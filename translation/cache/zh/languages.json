	"Many human ethnicities and nations in Faerûn have their own language, in addition to Common. Most human languages are written in Thorass, the alphabet of Old Common, derived from the Chondathan language that traders used as their common tongue. A few human languages use other alphabets, including Draconic, Dethek, and Espruar.": "法鲁恩的许多人类种族和国家除了通用语之外，还有自己的语言。大多数人类语言都是用索拉斯（Thorass）书写的，索拉斯是旧通用语的字母表，源自商人作为他们的通用语的崇丹语。少数人类语言使用其他字母，包括Draconic、Dethek和Espruar。",
	"If your Dungeon Master allows this option, then any human from an ethnic group that has its own language is assumed to know that language as well as Common. This ethnic language is treated as a free additional language for such individuals.": "如果你的地下城管理员允许这个选项，那么任何来自有自己语言的族群的人类都会被假定为知道该语言以及普通话。对于这些人来说，这种民族语言被视为一种免费的附加语言。",
	"Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.": "Draconic被认为是最古老的语言之一，并且经常被用于研究魔法。这种语言对大多数其他生物来说听起来很刺耳，包括许多硬辅音和咝音。",
	"Druidic is the secret language of druids. It can be spoken or used to leave hidden messages. Creatures who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check but can't decipher it without magic.": "德鲁伊语是德鲁伊人的秘密语言。它可以被说出来，也可以用来留下隐藏的信息。懂这种语言的生物会自动发现这种信息。其他人通过成功的DC15智慧（（%0%））检查发现信息的存在，但没有魔法就无法破译。",

	"Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.": "精灵语很流畅，有微妙的语调和复杂的语法。精灵文学丰富多样，他们的歌曲和诗歌在其他种族中很有名。许多吟游诗人学习他们的语言，以便在他们的曲目中加入精灵族的歌谣。",

Each cluster of characters represents a single word, and multiple tir'su connect to form phrases and sentences.": "吉斯人使用一种由字母符号组成的书面语言，这些符号排列在被称为tir'su的圆形群里。轮子上的每个 \"辐条 \"都对应着一个字母。每组字符代表一个单词，多个tir'su连接起来就形成了短语和句子。",
	"Githyanki and githzerai both speak Gith, but each race has a distinct dialect and accent. Similarly, the two races of gith differentiate their language by how they write it. Githyanki write a tir'su clockwise, starting at the top. Githzerai use the same letter symbols but write their tir'su counterclockwise, starting from the bottom.": "吉斯扬基和吉斯泽拉都讲吉斯语，但每个种族都有独特的方言和口音。同样地，两个种族的吉斯人也通过他们的书写方式来区分他们的语言。吉斯亚克人顺时针写一个提尔苏，从顶部开始。吉斯泽拉人使用相同的字母符号，但他们的tir'su是逆时针写的，从底部开始。",

	"The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature.

Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.": "半身人的语言并不是秘密，但半身人不愿意与他人分享。他们很少写作，所以他们没有丰富的文学作品。然而，他们的口述传统是非常强大的。几乎所有的半身人都会说普通话，与他们居住地或旅行地的人们交谈。",
	"Loross, a language spoken by the Netherese, is a dead tongue. Very few creatures in the world today would recognize it, much less speak it. Loross used the Draconic alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities with Elvish, due to the cultural influence the elves had on Netherese civilization. A character who speaks Elvish can understand what a creature speaking Loross is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the Cloistered Scholar or Sage background, or a warlock who knows the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation, can translate written Loross without an ability check.": "Loross，一种由Netherese说的语言，是一种死语言。今天的世界上很少有生物能认出它，更不用说讲它了。Loross在书面形式上使用Draconic字母，而口语则与精灵语有许多相似之处，这是由于精灵对尼瑟斯文明的文化影响。一个说精灵语的角色可以理解说Loross语的生物在说什么，反之亦然。一个拥有 \"隐修学者 \"或 \"贤者 \"背景的角色，或者一个知道 \"符文守护者之眼 \"召唤的术士，可以翻译书面的Loross，而不需要进行能力检查。",
	"The Menagerie Coast was settled by colonists from the arid land of Marquet, and their language now holds an unusual position in the Clovis Concord. It is the language of high society, as many Clovis elite are descended from Marquesians, but it is also the language of piracy, since countless lower-class Marquesians defected from the Concord and formed the Revelry pirates.": "梅纳吉海岸是由来自干旱的马尔凯岛的殖民者定居的，他们的语言现在在克洛维斯协约中占有不寻常的地位。它是上流社会的语言，因为许多克洛维斯的精英都是马尔凯特人的后裔，但它也是海盗的语言，因为无数下层的马尔凯特人从康科德叛逃出来，组成了瑞维里海盗团。",

Even sailors who only speak Common incorporate dozens of Naush words into their nautical jargon.": "纳什语最初是由Menagerie海岸的Ki'Nau岛民说的，在Clovis Concord的多元文化城市中是一种繁荣的语言。即使是只说普通话的水手，也将几十个纳什语纳入他们的航海术语中。",

	"The \"writing\" of mind flayers, known as Qualith, isn't as simple as a set of symbols representing sounds or ideas. An inscription in Qualith captures the thoughts of its creator and psionically transmits the thoughts to a mind flayer who later reads the inscription by touching it with its tentacles. Mind flayers write in Qualith by psionically imprinting their messages on nonmagical, nonliving material they grasp or caress with their tentacles. The imprinting causes imperceptible surface changes to the object, and abrasion or degradation of the material can cause the inscription to fade and fail.": "噬心者的 \"文字\"，被称为Qualith，并不像一组代表声音或想法的符号那么简单。在Qualith中的铭文能捕捉到创造者的思想，并通过灵能将这些思想传递给噬心者，噬心者随后通过触手触摸铭文来阅读。噬心者通过幻觉将他们的信息印在他们用触手抓取或抚摸的非魔法、非生命的材料上，从而在Qualith中书写。这种印记会使物体的表面发生难以察觉的变化，而材料的磨损或退化会导致铭文褪色和失效。",
	"An expression in Qualith is made up of four-line stanzas packed into interlocking blocks, creating complex patterns that are indecipherable by other creatures. Someone that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained within it. A non-illithid that wants to understand a Qualith inscription can make an Intelligence check (DC based on the complexity of the contained thoughts) to try to derive some of the inscription's meaning. Multiple successful attempts might uncover different aspects about the illithid author, its intended meaning, and its intended audience. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and, in extreme cases, madness. A {@spell comprehend languages} spell provides understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it.": "在Qualith中的表达是由四行诗句组成的，这些诗句被包装成相互交错的块状，形成复杂的图案，其他生物无法破译。然而，触摸到Qualith铭文的人可以获得对其中所包含的多层次思想的零星洞察力。非illithid想要理解Qualith铭文，可以进行智力测验（DC基于所含思想的复杂性），以尝试推导出铭文的一些含义。多次成功的尝试可能会发现关于illithid作者的不同方面，它的预期含义，以及它的预期受众。失败的尝试会导致头痛欲裂，在极端情况下会导致疯狂。一个{@spell comprehend languages}的法术提供了对铭文的理解，大致相当于一个思想骗子从铭文中得到的东西。",
	"Sylvan is widely spoken in the Selesnya Conclave, for it is rich in vocabulary to describe natural phenomena and spiritual forces.": "西尔凡语在塞勒斯尼亚协约国中被广泛使用，因为它有丰富的词汇来描述自然现象和精神力量。",
	"Thieves' cant is a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows messages to be hidden in seemingly normal conversation. Only a creature that knows thieves' cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.": "盗贼之语是一种方言、行话和代码的秘密混合体，它允许在看似正常的对话中隐藏信息。只有懂得盗贼之语的生物才能理解这种信息。传达这样的信息所需的时间是明说同样想法的四倍。",
	"The Vedalken language is renowned for its technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural world and the aether that pervades it.": "维达肯语以其技术论文和有关自然界和弥漫在其中的乙醚的知识目录而闻名。",
	"This ancient language was spoken by the people of Zemniaz in the Age of Arcanum. That ancient culture has long since crumbled, but its language and its people live on in the Dwendalian Empire. Many ancient scrolls were written in Zemnian, but it is a language now largely spoken by farmers, as Common is the default language of the empire.": "这种古老的语言是由阿卡诺姆时代的泽姆尼亚兹人说的。这种古老的文化早已瓦解，但它的语言和它的人民在德文达尔帝国继续生存。许多古代卷轴都是用泽姆尼亚语书写的，但现在这种语言主要是由农民使用，因为通用语是帝国的默认语言。"
