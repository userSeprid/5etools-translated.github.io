	"The Great Master of Greed exerts an influence, no matter how subtle, over every dwarven heart. Abbathor teaches that greed isn't only desirable, but necessary to keep the dwarves in a strong and safe position.": "贪婪的大法师对每个矮人的心都施加了影响，无论多么微妙。阿巴瑟教导说，贪婪不仅是可取的，而且是使矮人处于强大和安全地位的必要条件。",
	"Abbathor has no skill in crafting. Instead, he relies on his ability as a thief to take ownership of what he wants. Why work so hard to manufacture something when a much easier path to riches lies open?": "阿巴瑟尔没有手工制作的技能。相反，他依靠他作为小偷的能力来获得他想要的东西的所有权。既然有一条更容易的致富之路，为什么还要辛辛苦苦地去制造东西呢？",
	"Abbathor is the only advocate for change within the dwarven pantheon. He can inspire dwarves to seek shortcuts, normally frowned upon, but sometimes those methods turn out to be efficient techniques that improve a clan's capabilities.": "阿巴瑟是矮人万神殿内唯一倡导变革的人。他可以激励矮人寻求通常不被看好的捷径，但有时这些方法会变成提高氏族能力的有效技术。",
	"The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in Amaunator's dominion. His priests help establish bureaucracies and lawful order in communities. They often witness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify their validity.": "法治和太阳的光辉都在Amaunator的统治之下。他的祭司帮助建立官僚机构和社区的合法秩序。他们经常见证合同和签署的协议，在这些文件上盖上阿玛努纳特的太阳符号以表示其有效性。",
	"His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been reborn time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into the realm of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze will fall on the world once again. Amaunator is seen as a stern and unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in comportment, but his concern isn't for the balance of life - he cares that things proceed according to the celestial order, that promises are kept, and that the rule of law persists.": "他的牧师们教导说，阿玛努纳特已经死了，并且一次又一次地重生了。就像太阳一样，他可能会进入黑暗的领域，但不可避免的是，他明亮的目光会再次落在这个世界上。阿玛努纳特被看作是一个严厉和不宽容的神，在行为举止上与希尔瓦努斯并无二致，但他关心的不是生命的平衡--他关心的是事情是否按照天体的秩序进行，承诺是否得到遵守，以及法治是否持续存在。",
	"Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray for rain or sun, as do any others looking for a favorable change in the weather. But the most common form of propitiation to Amaunator is the practice of swearing oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws under the light of the sun. So ingrained in the common perception is the connection between a solemn oath and the sun that those engaged in closing deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or pronouncement.": "农民和旅行者在祈求雨水或太阳时都会向他祈求，就像任何其他寻求有利天气变化的人一样。但最常见的祭祀阿玛努特的形式是在太阳光下宣誓、签署合同和宣布法律的做法。庄严的誓言和太阳之间的联系在普通人的观念中是如此根深蒂固，以至于那些从事交易或发布法令的人经常暂停，等待过往的云彩将太阳照亮，然后完成交易或宣布。",

	"Before the Calamity, eight of the Betrayer Gods each forged a sentient weapon using the life force of a greater fiend and gave the weapon to a chosen champion in the kingdom of Ghor Dranas. The Calamity flung these weapons across Wildemount, burying them in mountains, forests, fields, and underground. Several of these weapons have been recovered, but a few have never been found and are highly sought-after. The weapons—or more properly, the fiends bound inside them—attract their own followings of mortal worshipers.": "在灾变之前，八位背叛者之神各自用一个大恶魔的生命力锻造了一件有生命的武器，并将武器交给了古尔-德拉纳斯王国中被选中的冠军。灾难将这些武器抛向整个荒野山庄，将它们埋藏在山林、田野和地下。这些武器中有几件已经被找回，但有几件从未被发现，而且非常抢手。这些武器--或者更确切地说，被捆绑在里面的恶魔--吸引着他们自己的凡人崇拜者。",
	"When an Arm of the Betrayers is found, it grants its wielder some of the power of the Betrayer Gods and the wisdom of the fiend within. The bound fiends know that their war was lost long ago, but they still desire to be used in battle, win victories, and spill blood in the hands of skilled warriors. As a weapon's wielder becomes more powerful, so too does the weapon, which in turn is able to lend even more magic to the wielder. Whenever a weapon's wielder dies, the weapon disappears and reappears elsewhere.": "当背叛者之臂被发现时，它就会赋予其持有者一些背叛者之神的力量和里面的恶魔的智慧。被束缚的魔族知道他们的战争早已失败，但他们仍然渴望在战斗中被使用，赢得胜利，并在熟练的战士手中洒下鲜血。当武器的持有者变得更加强大时，武器也会变得更加强大，而武器也能为持有者提供更多的魔法。每当武器持有者死亡时，武器就会消失并在其他地方重新出现。",

Every youth hears over and over again the stories of the hero's bravery and cunning, his clever tactics in battle, and his ability to use speed and smallness to defeat a much larger foe. The elders know that the world outside is dangerous and that their kin must understand how to deal with those dangers. Stories about Arvoreen are told in such a way that youngsters are inspired to act out his epic battles. In this way, the halflings get practical experience in executing measures that are designed to help the halflings defeat kobolds and goblin raiders, or even take down an ogre. When the time comes to put those tactics to use in earnest, everyone will be ready.": "有时，半身人必须为保护他们的朋友或他们的村庄而战斗。在那些时刻，阿尔弗莱恩的故事在每个半身人的记忆中浮现出来。每个年轻人都反复听到英雄的勇敢和狡猾的故事，他在战斗中的巧妙战术，以及他利用速度和渺小来击败更大敌人的能力。长老们知道，外面的世界很危险，他们的亲属必须了解如何应对这些危险。关于Arvoreen的故事是以这样的方式讲述的，年轻人被激励着去表演他的史诗般的战斗。通过这种方式，半身人获得了执行措施的实际经验，这些措施旨在帮助半身人击败哥布林和哥布林突袭者，甚至是打倒食人魔。当认真运用这些战术的时候，每个人都会做好准备。",
	"Cooperation is a fundamental principle in how halflings fend off their enemies. Every community practices its own version of Arvoreen's favored tactics:": "合作是半身人抵御敌人的一个基本原则。每个社区都有自己版本的Arvoreen所青睐的战术。",
	"The halflings run in every direction as if in a panic, but then they regroup and circle back to attack with a concentrated effort.": "半身人向各个方向跑去，好像很慌乱，但随后他们又重新组织起来，绕回来集中力量进攻。",

	"Halflings rush an intruder in waves, swatting the enemy with sticks on all sides.": "半身人一浪高过一浪地冲向入侵者，用棍子拍打四面的敌人。",
	"A halfling fiddler lures the monster into a trap, usually a net or a pit, followed by several burly halflings wielding large sticks and hitting the monster from a safe vantage.": "一个半身人提琴手把怪物引到一个陷阱里，通常是一个网或一个坑，然后由几个魁梧的半身人挥舞着大棒，从一个安全的位置打怪物。",
	"The devil god of the Hells is the master of tyranny and domination. His words are honeyed and carefully crafted, soothing and corrupting the mortal heart. Asmodeus rules his domain with an iron fist, and the punishments awaiting those that cross him are the basis of nightmares. Evil entities pay him tribute alongside his devils, and many warlocks are drawn to his power.": "地狱的魔神是暴政和统治的主宰。他的话语充满蜜意，精心制作，抚慰和腐蚀着凡人的心灵。阿斯莫德用铁拳统治他的领域，等待那些与他作对的人的惩罚是噩梦的基础。邪恶的实体与他的魔鬼一起向他致敬，许多术士被他的力量所吸引。",
	"Asmodeus lords over his fiendish hordes from within his fortress of Nalsheem, nestled in the depths of Nessus, the ninth and deepest of the Nine Hells.": "阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）在他的堡垒纳尔希姆（Nalsheem）中统治着他的恶魔群，该堡垒坐落在九层地狱中第九层最深的内瑟斯（Nessus）深处。",
	"A twisted image of the celestial blood that once bore him, the Lord of the Nine Hells is revealed in many tomes and murals as a handsome humanoid with deep, red skin and long, black hair. Two curling horns rise from his brow, and his lips bear an eternal, knowing grin.": "九层地狱之主是曾经孕育他的天体血脉的扭曲形象，在许多书籍和壁画中，他是一个英俊的人形，有着深红的皮肤和黑色的长发。两只卷曲的角从他的眉心升起，他的嘴唇上有一个永恒的、知情的微笑。",
	"Asmodeus's enemies are numerous, even among the Betrayer Gods, many of whom only follow the archdevil for fear of his immense power. His archnemesis is Avandra, the Change Bringer, whose mischief and cunning has vexed him throughout the eons. It was she who defeated him in the Calamity by tricking his fiendish armies into attacking one another. The Devil Lord's greatest triumph during the Calamity was fooling and betraying the Everlight and slaughtering all her followers in one fell stroke—an act that has united the followers of Raei and Avandra in a bond of unbreakable fellowship ever since.": "阿斯莫德的敌人数不胜数，甚至在背叛者诸神中也是如此，他们中的许多人只是因为害怕他巨大的力量而追随大恶魔。他的克星是阿凡达，变化的使者，她的恶作剧和狡猾在过去的岁月里一直困扰着他。在灾难中，正是她通过诱使他的恶魔般的军队相互攻击而击败了他。魔王在灾变期间最大的胜利是愚弄和背叛了永生之光，并一举屠杀了她所有的追随者--这一行为使雷伊和阿凡达的追随者们自此团结在一起，结成了牢不可破的友谊。",
	"Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of the Asmodeus.": "对他人宣示支配地位和权力。以阿斯莫德的形象展示你的意志力。",

	"As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. Compassion is for the weak.": "当你上升到权力时，不要怜悯或怜悯那些你为了达到目的而翻越的人。怜悯是针对弱者的。",
	"Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century ago when small cults with charismatic leaders sprang up in the aftermath of the Spellplague. That catastrophe left many asking why the gods were angry or had abandoned them. To those questioners, the faithful of Asmodeus provided answers and a god who would forgive all their faults. Still, for the next few decades, the Cult of Asmodeus struggled for acceptance.": "对阿斯莫德的公开崇拜大约始于一个世纪前，当时在法术瘟疫之后，有魅力的领导人的小邪教兴起。那场灾难让许多人问为什么神灵生气或抛弃了他们。对于这些提问者，阿斯莫德的信徒们提供了答案，以及一个会原谅他们所有错误的神。然而，在接下来的几十年里，阿斯莫德教派仍在努力争取被接受。",
	"In the beliefs of the people of the North - which coincide with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and others - Asmodeus is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of all devils of the Nine Hells. People know devils to be iron-minded and silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, whose price for their boons can be as dear as one's soul. It's said that when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane for a deity to take it to its appropriate afterlife, devils approach the soul and offer it a chance at power and immortal pleasures. All a soul needs to do is take one step out of the dust and the milling crowd and put a foot on the first rung of the infernal ladder that represents the hierarchy of the Nine Hells.": "在北方人的信仰中--这与矮人、精灵和其他人讲述的许多故事相吻合--阿斯摩德是第九区的领主，是九层地狱所有魔鬼的领袖。人们知道魔鬼是铁石心肠和银牙利齿的诱惑传播者，他们的好处的价格可以和人的灵魂一样珍贵。据说，当一个灵魂在赋格平面上等待神灵把它带到适当的来世时，魔鬼就会接近这个灵魂，给它一个获得权力和不朽快乐的机会。灵魂所需要做的就是走出尘埃和熙熙攘攘的人群，踏上代表九层地狱等级制度的地狱阶梯的第一层。",
	"The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils offer their worshipers a path that's not for everyone - just as eternally basking in the light of Lathander or endlessly swinging a hammer in the mines of Moradin might not be for everyone. Those who serve Asmodeus in life hope to be summoned out of the moaning masses of the Fugue Plane after death. They yearn for the chance to master their own fates, with all of eternity to achieve their goals.": "阿斯莫德的信徒们承认，魔鬼为他们的崇拜者提供了一条并非适合所有人的道路--就像永远沐浴在拉坦德的光芒中或在莫拉丁的矿井中无休止地挥舞锤子可能不适合所有人一样。那些生前为阿斯莫德服务的人希望死后能从赋格平面的呻吟人群中被召唤出来。他们渴望有机会掌握自己的命运，用所有的永恒来实现他们的目标。",
	"To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer the prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait on the Fugue Plane for a deity's pleasure, which determines where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those who lived their lives most in keeping with a deity's outlook are taken first. Others, who have transgressed in the eyes of their favored god or have not followed any particular ethos, might wait centuries before Kelemvor judges where they go. People who fear such a fate can pray to Asmodeus, his priests say, and in return a devil will grant a waiting soul some comfort.": "对于那些不那么虔诚的人，阿斯莫德的祭司们提供了在来世得到缓和的前景。所有的灵魂都在赋格平面上等待神灵的喜悦，这决定了一个灵魂将在哪里度过余下的永恒岁月。那些生活中最符合神灵观点的人首先被带走。其他人，如果在他们所喜爱的神的眼中犯了错，或者没有遵循任何特定的道德规范，可能会在凯勒莫尔判断他们的去向之前等待几个世纪。害怕这种命运的人可以向阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）祈祷，他的牧师说，作为回报，一个魔鬼会给等待的灵魂一些安慰。",
	"Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples are almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the habit of asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. After transgressing against a god in some way, a person prays to Asmodeus for something to provide respite during the long wait. Asmodeus is known to grant people what they wish, and thus people pray for all the delights and distractions they desire most from life. Those who transgress in great ways often ask Asmodeus to hide their sins from the gods, and priests say that he will do so, but with a price after death.": "今天，阿斯莫德的神龛仍很罕见，寺庙也几乎闻所未闻，但许多人都养成了向阿斯莫德请求赦免罪过的习惯。在以某种方式触犯了某位神灵后，人们会向阿斯莫德祈祷，希望在漫长的等待中得到喘息的机会。众所周知，阿斯莫德会满足人们的愿望，因此，人们祈求从生活中获得他们最渴望的所有乐趣和分心。那些犯了大错的人经常要求阿斯莫德向诸神隐瞒他们的罪过，祭司们说他会这样做，但死后要付出代价。",
	"All mortals are destined to face Athreos, the River Guide, when their lives come to an end. The god of passage ferries the dead across the Tartyx River, conveying each mortal soul to its destiny in the Underworld. For most people, Athreos embodies the greatest mysteries of existence—the terror and wonder of life's last moment and the revelation of one's ultimate fate in the afterlife. Athreos is no judge, though. The veiled, silent god undergoes no deliberations and makes no exceptions. The River Guide reads the truth of each soul and bears it unfailingly to its proper place in the Underworld. There is no haggling and no sympathy on Athreos's skiff, the god having heard and denied every conceivable mortal plea.": "所有的凡人都注定要在他们的生命即将结束时面对河流向导阿瑟雷斯。这位通行之神带领死者渡过塔提克斯河，将每个凡人的灵魂送入冥界的命运。对大多数人来说，阿斯琉斯体现了存在的最大奥秘--生命最后一刻的恐怖和奇迹，以及一个人在来世的最终命运的揭示。不过，阿斯雷欧斯不是法官。这位戴着面纱、沉默寡言的神没有经过任何审议，也没有例外。河流向导读懂了每个灵魂的真相，并将其不折不扣地带到其在冥界的适当位置。在Athreos的船上没有讨价还价，也没有同情心，神已经听到并拒绝了所有可以想象的凡人的请求。",
	"Athreos appears as a gaunt figure cloaked in ragged robes and a collection of golden masks. What little can be seen of his body is unsettling, its gray flesh stretched thin over a barely human skeleton. The River Guide is never without his ancient staff, Katabasis, which he transforms into the ferryboat he uses to ply the Rivers That Ring the World. Though the deity's shrouded form gives no clue, many mortals consider Athreos to be male, but the River Guide cares for terms or labels no more than any other force of nature. Athreos can change shape but rarely, if ever, takes on other forms.": "阿斯瑞斯出现时是一个憔悴的身影，披着破旧的长袍，戴着一系列金色的面具。他的身体让人感到不安，灰色的肉体在勉强算是人类的骨架上被拉得很薄。河流向导从未离开过他古老的法杖，Katabasis，他把它变成渡船，用来在环游世界的河流上航行。虽然神灵被遮蔽的外形没有提供任何线索，但许多凡人认为阿瑟雷斯是男性，但河流向导并不像其他自然力量那样关心术语或标签。Athreos可以改变形状，但很少，如果有的话，会变成其他形式。",
	"Most mortals focus on the River Guide's role in their own deaths. Countless mortal superstitions prescribe ways to garner Athreos's favor, but all Athreos demands of those he transports is payment: a single coin of any minting or value. The River Guide has an expansive definition of what constitutes a coin, from actual stamped currency and jewelry to shiny beads or opalescent shells. Ultimately, he seems most concerned with whether a mortal has prepared for death, keeping payment ready out of respect and as a personal memento mori. Those whose bodies are burned, buried, or otherwise disposed of along with valuables deliberately intended for the River Guide discover that they can make use of such items when trading for Athreos's services. Spirits that reach the shores of the Tartyx River unprepared, though, risk being stranded, as Athreos refuses to ferry those who can't pay.": "大多数凡人都专注于河流向导在他们自己的死亡中的作用。无数的凡人迷信规定了如何获得阿瑟雷斯的青睐，但阿瑟雷斯对他所运送的人所要求的只是报酬：任何铸币或价值的单一硬币。河流指南》对什么是硬币有一个广泛的定义，从实际盖章的货币和珠宝到闪亮的珠子或乳白色的贝壳。归根结底，他似乎最关心的是一个凡人是否为死亡做好了准备，出于尊重和作为个人的纪念品而准备好付款。那些尸体被焚烧、埋葬或以其他方式处理的人，以及故意为河流向导准备的贵重物品，发现他们可以利用这些物品来换取阿瑟罗斯的服务。不过，在毫无准备的情况下到达塔提克斯河岸的灵魂有可能被搁浅，因为阿斯雷欧斯拒绝为那些无法付款的人提供渡船。",
	"Athreos is also invoked as the god of passage, as well as the deity with dominion over borders, boundaries, and that which is \"neither.\" Those who undertake journeys, especially dangerous ones, often drop a coin into a fountain or a body of water in apotropaic acknowledgment of the River Guide. Bridges and borders are also places where Athreos is commonly remembered, with many such sites being marked by motifs of rivers or spirits. Additionally, phenomena that are neither one thing nor another, defying simple classification, are often considered to be within Athreos's province—most notably the state between life and death, but also echoes, phantom sensations, and the feeling of déjà vu.": "Athreos也被当作通行之神，同时也是掌管边境、边界和 \"非 \"的神明。那些进行旅行的人，尤其是危险的旅行，经常向喷泉或水体投掷硬币，以表示对河流向导的认可。桥梁和边界也是人们通常记住的地方，许多这样的地方都有河流或神灵的图案。此外，那些既不是一种东西也不是另一种东西，无法简单分类的现象通常被认为属于阿瑟雷斯的管辖范围--最明显的是生与死之间的状态，还有回声、幻觉和似曾相识的感觉。",
	"Athreos endlessly works to maintain the balance between Nyx, the Underworld, and the lands of the living. The River Guide sees himself as a servant of the mortal world and knows nothing of the glamor, honor, or mystery mortals often ascribe such to him. Rather, he does what must be done, and should some cosmological condition fall out of sorts, the River Guide and his servants work with silent efficiency to restore balance.": "Athreos无休止地工作，以维持Nyx、冥界和活人的土地之间的平衡。导河者认为自己是凡人世界的仆人，对凡人经常赋予他的魅力、荣誉或神秘感一无所知。相反，他做的是必须要做的事，如果某些宇宙条件不正常，导河者和他的仆人会以沉默的效率来恢复平衡。",
	"Athreos cares little for the dealings of the other gods. As long as other deities don't impinge on the border between life and death, either by overstepping their bounds or by trying to draw the dead back into life, the River Guide has little to do with them. More than once, this isolation has put Athreos in silent conflict with Heliod and Erebos, both of whom subtly resent Athreos for limiting how much each can meddle in the other's realm. At the same time, the River Guide's role as a buffer between the two vindictive gods actively prevents their grudges from exploding into divine warfare.": "Athreos对其他神灵的交易并不关心。只要其他神灵不侵犯生与死的边界，无论是超越他们的界限，还是试图将死人拉回生活，导河者就与他们没什么关系。不止一次，这种孤立使阿斯琉斯与赫利奥德和埃雷波斯发生了无声的冲突，他们都对阿斯琉斯限制各自对对方领域的干预程度而感到微妙的不满。同时，导河者作为两个报复性神灵之间的缓冲者，积极防止他们的怨恨爆发成神战。",
	"Thassa bears a chilly respect for Athreos. In a time before reckoning, boundaries divided the god of the sea's dominion from the Tartyx River. Though the god of the sea quietly resents sharing even a drop of water, she considers the River Guide to be a quiet, unobtrusive trespasser on her favored element and keeps her distance. Were her respect to wane, though, Thassa would eagerly vie to control the Rivers That Ring the World.": "Thassa对Athreos怀有一种冷酷的敬意。在清算前的时代，边界将海神的统治权与塔提克斯河分割开来。尽管海神对分享哪怕是一滴水都会悄悄地反感，但她认为河流引导者是一个安静的、不引人注意的对她喜爱的元素的侵入者，并保持着距离。不过，如果她的敬意减弱，塔萨会急切地争夺对环游世界的河流的控制权。",
	"Most funeral traditions include small offerings and words of reverence to Athreos. Predominant among these traditions is burying or burning the dead with a clay funerary mask, to \"frame\" the identity of the dead for Athreos, and with at least one coin, so a soul might pay Athreos to ferry them to the Underworld. Some people are laid to rest with large amounts of grave goods. Memorial practices vary widely by culture, from tearful, somber affairs to lively celebrations. These rituals serve more as catharsis for the living than as meaningful boons to Athreos, though. The River Guide cares only for the single coin he's owed by any who board his skiff.": "大多数葬礼传统都包括对阿斯雷欧斯的小型供品和敬语。这些传统中最主要的是埋葬或焚烧死者时带着一个泥制的葬礼面具，以 \"框住 \"死者的身份，并至少带着一枚硬币，这样灵魂就可以付钱给阿瑟雷斯，让他把他们渡到冥界。有些人在安息时带着大量的墓地物品。纪念活动因文化而异，从催人泪下的沉痛事件到热闹的庆祝活动。不过，这些仪式更多的是作为生者的宣泄，而不是作为对阿瑟雷斯有意义的恩赐。河流向导只关心那些登上他的小船的人欠他的那枚硬币。",
	"During the feast of the Necrologion, which gives its name to the eighth month in the calendar of Meletis, pious souls silently spend the day reading ancient memoirs or writing messages for their own descendants.": "在Necrologion节期间，它的名字是Meletis日历中的第八个月，虔诚的灵魂默默地花一天时间阅读古代回忆录或为他们自己的后代写信息。",
	"Athreos eternally performs a remarkable labor, ferrying mortal souls to the Underworld. During the River Guide's ages of toil, he has inspired a number of legends.": "Athreos永恒地执行着一项非凡的劳动，将凡人的灵魂运送到冥界。在导河者的劳作岁月中，他激发了许多传奇故事。",
	"Some claim that Athreos doesn't collect coins out of greed but because he's looking for five specific treasures. Apocryphal writings in the Underworld library of Oneirrakthys say that Athreos was the first mortal to die. When he came to face the gods, he brought a single treasure as an offering to each of Theros's five mightiest deities, hoping to receive a peaceful place among them in return.": "有些人声称，阿特里奥斯收集硬币并不是出于贪婪，而是因为他在寻找五个特定的宝藏。Oneirrakthys的冥界图书馆中的启示录说，Athreos是第一个死去的凡人。当他面对众神时，他带着一件宝物作为祭品献给特洛斯的五个最强大的神灵，希望能在他们中间得到一个和平的位置作为回报。",
	"The gods realized what Athreos's spirit represented: the first of an endless flood of mortal souls that would soon begin to join Athreos in death. Unwilling to spend eternity sorting the endless stream of dead mortals themselves, the other gods did give Athreos a place among them, as well as charging him with his impossible task. They also offered him a measure of hope. The gods cast Athreos's offerings back into the mortal world in the form of five coins. They promised Athreos that, once he collected the coins anew, the gods would free the River Guide from his service and welcome him into their ranks. Ever since, Athreos has labored, both at ferrying the dead and in search of his five lost coins, called the Athrean Obols. It's said that any who bring the River Guide one of the coins will be rewarded with a wish for anything Athreos can grant—even exception from death.": "诸神意识到阿斯琉斯的灵魂代表着什么：无尽的凡人灵魂洪流中的第一个，它们很快就会开始与阿斯琉斯一起死亡。由于不愿意自己花时间去分拣无穷无尽的死亡凡人，其他诸神确实在他们中间给了阿斯雷欧斯一个位置，并让他承担他不可能完成的任务。他们还为他提供了一定的希望。众神将阿斯雷欧斯的供品以五枚硬币的形式投回了凡人世界。他们向阿斯雷欧斯承诺，一旦他重新收集这些硬币，众神就会把河流向导从他的服务中解放出来，并欢迎他加入他们的行列。从那时起，阿斯雷欧斯就开始努力工作，既为死者摆渡，又寻找他丢失的五枚硬币，称为阿斯雷欧波尔斯。据说，任何给河流向导带来一枚硬币的人都会得到回报，希望得到阿斯雷欧斯能给予的任何东西--甚至免于死亡。",
	"Some legends tell of an ancient shade who has tarried at the banks of the Tartyx longer than any other—a woman, ancient beyond years and clad only in her own flowing hair and sagging skin, who some passing souls mistake for Athreos. This figure is Solyssia, once an oracle of Meletis. Solyssia refuses to pay Athreos's price, or to have it paid for her. For untold centuries, she has harassed the newly dead, learning an incredible amount about the mortal world in the process. The only thing she's less impressed with than the state of the modern world is Athreos, whom she curses like a bitter old friend whenever the River Guide draws near. If any mortal has ever truly known Athreos, it is her.": "一些传说中，有一个古老的阴影在塔提克斯河畔停留的时间比其他任何地方都长--一个古老的女人，超越了年龄，只穿着她自己的飘逸的头发和下垂的皮肤，一些路过的灵魂将她误认为是阿斯雷欧。这个人就是索里西亚，曾经是梅里提斯的神谕。索丽夏拒绝支付阿斯雷欧斯的价格，也拒绝让他为她支付。无数个世纪以来，她一直在骚扰新死的人，在这个过程中学习了大量关于凡人世界的知识。唯一比现代世界的状况更让她印象深刻的是阿斯琉斯，每当引导河靠近时，她就像一个痛苦的老朋友一样诅咒他。如果有哪个凡人真正了解过阿斯瑞斯，那就是她。",
	"Eight times in the course of history, Athreos has purposely allowed a mortal to delay their death or temporarily return from the Underworld. These individuals were restored as living beings (not as Returned) to complete particular tasks. As a record of these exceptions, Athreos bears a Returned-like mask of each individual. Despite centuries between bargains, though, no one who Athreos has made an exception for has ever returned. As a result, the River Guide refuses to make another exception. He might be convinced to do otherwise were someone to bring one of the eight lost souls—such as Biaas the Poison Drinker, Dianyan Half-Heart, or Hundred-Damned Thasmudyan—before him for punishment.": "在历史的进程中，阿瑟雷斯曾八次故意让一个凡人推迟死亡或暂时从冥界返回。这些人被恢复成活人（而不是回归者）来完成特定的任务。作为这些例外的记录，Athreos带着每个人的类似回归者的面具。尽管有几个世纪的交易，但阿斯琉斯为之破例的人都没有回来过。因此，河流向导拒绝再做例外。如果有人把八个迷失的灵魂中的一个带到他面前接受惩罚，他可能会被说服，比如饮毒者比亚斯（Biaas the Poison Drinker）、半心莲（Dianyan Half-Heart）或百鬼夜行（Hundred-Damned Thasmudyan）。",

In Luskan, visitors gather at the temple to watch the frequent \"wet parades,\" a ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice. They then journey between six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, which are dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the goddess. Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and then \"kiss the lady,\" touching lips to a rusty iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The parade runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the participants. Those who finish the race are thought to have helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to pay for food or ale all winter long.": "卢斯坎有一座供奉奥里尔的神庙，即白描的冬宫。该结构是一个由白色石头雕刻的柱子和拱门组成的无屋顶阵列。在外人看来，奥里尔的崇拜仪式往往是残酷的。在卢斯坎，游客们聚集在寺庙，观看频繁的 \"湿身游行\"，在这种仪式中，祈求者穿上装满冰块的衣服。然后他们在被称为 \"奥里尔之吻 \"的六根白色柱子之间穿梭，这些柱子分散在整个城市。崇拜者从一个柱子到另一个柱子，向女神诵读祈祷文。到达一个柱子后，祈求者必须爬上柱子，然后 \"亲吻女士\"，将嘴唇接触到柱子顶端的一块生锈的铁板。在冬天，这些活动类似于疯狂的赛跑，同时还有冻伤和从湿滑的柱子上摔下来受伤的风险。游行者受到附近酒馆的顾客的欢呼，他们在参与者的耐力上下注。那些完成比赛的人被认为是帮助了这个冬天，他们在整个冬天很少需要支付食物或酒水。",

	"Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to the specific practices of wizards. For instance, while Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, and wonder of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard's long hours of study, exacting standards of movement and speech, and cramped, ink-stained fingers. Wizards invoke Azuth when they scribe scrolls, inscribe magic circles, attempt to memorize spells, and even when they cast spells. Often this acknowledgment comes in the form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol, pointing the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For many wizards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives that it becomes an unconscious habit.": "米斯特拉是魔法女神；奥格玛是知识之神；迪内尔是写作和语言之神。阿苏斯从这些一般领域中抽取一些方面，并将其应用于巫师的具体实践。例如，Mystra是代表魔法的灵魂、艺术和奇迹的神，而Azuth则是巫师长时间学习、严格的动作和语言标准以及抽筋、沾满墨水的手指的神。巫师们在书写卷轴、刻画魔法阵、尝试记忆法术，甚至在施展法术时都会召唤阿苏特。这种承认往往是以默默地形成阿祖思的神圣符号的形式出现，将左手的食指指向天空。对许多巫师来说，这个手势在他们的生活中是如此常见，以至于成为一种无意识的习惯。",
	"Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of the deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated Halruaa, only a handful of holy places are dedicated to Azuth. Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him stands in a corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. More often, a wizard has a personal shrine at home. Azuth is represented at such sites as a hooded and bearded figure with left hand held high, finger pointed up. Sometimes he is represented by merely the hand. In either case, the finger often serves as a candleholder or as the point of origin for a light spell.": "献给阿苏特的寺庙很少，神职人员也极为罕见。即使在魔法盛行的哈尔鲁阿，也只有少数几个圣地供奉着阿苏特。有时，在供奉Mystra或其他神灵的寺庙的一个角落里，会有一个供奉他的雕像或神龛。更常见的是，巫师在家里有一个个人神龛。在这些地方，阿苏斯被表现为一个戴着头巾、留着胡子的形象，左手高举，手指向上。有时他只用手来代表。在这两种情况下，手指经常作为烛台或作为光明咒语的起源点。",
	"Baervan Wildwanderer is the god of the forests and of those who travel, a peaceful soul whose explorations often turn into exciting adventures. Baervan's constant companion is Chiktikka Fastpaws, a mischievous giant raccoon who often gets the duo into trouble. Although Baervan isn't as much of a prankster as some of the other gods, she is often held responsible when Chiktikka does something outrageous, such as stealing Gruumsh's breakfast or peeing on Rillifane Rallathil's shoes.": "Baervan Wildwanderer是森林之神，也是旅行者之神，他是一个和平的灵魂，他的探索常常变成令人兴奋的冒险。巴尔凡的常伴是奇克提卡-快爪，一只调皮的大浣熊，经常给两人带来麻烦。虽然巴万并不像其他一些神那样喜欢恶作剧，但当奇克提卡做出一些过分的事情时，她常常要负责任，比如偷吃格鲁姆什的早餐或在里利法恩-拉拉蒂尔的鞋子上撒尿。",
	"Baervan can sing every bird's song, knows every type of plant that has ever grown, never gets lost, and can befriend anyone under the sun (as long as Chiktikka chooses to act pleasant rather than annoying). Forest gnomes believe that they can speak to the animals of the woods and on the wing because Baervan teaches their souls how to do so before they are born.": "巴尔凡能唱每一种鸟的歌，知道曾经生长过的每一种植物，从不迷路，并能与阳光下的任何人交朋友（只要奇克提卡选择表现得愉快而不是恼人）。森林地精相信，他们能与森林中的动物和翅膀上的动物交谈，因为贝文在他们出生前就教会了他们的灵魂如何这样做。",

In a flash, Bahgtru was wrapped in the creature's coils and gripped by its legs. No one had ever escaped the grasp of the behir, but Bahgtru saw this as the ultimate test of his strength, and laughed at his good fortune. One by one, Bahgtru broke the behir's legs, and freed himself from its clutches. The creature's shrieks became the lightning of the storm, and its broken femur became the symbol of Bahgtru's followers, reminding them that anything can be broken and defeated by superior strength.": "在神话中，据说Bahgtru在外出打猎时被最强大的behirs所惊吓，它有数百条腿。在一瞬间，Bahgtru被这个生物的线圈包裹着，被它的腿抓着。从来没有人能够逃脱behir的控制，但Bahgtru认为这是对他力量的最终考验，并为他的好运而欢笑。Bahgtru一个接一个地打断了beheir的腿，把自己从它的魔掌中解放出来。怪物的尖叫声成了风暴的闪电，它的断腿成了Bahgtru追随者的象征，提醒他们任何东西都可以被打碎，被卓越的力量打败。",
	"Most young orcs that an explorer or an adventurer might encounters are followers of Bahgtru. Orcs of Bahgtru continually try to prove their superior strength and endurance through cruel contests against their tribe mates, acts of unprovoked belligerence, and great success in battle.

No orc will eat or harm one of these sacred beasts, which are believed to be imbued with Bahgtru's spirit.": "巴格鲁的兽人有时会骑着（%0%）进入战场，这些大型生物类似于牛或牲畜，但更加凶猛。他们这样做既是对这些生物的尊重，也是对他们的神灵的尊重，因为传说中巴格鲁也曾骑着一头大牛上战场。没有兽人会吃或伤害这些神圣的野兽，他们认为这些野兽被注入了巴格鲁的精神。",

When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise.": "班恩有一个简单的道德观：强者不仅有权利而且有义务统治弱者。能够夺取权力的暴君必须这样做，因为不仅暴君受益，在暴君统治下的人也会受益。当一个统治者屈服于颓废、腐败或堕落时，一个更强大、更合适的统治者将崛起。",
	"Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, those who favor him have committed dark deeds in his name, but most people don't worship Bane out of malice.

But in just as many other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist.": "在Faerûn的许多时候和许多地方，Bane的信徒被视为救世主，因为他们努力屠杀突袭者，推翻腐败的统治者，或拯救濒临失败的军队。但在其他许多地方，对贝恩的崇拜也创造或支持了残酷的独裁统治，帮助了商业垄断，或者在以前不存在的地方带来了奴隶制的做法。",
	"When gnomes arrived in the world, Baravar protected them by teaching them how to hide, use magic, and deceive their foes. She was once entrapped by the goblin god Khurgorbaeyag, and after escaping and gaining her revenge, she began the practice of never wearing the same face twice, and she follows a different routine every day so no one can predict what she might do. When gnomes tell stories of their gods' adventures, Baravar is always the last to be found when the group forms, but she nevertheless swiftly agrees to support Garl's plans.": "当地精来到这个世界时，巴拉瓦尔通过教他们如何隐藏、使用魔法和欺骗敌人来保护他们。她曾经被地精之神Khurgorbaeyag困住，在逃脱并获得复仇后，她开始练习永远不要两次戴着同一张脸，她每天都遵循不同的程序，所以没有人可以预测她可能做什么。当地精们讲述他们的神的冒险故事时，巴拉瓦尔总是最后一个被发现，当这群人组成时，但她还是迅速地同意支持加尔的计划。",
	"Forest gnomes and deep gnomes owe their innate magical abilities to Baravar, and all gnomes get their natural defense against magic from her shrewdness.": "森林地精和深层地精都归功于巴拉瓦的先天魔法能力，所有地精都从她的精明中获得了对魔法的天然防御。",
	"The Matron of Home and Hearth is the patron of family, honor, and law. She lays out the rules for managing a dwarf clan.": "家庭和炉灶的女主人是家庭、荣誉和法律的守护者。她制定了管理矮人部族的规则。",
	"Berronar's code establishes the laws of the dwarves, including contracts, trade agreements, and every other kind of bond forged through words and deeds. As Moradin provides the example that dwarves strive to match, Berronar provides the bonds that create dwarven society and culture.": "贝罗纳的法典规定了矮人的法律，包括合同、贸易协议和其他各种通过言行形成的纽带。正如莫拉丁提供了矮人努力效仿的榜样，贝罗纳提供了创造矮人社会和文化的纽带。",
	"Berronar's priests arrange marriages, using a process that finds the best matches and is designed to ensure that each generation of a clan is stronger and more talented than the last. Their dictates in this respect are sacrosanct, and a dwarf designated for an arranged marriage must obey the priests or risk exile.": "Berronar的祭司们安排婚姻，使用一种程序来寻找最佳匹配，旨在确保一个部族的每一代都比上一代更强大、更有才华。他们在这方面的指令是神圣不可侵犯的，被指定为包办婚姻的矮人必须服从祭司的安排，否则就有可能被流放。",
	"Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more benevolent \"sister.\" She is seen as a cruel and capricious goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her attention and interest in a negative way.": "贝沙巴是泰莫拉的对立面，在日常生活中与她更仁慈的 \"妹妹 \"一样经常被承认。她被看作是一个残酷而任性的女神，必须对她进行祭祀，以避免以消极的方式吸引她的注意和兴趣。",
	"Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by bad luck - which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or breaking a wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping and accidentally falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to ward off her attentions when someone is doing something in which good luck wouldn't play a part but bad luck might. For example, someone rolling dice would invoke Tymora because they want random chance to fall in their favor, but someone about to cross a rickety bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge intact.": "Beshaba的名字在某人被厄运困扰时被引用--厄运可能是小事，如戳到脚趾或弄坏马车车轮，也可能是灾难性的，如滑倒并意外地掉下悬崖。当有人在做一件好运不会影响到他，但坏运气可能会影响到他的事情时，也会引用它来抵御她的关注。例如，有人在掷骰子时会召唤泰莫拉，因为他们希望随机的机会对他们有利，但有人要过一座摇摇欲坠的桥时会请求贝沙巴保持桥的完整。",
	"Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their thumbs and extending their fingers on one or both hands (mimicking the horns of her holy symbol) to ward off misfortune. The same gesture raised to the head signifies a salute; when pointed at someone, the \"horns\" indicate ill favor directed toward that individual.": "民间用大拇指折叠，伸出一只手或两只手的手指（模仿她的神圣标志的角）来做贝沙巴的象征，以抵御不幸。同样的手势举到头上表示敬礼；当指向某人时，\"角 \"表示对该人的不友好。",
	"Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First Circle. They propitiate her with dances while wearing fire-blackened antlers dipped in blood. According to these druids, her holy symbol is the horns of a stag because when Beshaba was first worshiped, humans were simple hunter-gatherers and she was believed to bring misfortune to hunters, such as being gored by a stag.": "许多德鲁伊将贝沙巴作为第一圈的一员加以崇拜。他们戴着蘸了血的火黑鹿角，用舞蹈来祭祀她。根据这些德鲁伊的说法，她的神圣象征是雄鹿的角，因为在贝沙巴最初被崇拜时，人类是简单的狩猎采集者，她被认为会给猎人带来不幸，比如被雄鹿咬伤。",
	"Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect of Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), Beshaba is almost always invoked and welcomed formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions such as marriages and coronations, contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she isn't invited to such an event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on those involved.": "尽管大多数人对Beshaba出席任何活动（即使是精神上的）的前景感到恐惧，但Beshaba几乎总是在正式活动的开幕词或仪式上被援引并受到正式欢迎，如婚姻和加冕仪式、体育或武术比赛，以及儿童的命名仪式。如果她没有被邀请参加这样的活动，她可能会生气，并对有关人员造成不幸。",
	"Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on it at the site of some roadside accident or murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by and murders and accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These \"shrines,\" in either form, serve as warnings to others about places of ill fortune.": "祭祀贝沙巴的庙宇几乎不存在。然而，农村人在路边发生事故或谋杀的地方竖起一根柱子，并在上面挂上鹿角，这很常见。在城市里，鹿角很难买到，谋杀和事故也更多，时尚的做法是在附近的墙上用木炭画出贝沙巴的黑色鹿角，让这个符号一直展示着，直到天气把它刮走。这些 \"神龛\"，无论是哪种形式，都是对他人的警告，提醒他们注意不吉利的地方。",
	"More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where folk frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites tend to be posts or stones painted red with blackened antlers attached to them, or a red, triangular wallmounted plaque with attached antlers. Both types have a stone or bronze bowl where coins can be tossed or burnt offerings made. The Red Wizards of Thay commonly erect such shrines outside their ritual chambers to guard against unfortunate mistakes.": "在民间经常希望抵御不幸的地方，有更正式的贝沙巴神龛。这些地方往往是涂成红色的柱子或石头，上面挂着发黑的鹿角，或者是一个红色的、挂在墙上的三角形牌子，上面挂着鹿角。这两种类型都有一个石碗或铜碗，可以投掷硬币或进行焚烧供奉。泰伊的红袍巫师们通常在他们的仪式室外竖起这样的神龛，以防止不幸的错误。",
	"Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare clerics of the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been deeply affected by great misfortunes and who seek to warn others of the essential unfairness of life - or to inflict that unfairness upon them.": "很少有人敢把贝沙巴作为赞助人。罕见的 \"不幸女仆 \"教士是那些深受巨大不幸影响的人，他们试图警告他人生活本质上的不公平--或将这种不公平施加于他们。",
	"The folk of Faerûn don't normally pray to or acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive deity who hungers for death - meaning the death of any sentient beings through unlawful means.": "法鲁恩的民众通常不向巴尔祈祷或承认巴尔。他被看作是一个极度邪恶和具有破坏性的神灵，他渴望死亡--意味着通过非法手段使任何有生命的人死亡。",
	"Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit murder. A person might have good reason to resort to murder, such as when one is unable to redress some injustice through lawful means. But it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by those who seek to kill someone out of jealousy, greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron, and clerics who revere Bhaal often qualify on both counts.": "有些人在想杀人的时候会向Bhaal祈祷。一个人可能有充分的理由诉诸于谋杀，比如当一个人无法通过合法手段纠正某些不公正的行为时。但那些因嫉妒、贪婪或愤怒而想杀人的人对巴哈的祈祷则更为常见。除了刺客或强迫性杀手之外，很少有人会把巴哈勒当做守护神，而崇尚巴哈勒的神职人员往往在这两方面都符合条件。",
	"Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder. Such shrines typically feature a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood (often both from the murdered victim).": "过去曾出现过对巴哈的谋杀崇拜，每个人都由一个有魅力的、自称是巴哈的牧师领导，但对谋杀之主的有组织的崇拜是极其不常见的。寺庙和神龛也同样罕见。那些为巴尔建立神龛的人通常是为了感谢他的成功谋杀。这类神龛通常以头骨或断头为特色，周围有血滴（通常都是被害人的血滴）。",

	"Dashing trickster, patron of thieves, and star of fantastical fables and wild stories of adventure-that's the legacy of Brandobaris, the Master of Stealth. Stories of Brandobaris, full of artful trickery and narrow escapes, inspire many young halflings to play at roguish pursuits. In their imagination, a grain silo becomes a lofty wizard's tower to scale in search of treasures, or a rowboat becomes the setting for a swashbuckling adventure. And for some—the youngsters who are said to \"have a bit of Brandobaris in them\"—that play-acting is the prelude to a life of living as Brandobaris does: always on the lookout for the next challenge.": "潇洒的诡计家、盗贼的守护者、幻想中的寓言故事和疯狂的冒险故事的主角--这就是隐身术大师布兰多巴利斯的遗产。关于布兰多巴利斯的故事，充满了艺术性的诡计和狭隘的逃亡，激发了许多年轻的半身人玩弄无赖的追求。在他们的想象中，一个粮仓变成了高高在上的巫师塔，可以爬上去寻找宝藏，或者一艘划艇变成了一个轻率冒险的背景。而对于某些人--那些据说 \"身上有一点布兰多巴里斯的影子 \"的年轻人来说，这种游戏行为是过上像布兰多巴里斯那样生活的前奏：一直在寻找下一个挑战。",
	"Brandobaris continues to wander in search of excitement, and now, as an ascended being, his travels span the planes of existence. His curiosity takes him to all corners of the multiverse in search of magical curios, rare treasures, and mystical puzzles. When Brandobaris moves stealthily, no mortal or god can hear his footfalls-an ability he uses not only for defense, but also to bestow unlooked-for treats upon those he favors.": "布兰多巴里斯继续在寻找刺激，现在，作为一个上升的生命，他的旅行跨越了存在的平面。他的好奇心把他带到多元宇宙的各个角落，寻找神奇的古玩、稀有的宝物和神秘的谜题。当布兰多巴里斯悄悄地移动时，凡人或神灵都听不到他的脚步声--他的这种能力不仅用于防御，而且还能给他喜欢的人带来意想不到的待遇。",
	"Although he never seems to rest in his travels, Brandobaris always has time to reward halflings who dare to take risks and explore the world to make their own mark on it. He has been known to give a bit of aid to halflings in dire straits, turning them invisible for a time or intervening so that they can't be heard or tracked.": "虽然他在旅行中似乎从不休息，但布兰多巴利斯总是有时间奖励那些敢于冒险和探索世界以在世界上留下自己痕迹的半身人。众所周知，他对处于困境中的半身人给予了一点帮助，让他们暂时隐身，或者进行干预，使他们无法被听到或追踪到。",
	"Callarduran became the patron of the deep gnomes when he led them into the Underdark and taught them how to survive, but all gnomes see him as the embodiment of the drive to know more, to examine everything more minutely-and thereby make great discoveries.": "当卡拉杜兰带领地精进入地下世界并教他们如何生存时，他成为了深层地精的守护者，但所有地精都把他看作是了解更多、更细致地研究一切的动力的体现，从而做出伟大的发现。",
	"Callarduran earned his moniker when, after stealing the heart of Ogrémoch, he rubbed his hands smooth as he polished the heart and turned it into a magical stone. The theft caused Ogrémoch to turn to evil, but it gave Callarduran the power to control earth elementals-which, it is said, he can confer to deep gnomes by rubbing the stone and saying their names.": "Callarduran在偷了Ogrémoch的心脏后，把他的手擦得很光滑，把心脏变成了一块神奇的石头，从而获得了他的称号。这次偷窃使Ogrémoch变成了恶魔，但却给了Callarduran控制土元素的力量--据说他可以通过摩擦石头并说出它们的名字来赋予深层地精。",
	"A being that slipped from the Far Realm into Exandria before the Founding, Ceratos is one of the oldest creatures in the world. A single creature of many minds, Ceratos reveled in chaos. When the Elemental Chaos was divided into four planes, Ceratos retreated underground, their minds unraveling as they entered a nightmarish slumber.": "瑟拉托斯是在建国前从远界滑落到艾克桑德里亚的生物，是世界上最古老的生物之一。瑟拉托斯是一个拥有众多思想的单一生物，他陶醉于混沌之中。当混沌元素被分割成四个平面时，瑟拉托斯退到了地下，他们的思想在进入梦魇般的沉睡中解体。",
	"The digging of the Crawling King woke Ceratos a long time after. Though their minds were scattered, each desired the return of chaos to unite themselves. So Ceratos sent thoughts to the surface, offering magic to those who could create chaos in the land above, so that they might one day regain their full power. Ceratos tells their followers that chaos brings clarity and destruction begets rebirth.": "挖掘的爬行王在很久之后唤醒了塞拉托斯。虽然他们的思想是分散的，但每个人都希望混沌的回归能使自己团结起来。于是瑟拉托斯将思想送到地面，为那些能在上面的土地上制造混乱的人提供魔法，以便他们有一天能重新获得全部力量。塞拉托斯告诉他们的追随者，混乱带来清明，毁灭产生重生。",

They can project their minds' thoughts into other creatures, especially those who desire to bring chaos to the world.": "Ceratos被认为是一个巨大的无皮肉球，上面覆盖着不匹配的眼睛、嘴巴和触手。他们可以将自己的思想投射到其他生物身上，特别是那些渴望给世界带来混乱的生物。",
	"Charmalaine is an energetic and spontaneous deity, unafraid of danger, for she expects to be able to detect it as it approaches and evade it before it brings her harm. The stories of her accomplishments read like an adventurer's wildest dreams: she escaped from an army of sahuagin, solved the Chamber of a Thousand Traps, and took treasure from the lair of Tiamat. Halflings envision her as a young adult who moves so fast that her boots smoke and sometimes even catch fire. She carries a mace that has a head that shouts out warnings, and she is accompanied by her ferret friend, Xaphan.": "Charmalaine是一个精力充沛、自发的神灵，不惧怕危险，因为她期望能够在危险接近时发现它，并在它给她带来伤害之前躲开它。关于她的成就的故事读起来就像一个冒险家最疯狂的梦想：她从萨瓦金人的军队中逃脱，解决了千人陷阱的密室，并从提亚马特的巢穴中拿走了财宝。半身人把她想象成一个年轻的成年人，她的动作非常快，以至于她的靴子冒烟，有时甚至起火。她带着一把长矛，长矛的头部会发出警告，她有一个雪貂朋友Xaphan陪伴。",
	"Halflings sometimes call Charmalaine the Lucky Ghost because she can send her spirit out of her body to scout ahead, and thus she is able to warn halfling adventurers of danger while in her incorporeal form. Halflings who favor Charmalaine are usually adventurers or those who pursue other risky professions such as hunting, beast training, scouting, and guarding public officials.": "半身人有时会称查玛琳为幸运鬼，因为她可以将自己的灵魂送出身体去侦查前方，因此她能够在无实体的状态下警告半身人冒险者有危险。偏爱Charmalaine的半身人通常是冒险家或从事其他危险职业的人，如狩猎、野兽训练、侦察和看守政府官员。",
	"Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping, seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing and weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely prayed to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen gardeners. But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a goddess of crib, hearth, and home. And as such she is welcomed into all homes at mealtimes and at the birth of children, and folk give her thanks whenever they experience the pleasure of settling by a fire and feeling safe and loved.": "Chauntea是农业女神：播种和收割，播种和收获，繁殖和屠宰，剪羊毛和织布。在这方面，她是一位农村的神，除了厨房里的园丁，很少有人在城市的围墙后面向她祈祷。但Chauntea也是伟大的母亲，是摇篮、炉灶和家庭的女神。因此，她在吃饭时和孩子出生时被欢迎到所有的家庭，而且每当人们体验到在火堆旁定居并感到安全和被爱的乐趣时，就会向她表示感谢。",
	"Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth. Agricultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her teachings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a common theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her.": "Chauntea的信仰是养育和成长。农业箴言和农耕寓言点缀着她的教义。成长和收获，永恒的循环，是信仰中的一个共同主题。为破坏而破坏，或只铲除而不重建，对她来说是一种诅咒。",
	"Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore about farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely with communities in rural areas, and they are willing to roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt.": "Chauntea的寺庙保留了大量关于农耕和种植的传说。她的牧师与农村地区的社区密切合作，他们愿意卷起袖子，把手伸进土里。",
	"The druids of the Moonshae Isles worship the Earthmother, she who is the generative power of the land itself. To some mainlanders, the Earthmother is an aspect or manifestation of Chauntea, but to the Ffolk, she is simply the Earthmother, and always will be. The moonwells of the isles are her sacred sites and her windows onto the world. See \"Druids\" in chapter 4 for more information.": "月海群岛的德鲁伊们崇拜地母，她是土地本身的生成力量。对一些大陆人来说，地母是Chauntea的一个方面或表现，但对Ffolk来说，她只是地母，而且永远是。岛屿上的月井是她的圣地，是她通向世界的窗口。更多信息见第4章的 \"德鲁伊\"。",

He compels his followers to seek out and dispatch such enemies before they can become a threat to the stronghold.": "Clangeddin鼓励矮人战士冒险离开据点，寻找可以打败的敌人。他特别憎恨地精、巨人和龙。他强迫他的追随者们在这些敌人成为据点的威胁之前，寻找并驱除他们。",
	"Clangeddin's faithful are mainly full-time warriors assigned to weapon training from an early age and expected to take the fight to the enemy. The two axes he wields embody his attitude, since he forsakes the added protection of a shield for the chance to deal more damage to his enemies.": "Clangeddin的信徒主要是全职战士，他们从小就被分配接受武器训练，并被期望向敌人发起战斗。他挥舞的两把斧头体现了他的态度，因为他放弃了盾牌的额外保护，以获得对敌人造成更大伤害的机会。",
	"Clangeddin's priests are warriors who lead from the front. When defending a stronghold, they guard the walls and lead sorties against enemy positions. When an external threat is near, the priests plan guerrilla raids to disrupt invaders before they can besiege the stronghold.": "Clangeddin的牧师是在前线指挥的战士。在保卫据点时，他们守卫城墙，并率领突击队打击敌人的据点。当外部威胁临近时，祭司们会计划进行游击战，在入侵者围攻据点之前将其打乱。",
	"Guardian of spring, beauty, and the arts, Corellon is the patron of arcane magic and the fey. The Founding inspired them to wander the twisted lands, seeding them with the first arcane magics and raising the most ancient of forests. It was by the Arch Heart's hand that the first elves wandered from the Feywild, and for this reason they are considered the Mother and Father of all elves. Those who seek art in all their work, whether magical or mundane, often worship at the altar of Corellon. They loathe the Spider Queen and her priestesses for leading the drow astray.": "科瑞隆是春天、美丽和艺术的守护者，是奥术魔法和精灵的守护神。建国者激励他们在扭曲的土地上游荡，为他们播种了第一批奥术魔法，养育了最古老的森林。正是在拱心的帮助下，第一批精灵从翡冷翠流浪而来，因此他们被认为是所有精灵的母亲和父亲。那些在所有工作中追求艺术的人，无论是魔法还是世俗的，都经常在科瑞隆的祭坛前顶礼膜拜。他们厌恶蜘蛛女王和她的女祭司们，因为他们把乌鸦引入了歧途。",
	"Corellon watches the business of mortals and gods from within the palace of Crescent Grove in the beautiful realm of Arborea, surrounded by towering white trees and pillars of marble.": "科瑞隆在美丽的阿尔博雷亚王国的新月林宫殿内，在高耸的白树和大理石柱的环绕下，观察着凡人和众神的事务。",
	"Most modern tapestries and tomes depict the Arch Heart as an elven being of impossible grace and beauty, androgynous and alluring, framed by long, wavy, golden hair. They were the inspiration for many early elven art pieces, and elements of their visage or symbol are included in most elven architecture.": "大多数现代挂毯和书籍都将拱心描绘成精灵的一种不可能的优雅和美丽，雌雄同体，充满诱惑，被长长的波浪形金发所包围。他们是许多早期精灵艺术作品的灵感来源，他们的面容或符号的元素被包含在大多数精灵建筑中。",
	"Corellon's holy day is called Elvendawn, or Midsummer. It is celebrated on the twentieth day of the sixth month, and commemorates the elves' first emergence from the Feywild. Though the Dwendalian Empire doesn't promote the worship of the Arch Heart, the elves of Bysaes Tyl quietly celebrate in private by opening small doors to the Feywild and having a little more wine than usual.": "科雷隆的圣日被称为埃尔文道恩，或仲夏节。它在第六个月的第二十天庆祝，并纪念精灵们第一次从仙境中出现。虽然德文达尔帝国并不提倡对拱心的崇拜，但拜赛斯-泰尔的精灵们在私下里悄悄地庆祝，打开通往仙境的小门，比平时多喝一点酒。",
	"Create, inspire, and find beauty in all that you do.": "创造、激励，并在你所做的一切中发现美。",

	"Combat the followers of Lolth wherever they might be.": "打击洛尔思的追随者，无论他们在哪里。",
	"The creator of all elves is both chaos and beauty personified. Corellon is as fluid and changeable as a breeze or a brook-quick to anger, but equally quick to forgive and forget. The god loves magic, artistry, nature, and freedom. Anyone who has felt the mystical presence of Corellon describes it as a joy like no other, followed by a deep melancholy when his presence is no longer felt.": "所有精灵的创造者既是混沌又是美丽的化身。科雷隆就像微风或小溪一样流动和多变--很快就会发怒，但同样很快就会原谅和忘记。该神热爱魔法、艺术、自然和自由。任何感受过科雷隆神秘存在的人都将其描述为一种前所未有的快乐，而当他的存在不再被感受到时，又会有一种深深的忧郁感。",
	"Corellon doesn't expect much from followers-no complex rituals or frequent ceremonies or even regular prayer. Corellon wants them to enjoy life, to try new things, to imagine what they desire and then pursue it, and to be kind to others. In return for this freedom from the usual requirements of religion, Corellon expects them to address their own problems and not pray for aid in every crisis. These precepts are instilled within every elf, since all elves are ultimately descended from fragments of Corellon. When elves ask their priests how one might become able to sense Corellon's presence, the priests often say, \"First, truly know yourself. Only then can you feel our creator near.\" Services in Corellon's honor are typically conducted in natural stone amphitheaters or bowl-shaped forest clearings. In keeping with Corellon's chief commandment for everyone to be free, all who attend are allowed to show their obeisance however they choose, as long as their way of contributing combines with the others to form a grand display of reverence. Such a gathering has the atmosphere of a festival rather than of an organized worship service.": "科瑞隆对追随者的期望不高--没有复杂的仪式或频繁的典礼，甚至没有定期的祈祷。科雷隆希望他们享受生活，尝试新事物，想象自己的愿望，然后追求它，并善待他人。作为对这种不受宗教通常要求的自由的回报，科雷隆希望他们解决自己的问题，而不是在每一次危机中祈求援助。这些戒律被灌输给每个精灵，因为所有的精灵最终都是科瑞隆的碎片的后代。当精灵们问他们的祭司如何能够感觉到科里隆的存在时，祭司们经常说：\"首先，要真正了解自己。只有这样，你才能感觉到我们的造物主在身边。纪念科雷隆的仪式通常在天然石制圆形剧场或碗状森林空地上进行。根据科雷隆的主要戒律，每个人都是自由的，所有参加的人都被允许以他们选择的方式表达他们的敬意，只要他们的贡献方式与其他人结合起来，形成一个盛大的敬意展示。这样的聚会有一种节日的气氛，而不是有组织的崇拜仪式。",
	"Many elf wizards honor Corellon and adorn their spellbooks and towers with the god's symbols. Some of them speculate that Corellon is the personification of raw magic itself, the primal force that underlies the multiverse. Corellon is not magic tamed or shaped-not the Weave, as some name it-but magic in its original form: a well of endless, splendid possibilities.": "许多精灵巫师对科瑞隆表示敬意，并用神的符号来装饰他们的法术书和塔楼。他们中的一些人猜测，科瑞隆是原始魔法本身的化身，是支撑多元宇宙的原始力量。Corellon不是驯服或塑造的魔法--不是一些人所说的 \"编织\"--而是原始形式的魔法：一个拥有无穷无尽、绚丽的可能性的井。",
	" Only those long-lived scholars who have researched the elves with the greatest tenacity have heard of the Mysteries of Arvandor, and all these luminaries have ever been able to glean is that it is a secret gathering of elves dedicated to Corellon where a magical replaying of the elven myths of creation is communally experienced.": " 只有那些以最顽强的毅力研究过精灵的长寿学者才听说过阿凡多之谜，而这些名人所能了解到的是，这是一个致力于科里隆的精灵秘密聚会，在那里共同经历了精灵创世神话的神奇回放。",
	"The truth is that the Mysteries of Arvandor is a phenomenon that elves recognize as a summons from their creator, which they can choose to accept or disregard. The event occurs on one plane or multiple planes within the multiverse in a single moment, and there is no guarantee that it will ever occur again; the ability to hear the call is a rare gift. Depending on Corellon's need, the god might call a few dozen or several thousand elves to gather, each elf returning to Corellon's body temporarily for some task that only the god can comprehend.": "事实是，阿凡多之谜是一种现象，精灵们认识到这是来自他们创造者的召唤，他们可以选择接受或不接受。该事件在单一时刻发生在多元宇宙中的一个平面或多个平面上，而且不能保证它会再次发生；能听到召唤的能力是一种罕见的天赋。根据科瑞隆的需要，神可能会召唤几十个或几千个精灵聚集，每个精灵都会暂时返回科瑞隆的身体，执行一些只有神才能理解的任务。",
	"Before this gathering begins, the elves who have been selected start to have powerful dreams and waking visions, urging them to travel to a certain location. At this point, each of the summoned elves must choose whether to follow the visions, because it is known that not every elf returns from an encounter with Corellon. It's true that to be absorbed into the god once more, and returned to awareness before the Drawing of the Veil, is the fulfillment of every elf's longing, but some elves have grown attached to the mortal and mundane world, and thus they turn away from their god's summons. Those who answer the call of Corellon are telepathically guided to their destination, often for hundreds of miles across unknown terrain, or even across planes.": "在这次聚会开始之前，被选中的精灵们开始有强大的梦境和清醒的幻觉，敦促他们前往某个地点。此时，每个被召唤的精灵都必须选择是否跟随这些幻象，因为众所周知，不是每个精灵都能从与科瑞隆的相遇中返回。诚然，再次被吸收到神的体内，回到拉开面纱之前的意识，是每个精灵渴望的满足，但有些精灵已经对凡人和世俗世界产生了依恋，因此他们拒绝了神的召唤。那些响应科瑞隆召唤的人被心灵感应引导到他们的目的地，往往要穿越数百英里的未知地形，甚至是跨越平面。",
	"Most elves who return to their homes from the Mysteries are forever transformed. These participants generally remain silent about their experience, out of reverence and appreciation. Those who speak about the Mysteries of Arvandor struggle for the right words, but they all say in one way or another that experiencing the Mysteries is a way for elves to join with Corellon, gifting the god with their life force-and in return, they revert back to their free, formless nature for a time. After this mystical communion, many elves have a deeper understanding of their origin and a firmer grasp of magic, and some enjoy a lingering telepathic connection with others who have been initiated into the Mysteries.": "大多数从神秘之地返回家园的精灵都被永远改变了。这些参与者通常对他们的经历保持沉默，出于敬畏和感激。那些谈论阿尔凡多之谜的人努力寻找合适的词句，但他们都以这样或那样的方式说，体验神秘是精灵们与科瑞隆结合的一种方式，用他们的生命力赠予神明--作为回报，他们在一段时间内恢复了自由、无形式的本性。在这种神秘的交流之后，许多精灵对自己的起源有了更深的了解，对魔法有了更牢固的掌握，有些人还享受着与其他已进入神秘世界的人之间的心灵感应，挥之不去。",
	"Cryptic shrines to the Mysteries of Arvandor appear throughout the planes, mostly sites where carved or painted stars cover the ceiling of a cave. On the planes that have hosted one of these rare events, elf priests consecrate and maintain temples devoted to the Mysteries. Often these sacred sites are natural spaces that have intrinsic magical properties.": "隐秘的阿凡多之谜的神龛出现在整个星球上，大多是在洞穴的天花板上雕刻或绘画星星的地方。在那些举办过这些罕见活动的星球上，精灵祭司们祭祀并维护着致力于神秘事物的寺庙。这些圣地通常是具有内在魔力的自然空间。",
	"Stories about the Mysteries are preached by many theologians as examples of Corellon's abiding love for his wayward children. Some sages imagine that, one day, all elves will be given this opportunity, after Corellon is satisfied by the completion of some great cosmic quest, and elves will once again be a people of unfettered form and unimaginable joy.": "许多神学家宣扬有关奥秘的故事，作为科瑞隆对他迷途的孩子持久的爱的例子。一些圣人想象，有一天，所有的精灵都会得到这样的机会，在科瑞隆因完成某个伟大的宇宙探索而得到满足之后，精灵们将再次成为一个形式不受约束、快乐无法想象的民族。",
	"Ever changing, mirthful, and beautiful, the primal elves could assume whatever sex they liked. When they bowed to Lolth's influence and chose to fix their physical forms, elves lost the ability to transform in this way. Yet occasionally elves are born who are so androgynous that they are proclaimed to be among the blessed of Corellon-living symbols of the god's love and of the primal elves' original fluid state of being. Many of Corellon's chief priests bear this blessing.": "不断变化、欢快、美丽，原始的精灵可以承担他们喜欢的任何性别。当他们屈服于洛尔思的影响，选择固定他们的身体形态时，精灵们就失去了以这种方式转变的能力。然而，偶尔也会诞生一些雌雄同体的精灵，他们被宣布为科瑞隆的受祝福者，是神的爱和原始精灵的原始流动状态的活生生的象征。许多科里隆的首席祭司都带有这种祝福。",
	"The rarest of these blessed elves can change their sex whenever they finish a long rest-a miracle celebrated by elves of all sorts except drow. (The DM decides whether an elf can manifest this miracle.) Dark elves find this ability to be terrifying and characterize it as a curse, for it could destabilize their entire society. If Corellon's blessing manifests in a drow, that elf usually flees to the surface world to seek shelter among those dedicated to Corellon.": "其中最稀有的受祝福的精灵可以在完成长时间的休息后改变自己的性别--这是除乌鸦以外的各种精灵都在庆祝的奇迹。(黑暗精灵认为这种能力很可怕，并将其描述为一种诅咒，因为它可能会破坏他们整个社会的稳定。如果科瑞隆的祝福在一个乌鸦身上显现，这个精灵通常会逃到地表世界，在那些献给科瑞隆的人中间寻求庇护。",
	"The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of his ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the Time of Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period resolved, but he was also a selfish traitor and a murderer. When he became a god, Cyric continued to work various plots of deceit and murder - the most famous of which is that, according to legend, Cyric murdered Mystra and thus caused the Spellplague over a century ago.": "对居里的崇拜直接来源于他升天成神的故事。西里克是动乱时期的一个凡人，是那个混乱时期如何解决的关键，但他也是一个自私的叛徒和杀人犯。当他成为神后，赛里克继续实施各种欺骗和谋杀的阴谋--其中最著名的是，根据传说，赛里克在一个多世纪前谋杀了米斯特拉，从而引发了法术之灾。",
	"Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of madness, strife, and deceit, although his priests consider such claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies isn't a twisted madman, but a god of dark majesty who proves that, ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt and wither away.": "那些不崇拜Cyric的人认为他是一个疯狂、争斗和欺骗的神，尽管他的牧师认为这种说法是异端。他们的谎言王子并不是一个扭曲的疯子，而是一个黑暗的威严之神，他证明了，最终，民间的所有纽带都会腐烂和凋零。",
	"Cyric's church works openly in Amn, where the citizens espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, and \"buyer beware.\" Those who take Cyric as their patron tend to be sadists, con artists, power-mad connivers, and worse. Other folk pray to Cyric when they want to do wrong but don't want others to find out about it.": "西里奇的教会在安恩公开运作，那里的公民崇尚野心、自力更生和 \"买家要小心 \"的原则。那些以赛里克为守护神的人往往是虐待狂、骗子、权力狂的骗子，甚至更糟。另一些人在想做坏事但又不想让别人发现时，会向西里克祈祷。",
	"\"The Dark Sun,\" originally one of Cyric's epithets, has become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. \"A Dark Sun has risen o'er this court\" might be spoken as a warning that intrigues and infighting have gotten out of hand in a noble household; and married couples know to seek advice from others if \"a Dark Sun shines through the window\" in their relationship.": "\"黑暗的太阳\"，最初是西里奇的外号之一，现在已经成为王国纷争的隐喻。\"黑暗的太阳在这个宫廷里升起 \"可能被说成是一个警告，即阴谋和内讧在一个贵族家庭中已经失控；已婚夫妇知道，如果在他们的关系中出现 \"黑暗的太阳照进了窗户\"，就要向别人寻求建议。",
	"Cyrrollalee embodies the spirit of friendship and hospitality that is part of every halfling's makeup and is represented by one's home and hearth. The home is a welcoming place, but it is also sacrosanct. Halflings honor Cyrrollalee by opening their homes to visitors, and by respecting the home of one's host as if it were one's own.": "Cyrrollalee体现了友谊和好客的精神，这是每个半身人构成的一部分，由一个人的家和炉灶代表。家是一个受欢迎的地方，但它也是神圣不可侵犯的。半身人通过向来访者开放自己的家，以及尊重主人的家，就像尊重自己的家一样，来向Cyrrollalee致敬。",
	"Every halfling village tells its version of the legendary tale of Cyrrollalee and the troll pies. Long ago, a large human town near Cyrrollalee's village was regularly attacked by a vicious troll. Warriors from the town hacked at the troll, but even its most dire wounds would heal, and the troll would come back again. One day Cyrrollalee presented herself at the town gate in apron and peasant clothes, and she offered to rid the town of the troll. The proud human warriors all scoffed at her, but the desperate mayor asked Cyrrollalee for her help.": "每个半身人的村庄都会讲述它的版本，即关于Cyrrollalee和巨魔馅饼的传奇故事。很久以前，Cyrrollalee村庄附近的一个大型人类城镇经常受到一个邪恶的巨魔的攻击。镇上的勇士们砍杀巨魔，但即使是最可怕的伤口也会愈合，而巨魔又会再次回来。有一天，Cyrrollalee穿着围裙和农民的衣服出现在镇子的门口，她提出要把镇子里的巨魔赶走。骄傲的人类战士们都嘲笑她，但绝望的镇长请求Cyrrollalee帮助她。",
	"So Cyrrollalee set all the people in the town to baking pies, but not just any pies. They were special troll pies. Into each one she put a pinch of magic to make them irresistible to trolls. While the warriors of the town grumbled and sharpened their steel, Cyrrollalee created an atmosphere of fun, bringing cheer to the frightened people as they worked. When the day was done, she set off with a cart full of pies and laid them in a tasty trail far up into the mountains. When the troll came near the town and found the trail, it began to gobble up pie after pie, following the delightful smells up the mountain path until it walked right into the lair of a young red dragon. The greedy troll was swiftly incinerated.": "所以西罗拉里让镇上所有的人都去烤馅饼，但不是普通的馅饼。它们是特殊的巨魔馅饼。她在每个馅饼中都加入了一撮魔法，使它们对巨魔无法抗拒。当镇上的战士们埋怨和磨砺他们的钢铁时，西罗拉里创造了一种有趣的气氛，在他们工作时给受惊的人们带来了欢乐。当一天的工作完成后，她带着满满一车的馅饼出发了，把它们放在远处山间的美味小道上。当巨魔来到小镇附近，发现这条小路时，它开始狼吞虎咽地吃着一个又一个的馅饼，顺着令人愉快的气味，沿着山路往上走，直到它走进一条年轻的红龙的巢穴。贪婪的巨魔很快就被烧死了。",
	"Cyrrollalee returned a hero, and from that day forward all the townsfolk remembered her with a word of thanks when baking pies.": "Cyrrollalee作为英雄回来了，从那天起，所有的镇民在烤馅饼时都会想起她，并说声谢谢。",
	"According to legend, Deep Duerra stole the power of psionics from the mind flayers and gifted it to her people. Her command of it was so great that she dominated a mind flayer colony and turned the illithids into her slaves.": "根据传说，深杜尔拉从读心者那里窃取了幻术的力量，并将其赠送给她的人民。她对这种力量的掌握是如此之大，以至于她统治了一个心灵传播者的殖民地，并把伊利特人变成了她的奴隶。",
	"Deep Duerra's followers stand at the forefront of the duergar's attacks on their most hated enemies. Inspired by her mythic deeds, her priests are especially eager to find and annihilate dwarf communities and mind flayer colonies.": "深度杜拉的追随者们站在杜尔加人攻击他们最痛恨的敌人的最前沿。在她的神话事迹的激励下，她的祭司们特别渴望找到并消灭矮人社区和心灵骗子的殖民地。",
	"The priests of Deep Duerra maintain a training ground and armory inside each duergar stronghold. All duergar are required to learn the basic skills of combat, and the nobles are obliged to contribute weapons, armor, and followers to the stronghold's defensive force. The priests honor their deity by planning, equipping, and launching holy crusades against their enemies.": "深杜尔拉的牧师们在每个杜尔加人的据点内都有一个训练场和军械库。所有杜尔加人都必须学习基本的战斗技能，而贵族们则有义务为据点的防御力量贡献武器、盔甲和追随者。祭司们通过计划、装备和发动对敌人的神圣讨伐来纪念他们的神灵。",
	"Deep Sashelas, sometimes known just as Sashelas, is the elven deity of the sea, seafaring, and knowledge. Sashelas is called the Knowledgeable One. His awareness of all lore, not only that about the sea, is seemingly limitless. He is especially beloved by sea elves, dolphins, and elf sages.": "深海萨瑟拉斯，有时只被称为萨瑟拉斯，是精灵族的海洋、航海和知识的神灵。萨谢拉斯被称为知识渊博的人。他对所有的传说，不仅仅是关于海洋的传说，似乎是无限的。他特别受到海洋精灵、海豚和精灵圣人的喜爱。",
	"Most of Sashelas's most devoted followers are sea elves, as are his priests. Many seafarers toss offerings of gold and jewels overboard, beseeching Sashelas to calm storms or provide favorable winds, and he is inclined to aid them even if they aren't fully dedicated to his worship. His sea elf priests often lurk in the water beneath ships when these offerings are made. They catch the treasures as they sink and use them to decorate Sashelas's underwater shrines, to purchase items from coastal merchants that can't be manufactured underwater, and to bribe dragon turtles into their service. Ceremonies honoring Sashelas are held underwater at times of uncommonly high tides or during electrical storms, when flashes of lightning above the waves provide illumination to the calmer realm below the surface.": "萨瑟拉斯最忠实的追随者大多是海精灵，他的祭司也是如此。许多海员将黄金和珠宝的祭品扔到海里，祈求萨谢拉斯平息风暴或提供顺风，即使他们没有完全献身于他的崇拜，他也倾向于帮助他们。他的海精灵祭司经常在这些祭品被献出时潜伏在船底下的水中。他们在宝物沉没时将其抓住，用来装饰萨谢拉斯的水下神殿，从沿海商人那里购买无法在水下制造的物品，并贿赂龙龟为他们服务。纪念萨谢拉的仪式是在不寻常的大潮或电风暴雨时在水下举行的，那时海浪上的闪电为海面下的平静世界提供了照明。",
	" Over time, much of the world sinks to the depths of the oceans and is thought to be lost forever, but it isn't lost to everyone. Sashelas gleans much about the world above the waves from that which sinks beneath them: every shipwreck, every offering, and the wealth and knowledge of every seaside city swallowed by a giant wave are added to Sashelas's ever-expanding library of lore. Knowledge that has disappeared from the surface world might still be known to the priests of Sashelas, gained through communion with their god. Messengers who never reached their destination, ships filled with scrolls from an ancient library, scholars whose works were lost at sea-all of these add to Sashelas's storehouse.": " 随着时间的推移，世界上很多东西都沉入海洋深处，被认为是永远消失了，但并不是对每个人都消失了。Sashelas从沉入海底的东西中获取了许多关于海面世界的信息：每一艘沉船，每一个祭品，以及每一个被巨浪吞没的海滨城市的财富和知识都被添加到Sashelas不断扩大的传说图书馆中。从地表世界消失的知识可能仍然为萨谢拉斯的祭司所知，通过与他们的神交流获得。从未到达目的地的信使，装满古代图书馆卷轴的船只，作品遗失在海上的学者--所有这些都增加了萨谢拉斯的库房。",
	"Away from the open sea, many lagoons, reefs, and grottoes have shrines devoted to Sashelas. Many come in reverence to bathe in the waters in the hope of receiving visions from the god, since it is known that Sashelas is fond of sharing knowledge with those who are true seekers. Scholars, monks, and clerics visit these elaborately decorated seaside temples, immersing themselves in the blessed waters and looking for enlightenment.": "在远离公海的地方，许多泻湖、礁石和石窟都有专门供奉萨谢拉斯的神龛。许多人怀着崇敬的心情来到这里，在水中沐浴，希望得到神的启示，因为众所周知，萨谢拉斯喜欢与那些真正的追求者分享知识。学者、僧侣和神职人员访问这些精心装饰的海滨寺庙，将自己沉浸在受祝福的水中，寻找启迪。",
	"Because the god also dispenses lore through dreams and reveries of memory, many artists and poets worship Sashelas. They seek his creative insight by spending time floating on the waves, then return to shore to write down or sketch out the gifts bequeathed to them.": "由于该神还通过梦境和记忆的遐想来传播传说，许多艺术家和诗人都崇拜萨谢拉斯。他们通过花时间在海浪上漂浮来寻求他的创造性洞察力，然后回到岸上写下或勾勒出遗赠给他们的礼物。",
	"Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass on information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as being a scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes thought of as Oghma's right hand.": "德尼尔是文学和识字之神，是艺术家和抄写员的守护者。他有能力准确地呈现和描述、书写和阅读，并传递信息。在传说中，Deneir经常被描绘成一个为Oghma服务的文士，他有时被认为是Oghma的右手。",
	"It's common practice for someone who writes a letter or records information to say a prayer to Deneir to avoid mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir before beginning and upon completing paintings, particularly illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that relate stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture the truth.": "写信或记录信息的人通常会向Deneir祈祷以避免错误。同样，艺术家们在开始和完成绘画之前，特别是在手稿上的插图、与故事有关的挂毯以及任何此类试图用艺术来捕捉真相的作品时，都会向Deneir致意。",
	"Followers of Deneir believe that information not recorded and saved for later use is information lost. They consider literacy an important gift of the gods, one that should be spread and taught. His followers are scribes and scholars devoted, like their patron, to preserving written works, and also to experiencing them, for they say that Deneir himself is hidden within the lines, shapes, and passages of all written works. Priests of Deneir take an oath of charity as well, compelling them to accept the requests of others to write letters and transcribe information.": "德涅尔的追随者认为，没有记录和保存以供日后使用的信息就是丢失的信息。他们认为识字是诸神的重要礼物，应该被传播和传授。他的追随者是文士和学者，像他们的守护者一样，致力于保存书面作品，同时也致力于体验它们，因为他们说迪内尔本人隐藏在所有书面作品的线条、形状和段落中。Deneir的祭司们也会发下慈善的誓言，迫使他们接受他人的请求，写下信件和抄写信息。",
	"The god's followers tend to be individualists, united by their shared faith but not overly concerned with religious hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported by the fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are more often bestowed on those who lose themselves in written works than on those who fancy themselves part of any temple or religious order. Contemplation of the faith's most holy book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, is the most effective way to become deserving of Deneir's blessings.": "神的追随者往往是个人主义者，他们因共同的信仰而团结在一起，但对宗教等级和礼节并不过分关注。这种行为得到了以下事实的支持：德内尔的神圣魔法祝福更多的是赐予那些在文字作品中迷失自我的人，而不是那些自诩为任何神庙或宗教秩序的人。思考信仰中最神圣的书--《宇宙和谐之书》，是成为值得Deneir祝福的最有效方式。",
	"Desirat was the companion and mount of Asmodeus during the great wars of the Calamity. Before the Divergence, she was torn from her master by the remnants of the original Cerberus Assembly, who wished to study and harvest the phoenix's fiendish form for their own purposes. After the assembly was destroyed in the war and the pantheon was banished from Exandria, the phoenix remained chained beneath the Cyrios Mountains. Her shadowed flames have scalded and scarred the realm above for centuries, giving birth to the thermal phenomena surrounding Mount Metiri in Western Wynandir.": "德西拉是阿斯摩德斯在大灾变战争中的伙伴和坐骑。在分歧之前，她被最初的地狱犬议会的残余势力从她的主人那里夺走，他们希望为自己的目的研究和收获凤凰的恶魔形态。集会在战争中被摧毁，万神殿被放逐出埃克桑德里亚后，凤凰仍然被锁在赛里奥斯山下。几个世纪以来，她阴影下的火焰烫伤了上面的王国，并留下了疤痕，在西维南迪尔的梅蒂里山周围产生了热现象。",
	"Desirat's sanity has fractured in isolation, lending to delusions of divinity, which she perpetuates in the hearts of those who carry a seed of fiery vengeance by reaching out to them through dreams and visions. Though she once amassed a following with the aid of Uk'otoa's worshipers, who nearly dug deep enough to free her, her followers were then subjugated and scattered when the Julous Dominion took power in the Marrow Valley. She now speaks to the minds of those who lie spurned and angry at night, calling them to unlock their inner flame and let Desirat aid them in their vengeance.": "德西拉的理智在与世隔绝的情况下发生了断裂，使她产生了神性的错觉，她通过梦境和幻觉接触那些带着火热复仇种子的人，使他们的心永远处于这种状态。虽然她曾经在乌克托亚的崇拜者的帮助下积累了一批追随者，他们几乎挖到了足够的深度来释放她，但当朱鲁斯统治者在骨髓谷掌权时，她的追随者就被征服和驱散了。她现在对那些躺在夜里被唾弃和愤怒的人的心灵说话，呼唤他们释放他们内在的火焰，让德西拉帮助他们复仇。",
	"Desirat is depicted as a giant phoenix of dark purple down, wreathed in purple-black flames. Her sword-like beak is pointed and smooth, while her three onyx eyes peer from beneath bright, burning lids.": "德西拉被描绘成一只深紫色的巨大凤凰，被紫黑色的火焰包围着。她像剑一样的喙尖而光滑，而她的三只玛瑙眼睛从明亮、燃烧的眼睑下窥视。",
	"Dol Arrah is the sun that drives away the darkness. She stands for wisdom in war and for those who fight with honor, pursue justice, and make sacrifices for the greater good.": "多尔-阿拉是驱除黑暗的太阳。她代表着战争中的智慧，代表着那些为荣誉而战、追求正义并为更大利益做出牺牲的人。",
	"Dol Dorn is the Sovereign of Strength and Steel. He is the patron of the common soldier, and he guides the hands of anyone who holds a weapon. He embodies courage, strength, and martial skill.": "多尔-多恩是力量和钢铁的君主。他是普通士兵的守护神，他指导任何持有武器的人的双手。他体现了勇气、力量和武术技巧。",
	"Most drow know nothing of Eilistraee. Matron mothers of the most powerful houses closely guard the scrolls that chronicle her existence. They retain them for the sake of remaining aware of the enemy they describe: a drow god who would spirit away all of Lolth's worshipers to the surface world.": "大多数鸦人对艾利斯特莱一无所知。最有权势的家族的主母严密保护着记载她存在的卷轴。他们保留这些卷轴是为了保持对卷轴所描述的敌人的了解：一个会把所有洛尔思的崇拜者带到地面世界的鸦人之神。",
	"The matron mothers warn those who go to the surface on raids to retreat if they can see the moon-practical advice, it would seem. But an equally important reason is that Eilistraee is known to work her wiles under the light of the moon, so that drow are more susceptible to her lure at such times. The matrons also direct the raiders to flee back underground if any of their number hear music they find appealing, such as a parent's lullaby or the chorus of a rousing song carried on the mind, because Eilistraee's call to drow who would be free of Lolth's web is often delivered within dulcet tunes that aren't of otherworldly origin.": "母夜叉们警告那些去地表突袭的人，如果他们能看到月亮，就要撤退，这似乎是个实用的建议。但同样重要的原因是，众所周知，埃利斯特莱会在月光下施展她的诡计，所以乌鸦在这种时候更容易受到她的引诱。如果他们中的任何一个人听到了他们认为有吸引力的音乐，比如父母的摇篮曲或在脑海中出现的振奋人心的歌曲的合唱，女院长们也会指示突袭者逃回地下，因为艾利斯特雷对那些将从洛尔思之网中解脱出来的乌鸦的召唤往往是在并非来自其他世界的沉闷曲调中发出的。",
	"Eilistraee is a god of moonlight, song, dance, and, most important, the rejection of the evil ways of Lolth. Drow who feel like outsiders in their society, who react with disgust to the evils perpetrated by their kind, who come to the surface and fall in love with the stars-these are the ones who might be pleased to hear Eilistraee's call. If they respond to it by going to the surface and staying there, Eilistraee offers no guarantee of their safety and no promise of acceptance in the world above. But she opens her followers' hearts to the wonder of the nature in the night, and her songs and signs can show a drow how to persevere in that alien environment.": "Eilistraee是月光、歌曲、舞蹈之神，最重要的是拒绝Lolth的邪恶方式。那些在社会中感到自己是局外人的鸦人，那些对自己的同类所犯下的罪恶感到厌恶的人，那些来到地表并爱上星星的人--这些人可能会很高兴听到Eilistraee的召唤。如果他们响应号召，前往地表并留在那里，Eilistraee不能保证他们的安全，也不能保证他们在上面的世界中被接受。但她向追随者敞开了心扉，让他们感受到黑夜中大自然的神奇，她的歌声和征兆可以告诉鸦人如何在这个陌生环境中坚持下去。",
	"The scrolls that the matron mothers guard so closely attest that Eilistraee turned against Lolth but knew better than to seek solace among the Seldarine. Her position among the other drow gods remains uncertain, as is the fate of the souls of those who turn to her worship. Drow who are beloved by Eilistraee sometimes appear to vanish when they die, as the body dissolves into pale light and leaves no clue to where the soul has gone.": "女修道院院长们严加看守的卷轴证明，伊利斯特莱背叛了洛尔思，但她知道最好不要在塞尔达林人中寻求慰藉。她在其他鸦人之神中的地位仍然不确定，那些转向她的崇拜的人的灵魂的命运也是如此。被艾利斯特雷爱戴的乌鸦在死亡时有时会出现消失，因为身体会化为苍白的光，没有留下任何关于灵魂去向的线索。",
	"Eldath is the goddess of waterfalls, springs, pools, stillness, peace, and quiet glades. She is thought to be present at many such places, particularly those that serve as druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing, and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure madness, and comfort the dying.": "埃尔达斯是瀑布、泉水、水池、静止、和平和安静的小树林的女神。她被认为存在于许多这样的地方，特别是那些作为德鲁伊丛林的地方。埃尔达斯是一位舒适、治愈和平静的女神。她的祝福之水可以治愈病人，治愈疯狂，并安慰垂死的人。",
	"Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of quiet reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A body of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves as a repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a stream one crosses along the way might serve as the repository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of arguments, which the faithful discard while making a wish for peace in the future. Many of those who favor Eldath are pacifists or people who are troubled by violence they have witnessed or experienced.": "大多数农村地区都有一个池塘或一个小树林，当地人把它归于埃尔德斯。传统上，它是一个安静思考的地方，其他人可以在那里进行思考。池塘或泉水等水体通常作为祭品的存放地。如果圣地是一片沼泽地，人们沿途经过的一条小溪可能会成为存放地，或者沼泽地中突出的灌木或树木可能是人们系上祭品的地方。典型的祭品是破损的武器或纪念争吵的物品，信徒们将其丢弃，同时许下未来和平的愿望。许多赞成Eldath的人都是和平主义者，或被他们所目睹或经历的暴力所困扰的人。",
	"Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed, many are itinerant, wandering between various holy sites and shrines, seeing that the locations are cared for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath are usually close to nature, and allied to druids, who count Eldath among the First Circle. It is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great misfortune. Despite the measure of protection that this belief affords them, most priests of Eldath avoid conflicts rather than attempting to quell them. Those who serve Eldath are happy to preside over peaceful negotiations and to certify treaties, but they can't force others to engage in harmony.": "艾尔达斯的祭司们并没有组织成大的教派。事实上，很多人都是流动的，在各个圣地和神殿之间游荡，确保这些地方得到照顾，并保持甜蜜的宁静。艾尔达斯的信徒通常亲近自然，并与德鲁伊结盟，他们把艾尔达斯视为第一圈。打击艾尔达斯的牧师是一种禁忌，杀死一个牧师据说会带来巨大的不幸。尽管这种信仰为他们提供了一定程度的保护，但大多数艾尔达斯的牧师会避免冲突，而不是试图平息冲突。那些为艾尔达斯服务的人很乐意主持和平谈判并证明条约，但他们不能强迫他人参与和谐。",
	"As god of the polis, Ephara sees herself as the founder of civilization. She watches over cities, protecting them from outside threats. She is credited with establishing the first code of law, which Meletis has preserved and the other poleis have imitated. Even more important, she helps cities reach their highest potential, becoming centers of scholarship, industry, and art.": "作为政体之神，埃法拉认为自己是文明的创始人。她守护着城市，保护它们免受外部威胁。她被认为建立了第一部法典，Meletis保留了这部法典，而其他城市也模仿了这部法典。更重要的是，她帮助城市发挥最大潜力，成为学术、工业和艺术的中心。",
	"Ephara appears as a huge animated statue wearing a stone crown, resembling the capital of a column. When she chooses to walk about her cities at human scale, she often takes on the form of a human woman. In either form, she is always dressed in blue and white, and her expression is usually serious, but not unkind. She often carries a large urn on one shoulder, with the dark, star-studded sky of Nyx pouring from it and dissolving into mist as it hits the ground.": "艾法拉以一个巨大的动画雕像出现，戴着一个石冠，类似于柱子的资本。当她选择以人类的尺度在她的城市中行走时，她常常以人类妇女的形式出现。无论哪种形式，她总是穿着蓝色和白色的衣服，她的表情通常是严肃的，但不是不友善的。她经常在一个肩膀上扛着一个大瓮，Nyx的黑暗、星空从瓮中倾泻而出，落地时化为雾气。",
	"Ephara's sphere of influence is the polis. Although worshiped in many places, she is most beloved in Meletis, whose citizens credit her with the city's founding. Many city walls bear Ephara's face, fashioned thus in the belief that each of her images watches over the part of the city it looks upon.": "埃法拉的影响范围是政区。虽然很多地方都有对她的崇拜，但她在梅莱蒂斯最受爱戴，梅莱蒂斯的市民认为她是这座城市的建立者。许多城市的墙壁上都有埃法拉的脸，这样做是为了相信她的每一个形象都会守护着城市的一部分。",
	"Ephara is strongly affiliated with the daytime, when cities are awake, alive, and at work. Her followers generally pray at midday, with the sounds of the city forming an appropriate backdrop to their rites, as industry itself is sacred to Ephara. Many aspects of city life and culture fall under Ephara's influence. Scholarship is closely connected to Ephara, as is art—particularly poetry, sculpture, and architecture. Ephara is also highly concerned with civic wisdom and justice, and many politicians and other leaders seek her guidance in how to rule.": "埃法拉与白天密切相关，此时城市是清醒的、有活力的和工作的。她的追随者一般在中午祈祷，城市的声音构成了他们仪式的适当背景，因为工业本身对Ephara来说是神圣的。城市生活和文化的许多方面都受到埃法拉的影响。学术研究与Ephara密切相关，艺术也是如此，特别是诗歌、雕塑和建筑。埃法拉也高度关注公民的智慧和正义，许多政治家和其他领导人在如何统治方面寻求她的指导。",
	"Ephara seeks always to further cities: establishing them, protecting them, and seeing them grow. She supports those who build new cities and those who free others from tyranny. Ephara knows that not all threats to a city come from outside it, and she encourages her followers to watch out for tyranny and injustice from within. She seeks for justice to prevail in civilized lands.": "艾法拉总是寻求促进城市的发展：建立它们，保护它们，并看到它们的成长。她支持那些建立新城市的人和那些把别人从暴政中解放出来的人。艾法拉知道，并非所有对城市的威胁都来自外部，她鼓励她的追随者注意来自内部的暴政和不公正。她寻求在文明的土地上实现正义。",
	"Ephara seeks far more for her cities than mere safety. She drives every city to aspire toward efforts that help its people thrive. Civic responsibility is essential in Ephara's eyes, and having an engaged citizenry is important. The pursuit of knowledge is also a vital task, and she encourages advances in philosophy and science. As the scholars in her cities obtain or derive new knowledge, Ephara's magic scrolls grow ever longer. Finally, art is of critical importance to a thriving city. Ephara particularly supports architecture, the creation of which often drives industry and sculpture, though she doesn't scorn other varieties of artistic expression.": "艾法拉为她的城市寻求的远不止是安全。她驱使每个城市向着帮助其人民繁荣的方向努力。在Ephara眼中，公民责任是必不可少的，拥有一个参与其中的公民是很重要的。对知识的追求也是一项重要的任务，她鼓励哲学和科学的进步。随着她的城市中的学者们获得或衍生出新的知识，Ephara的魔法卷轴也越来越长。最后，艺术对于一个繁荣的城市来说是至关重要的。艾法拉特别支持建筑，建筑的创造常常推动工业和雕塑的发展，尽管她并不蔑视其他种类的艺术表达。",
	"Ephara and Heliod have aligning interests, since they both value structure and justice. Ephara works toward establishing judicial systems that enforce the laws and uphold the values that Heliod holds dear.": "Ephara和Heliod有一致的利益，因为他们都重视结构和正义。Ephara致力于建立司法系统，执行法律并维护Heliod所珍视的价值观。",
	"Ephara is also on good terms with Thassa, the god of the sea, because Ephara recognizes the necessity of water for a thriving polis. She also admires Purphoros's craft, realizing the essential role of the forge and other forms of industry to build a city.": "埃法拉还与海神塔萨关系良好，因为埃法拉认识到水对一个繁荣的城市的必要性。她也很欣赏珀弗洛斯的手艺，意识到锻造和其他形式的工业对建设城市的重要作用。",
	"Ephara and Nylea are almost polar opposites, and there is no shortage of bad blood between the god of the cities and the god of the hunt. Nylea resents the construction of every building in a place that once held plants and animals, and Ephara has no patience for any wild creature that encroaches on a settlement. Ephara looks at the wilderness and sees only wasted potential, while Nylea looks at cities and sees only destruction.": "Ephara和Nylea几乎是两极对立，城市之神和狩猎之神之间不乏恶斗。Nylea憎恨在一个曾经拥有植物和动物的地方建造每一座建筑，而Ephara对任何侵占定居点的野生生物都没有耐心。埃法拉看着荒野，只看到浪费的潜力，而奈拉看着城市，只看到破坏。",
	"Ephara has a deep-seated hatred for Phenax. While Ephara can appreciate the perspective of most of her peers, she has no such understanding for those who would deliberately try to undermine a thriving social structure. Ephara opposes Phenax and what she sees as his utter disdain for everything she stands for.": "Ephara对Phenax有一种根深蒂固的憎恨。虽然Ephara可以欣赏她大多数同龄人的观点，但她对那些故意破坏繁荣的社会结构的人没有这种理解。Ephara反对Phenax，她认为他对她所代表的一切完全不屑一顾。",
	"Her relationship with Karametra is a difficult one from either perspective. Ephara approves of agriculture, a key ingredient for the development of cities, and both gods are concerned with defense of settlements. Even so, Karametra is tied to Setessa and the wild lands, where Ephara is distrusted, and although Karametra and Nylea have their own complicated relationship, Karametra strongly favors Nylea over Ephara.": "无论从哪个角度看，她与卡拉米特拉的关系都是一个难题。埃法拉赞同农业，这是城市发展的关键要素，两位神都关心定居点的防御问题。即便如此，卡拉米特拉还是与塞特萨和荒野之地联系在一起，而埃法拉在那里是不被信任的。尽管卡拉米特拉和奈拉有自己复杂的关系，但卡拉米特拉强烈地偏爱奈拉而不是埃法拉。",
	"To an extent, Ephara's devout show their faith by going about their lives and contributing to society. Midday services at Ephara's temples often feature a brief prayer, followed by a longer talk from an industrial or civic leader on a topic of general interest. Attendants often bring meals to eat while on a break from their jobs.": "在某种程度上，埃法拉的虔诚者通过自己的生活和对社会的贡献来展示他们的信仰。埃法拉寺庙的午间仪式通常有一个简短的祈祷，然后是一个工业或公民领袖就普遍感兴趣的话题进行较长时间的谈话。参加者经常在工作休息时带饭来吃。",
	"Ephara's face is a common sight in cities. Marble buildings, stone walls, and similar surfaces usually feature a sculpture or relief of her visage. People often swear oaths or engage in verbal disputes in front of these images, believing she won't let a falsehood told in front of her go unpunished. Whether she actually intervenes is unclear, but conflicts that play out this way are often resolved peacefully, without a need for the justice system to get involved.": "艾法拉的脸是城市中常见的景象。大理石建筑、石墙和类似的表面通常都有她的面部雕塑或浮雕。人们经常在这些图像前发誓或进行口头争论，相信她不会让在她面前说的假话不受惩罚。她是否真的干预尚不清楚，但以这种方式进行的冲突往往能和平解决，不需要司法系统介入。",
	"Ephara's deeds demonstrate her commitment to the poleis and those who seek their improvement.": "艾法拉的事迹表明她对Poleis和那些寻求改善的人的承诺。",
	"The city-state of Meletis was once part of the archon Agnomakhos's empire. The archon ruled his territory with absolute cruelty. Ephara bestowed her magic on the subjugated populace to enable them to fight back and overthrow Agnomakhos. The newly freed people then established Meletis, as the settlement on that site is known today. The founding of Ephara's favored city is still celebrated today, both in Meletis and elsewhere among the god's followers, as the summer holiday of Polidrysion, which gives its name to the fourth month in the Meletian calendar.": "Meletis城邦曾经是大主教Agnomakhos帝国的一部分。大主教以绝对残酷的方式统治着他的领土。埃法拉将她的魔法赐予被征服的民众，使他们能够反击并推翻阿格诺玛科斯。新获得自由的人们随后建立了梅里提斯（Meletis），该地的定居点今天已为人所知。埃法拉宠爱的城市的建立今天仍然被庆祝，无论是在梅莱蒂斯还是在其他地方的神的追随者中，作为夏季的Polidrysion节日，它的名字来自于梅莱蒂亚历的第四个月。",
	"The temple of Ephara in Meletis is the god's largest and grandest place of worship on Theros. It is kept in perfect repair, and worn or damaged pieces of the structure are quickly replaced. During an enormous earthquake, many of the structures in Meletis crumbled. Ephara kept her temple standing throughout the mighty quake, making it a place for Meletians to take refuge in the following days during the aftershocks. After the cataclysm, she shared designs from her scrolls of sacred knowledge with the architects of Meletis so they could rebuild the city to be much more resistant to earthquakes.": "位于梅莱蒂斯的埃法拉神庙是特洛斯岛最大、最宏伟的祭祀场所。它保持着完美的维修，结构上磨损或损坏的部分很快被替换。在一次巨大的地震中，Meletis的许多建筑都倒塌了。埃法拉在整个大地震中保持她的神庙屹立不倒，使之成为余震期间梅莱蒂斯人避难的地方。大灾难过后，她与梅莱蒂斯的建筑师们分享了她的神圣知识卷轴中的设计，以便他们能够重建城市，使其更能抵抗地震。",
	"The small town of Glossion boasts a remarkable library that according to local legend was a gift from Ephara. Other tales suggest that the library was actually founded by an ancient sage named Anatheia, but then a terrible fire destroyed the place, and along with it generations of collected knowledge. Once the people finished rebuilding the structure to start the library over, Ephara is said to have appeared and restored the books and scrolls the library had lost, copying the information from her personal scrolls of sacred knowledge.": "小镇Glossion拥有一个非凡的图书馆，根据当地的传说，这是Ephara的礼物。其他的传说表明，图书馆实际上是由一位名叫安纳提亚（Anatheia）的古代圣人建立的，但后来一场可怕的大火烧毁了这个地方，连同它所收集的几代知识。当人们完成了重建图书馆的工作后，据说埃法拉出现了，并恢复了图书馆丢失的书籍和卷轴，从她个人的神圣知识卷轴中复制了这些信息。",
	"A kraken that escaped its sea lock once threatened the small seaside city of Altrisos. Recently weakened by a triton raid, the city had no defenses left and would be destroyed by an attack. The people prayed to Ephara, and the large image of her face on the city's wall came to life. The walls of the city grew impossibly high and strong, and the kraken could do no more than dash its head against the impassable barrier. The monster soon returned to the ocean to find an easier meal.": "一只逃脱了海锁的海怪曾经威胁着海滨小城Altrisos。最近，这座城市在一次三叉戟突袭中被削弱，没有任何防御措施，将被攻击所摧毁。人们向艾法拉祈祷，城墙上她的巨大脸部图像出现了生命。城墙变得不可能那么高，那么坚固，海怪只能用它的头去撞那无法逾越的屏障。这只怪物很快就回到了海里，去寻找更容易的食物。",
	"A man named Aristhenes committed many murders, targeting members of the government and some of their family members. When he was arrested and put to trial, he claimed that no one could fairly judge him because every qualified judge was personally affected by the case. Ephara herself came to the city to serve as judge for the trial, since no one could accuse her of anything but perfect impartiality, and she found Aristhenes guilty.": "一个名叫亚里士多德的人犯下了许多谋杀案，目标是政府成员和他们的一些家庭成员。当他被逮捕并接受审判时，他声称没有人能够公正地审判他，因为每一个合格的法官都受到案件的影响。埃法拉亲自来到城市，担任审判的法官，因为除了完美的公正性之外，没有人可以指责她，她认定亚里斯提尼斯有罪。",

Some of the god's most devout followers work as architects, artists, or philosophers, all striving to serve the public good.": "大多数埃法拉的拥护者认为城市代表了成就的顶峰，并尽其所能地维护法律和保持社会的运转。一些神的最虔诚的追随者从事建筑师、艺术家或哲学家的工作，都在努力为公共利益服务。",
	"Ephara seeks champions who will defend her cities fiercely, both from external threats and internal corruption. She asks them to protect not only the people, but also the structures that comprise a polis. The circumstances that led you to worship Ephara most likely involved the polis you call home. The Ephara's Favor table provides just a few possibilities.": "埃法拉寻求的是那些能够激烈地捍卫她的城市的冠军，既要抵御外部威胁，又要抵御内部腐败。她要求他们不仅要保护人民，而且要保护构成政体的结构。导致你崇拜埃法拉的情况很可能与你所居住的政体有关。埃法拉的恩惠表提供了一些可能性。",

	"Erebos's very presence is stifling, and those who come face to face with him often depart in despair.

In the other four realms of the dead, his will is law.": "从赫利奥德的阴影中诞生，然后被放逐到冥界，埃瑞博斯声称对那个荒凉的领域拥有统治权。他认为确保进入他的领域的人永远留在那里是他的责任和权利。在冥界中，只有相对的天堂伊里西亚能免受他的影响。在其他四个亡灵领域，他的意志就是法律。",

Erebos, having long ago come to terms with his own banishment, teaches his followers to accept the inevitability of death and the often unavoidable tragedies of life.": "凡人通常害怕死亡，然而死亡是每个人在凡人世界中的不可避免的结局。埃里伯斯很早就接受了自己被放逐的事实，教导他的追随者接受死亡的不可避免性，以及生命中经常无法避免的悲剧。",

	"Erebos wants above all to maintain his position of absolute authority over the realm of the dead. He lashes out at anyone who aids souls in escaping from him or otherwise tries to subvert the inevitability of death.": "埃瑞博斯首先想保持他在死人界的绝对权威地位。他抨击任何帮助灵魂逃离他的人，或以其他方式试图颠覆死亡的不可避免性。",
	"Erebos is patient, usually willing to wait for souls to come to him, but he does interfere in the mortal realm on occasion. When the other gods displease him, he sends mortal agents or Nyxborn monsters to kill the worshipers of the offending gods and spread despair.": "埃瑞博斯很有耐心，通常愿意等待灵魂来找他，但他偶尔也会干涉凡人的境界。当其他神灵对他不满时，他就会派凡人代理人或Nyxborn怪物去杀死冒犯神灵的崇拜者，并传播绝望。",
	"Many of Erebos's schemes target those who escape his clutches. He regularly sends agents to retrieve the Returned soul or the wayward eidolon of a hero of great renown who has succeeded in returning to Theros. If any of the dead, renowned or otherwise, escape the Underworld fully intact—without identities erased—Erebos will spare nothing to make an example of the fugitive and any who provided assistance.": "埃瑞博斯的许多计划都是针对那些逃离他魔掌的人。他经常派特工去找回回归者的灵魂，或者找回成功返回特洛斯的著名英雄的不归路Eidolon。如果任何死者，不管是知名的还是其他的，都能完整地逃出冥界--没有被抹去身份--雷波斯会不遗余力地将逃犯和任何提供帮助的人作为例子。",
	"Erebos loathes Heliod, who banished him to the Underworld eons ago, forever severing him from the world of life and light. Erebos takes particular delight in profaning Heliod's temples, defiling the raiment of his priests, slaughtering his worshipers, and claiming the souls of his champions. Erebos believes that Heliod will one day challenge him for control of the Underworld. He looks forward to that day, certain that his lesser brother can't possibly prevail within Erebos's own territory.": "埃瑞博斯憎恨赫利奥德，赫利奥德在很久以前就把他放逐到了冥界，永远切断了他与生命和光明世界的联系。埃瑞博斯特别喜欢亵渎赫利奥德的神庙，玷污他的祭司的衣服，屠杀他的崇拜者，并索取他的冠军们的灵魂。埃瑞博斯相信，赫利奥德有一天会向他挑战，争夺对冥界的控制权。他期待着那一天的到来，确信他的小兄弟不可能在埃雷伯斯自己的领土上获胜。",
	"Erebos holds a special grudge against Phenax. Phenax readily teaches others how to escape the Underworld as the Returned and even sneaks into the Underworld to assist them, earning him Erebos's undying ire.": "Erebos对Phenax怀有特殊的怨恨。Phenax很乐意教别人如何以回归者的身份逃离冥界，甚至潜入冥界协助他们，这使他赢得了Erebos不死的愤怒。",
	"Pharika and Karametra understand, better than many of the other gods, that life and death are closely intertwined. Pharika's tinctures can either extend a life or snuff it out, and Karametra's planters know that reaping follows sowing in turn. Although he appreciates what these gods have in common with him, Erebos occasionally feels the need to remind them that the dead are his, and other gods' acceptance of death's inevitability doesn't make them masters of it.": "法里卡和卡拉米特拉比其他许多神灵更明白，生命和死亡是紧密相连的。法里卡的酊剂可以延长生命，也可以扼杀生命，卡拉米特拉的种植者知道，收获是在播种之后反过来的。虽然他很欣赏这些神明与他的共同点，但埃里伯斯偶尔会觉得有必要提醒他们，死者是他的，其他神明接受死亡的不可避免性并不意味着他们是死亡的主人。",
	"Erebos has no true allies but operates closely with Athreos and Klothys. Athreos is one of the few beings Erebos trusts to be as committed as he is to ensuring that the passage into death is a one-way trip. Klothys, too, would see the dead remain dead, concerned as she is with the acceptance of destiny.": "Erebos没有真正的盟友，但与Athreos和Klothys密切协作。Athreos是Erebos信任的少数生命之一，他像他一样致力于确保进入死亡的通道是一个单程旅行。Klothys也会看到死人保持死亡，因为她关心的是对命运的接受。",
	"To many mortals, Erebos is primarily concerned not with death, but with gold. Most of his followers downplay his association with death and misfortune, instead praying to him for material wealth. Others pray to him because they want to be more accepting of their misfortune. These individuals see themselves as beyond hope of improving their lot in life, asking only that Erebos grant them the strength to endure until they enter his realm at their predestined time.": "对许多凡人来说，Erebos主要关注的不是死亡，而是黄金。他的大多数追随者淡化了他与死亡和不幸的联系，而是向他祈祷物质财富。其他人向他祈祷是因为他们想更多地接受自己的不幸。这些人认为自己没有希望改善自己的命运，只要求埃里伯斯给予他们力量，让他们在预定的时间进入他的领域。",
	"A smaller but more dangerous group of Erebos worshipers are those who actively glorify death. These cultists and assassins congregate in secret in communities across Theros, engaging in campaigns of violence.": "一个更小但更危险的埃雷伯斯崇拜者群体是那些积极颂扬死亡的人。这些崇拜者和刺客秘密地聚集在整个塞洛斯的社区，从事暴力活动。",

	"Many know the story of Kytheon Iora, an Akroan orphan who took up Heliod's spear and attempted to kill Erebos himself. The tale ends in tragedy, as Kytheon was struck down along with his friends. Only the high priests of Erebos, however, know that Kytheon's soul isn't in the Underworld, having somehow escaped right before Erebos's eyes. Suspecting that either Heliod or Kruphix knows where Kytheon's soul went, Erebos will reward anyone who can tell him.": "许多人都知道凯瑟恩-伊奥拉的故事，他是一个阿克罗安的孤儿，拿起赫利奥德的长矛，试图亲手杀死埃瑞博斯。这个故事以悲剧收场，Kytheon和他的朋友一起被击倒。然而，只有Erebos的大祭司知道Kytheon的灵魂并不在冥界，他在Erebos的眼前莫名其妙地逃走了。由于怀疑Heliod或Kruphix知道Kytheon的灵魂去向，Erebos将奖励任何能告诉他的人。",

She entered the Winter Nexus, a cave on the edge of Setessa that leads to the Underworld, and played a love song to lure Pero's soul back to the mortal world. When Erebos saw this, he became furious, and he extended his whip to draw both of the lovers back. But Menelaia was beloved of Nylea, and that god blocked Erebos's whip with vines. The two lovers lived long lives together. Erebos had the last word, however, tormenting both of the lovers in the Underworld. To this day, this turn of events plagues Nylea, who seeks a way to bring the lovers peace.": "很久以前，一位名叫Menelaia的作词大师哀悼她的爱人佩罗。她进入了冬日纽带，一个位于塞特萨边缘、通往冥界的洞穴，并演奏了一首情歌，引诱佩罗的灵魂回到凡间。埃里伯斯看到这一幕，勃然大怒，他伸出鞭子想把这对恋人都引回来。但梅内莱亚是奈拉的爱人，那位神用藤蔓挡住了埃里伯斯的鞭子。这对恋人在一起生活了很长时间。然而，埃里伯斯拥有最后的话语权，在冥界折磨着这对恋人。直到今天，这一事件还在困扰着奈拉，她寻求一种方法来使这对恋人获得和平。",
	"Daxos of Meletis was a powerful oracle who heard the voices of all the gods. Daxos tragically died at the hands of his lover, the champion of Heliod, Elspeth, through the duplicity of the satyr Xenagos. Daxos's soul passed into the Underworld, and Elspeth sought Erebos's help to travel into Nyx. After passing Erebos's test for admittance, Elspeth demanded an additional reward: she would trade her life for Daxos's. Erebos, always eager to claim a champion of the sun god, agreed. Elspeth died shortly after her triumph over Xenagos, whereupon Erebos kept his word—but in a treacherous fashion, allowing Daxos's body to go back to the mortal world as a Returned. Bereft of memories, he wanders aimlessly.": "Meletis的Daxos是一个强大的神谕，能听到所有神的声音。达克索斯不幸死于他的爱人，赫利奥德的冠军埃尔斯珀斯之手，因为萨特纳戈斯的阴谋。达克索斯的灵魂进入了冥界，埃尔斯珀斯寻求埃雷伯斯的帮助，进入尼克斯。在通过了Erebos的准入测试后，Elspeth要求一个额外的奖励：她将用她的生命换取Daxos的生命。Erebos总是渴望得到一个太阳神的冠军，他同意了。埃尔斯珀斯在战胜赛纳戈斯后不久就死了，于是埃里伯斯遵守了他的诺言--但以一种奸诈的方式，让达克索斯的身体以回归者的身份回到了凡人世界。失去了记忆，他漫无目的地游荡着。",
	"Heliod's followers maintain that their god gave rise to Erebos by casting a shadow in the sun's first light. Followers of Erebos say that this tale is self-refuting. Before there ever was a sun, the entire world stood in shadow, and the shadow was Erebos—elder to Heliod. Only with the first dawning was Erebos's form diminished enough that Heliod could overpower him, and the god of the dead has never forgiven his upstart brother. The faithful of both Erebos and Heliod viciously argue the details of their gods' origins, some risking their lives in battle over which of their gods came into being first.": "赫利奥德的追随者坚持认为，他们的神通过在太阳的第一道光中投下阴影而产生了埃雷伯斯。埃雷伯斯的追随者说，这个故事是自相矛盾的。在有太阳之前，整个世界都处于阴影之中，而这个阴影就是埃雷伯斯--赫利奥德的长老。只有在第一次黎明时分，Erebos的形体才减弱到足以让Heliod制服他，而亡灵之神从来没有原谅过他的后进兄弟。埃雷伯斯和赫利奥德的信徒们对他们的神的起源细节进行了激烈的争论，有些人冒着生命危险在战斗中争论他们的神谁先诞生。",

	"As Erebos sees it, he already owns the soul of every living being. For him to bestow special favor or power on a mortal would be an act of generosity, and he expects to be compensated for it. Those who rise to the ranks of true champions of Erebos, though, embrace death and their inescapable destiny in the Underworld. Did you pledge yourself to Erebos by joining his priesthood, or did you come to find his favor through a prayer of quiet desperation? The Erebos's Favor table offers a handful of suggestions.": "在Erebos看来，他已经拥有每个生命体的灵魂。对他来说，将特殊的恩惠或力量赐予一个凡人是一种慷慨的行为，他希望得到补偿。不过，那些上升到真正的Erebos冠军行列的人，会接受死亡和他们在冥界不可避免的命运。你是通过加入Erebos的神职来保证自己，还是通过安静的绝望的祈祷来获得他的青睐？埃瑞博斯的恩惠表提供了一些建议。",

For some, Ezra is a goodly guardian, while others perceive her as a soul-stealing embodiment of the Mists. Ultimately, though, her true nature is a mystery.

	"The stories that gnomes tell of Flandal Steelskin typically feature some perfect item that he crafted or a misadventure that results from following his enormous nose, which can smell ore more easily than a wolf can scent a skunk. The most often told legend of Flandal includes both elements. Before creating Garl's marvelous axe, Arumdina, Flandal sniffed out the purest source of mithral: the heart of Imix. With the aid of the other gnome gods, he stole the heart and turned it into a mithral forge that now burns with an eternal furious flame.": "侏儒们讲述的弗兰达尔-钢皮的故事通常都是关于他制作的一些完美的物品，或者是由于他巨大的鼻子而导致的不幸事件，他的鼻子能比狼闻到臭鼬的气味更容易闻到矿石。最常说的弗兰德的传说包括这两个因素。在制造Garl的神奇斧头Arumdina之前，Flandal嗅到了最纯正的米塔尔石来源：Imix的心脏。在其他地精之神的帮助下，他偷走了那颗心脏，并将它变成了现在燃烧着永恒的愤怒火焰的米塔尔锻造炉。",

	"Instead of bustling about as gnome deities normally do, Gaerdal has a tendency to dig in and hide out, and in many tales Garl finds it difficult to convince her to leave her home to join the others on adventures. Some legends say this reluctance is due in part to an escapade that cost her the loss of her hand. Flandal and Nebelun worked together to replace it with a stronger one made of iron, but her resentment over the mishap lingers.": "在许多故事中，加尔发现很难说服她离开她的家与其他人一起冒险，而不是像地精神灵通常那样熙熙攘攘，加尔有一种挖空心思躲起来的倾向。有些传说说这种不情愿部分是由于一次逃亡使她失去了自己的手。弗兰德和内贝伦一起努力，用一只更强壮的铁制手取代了它，但她对这次事故的怨恨却挥之不去。",

	"A joker and a prankster, Garl Glittergold reminds gnomes that life is to be taken lightly, and that a good laugh will serve them better than a grim attitude.

	"This entity is most often referred to as That Which Lurks, because uttering its real name risks attracting its attention. Its actual form, if it even has one, is unknown; it's most often represented as an ooze-like creature with many tentacles or a purple pupil surrounded by black instead of white. The liquid nature of Ghaunadaur is symbolic of its unpredictable nature, which is what makes attracting its attention so risky. It occasionally rewards its followers with supernatural powers or wealth, but it's equally likely to curse its faithful with hideous torments and afflictions. A subterranean hunter who whispers Ghaunadaur's name might stumble into a forgotten treasure trove, while a devoted priestess who offers long prayers and valuable sacrifices is consumed by a gelatinous cube. The entity's random behavior can be an attraction to drow who lack status and are desperate to achieve it. A small sacrifice and a prayer to That Which Lurks might simply go unnoticed by Ghaunadaur, or it might punish the petitioner, but there is also a chance of receiving a great reward.": "这个实体最常被称为 \"潜伏的东西\"，因为说出它的真实名字有可能引起它的注意。它的实际形态，如果它有的话，也是未知的；它最常被表现为一个有许多触角的渗水生物，或者一个被黑色而不是白色包围的紫色瞳孔。Ghaunadaur的液体性质象征着其不可预测的性质，这也是吸引其注意力的风险所在。它偶尔会用超自然的力量或财富来奖励它的追随者，但它也同样可能用可怕的折磨和苦难来诅咒它的信徒。一个低声念叨豪纳杜尔名字的地下猎人可能会偶然发现一个被遗忘的宝库，而一个虔诚的女祭司提供了漫长的祈祷和宝贵的祭品，却被一个胶状的立方体所吞噬。这个实体的随机行为可以吸引那些缺乏地位又急于求成的乌鸦。一个小小的祭品和对 \"潜伏之物 \"的祈祷可能会被豪纳杜尔忽略，或者它可能会惩罚请愿者，但也有机会获得巨大的回报。",

	"Those who are faithful to Lolth often oppose Ghaunadaur's cultists, driving them into hiding or forcing them into open conflict. Some priestesses and scholars believe that this enmity exists because Ghaunadaur betrayed Lolth shortly after she betrayed Corellon. In these legends, Ghaunadaur tried to curry favor with Corellon and recapture his earlier formless nature by turning on Lolth. Ghaunadaur's double act of betrayal brought retribution from both gods, and he was cast down into the world as a skinless, boneless mass. Other stories portray Ghaunadaur as an incredibly ancient and ineffable deity, one of the so-called Great Old Ones. Both claims might have merit, because the truth about the time of the birth of gods can never be known for certain.": "那些忠于洛尔思的人经常反对豪纳杜尔的崇拜者，把他们逼得东躲西藏，或者迫使他们发生公开冲突。一些女祭司和学者认为，这种敌意之所以存在，是因为在洛尔思背叛科瑞隆后不久，高纳多就背叛了她。在这些传说中，Ghaunadaur试图通过背叛Lolth来讨好Corellon，并重新获得他早期的无形本性。豪纳杜尔的双重背叛行为带来了两个神的报复，他被扔到了世界上，成为一个无皮无骨的一团。其他故事将豪纳多描绘成一个难以置信的古老而不可言喻的神灵，即所谓的伟大的老者之一。这两种说法可能都有道理，因为关于神灵诞生时间的真相永远无法确定。",

A traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds.

Wandering priests turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all.": "贡德的祭司们穿着藏红花法衣在北方游荡，装饰着腰带，腰带的褶皱里有齿轮、锁、钩子，以及在紧要关头可能证明有用的钢、锡和木头碎片。他们还戴着由大的、连在一起的金属奖章组成的腰带和巨大的太阳帽。贡德的旅行牧师向远方的村庄提供服务，就像一个工匠、一个木匠和一个土木工程师，随时准备帮助建造一个更好的围场门，挖一口新井，或者修补可能被浪费的锅或家具。贡德的所有牧师都会写日记，记录他们在旅行中发现的想法、发明和创新，并非常乐意与其他牧师会面，分享他们的发现。在大城市里，刚德人建造的寺庙是伟大的工作室和发明家的实验室。漂泊的祭司将他们的日记交给这些寺庙的常驻抄写员，然后他们将祭司们的观察记录下来，供后人参考，使所有人受益。",

These god-touched orcs are revered as living connections to Gruumsh, and are treated with respect even when they are old and infirm.": "少数被格鲁姆什的力量触动的兽人被赋予了终极的荣誉，他们带着神的一小部分压倒性的愤怒进入战斗，以魔法的形式增强他们的武器并帮助部落取得成功。要成为格鲁姆什的眼睛，被格鲁姆什选中的兽人必须挖出自己的一只眼睛以示虔诚，牺牲一半的凡人视觉来换取神力。这些被神触摸过的兽人被尊为与格鲁姆什的活生生的联系，即使他们年老体弱也会受到尊重。",
	"Orcs believe that if they die with honor, their spirits go to the plane of Acheron, the Infinite Battlefield-specifically the layer of Nishrek, where they join Gruumsh's army and fight on his behalf in the endless war against the goblinoid followers of Maglubiyet. Gruumsh sees this conflict as a chance to pit his people against an eager foe and enable them to prove their worth before their deities. He relishes every short-term triumph and swears revenge for every setback.": "兽人相信，如果他们光荣地死去，他们的灵魂就会到阿克伦位面，即无限战场--特别是尼什雷克层，在那里他们会加入格鲁姆什的军队，代表他在与马格鲁比耶特的妖精信徒的无尽战争中作战。格鲁姆什把这场冲突看作是让他的人民对抗一个急切的敌人的机会，使他们能够在他们的神灵面前证明自己的价值。他乐于看到每一次短期的胜利，并发誓要为每一次挫折进行报复。",
	"Luthic, though, takes a longer view. She understands the cosmic implications of Maglubiyet's attacks. To prevent the goblinoids from outstripping her people in population, she urges the orcs to have many offspring and teach them the ways of battle not only for survival in the material world, but to keep Maglubiyet at bay in the conflict on the planes. Her children will remain in her care, and if need be she wouldn't hesitate to take to the field herself and claw Maglubiyet's beady eyes from his face to prevent him from taking them from her.": "不过，Luthic看得比较远。她了解马格鲁比耶特的攻击所带来的宇宙影响。为了防止地精族在人口上超过她的族人，她敦促兽人生育许多后代，并教导他们战斗的方法，不仅是为了在物质世界中生存，而且是为了在平面冲突中阻止马格鲁比耶特。她的孩子们将继续由她照顾，如果需要的话，她会毫不犹豫地亲自上阵，把马格鲁比耶特那双炯炯有神的眼睛从他脸上抓下来，以防止他把孩子们从她身边夺走。",
	"The cosmic battle between the two pantheons has raged for eons without resolution, leading those who study its ebb and flow to expect the stalemate to continue. A different view is put forth by the archmage Tzunk, who notes that Maglubiyet has never faced a foe as ferocious and protective as Luthic. He predicts that the war will end with Luthic the only deity standing, as the cave mother ascends to rule her warrior children.": "两个万神殿之间的宇宙之战已经持续了数个世纪而没有解决，导致那些研究其起伏的人预计僵局将继续下去。大法师Tzunk提出了不同的观点，他指出马格鲁比耶特从来没有面对过像卢斯克这样凶猛和保护性的敌人。他预言，战争结束时，Luthic将是唯一屹立不倒的神灵，因为洞穴中的母亲会升起，统治她的战士子女。",
	"Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger, the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and orcs. He is said to look like an old man with a long white beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar.": "除了北方的游骑兵外，很少有人向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦祈祷。据说格瓦隆是被米利基提升为神的凡人，他作为游骑兵与米利基的中间人为他们服务。他被视为一个游侠大师，完美的追踪者，无以伦比的动物管理人，以及巨魔和兽人等贪婪生物的忠实敌人。据说他看起来像一个长着白色胡须的老人，但仍然精神矍铄，据说他在特里波尔附近的树丛中休息和睡觉。",
	"Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents much of the work they do, and because he can speak to Mielikki on their behalf. In the North, most rangers view Mielikki as too mysterious, holy, and wild to be addressed directly with their requests, but they consider Gwaeron Windstrom to be one of them and thus understanding of their needs.": "游骑兵向格瓦隆祈祷，因为他代表了他们所做的大部分工作，也因为他能代表他们向米利基说话。在北方，大多数游骑兵认为Mielikki太过神秘、神圣和野性，无法直接向他们提出要求，但他们认为Gwaeron Windstrom是他们中的一员，因此理解他们的需求。",
	"Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to him can be found in many places that serve wilderness wanderers as trail markers. Each one is denoted by a carving of Gwaeron's symbol, a paw print with a star on the palm, on a prominent tree or stone.": "格瓦隆没有寺庙，但在许多地方都能找到供奉他的神龛，作为荒野流浪者的足迹标志。每一个神龛都有一个格瓦隆的标志，即在一棵突出的树或石头上雕刻一个手掌上有一颗星的爪印，以此来表示。",
	"Hanali is the elven god of beauty and love. Usually depicted as a beautiful female, in some stories the god appears to mortals as a gorgeous male. Hanali's gender in a story seldom matters, for no matter how much heartache and confusion the stories contain, they end with affairs of the heart properly sorted out and everyone in love with the person, or persons, they were fated to be with. Stories of Hanali's romantic adventures among elves and other mortals are perennial favorites when sung by elf bards and poets.": "哈纳里是精灵族的美神和爱神。通常被描绘成一个美丽的女性，在一些故事中，该神以一个华丽的男性出现在凡人面前。哈纳里在故事中的性别并不重要，因为无论故事中包含多少心痛和困惑，它们的结局都是心事得到妥善解决，每个人都爱上了他们命中注定要在一起的那个人。哈纳利在精灵和其他凡人中的浪漫冒险故事，在精灵吟游诗人的歌声中，常年受到欢迎。",
	"In Arvandor, Hanali maintains a hidden pool called Evergold. She bathes in it at least once a day. It's said that the water of Evergold keeps her young and breathtakingly beautiful, but this is certainly a poetic myth, since all the Seldarine appear young and beautiful, with or without having bathed in this fountain. Mortal elves who are invited to join Hanali in the pool are said to retain their youthfulness and to delay the onset of Transcendence by at least a century. More than a few elves claim to have experienced this benefit, and the truth of it is attested by many bards-sometimes in all earnestness, sometimes with a knowing wink.": "在Arvandor，Hanali维护着一个名为Evergold的隐蔽水池。她每天至少要在里面洗澡一次。据说恒金之水使她保持年轻和惊人的美丽，但这肯定是一个诗意的神话，因为所有的塞尔达林都显得年轻和美丽，不管有没有在这个喷泉里洗过澡。被邀请加入哈娜莉池中的凡人精灵据说可以保留他们的青春，并将超脱的时间至少推迟一个世纪。不止几个精灵声称体验过这种好处，而且许多吟游诗人都证明了这一事实--有时是真诚的，有时是有意的眨眼。",
	"Priests of Hanali perform weddings between elves and preside over most other family-related ceremonies. Other than nuptials and a spate of spring celebrations, the priests conduct few observances.": "哈纳利的祭司为精灵们举行婚礼，并主持其他大多数与家庭有关的仪式。除了婚礼和一连串的春季庆祝活动，祭司们几乎不举行任何仪式。",
	" Those who worship Hanali Celanil build shrines in her honor around natural pools of clear spring water-a representation of the purity and power of Evergold. Her priests often surround such an area with flowers or arrange stones in a way that accentuates the natural beauty of the place. In a shrine dedicated to the worship of several elven deities, an alabaster bowl of water, usually with yellow flowers or petals floating in it, is left in reverence to Hanali.": " 那些崇拜哈纳利-塞拉尼尔的人为了纪念她，在天然的清澈泉水池周围建立了神龛--代表着恒金的纯洁和力量。她的祭司们常常用鲜花围绕着这样的地方，或者用石头排列，以突出这里的自然之美。在专门供奉几位精灵神灵的神殿中，会留下一个雪花膏水碗，里面通常漂浮着黄色的花朵或花瓣，以示对哈娜莉的敬意。",
	"Hanali's pool is a symbol of rejuvenation, and its water has significance as well in representing the ever-flowing force of love. To Hanali's followers, love is a living thing that flows like a river, moving around obstacles with ease, and, if it must, carving a path through bedrock to reach the sea of unity where all love gathers to become one with the cosmos. As one would navigate a river, the faithful of Hanali are known for following their hearts, unwilling to deviate from the pursuit of ultimate beauty.": "哈纳利的池子是恢复活力的象征，它的水也有意义，代表着不断流动的爱的力量。对哈纳利的信徒来说，爱是一种活生生的东西，它像河流一样流淌，轻松地绕过障碍物，如果必须这样做的话，还可以在基岩上开辟出一条道路，到达团结之海，所有的爱都聚集在那里，与宇宙融为一体。就像人们在河流中航行一样，哈纳利的信徒以追随他们的心而闻名，不愿意偏离对终极美的追求。",
	"Devotees of Hanali Celanil are known for taking the initiative in beautifying their surroundings without asking or expecting others to follow suit. If a shrine to the gods is beginning to look somewhat untidy, her followers will straighten things up, bring fresh flowers, and refresh offerings of food, water, and wine. Especially vigilant individuals might even decide to clean up after others who carelessly spill a drink in a tavern or leave their dinner table in a slovenly condition, all in humble service to their god.": "哈纳利-塞拉尼尔的信徒以主动美化周围环境而闻名，而不要求或期望他人效仿。如果一个神龛开始显得有些不整洁，她的追随者会把东西整理好，带来新鲜的花，并重新提供食物、水和酒。特别警惕的人甚至会决定为那些在酒馆里不小心打翻了酒的人打扫卫生，或者让他们的餐桌处于邋遢的状态，这都是对他们的神的谦卑服务。",
	"Heliod is the radiant god of the sun. According to myth, he ensures that the sun rises every day to provide light and warmth to the world. Every inhabitant of Theros acknowledges his dominant presence, and nearly everyone at least pays lip service to the idea of giving him worship and honor.": "赫利奥德是光芒四射的太阳神。根据神话，他确保太阳每天都会升起，为世界提供光明和温暖。泰罗斯的每个居民都承认他的主导地位，几乎每个人都至少在口头上表示要给予他崇拜和尊敬。",
	"Pride and self-assurance radiate from Heliod as light floods from the sun. He is cheerful and sociable, enjoying the company of others and forming bonds easily. His friendship can be as easily lost, though, turning him from ally to enemy as the consequence of a single misstep or perceived betrayal.": "骄傲和自信从赫利奥德身上散发出来，就像太阳发出的光芒。他性格开朗，善于交际，喜欢与人交往，很容易建立起联系。不过，他的友谊也很容易失去，因为一个错误的举动或被认为是背叛的结果，他就会从盟友变成敌人。",
	"Heliod has appeared to mortals in a variety of forms, but he prefers the appearance of a sun-bronzed male human in his forties, dressed in a flowing tunic of golden cloth. His profile is noble, highlighted by a strong chin and a short beard, and he boasts the broad chest of a perfectly fit athlete. His hair is glossy black, and his head is crowned with a golden wreath. He is also fond of appearing as a brilliant white pegasus or a radiant golden stag. In any guise, he looks lit by the sun, even when he travels across the night sky.": "赫利奥德曾以各种形式出现在凡人面前，但他更喜欢以一个四十多岁、身穿金色布衣的阳光下的男性人类形象出现。他的轮廓是高贵的，突出表现为强壮的下巴和短小的胡须，他拥有一个完全健康的运动员的宽阔胸部。他的头发是光亮的黑色，头上戴着一个金色的花环。他还喜欢以明亮的白色飞马或光芒四射的金色雄鹿的形象出现。在任何情况下，他看起来都被太阳照亮，即使他在夜空中旅行时也是如此。",
	"Heliod personifies the light of day, and by extension, he is associated with many metaphorical aspects of the sun's circuit.": "赫利奥德是白天之光的化身，推而广之，他与太阳回路的许多隐喻有关。",
	"As the sun rises without fail every morning, so Heliod values faithfulness in oaths and bonds. Courtroom testimony and marriage vows are sworn on his name, for he can't tolerate the breaking of a solemn promise. He is the arbiter of morality, virtue, and honor.": "就像太阳每天早上都会准时升起一样，赫利奥德也重视誓言和契约中的忠诚度。法庭上的证词和婚姻誓言都是以他的名义宣誓的，因为他不能容忍违背庄严承诺的行为。他是道德、美德和荣誉的仲裁者。",
	"The sun's nightly descent into darkness symbolizes bravery and self-sacrifice—the willingness to endure the horrors of the dark for the sake of others. Those who protect innocents in his name receive Heliod's favor.": "太阳每晚进入黑暗，象征着勇敢和自我牺牲--愿意为了他人而忍受黑暗的恐怖。那些以他的名义保护无辜者的人都会得到赫利奥德的青睐。",
	"As sunlight casts out darkness, Heliod's justice casts out chaos and lawlessness. He is the god of the laws that govern society and the laws that punish the wicked. He is interested not only in punitive justice, but also in the establishment of fair and equitable relationships among people and gods, in service to the common good. He also takes an interest in the bonds of family—the relationships that tie people most closely to each other.": "正如阳光驱除黑暗一样，赫利奥德的正义驱除了混乱和无法无天的局面。他是管理社会的法律和惩罚恶人的法律的神。他不仅对惩罚性的正义感兴趣，而且还对建立人与人之间、神与神之间的公平和公正关系感兴趣，为共同利益服务。他还对家庭纽带感兴趣--将人与人之间最紧密联系在一起的关系。",
	"In Heliod's mind, he is the ruler of the gods, and he wants merely for his rightful place to be recognized. He imagines Nyx rebuilt as his personal palace, where all can witness him in his glory. He considers himself a kind and beneficent ruler—a benign autocrat, not a tyrant—and he doesn't expect abject servility from anyone, god or mortal. He just wants everyone to defer to his will and carry out his orders. He believes that his decisions are always just and right, and that if his sovereignty were properly respected, there would be peace and order in Nyx and the mortal world alike.": "在赫利奥德的心目中，他是众神的统治者，他只想让自己应有的地位得到承认。他想象Nyx被重建为他的个人宫殿，所有人都能在那里见证他的荣耀。他认为自己是一个仁慈和有益的统治者--一个仁慈的专制者，而不是一个暴君--他并不期望任何人，无论是神还是凡人，都能卑躬屈膝。他只是希望每个人都能服从他的意志，执行他的命令。他相信他的决定总是公正和正确的，如果他的主权得到适当的尊重，尼克斯和凡人世界都会有和平和秩序。",
	"Heliod's repeated attempts to establish himself as the ruler of the pantheon anger Erebos and Purphoros, who both have a degree of the arrogance he demonstrates.": "赫利奥德一再试图将自己确立为万神殿的统治者，这让埃雷伯斯和珀弗罗斯感到愤怒，他们都有一定程度的他所表现出来的傲慢。",
	"Thassa and Nylea, by contrast, aren't bothered by his efforts because they see themselves as being safely outside his reach. He could declare himself the ruler of the pantheon, they reason, but his dictates can't alter the rhythms of the sea and the cycles of nature. Thassa and Nylea will continue as they are, as they always have been, whatever squabbles their brothers might have.": "相比之下，塔萨和奈拉并不为他的努力所困扰，因为他们认为自己已经安全地置身于他的影响之外。他们认为，他可以宣布自己是万神殿的统治者，但他的命令不能改变海洋的节奏和自然的周期。Thassa和Nylea将一如既往地继续下去，不管他们的兄弟有什么争吵。",
	"Ephara, Karametra, and Iroas are closely aligned with Heliod in attitude and philosophy. In some ways, these three gods represent the principles and the abstract nature of Heliod made tangible and concrete through the lives of mortals. Heliod represents a divine, natural, moral law; Ephara gives those laws a concrete manifestation by establishing mortal society in the poleis. Heliod controls the radiant sun that makes the natural world flourish; Karametra brings the interplay of light and nature to life for mortals in the practice of agriculture. And while Heliod stands for justice, Iroas actually fights for it, taking up arms against brutality and injustice in defense of what is good and right.": "埃法拉、卡拉米特拉和伊罗亚斯在态度和哲学上与赫利奥德紧密结合。在某些方面，这三位神代表了赫利奥德的原则和抽象性质，通过凡人的生活使其具体化。Heliod代表了神圣的、自然的、道德的法律；Ephara通过在Poleis建立凡人社会，使这些法律得到了具体的体现。赫利奥德控制着光芒四射的太阳，使自然界繁荣昌盛；卡拉米特拉在农业实践中为凡人带来了光与自然的相互作用。虽然赫利奥德代表着正义，但伊洛亚斯实际上是在为正义而战，拿起武器反对残暴和不公正，以捍卫美好和正确的事物。",
	"Heliod hates and fears Erebos, his dark twin and his shadow. He views the god of the dead as a pathetic liar and coward who wallows in self-pity in his exile.": "赫利奥德憎恨和害怕埃雷伯斯，他的黑暗双胞胎和他的影子。他认为亡灵之神是一个可悲的骗子和懦夫，在流亡中沉浸在自怜中。",
	"Heliod is also plagued by a nagging suspicion that the true ruler of the pantheon is Kruphix, a mysterious being who is capable of sealing the borders between the mortal world and the divine realm of Nyx. Kruphix is perhaps the only being who can impose limits on the other gods' actions, which makes Heliod resent and fear the god of horizons.": "Heliod还被一个令人不安的怀疑所困扰，即万神殿的真正统治者是Kruphix，一个能够封住凡人世界和Nyx神界边界的神秘存在。Kruphix也许是唯一能够对其他神明的行为施加限制的存在，这使得Heliod对地平线之神感到不满和恐惧。",
	"The brilliance of Heliod's sun is impossible to ignore. Thus, virtually everyone on Theros pays at least grudging respect to the sun god in forms of worship that range from simple gestures to days-long celebrations.": "赫利奥德的太阳的光辉是无法忽视的。因此，Theros上的每个人都对太阳神至少表示了勉强的敬意，其崇拜形式从简单的手势到长达数天的庆祝活动不等。",
	"Some families, particularly in the polis of Meletis, follow a practice of bowing in the direction of dawn's first light—or winking, in a gesture of respect for the sun god's luminous \"eye.\" More dedicated worshipers offer short litanies at dawn, noon, and dusk, acknowledging the sun's passage across the sky.": "一些家庭，特别是在梅里提斯（Meletis）地区，遵循着向黎明第一道光的方向鞠躬的习俗，或者眨眼，以示对太阳神发光的 \"眼睛 \"的尊重。更虔诚的崇拜者在黎明、中午和黄昏时提供简短的礼仪，承认太阳穿过天空。",
	"Many legends about Heliod highlight his mercurial nature, even while acclaiming him as a god of bravery and justice.": "许多关于赫利奥德的传说都强调了他的重情重义，甚至将他誉为勇敢和正义之神。",
	"In his desire to establish himself as the leader of the pantheon, Heliod attempted to commission Purphoros to rebuild Nyx in Heliod's image. Angered by Heliod's claim to rulership, Purphoros forged the sword Godsend to fight Heliod. As their conflict raged, Purphoros's sword cut the fabric of Nyx, opening the boundary between the realms of gods and mortals. As a result, the hydra Polukranos fell to the mortal world, but Heliod and Nylea joined forces to bind the hydra in the Nessian Wood. Years later, the hydra broke free of its bonds, and Heliod chose a mortal, Elspeth Tirel, to slay the hydra as his champion—using a spear called Godsend, forged from Purphoros's sword.": "为了确立自己作为万神殿领袖的地位，Heliod试图委托Purphoros按照Heliod的形象重建Nyx。珀弗洛斯被赫利奥德的统治要求所激怒，他铸造了一把剑Godsend来对抗赫利奥德。在他们的冲突中，Purphoros的剑切断了Nyx的结构，打开了众神和凡人领域之间的界限。结果，九头蛇Polukranos落入凡间，但赫利奥德和奈拉联手将九头蛇束缚在奈斯森林中。多年后，九头蛇挣脱了束缚，赫利奥德选择了一个凡人，埃尔斯珀特-蒂雷尔，作为他的冠军杀死了九头蛇--使用的是一把名为Godsend的长矛，由珀尔福罗斯的剑铸成。",
	"Some myths claim that Heliod was the first of the gods, though most people believe that distinction belongs to Kruphix. These myths also say that when the light of Heliod's own sun fell on him, Heliod saw his shadow and feared it. He banished the shadow to the land beyond the Rivers That Ring the World, and it became Erebos, god of the dead and ruler of the Underworld.": "一些神话声称赫利奥德是众神之首，尽管大多数人认为这一殊荣属于克鲁普希克斯。这些神话还说，当赫利奥德自己的太阳光落在他身上时，赫利奥德看到了自己的影子，并对它感到恐惧。他把这个影子放逐到环游世界的河流之外的土地上，这个影子变成了死神和冥界的统治者埃雷伯斯。",
	"When a herder boasted that his cattle were the finest in Theros because Heliod and Nylea had created them, the gods grew angry at this falsehood. Heliod persuaded Mogis to curse the cattle, transforming them into the first catoblepases. As a result, many animal breeders prove excessively modest to this day, with humble-boasts being common and well understood among both buyers and sellers. Livestock that are \"as Heliod intended\" or \"praiseless beasts\" might be considered second to none.": "当一个牧民吹嘘他的牛是特洛斯最好的牛，因为是赫利奥德和奈拉创造了它们，众神对这种虚假的说法感到愤怒。Heliod劝说Mogis诅咒这些牛，把它们变成了第一批catoblepases。因此，许多动物饲养者至今仍被证明是过分谦虚的，谦虚的自夸在买卖双方中都很常见，也很好理解。那些 \"如赫利奥德所愿 \"或 \"无赞美之物 \"的牲畜可能被认为是首屈一指的。",
	"After a life in Heliod's service, the aged oracle Solsemon departed on a final pilgrimage: setting forth to visit the sun. Day after day he journeyed east, seeking the lands from which the sun rose. He journeyed far and was mocked everywhere people learned of his quest. Worse, his sight grew ever weaker as he spent days staring at the sun. Yet still he traveled on. Even when blindness claimed Solsemon's sight, the oracle continued undaunted. Finally, one day, Solsemon found a warm, calm place. There, a powerful voice he'd heard in his dreams welcomed him to his journey's end. Praising Heliod, the oracle took his rest, and after several long, contented hours, peacefully died. Ever since, the tale of Solsemon has been argued as both a parable of determination and a warning not to pursue that which is divine.": "在为赫利奥德服务了一生之后，年迈的神谕者索尔塞蒙开始了最后的朝圣之旅：出发去拜访太阳。日复一日，他向东行进，寻找太阳升起的地方。他走得很远，到处都有人知道他的追求，却被嘲笑。更糟的是，他的视力越来越弱，因为他成天盯着太阳。但他仍然继续旅行。即使失明夺走了索尔塞蒙的视力，神谕者也毫不畏惧地继续前进。终于有一天，索尔塞蒙找到了一个温暖、平静的地方。在那里，他在梦中听到的一个强有力的声音欢迎他来到旅程的终点。在赞美赫利奥德的同时，神谕者开始休息，经过几个漫长而满足的小时后，平静地死去。从那时起，索尔塞蒙的故事就被认为既是一个关于决心的寓言，也是一个关于不要追求神圣事物的警告。",
	"Heliod wields the spear {@item Khrusor, Spear of Heliod|MOT|Khrusor}, which can strike any point on Theros, even in the depths of the Underworld. One tale describes how a wrathful Heliod used his spear to smite a human polis whose people angered him with their hubris: the entire city of Olantin sunk beneath the sea when Heliod struck it with his spear.": "Heliod挥舞着长矛（%0%），可以攻击Theros的任何一点，甚至是冥界的深处。有一个故事描述了愤怒的赫利奥德如何用他的长矛击打一个人类的政体，这个政体的人民因傲慢而激怒了他：当赫利奥德用他的长矛击打奥兰丁时，整个城市沉入了海底。",

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.": "作为赫利奥德的信徒，你已经证明自己是太阳神当之无愧的冠军。你可以呼唤赫利奥德的恩惠，用这个特性施展（%0%），不需要任何物质成分。赫利奥德的祝福在受影响的生物周围表现为一团云雾，使它们在5英尺的范围内散发出昏暗的光，直到咒语结束。你可以用这种方式施法，次数等于你的智慧修正值（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。智慧是你对这个法术的施法能力。",
	"You can cast {@spell daylight} with this trait. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.": "你可以用这个特质施展（%0%）。一旦你以这种方式施法，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。智慧是你对这个法术的施法能力。",
	"You grow accustomed to the blazing radiance of the sun; you have advantage on saving throws against being {@condition blinded}, and you have resistance to fire damage.": "你渐渐习惯了太阳的炽热光芒；你对自己的救赎有优势（%0%），并且对火的伤害有抵抗力。",

	"The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He is venerated by those who need to remain watchful for enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people who make a living by protecting someone or something, such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a treasury vault.": "赫尔姆是警戒和保护之神，被视为守护者、观察者和卫士的缩影。他被那些需要对敌人或危险保持警惕的人所敬仰。赫尔姆是那些以保护某人或某物为生的人最喜欢的神，如保镖、城市守望者和金库的守卫。",
	"Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard to good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate were found.": "赫尔姆体现了不分善恶的守望精神。在传说中，他是可敬的，并在一定程度上遵守自己的诺言，比如在动乱时期，他守护着天梯，阻止众神登上天梯，延续了那个时期的混乱局面，直到找到命运之片。",
	"Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent events have borne out that assertion.": "虽然他的信仰经历了黑暗的日子，但对赫尔姆的崇拜从未真正消退。他的大多数追随者认为，守望者永远不可能被彻底征服，最近的事件也证明了这一说法。",
	"Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert, clear-headed, and true to their word. These traits don't necessarily make them nice people, however, and as such many consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and merciless.": "赫尔姆的牧师们教导说，人必须时刻保持警惕，时刻注意，时刻为自己的敌人做好准备。耐心、清晰的思考和周密的计划最终总能打败仓促的行动。赞成赫尔姆的人努力做到警觉、头脑清晰、言行一致。然而，这些特征并不一定使他们成为好人，因此，许多人认为赫尔姆的信徒是不灵活的、无情的。",
	"Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assuran, is a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those who seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate - such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then accidentally slain himself - the hand of Hoar is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.": "胡尔，在内海沿岸的土地上被称为阿苏兰，是一个复仇和报应之神。他通常不会被习惯性地崇拜，但他的名字会被那些寻求复仇的人所援引。当有罪的一方成为命运的猎物时--比如当一个杀人犯逃脱起诉，但自己却意外被杀时--胡尔的手就会被归功。当人们连续听到三声雷鸣时，人们认为这是胡尔的征兆，表明某种复仇行为已经完成。许多人类社会都有这样的习俗：当对犯罪作出判决或执行死刑时，要敲响钟或锣三次。",
	"Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's generally believed that the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.": "当人们想要报仇的时候，特别是当他们没有能力报仇的时候，就会说出胡尔的名字。这种召唤可能是为了回应一个小的轻视或真正的不公正，对胡尔的承认可能是一个简短的祈祷，大声说出来或可能写在某个地方。人们普遍认为，祈祷的形式越是永久，就越有可能实现。出于这个原因，有些人把他们的祈祷词刻在铅上并埋起来，或者把他们的祈祷词藏在日记本里。除了赏金猎人和那些复仇的十字军，很少有人真正崇敬霍尔，而自称是牧师的人就更少。除了Chessenta和Unther的古老遗址外，霍尔的寺庙或神龛几乎不存在。",
	"Hoar became a member of the Faerûnian pantheon when his worship extended beyond the lands that originally revered him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jailor or a headsman is more likely to pray to Hoar.": "当胡尔成为法鲁尼亚万神殿的一员时，他的崇拜已经超出了最初敬仰他的土地。大多数人认为泰尔是法律的仲裁者，而胡尔则是对违反这些法规的人进行惩罚的神。法官可能倾向于崇拜泰尔，而狱卒或头人则更倾向于向胡尔祈祷。",
	"Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated.": "伊尔马特是苦难、殉道和坚忍之神，因其慈悲和忍耐而闻名。他为那些处于痛苦、受害或极度需要的人提供救助和安抚的话语。他是心甘情愿的受难者，是代替他人承担他人的负担，承受他人的痛苦的人。他是被压迫者和被不公正对待者的神。",
	"It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would take all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to spare others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure on others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed by Ilmater with a final rest and reward in the god's afterlife, should they so choose.": "据说，如果他有办法的话，哭神会把世界上所有的苦难都揽到自己身上，这样就可以免除别人的痛苦。既然他不能这样做，他就祝福那些为他人忍受痛苦的人，并且在他能做到的时候减轻痛苦。为他人生存而牺牲的殉道者总是受到伊尔马特的祝福，在神的来世得到最后的休息和奖赏，如果他们选择这样做的话。",
	"Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the injured, and his temples give most of what they receive to help offset the suffering of the world. His followers provide succor when they can, but also use force to put an end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater's priests travel to places where the worst possible conditions exist, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the deceased, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing of all they have, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of the material body.": "伊尔马特的牧师收留病人、饥饿者和受伤者，他的寺庙将他们收到的大部分东西用于帮助抵消世界的痛苦。他的追随者在可能的情况下提供救助，但也使用武力来结束对他人的折磨和痛苦。伊尔马特的牧师们前往条件最恶劣的地方，为受压迫者、死者和穷人的需要提供服务。他们把别人放在自己前面，分享他们所拥有的一切，并强调生命的精神本质而不是物质身体的福利。",
	"Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others can be recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse fur worn against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such priests as they go about their duties, such as when they administer to the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is so strongly felt among humans that other races respect the custom. Even orcs and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to their fallen warriors as well.": "伊尔马特的祭司们在执行援助他人的任务时，可以通过他们的毛衣来识别，毛衣是用粗糙的毛皮穿在裸露的皮肤上的背心。伤害这些牧师是禁忌，因为他们要履行自己的职责，例如在战场上为伤员提供治疗。这种禁忌在人类中是如此强烈，以至于其他种族也尊重这种习俗。即使是兽人和地精也会避免直接攻击和平的伊尔马特祭司，只要该祭司也为他们死去的战士进行治疗。",
	"Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice of Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where they can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed into action.": "大多数人对伊尔马特信仰的工作和牺牲深表敬意，并在力所能及的范围内为这种努力提供援助。当伊尔马特的寺庙派其信徒去帮助战争难民或瘟疫受害者时，他们愿意牺牲自己的福祉，总是促使普通人支持他们，无论他们是受到鼓舞还是被羞辱而采取行动。",
	"Ilneval is the loyal right hand of Gruumsh. He is the god who plans the attacks and devises the strategies that allow the forces of Gruumsh to dominate the battle and fill their war wagons with plunder and severed heads. Ilneval stands with his bloody sword, calling to those who understand the ebb and flow of combat to sit around his council fire and learn the ways of warfare.": "伊尔内瓦尔是格鲁姆什的忠实右手。他是策划攻击和制定战略的神，使格鲁姆什的部队能够在战斗中占优势，并在战车上装满掠夺物和断头。伊尔内瓦尔拿着他那把血淋淋的剑站在那里，呼唤那些了解战斗的起伏的人坐在他的议会火堆旁，学习战争的方法。",
	"Orcs that show aptitude for the nuances of warfare at an early age are considered chosen by Ilneval and are groomed to serve as blades of Ilneval. These individuals are battle captains that follow the orders of the tribe's chief, leading a portion of the tribe's warriors into the thick of battle and bringing a measure of strategy to the assault. Blades of Ilneval are fearsome opponents, seeming to have an uncanny sense of when to move and when to strike, able to exploit the weakness of their enemy like a pack of hungry wolves.": "兽人如果在很小的时候就表现出对战争的细微差别的能力，就会被认为是被伊尔内瓦尔选中，并被培养成伊尔内瓦尔的刀兵。这些人是战斗队长，听从部落首领的命令，带领部落的一部分战士投入战斗，并为攻击带来一定的策略。伊尔内瓦尔之刃是可怕的对手，似乎对何时行动、何时出击有一种不可思议的感觉，能够像一群饿狼一样利用敌人的弱点。",
	"Revered by seers, sages, and teachers of all walks of life, Ioun guided the growth of civilization throughout the Age of Arcanum like sunlight guides the branches of a tree. Grievously wounded by the Chained Oblivion during the Calamity, her followers are now hunted by agents of her ancient foes as she recovers. Her devout now worship in private, spreading knowledge, philosophy, and lore anonymously through traceless channels.": "伊恩受到先贤、圣人和各行各业的老师的尊敬，她引导着整个阿卡诺姆时代的文明发展，就像阳光引导树枝一样。她的追随者们在灾难期间被锁链式遗忘所伤，在她恢复期间被她古老的敌人的代理人所追捕。她的信徒现在在私下里崇拜，通过无迹可寻的渠道匿名传播知识、哲学和传说。",
	"Ioun sits among the infinite library that fills the hidden realm of the Endless Athenaeum, her celestial servants cataloging all known things as she inspires those who pray for her insight and guidance.": "伊翁坐在充满无尽雅典娜的隐秘领域的无限图书馆中，她的天体仆人对所有已知的事物进行编目，她激励那些祈祷她的洞察力和指导的人。",
	"Common representations show the Knowing Mentor as a graying, mature woman with a welcoming, matronly smile, swathed in billowing robes and scarves that fan into books and scrolls. Some colloquially refer to Ioun as the Knowing Mistress, revering her as a headmistress of knowledge among the gods.": "常见的表现形式显示，知识导师是一位白发苍苍的成熟女性，带着热情洋溢的母性微笑，身着宽大的长袍和围巾，将书本和卷轴扇成扇形。有些人把伊欧恩俗称为 \"知识导师\"，把她尊称为众神中的知识总管。",
	"Ioun has no public holy day, for her public worship was shattered during the Calamity, and she has since fallen into half-remembered myth. Only in the monasteries of the Cobalt Soul has the Knowing Mentor's faith been resurrected—though her worship by the intellectuals of the city bears little resemblance to that of the knowledge-seekers of old.": "伊欧恩没有公开的圣日，因为她的公开崇拜在灾难中被打破了，她从此陷入了半生不熟的神话。只有在钴魂的修道院里，\"知识导师 \"的信仰才得以复活--尽管城市里的知识分子对她的崇拜与古代知识寻求者的崇拜没有什么相似之处。",
	"Unmask those who would destroy Ioun. Learn their secrets and unveil them to the world.": "揭开那些要摧毁Ioun的人的面具。了解他们的秘密，向世界揭开他们的面纱。",
	"Uphold and teach the importance of reason, perception, and truth in guiding one's emotions and path.": "坚持并教导理性、感知和真理在指导人的情感和道路上的重要性。",
	"Condemn those who lie without moral cause, for evil folk gain power when their followers obscure the truth. Never stoop to the level of selfish liars.": "谴责那些没有道德原因而撒谎的人，因为邪恶的人在他们的追随者掩盖真相时获得权力。永远不要屈从于自私的骗子的水平。",
	"Iroas is the steadfast god of honor and victory in war. When soldiers march to battle, his voice is the thunder of their footsteps and the crash of spear on shield. Soldiers, mercenaries, and athletes all pray for Iroas's favor in securing victory. Common folk pray to Iroas for courage and fortitude in times of struggle, for his is the battle nobly fought and won.": "伊洛亚斯是坚定的荣誉和战争胜利之神。当士兵们走向战场时，他的声音就是他们的脚步声和长矛对盾牌的撞击声。士兵、雇佣兵和运动员都祈求伊洛亚斯的青睐，以确保胜利。普通人向伊洛亚斯祈祷，希望在斗争中获得勇气和毅力，因为他的战斗是高尚的，是胜利的。",
	"Bold and confident with a soldier's demeanor, Iroas is the pinnacle of martial pride and bearing. He is stoic almost to a fault, but also exhibits a wry sense of humor. Those who honorably shed blood in Iroas's name can count on his support. Cowards and oath breakers are to be despised, and traitors don't deserve mercy in battle.": "伊洛亚斯大胆而自信，具有军人的风范，是武者的骄傲和气度的巅峰。他几乎是坚忍不拔的，但也表现出一种狡猾的幽默感。那些以伊洛亚斯的名义光荣地流血的人可以得到他的支持。懦夫和违背誓言的人是要被鄙视的，叛徒在战斗中不值得怜悯。",
	"Iroas most often appears as a powerfully built centaur with a bull's body rather than a horse's, clad in gleaming armor and wielding a spear and shield. He speaks in a booming baritone that projects power, confidence, and courage. He has been known to appear as a burly soldier or a mighty bull before his followers. Whatever form he chooses, Iroas carries himself with precision and majesty at all times and doesn't tolerate disrespect or undue informality from those who would deal with him.": "伊洛亚斯最常出现的样子是一个身材强壮的半人马，有着牛的身体而不是马的身体，身穿闪亮的盔甲，挥舞着长矛和盾牌。他用洪亮的男中音说话，表现出力量、自信和勇气。众所周知，他曾以一个魁梧的士兵或一头强大的公牛出现在他的追随者面前。无论他选择什么形式，伊洛亚斯总是以精确和威严的方式来对待自己，并且不容忍那些与他打交道的人的不尊重或不适当的非正式行为。",
	"Iroas personifies the glory of victory, honorable combat, and physical competition. He is the unspoken bond between soldiers on the eve of battle, the courage of the standard bearer holding colors aloft in the midst of battle, and the exultation that comes after a hard-won victory. Iroas pushes his followers to excel in their chosen fields, particularly war and athletics, and gain honor through superior skill, training, and dedication.": "伊洛亚斯是胜利的荣耀、光荣的战斗和身体竞争的化身。他是战斗前夕士兵之间的无言纽带，是战斗中高举旗帜的旗手的勇气，是来之不易的胜利后的欣喜若狂。伊洛亚斯推动他的追随者在他们所选择的领域，特别是战争和竞技方面取得优异成绩，并通过卓越的技能、训练和奉献获得荣誉。",
	"War is, fundamentally, a terrible experience filled with pain, loss, and fear. Unfortunately, as Iroas sees it, war is also necessary. He sees preparing for and winning life's essential battles as being of paramount importance and the highest calling one can experience.": "从根本上说，战争是一种可怕的经历，充满了痛苦、损失和恐惧。不幸的是，在伊洛亚斯看来，战争也是必要的。他认为准备并赢得生命中的重要战斗是最重要的，也是一个人可以经历的最高召唤。",
	"The true warrior fights with honor, courage, and dedication, and values training, discipline, strength, and {@i esprit de corps}. In Iroas's eyes, nothing is more valuable or honorable than a honed blade wielded by a trained warrior loyal to a just cause. This message is ingrained in the ethos of Akros, the polis that claims him as its patron. His precepts and codes of conduct are incorporated in the civil and military laws of Akros.": "真正的战士以荣誉、勇气和奉献精神战斗，并重视训练、纪律、力量和（%0%）。在伊洛亚斯的眼里，没有什么比一个训练有素的战士挥舞着经过磨练的刀剑，忠于正义的事业更有价值和荣誉。这个信息已经根植于阿克罗斯的精神之中，这个政体声称他是它的守护者。他的戒律和行为准则被纳入阿克罗斯的民事和军事法律中。",
	"Iroas values strength and determination in less deadly pursuits, as well. He believes sports are a fine proxy for war, as just as in a battle, superior skill and strength lead to a victory. What Iroas truly loves is a winner.": "伊洛亚斯在不那么致命的追求中也重视力量和决心。他认为体育是战争的一个很好的替代品，就像在战斗中一样，卓越的技能和力量会带来胜利。伊洛亚斯真正喜欢的是胜利者。",
	"Lastly, Iroas urges his followers to blunt the advances of his brother, Mogis. This directive inevitably means combat, since Iroas knows of no other way to solve problems. Diplomacy isn't an act of cowardice per se, but because it isn't an activity Iroas is prepared to engage in, it isn't something he expects of his followers.": "最后，伊洛亚斯敦促他的追随者阻挡他的兄弟莫吉斯的进攻。这个指令不可避免地意味着战斗，因为伊洛亚斯不知道有什么其他方式来解决问题。外交本身并不是一种懦弱的行为，但因为这不是伊鲁阿斯准备参与的活动，所以他并不期望他的追随者们这样做。",
	"Iroas sees existence as a series of glorious battles to be won by both him and his followers. War is a testing ground from which only the bravest and strongest emerge. Between battles, there are feats of endurance and physical prowess to perform. Iroas exhorts his followers to hone their bodies and minds just as they hone their blades. He is certain that to slacken his vigilance and grow lazy would guarantee his demise at the edge of his brother's blood-soaked axe. Iroas pushes his followers to be ready at all times to meet conflict head-on.": "伊洛亚斯认为生存是一系列光荣的战斗，他和他的追随者都要赢得这些战斗。战争是一个试验场，只有最勇敢和最强大的人才能从中脱颖而出。在战斗间隙，需要进行耐力和体能方面的训练。伊洛亚斯劝告他的追随者磨练他们的身体和思想，就像他们磨练他们的武器一样。他确信，松懈警惕和懒惰会保证他死在他兄弟那把沾满鲜血的斧头边上。伊洛亚斯鼓励他的追随者随时准备好迎战冲突。",
	"Iroas is defined by his opposition to his twin brother, Mogis. Although both love battle, Iroas holds an honorable and valorous view of warfare, whereas Mogis lusts for carnage and butchery. Iroas firmly believes that mortals will always fight, whether in war or in less consequential pursuits. His charge is to ensure that war is waged with a code of honor and to prevent his brother's depravity from spreading through the world.": "伊洛亚斯的特点是与他的孪生兄弟莫吉斯对立。虽然两人都热爱战斗，但伊洛亚斯对战争持有一种光荣和勇敢的看法，而莫吉斯则对屠杀和屠戮充满欲望。伊洛亚斯坚信，凡人总是要战斗的，无论是在战争中还是在不太重要的追求中。他的职责是确保以荣誉为准则发动战争，并防止他哥哥的堕落行为在世界范围内蔓延。",
	"Iroas holds an abiding respect for Purphoros, who girds his warriors in the products of his artifice. Iroas sees finely crafted arms as the highest form of art, sublime and deadly at once. Still, Iroas finds Purphoros's volatile temper and bouts of passion unbecoming of one with such talent at creating weapons of war.": "Iroas对Purphoros抱有持久的敬意，Purphoros用他的工匠产品武装他的战士。伊洛亚斯认为精工制作的武器是最高形式的艺术，既崇高又致命。然而，伊洛亚斯发现珀弗罗斯的脾气不稳定，激情四射，这与他创造战争武器的天赋不相称。",
	"Iroas champions the cause of justice and thus seeks Heliod's guidance and counsel from time to time. During Heliod's piques of arrogance and temper, Iroas is the one who advocates restraint and calm. More often than not, the two deities agree where matters of justice and honor are concerned.": "伊洛亚斯拥护正义事业，因此不时地寻求赫利奥德的指导和建议。在赫利奥德傲慢无礼的时候，伊罗亚斯主张克制和冷静。更多的时候，这两位神明在涉及正义和荣誉的问题上意见一致。",
	"Iroas is interested not in pretty words, but in great deeds. The faithful of Iroas show their piety by comporting themselves well in contests of athleticism or skill. Swearing an oath to win a battle in Iroas's name and failing to do so is a great shame upon a warrior, thus such a promise is never uttered lightly.": "伊洛亚斯对漂亮的语言不感兴趣，而是对伟大的行为感兴趣。伊洛亚斯的信徒们通过在运动或技能竞赛中的良好表现来显示他们的虔诚。以伊鲁阿斯的名义发誓赢得一场战斗，但却没有做到，这对一个战士来说是一种巨大的耻辱，因此，这样的承诺是不会轻易说出口的。",
	"The fifth month of the Meletian calendar is Thriambion, named for an annual commemoration of the Meletian conquest of Natumbria. This victory cemented Meletis's control over the entire peninsula. But in Akros, the month is called Iroagonion, for the Iroan Games. These games are the grandest display to honor Iroas. To even compete in the Iroan Games is considered noteworthy, as the poleis send only their finest athletes. The grand prize, besides a ceremonial wreath, is the opportunity to be visited by Iroas himself.": "梅勒蒂亚历的第五个月是Thriambion，因每年纪念梅勒蒂亚征服纳坦布里亚而命名。这一胜利巩固了梅勒蒂亚对整个半岛的控制。但在阿克罗斯，这个月被称为Iroagonion，因为Iroan运动会。这些运动会是纪念伊洛亚斯的最盛大的展示。即使是参加伊鲁安运动会也被认为是值得注意的，因为各极地只派出他们最好的运动员。最大的奖赏，除了一个仪式性的花圈外，就是有机会被伊鲁阿斯亲自拜访。",
	"The myths told about Iroas's deeds acclaim his valor and bravery as well as his inflexibility and stubbornness. Countless tales tell of him or his champions besting terrible beasts, enemy armies, or threats to the world. Still other stories rise beyond accounts of his victories.": "关于伊鲁阿斯的事迹的神话，赞扬了他的英勇和勇敢，以及他的顽强和固执。无数的故事讲述了他或他的冠军们战胜了可怕的野兽、敌人的军队，或对世界的威胁。还有一些故事是在他的胜利记述之外发生的。",
	"Iroas carries a battle-worn bronze shield called the Bulwark of Brotherhood. It symbolizes the protective bond shared by all soldiers at war and his determination, ironically, to defeat his own brother. In the myth of Rygyra the Slinger, the soldier never missed when she launched stones from her magic sling. Yet, even so, her every shot bounced off the giant minotaur, Raksolcs Ravage-Soul. As the minotaur terror closed in on her, Rygyra whispered a prayer to Iroas and braced her flimsy wooden shield, knowing it would offer no defense against the giant's strikes. Yet, when the blow came, the shield resounded with the barest metallic clang—like a pin falling on bronze. Opening her eyes, Rygyra discovered that her shield had transformed into a gleaming bulwark—Iroas's own shield. Enraged, Raksolcs beat on the shield, leaving not even a dent. After hours of this, the minotaur collapsed, panting and exhausted. Only then did Rygyra emerge and strangle the brute with his own tongue.": "伊洛亚斯带着一面饱经战火的青铜盾牌，名为 \"兄弟之盾\"。它象征着所有士兵在战争中共享的保护性纽带，以及他的决心，讽刺的是，他要打败自己的兄弟。在 \"弹弓手Rygyra \"的神话中，士兵从她的魔法吊索中发射石头时从未失手。然而，即便如此，她的每一次射击都被巨大的牛头人拉克索尔茨-拉瓦格-灵魂弹开。当牛头人的恐怖力量向她逼近时，瑞吉拉低声向伊罗亚斯祈祷，并撑起她脆弱的木质盾牌，知道它无法抵御巨人的攻击。然而，当打击到来时，盾牌响起了最轻微的金属铿锵声，就像一根针落在青铜上。睁开眼睛，Rygyra发现她的盾牌已经变成了一个闪闪发光的公文包--Iroas自己的盾牌。被激怒的拉克索尔茨敲打着盾牌，甚至没有留下一个凹痕。这样持续了几个小时后，牛头人倒下了，气喘吁吁，精疲力竭。直到这时，雷格拉才出现，用他自己的舌头掐死了这个畜生。",
	"Followers of Iroas often push their physical and emotional limits, pursuing victory above all things. Even as priests of Iroas coach their followers to be the best, the most experienced religious leaders—particularly those who have retired from athletic competition—warn of growing addicted to triumph. Ultimately, they teach, only Iroas can drink endlessly from the river of glory and suffer no ill effects. Mortals, though, can grow intoxicated by victory and sickened by unattainable ideas of honor or eternal praise. Therefore, wise competitors are encouraged to seek only their draught of glory—a finite amount that they might revel in but that allows them to experience a life beyond grasping for greatness. Those who don't find themselves upon the path to despair, personal harm, and the temptations of Mogis.": "伊洛亚斯的追随者经常挑战他们的身体和情感极限，追求胜利高于一切。即使伊洛亚斯的牧师们指导他们的追随者成为最优秀的人，最有经验的宗教领袖--特别是那些已经从体育比赛中退役的人--警告说他们会对胜利上瘾。最终，他们教导说，只有伊洛亚斯可以无休止地喝下荣耀之河的水，而不会受到不良影响。然而，凡人可能会沉醉于胜利，并为无法实现的荣誉或永恒的赞美而感到恶心。因此，明智的竞争者被鼓励只寻求他们的荣耀之水--他们可能会陶醉于有限的数量，但这能让他们体验到超越对伟大的抓取的生活。那些不这样做的人发现自己走上了绝望的道路，个人受到伤害，并受到莫吉斯的引诱。",
	"One of the greatest of Iroas's champions, Kalemne is a stone giant sworn to the service of the god of war. A warrior of tremendous strength and tactical skill, she has imposed martial discipline on the most unruly of troops and has led squads of giants and minotaurs to glorious victories. Her devotion to Iroas is absolute, and her commitment to victory is unwavering. Countless petitioners have sought out Kalemne over the years, seeking her aid in righting wrongs or preventing disasters. Though she sympathizes with all who tell her their tragic tales, Kalemne has committed to aiding only those who can defeat her in a contest of athletic skill or a test of speed. Those who do can count on her aid, and possibly that of her troops. Those who can't must seek other answers to their problems.": "卡莱姆是伊洛亚斯最伟大的冠军之一，她是一个发誓要为战神服务的石巨人。她是一个拥有巨大力量和战术技巧的战士，她曾对最不守规矩的部队实施武术纪律，并带领巨人和牛头人的队伍取得了辉煌的胜利。她对伊洛亚斯的奉献是绝对的，她对胜利的承诺是坚定不移的。多年来，无数的请愿者向卡莱姆尼寻求帮助，希望她能纠正错误或防止灾难。尽管她同情所有向她讲述悲惨故事的人，但卡莱姆恩承诺只帮助那些在运动技能竞赛或速度测试中能击败她的人。那些人可以依靠她的帮助，可能还有她的部队。那些不能胜任的人必须寻求其他答案来解决他们的问题。",

	"Iroas has a soft spot in his heart for underdogs, even if they lack the strength to win the fight. It is easier, he believes, to make a hero from a weakling who has a heroic heart than it is to turn a brute into a defender of justice.

	"Why did Iroas seek you out as a champion? Perhaps you proved your courage even when victory eluded your grasp, or you demonstrated a willingness to use your strength for good. Occasionally, Iroas's choice of a champion has as much to do with his enmity toward Mogis as it does with the mortal he chooses; is there some connection between you and the god of slaughter? The Iroas's Favor table offers a few suggestions.": "为什么伊洛亚斯要找你做冠军？也许你证明了你的勇气，即使在你无法掌握胜利的时候，或者你表现出愿意用你的力量来做好事。偶尔，伊洛亚斯对冠军的选择与他对莫吉斯的敌意有很大关系，也与他选择的凡人有关系；你和屠杀之神之间是否有某种联系？伊洛亚斯的青睐表提供了一些建议。",

	"Legend has it that Jergal is an ancient deity. The story goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as the god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing of time, he became bored with his position. Then one day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jergal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him and take his power. Instead, Jergal calmly abdicated his throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, and Bhaal the portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former stature and became a scribe of the dead.": "传说Jergal是一个古老的神灵。故事说，在尼瑟尔时代，他被当作死亡、谋杀和争斗之神来崇拜。然而随着时间的流逝，他对自己的地位感到厌烦。然后有一天，三个凡人，每一个都是强大的冒险家，在亡灵之地遇到了杰格尔，决心摧毁他，夺取他的权力。相反，杰格尔平静地放弃了他的白骨王座，并允许这三个凡人中的每个人都能获得他的一部分神性。就这样，贝恩承担了争斗的职责，米尔库尔承担了亡灵的统治权，而巴尔则承担了谋杀的职责。耶格尔失去了他以前的地位，成了亡灵的抄写员。",
	"Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely acknowledged directly, except for being mentioned at funerals and among those who practice the custom of writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parchment and placing it in the corpse's mouth. This rite is common in places where an individual's grave or tomb isn't marked with the person's name.": "Jergal现在被看作是一个无情的死者监护人。他被认为是记录生者的逝去，并帮助凯勒莫尔看到灵魂被适当地束缚在他们适当的来世。他很少被直接承认，除了在葬礼上被提及，以及在那些实行将死者的名字写在羊皮纸上并放入尸体口中的习俗的人中。这种仪式在个人的坟墓或墓穴没有标明个人姓名的地方很常见。",
	"Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some way. Priests of Jergal serve communities as undertakers and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples dedicated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His faithful send their annual recordings of mortality to holy sites where records of that sort are kept.": "很少有人把耶加勒当作神灵，而大多数人都以某种方式关注死者的分配问题。杰尔加的祭司们作为殡仪馆和墓地的看护人为社区服务。除了专门供奉他的古老而黑暗的化身的废弃场所外，杰加尔没有专门供奉他的庙宇，但他的祭司在凯勒莫、迪内尔和米尔库尔的庙宇中受到欢迎。他的信徒们每年都会把他们的死亡记录送到保存有此类记录的圣地。",
	"Long ago there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge there is nothing - and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.": "很久以前，只有一个掌管纷争、死亡和亡灵的神，他被称为 \"Jergal\"，万物之灵。杰格尔在凡人和神灵之间煽动和滋生不和。当众生为了追求权力或仇恨而互相残杀时，他欢迎他们进入他那阴暗的永恒的黑暗王国。随着万物的消亡，一切最终都归于他，随着时间的推移，他建立了一个没有任何其他神灵可以挑战的王国。但他逐渐厌倦了自己的职责，因为他太了解这些职责了，没有挑战就没有一切--而在虚无中只有阴暗。在这样的状态下，绝对的权力和绝对的无权之间的区别是无法察觉的。",
	"During this dark era arose three powerful mortals - Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul - who lusted after the power Jergal possessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest - the Bone Throne.": "在这个黑暗的时代，出现了三个强大的凡人--贝恩（Bane）、巴尔（Bhaal）和米尔库尔（Myrkul）--他们渴望获得杰格尔拥有的力量。这三个人订立了一个不神圣的协议，他们将获得这种终极力量，否则就会死在这里。他们走遍了世界的各个角落，寻求强大的魔法和法术，并处处不畏死亡。无论他们面对的是什么怪物，也无论他们面对的是什么法术，这三个凡人每次都毫发无伤。最终，三人进入灰色荒原，寻找骨之城堡。他们在骷髅大军、僵尸军团、成群结队的巫师和地衣的包围中战斗。最终，他们到达了他们毕生追求的目标--白骨王座。",
	"\"I claim this throne of evil,\" Bane the tyrant shouted to Jergal.": "\"我要求这个邪恶的宝座，\"暴君班恩对杰格尔喊道。",
	"\"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger,\" threatened Bhaal the assassin.": "\"我会在你举起手指之前摧毁你，\"刺客巴尔威胁道。",
	"\"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,\" promised Myrkul the necromancer.": "\"而我将永远囚禁你的精华，\"死灵法师米尔库尔承诺。",
	"Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, \"The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish - l promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position.\" Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead asked, \"Who among you shall rule?\"": "耶哥从他的宝座上站起来，露出疲惫的表情，说：\"宝座是你的。我已经厌倦了这种空洞的权力。如果你想的话，就拿去吧--我保证作为你的参谋为你服务并指导你，直到你对这个位置感到舒适。\" 然后，在目瞪口呆的三人做出反应之前，亡灵之主问道：\"你们中谁将统治？\"",
	"The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.": "这三个人立即陷入了彼此之间的争斗，而杰格尔则冷眼旁观。当最终看来，要么他们都会因疲惫而死，要么就会永远战斗下去时，万物终结之主进行了干预。",
	"\"After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office by engaging in a game of skill for them?\" asked Jergal.": "\"在你们牺牲了那么多之后，你们会一无所获吗？你为什么不通过为他们搞一场技巧游戏来划分办公室的投资组合呢？\"耶格尔问。",
	"Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed to it. So Jergal took the skulls of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.": "班恩、巴尔和米尔库尔考虑了神的提议并同意了。于是，杰格尔把他的三个最强大的地衣的头骨给了他们三人，这样他们就可以在头骨保龄球比赛中一决高下。每个凡人都将一个头骨滚过灰色荒原，并约定谁打得最远谁就是赢家。",
	"Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would receive all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport had been ruined, but again Jergal intervened. \"Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don't have to share with the Beast?\"": "兽王马拉尔在这个时候赶来拜访杰尔格。在迅速确定比赛的获胜者将获得杰格尔的全部力量后，他追着那三个骷髅头走了，以确保比赛停止，直到他有机会参与其中以获得部分奖励。贝恩、巴哈尔和米尔库尔再次陷入争斗，因为很明显他们的运动已经被破坏了，但杰尔格再次进行干预。\"你为什么不让幸运女神来决定，这样你就不用和野兽分享了？\"",
	"The trio agreed to this alternative, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.": "三人组同意了这个备选方案，杰格尔掰下自己的骷髅指骨，送给了参赛者。当马拉尔追赶骷髅头回来时，发现三人组刚刚结束了一场指骨游戏。",
	"Bane cried out triumphantly, \"As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom.\"": "班恩胜利地喊道：\"作为胜利者，我选择作为最终的暴君来统治所有的永恒。我可以随心所欲地诱发仇恨和纷争，在我的王国里，所有人都会在我面前俯首称臣。\"",
	"Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, \"But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die - even gods.\"": "赢得第二名的米尔库尔宣布：\"但我选择了死人，这样做我就真正赢了，因为你所主宰的一切，贝恩，最终将是我的。所有的东西都必须死--即使是神。\"",
	"Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, \"I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand.\"": "获得第三名的Bhaal宣称：\"我选择死亡，正是通过我的手，班恩大人你所统治的一切，最终将传给Myrkul大人。你们两个人都必须向我表示敬意，并服从我的意愿，因为我可以通过谋杀你的臣民来摧毁你的王国，班恩，而我可以通过留手来饿死你的王国，米尔库尔。\"",

	"Karametra is recognized as the serene, maternal god of the harvest, her arms spread wide as she offers bounty to her worshipers or cradles communities in her embrace. Almost every human settlement contains at least a modest shrine to solicit her favor, and she is closely associated with Setessa, the center of her worship.": "卡拉米特拉被认为是宁静的、母性的丰收之神，她张开双臂，向她的崇拜者提供赏赐，或者将社区搂在怀里。几乎每一个人类定居点都至少有一个适度的神龛，以争取她的青睐，她与塞特萨密切相关，是她的崇拜中心。",
	"Wise and even-tempered, Karametra values community, stability, and the balance of nature. She is the god of maternity, family, orphans, domestication, and agriculture, as well as defense of the home and territory.": "卡拉米特拉智慧而脾气平和，重视社区、稳定和自然的平衡。她是母性、家庭、孤儿、驯化和农业之神，也是保卫家园和领土的神。",
	"Karametra appears to mortals as a motherly figure with hair made of ordered rows of leaves that shroud her eyes from view. She is always shown in art (and often seen in Nyx) seated on her throne, which is formed from a tangle of grape vines growing out of a collection of jugs and amphorae that surround her. An elaborately carved wooden canopy extends above her, and a giant sable—her faithful companion—curls around the base of the throne at her feet. In one hand, she holds a harvester's scythe.": "卡拉米特拉在凡人面前是一个母亲般的形象，她的头发由一排排有序的树叶组成，遮住了她的眼睛。在艺术作品中，她总是坐在她的宝座上（在Nyx中也经常看到），宝座是由围绕着她的一系列水壶和双耳瓶长出的葡萄藤蔓纠结而成的。她的头顶上有一个精心雕刻的木质天幕，一只巨大的紫貂--她忠实的伙伴--在她的脚下围绕着王座的底座。她的一只手拿着一把收割机的镰刀。",
	"Karametra governs nature as it comes into play in the lives of mortals, representing domesticated nature—a bounteous, nurturing provider. But she also reminds mortals that they are part of the natural world; they are animals that eat and digest and reproduce and sleep, and Karametra is influential in all of that, as well.": "卡拉米特拉管理着自然界，因为它在凡人的生活中发挥作用，代表着被驯化的自然界--丰饶的、养育人的提供者。但她也提醒凡人，他们也是自然界的一部分；他们是动物，会吃、会消化、会繁殖、会睡觉，卡拉米特拉在所有这些方面也有影响。",
	"Mortals seek her favor because the fertility of nature is necessary for their existence. It isn't her wrath they fear—she is not a god of storms or plagues—but her withdrawal. Without her, plants, livestock, families, and communities simply fail to thrive. Her goodwill is a bulwark against both physical starvation and starvation of the spirit: despair, loneliness, and moral weakness.": "凡人寻求她的青睐，因为自然界的生育力是他们生存的必要条件。他们害怕的不是她的愤怒--她不是暴风雨或瘟疫之神，而是她的退出。没有她，植物、牲畜、家庭和社区都无法茁壮成长。她的善意是防止身体饥饿和精神饥饿的堡垒：绝望、孤独和道德上的软弱。",
	"Karametra promises that spring will always come again, trees will always bear fruit, and flocks will always bear young. Children will always be born, parents will always care for them and be cared for in their turn. Great fortune or adventure might not be at hand, but the little joys of life—the smell of spring blossoms, the sweetness of ripe fruit, the flaming beauty of autumn leaves, the fellowship of community—can be savored.": "卡拉米特拉承诺，春天总会到来，树木总会结出果实，羊群总会生出小羊。孩子们将永远出生，父母将永远照顾他们，而他们也将得到照顾。伟大的财富或冒险可能不在眼前，但生活中的小乐趣--春暖花开的气息、成熟果实的甘甜、秋叶的火红之美、社区的友爱--都可以品尝到。",
	"In many ways, Karametra represents the essence of the divine relationship with mortals: fertility and protection are the nucleus of the aid mortals have always sought from gods, and Karametra doesn't complicate these basic needs by couching them in terms of abstract ideals of honor or law or justice. She is the distillation of an ancient and primal exchange: mortal devotion in return for divine blessing.": "在许多方面，卡拉米特拉代表了神与凡人关系的本质：生育和保护是凡人一直以来向神寻求帮助的核心，而卡拉米特拉并没有将这些基本需求复杂化，而是用抽象的荣誉、法律或正义的理想来表述。她是一种古老而原始的交换的提炼：凡人的奉献换来了神的祝福。",
	"Karametra doesn't engage in underhanded politicking or petty disputes. She seems to stand above the quarrels and tumultuous rivalries of other deities, and equally aloof from the machinations of the mortal world. Her fundamental concern is for the well-being of mortal folk, starting with their physical health but also including their need for security, love, and belonging.": "卡拉米特拉不参与暗中的政治活动或琐碎的争端。她似乎站在其他神灵的争吵和动荡的竞争之上，同样对凡人世界的阴谋诡计漠不关心。她最关心的是凡人的福祉，首先是他们的身体健康，但也包括他们对安全、爱和归属的需要。",
	"Karametra might not want to wield power over other gods, but her position of detached compassion lends her significant influence to wield as she chooses. The other gods trust her to be impartial in their disputes and honest about her motivations, and they look to her for wisdom and even sometimes comfort.": "卡拉米特拉可能不想对其他神灵行使权力，但她超脱的同情心使她有很大的影响力，可以随意挥洒。其他神灵相信她在争端中不偏不倚，对自己的动机也很诚实，他们向她寻求智慧，有时甚至寻求安慰。",
	"Karametra's closest relationship is with Heliod. He respects her civilized demeanor, and she recognizes the vital role the sun's brilliance plays in nurturing life.": "卡拉米特拉与赫利奥德的关系最为密切。他尊重她的文明举止，而她也认识到太阳的光辉在孕育生命方面的重要作用。",
	"The relationship between Karametra and Nylea is respectful but strained. Nylea is disappointed by Karametra's decision, as a nature deity, to subordinate nature to the needs of mortals. Karametra is frustrated by what she sees as Nylea's refusal to recognize mortal folk—and all their civilizations—as part of the natural world. Despite this tension, both gods encourage their worshipers to leave offerings at each other's shrines.": "卡拉米特拉和奈拉之间的关系是相互尊重但又紧张的。作为自然之神，卡拉米特拉决定让自然服从于凡人的需要，这让奈拉感到失望。卡拉米特拉对奈拉拒绝承认凡人的民俗--以及他们所有的文明--是自然世界的一部分感到沮丧。尽管存在这种紧张关系，两位神灵都鼓励他们的崇拜者在对方的神龛前留下祭品。",
	"The gods who provoke Karametra's sharpest disdain are Iroas and Mogis, who seem devoted to the idea of preventing mortal life from fully flourishing. War—even if it's couched in noble terms, as Iroas's followers like to do—is fundamentally an instrument of death, bringing a premature and pointless end to mortal life. That said, Karametra does recognize the need to fight in defense of one's life, family, and community when they come under attack, so she and Iroas are able to find some common ground in that matter—and in their shared hatred of Mogis.": "引起卡拉米特拉最强烈不满的神灵是伊罗亚斯和莫吉斯，他们似乎致力于阻止凡人的生命充分繁荣的想法。战争--即使像伊鲁阿斯的追随者喜欢用高尚的术语来表达--从根本上说是死亡的工具，给凡人的生活带来了过早和无意义的结束。尽管如此，卡拉米特拉确实认识到，当一个人的生命、家庭和社区受到攻击时，有必要为之战斗，所以她和伊洛亚斯能够在这个问题上找到一些共同点，以及他们对莫吉斯的共同仇恨。",
	"The earth's fertility is essential for mortal life to continue. Those who live in the modern poleis might not be as aware of that fact as those who farm their own food, but even they long for children, know the pinch of hunger, and feel the turn of the seasons.": "地球的肥力对凡人生命的延续至关重要。那些生活在现代极地的人可能不像那些自己耕种食物的人那样意识到这一事实，但即使他们也渴望孩子，知道饥饿的痛苦，并感受到季节的变化。",
	"Prayers to Karametra focus on asserting Karametra's constancy and bounty, praising the god's love and generosity. Worshipers of Karametra gather for a feast once a month, on the evening of the full moon, that celebrates the god's role in parenthood and community. New parents receive gifts and blessings, and young couples sneak away into the woods in hopes of finding sweet berries and sweeter kisses.": "对卡拉米特拉的祈祷着重于宣扬卡拉米特拉的恒久性和恩惠，赞扬神的爱和慷慨。卡拉米特拉的崇拜者每月一次在月圆之夜聚会，庆祝神在父母身份和社区中的作用。新父母会收到礼物和祝福，年轻夫妇会偷偷溜进树林，希望能找到甜美的浆果和更甜美的吻。",
	"Karametra rarely engages in legendary undertakings. It is her unshakable reliability that makes her a popular deity.": "卡拉米特拉很少从事传奇性的工作。正是她不可动摇的可靠性，使她成为一个受欢迎的神灵。",
	"Outside Setessa is a farm that produces incredible fruits and grains that can heal illnesses, increase fertility, and stave off hunger for days. The field is said to be Karametra's tribute to her beloved human priest, Thamuzus, who died there. While many seek the farm, it is said that the vineyard around it is so labyrinthine that few have ever reached its center.": "在塞特萨外面有一个农场，生产令人难以置信的水果和谷物，可以治疗疾病，增加生育能力，并能抵御几天的饥饿。据说这片田地是卡拉米特拉对她心爱的人类牧师塔穆扎斯的纪念，他就死在那里。虽然很多人都在寻找这个农场，但据说它周围的葡萄园是如此迷宫般，很少有人能到达它的中心。",
	"In rare, remote settlements, high summer ceremonies acknowledge ancient rural practices devoted to a less merciful vision of Karametra. These communities offer abundant sacrifices to the god, but also guard their ancient rituals from outsiders, as Karametra's organized clergy harshly forbids discussion of abandoned religious practices. However, occasionally, a centuries-old depiction of the goddess breaks, revealing an ancient icon inside, typically a primitive mud idol of a woman bearing a sheaf of grain in one hand and a skull in the other.": "在罕见的偏远定居点，夏季的高温仪式承认古老的农村习俗，致力于对卡拉麦特拉的不太仁慈的看法。这些社区向神提供丰富的祭品，但也保护他们的古老仪式不被外人所知，因为卡拉米特拉的有组织神职人员严厉禁止讨论被遗弃的宗教习俗。然而，偶尔也会有几百年前的女神形象被打破，露出里面的古老图腾，通常是一个原始的泥巴偶像，一个女人一手拿着谷穗，另一只手拿着头骨。",
	"The fall holiday known as the Blessing of the Beasts (or, in Meletis, the Therimakarion) celebrates humans' partnership with domestic animals. The horses and oxen that pull plows, the cats that guard the granaries, and the roosters that wake families and call them to their work are given blessings, special treats, and a day of rest. Stories say that strays found on this day are servants of Karametra and destined for great things. Others claim that on this day domestic animals can speak—that is, if they have anything they care to say to their supposed owners.": "秋天的节日被称为 \"野兽的祝福\"（或在Meletis，Therimakarion），庆祝人类与家畜的伙伴关系。拉犁的马和牛，看守粮仓的猫，以及叫醒家人并召集他们工作的公鸡，都会得到祝福、特殊待遇和一天的休息。有故事说，在这一天发现的流浪动物是卡拉米特拉的仆人，注定要做大事。还有人声称，在这一天，家畜可以说话，也就是说，如果它们有什么话想对它们的主人说的话。",
	"Although Karametra delights in nature's bounty, she ever strives to tap its greater potential. Her followers recount legends of breeders and horticulturalists who cultivated remarkable new types of plants and animals—such as the everfruit of Dakra or the storied Oraniad dragon-hens. Yet, while Karametra looks on such innovations with delight, some other gods see them as blasphemies.": "虽然卡拉米特拉以大自然的恩赐为乐，但她一直在努力挖掘其更大的潜力。她的追随者们讲述了育种家和园艺家们培育出卓越的新型动植物的传说--比如达克拉的长生果或传说中的奥拉尼亚德龙虾。然而，当卡拉米特拉高兴地看着这些创新时，其他一些神却把它们视为亵渎。",
	"The tales about Karametra don't specify what ignited the god's rage in ancient times, but they do record that for a year, she tore down her own temples and refused to let any plants grow. The mortals of the world, threatened with starvation, beseeched her to curb her wrath. In an effort led by Karametra's priests, nearly all of humanity prayed for a week, neither eating nor sleeping, praising Karametra for her serenity and generosity. After that time, she relented and produced a miraculous crop of grapes that cured illness and fed the people. Ever since then, her statues have been adorned with twining grape vines around their left wrists in commemoration of that event.": "关于卡拉米特拉的故事并没有具体说明是什么在古代点燃了这位神的怒火，但它们确实记录了一年的时间，她拆毁了自己的庙宇，并拒绝让任何植物生长。世界上的凡人受到饥饿的威胁，恳求她遏制自己的怒火。在卡拉米特拉的祭司们的努力下，几乎所有的人都祈祷了一个星期，不吃不睡，赞美卡拉米特拉的宁静和慷慨。在那之后，她松了口气，生产了神奇的葡萄，治好了疾病，也养活了人们。从那时起，她的雕像的左手手腕上都有缠绕的葡萄藤，以纪念这一事件。",

	"Kelemvor is seen as a just, fair, and comforting god of death. Death comes to all, and when it occurs Kelemvor is there to take each soul by the hand and lead it to the proper afterlife.

	"The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They help the dying put their affairs in order, and they officiate at funeral rites for those who can't afford the lavish ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor's faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worshipers define \"untimely\" in different ways. One group might concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another on the prevention of murder, and yet another on eliminating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the undead that they find - an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that aren't evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider holy. Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings regardless of that fact.": "Kelemvor的信众为人们提供和平过渡到亡灵之主的照顾。他们帮助濒临死亡的人把他们的事情安排好，并为那些负担不起他们信仰的奢华仪式的人主持葬礼仪式。凯勒莫的信徒的信条迫使他们尽可能地阻止或防止过早的死亡。不同的教派和崇拜者以不同的方式定义 \"不合时宜\"。一个团体可能专注于阻止疾病的传播，另一个专注于防止谋杀，还有一个专注于消除亡灵的祸害。事实上，所有Kelemvor的信徒都鄙视亡灵，并在某种程度上努力消除它们，因为任何形式的亡灵都被视为对自然秩序的憎恶。这种信仰显然使凯勒莫的信徒与死灵法师、米尔库尔的祭司以及其他提倡创造亡灵的人产生了矛盾，同时也造成了来自意想不到的冲突。例如，凯勒莫的牧师经常销毁他们发现的任何关于创造亡灵的著作--这种行为冒犯了那些为了知识而重视知识的人，比如奥格玛和迪尼尔的信徒。也有一些不邪恶的亡灵存在，比如精灵们认为神圣的baelnorn。凯勒莫的信徒们不顾这一事实，寻求这种生命的终结。",
	"Keptolo shows the way. Feed the vanity of your mistress, and all her treasures shall be yours. Be careful whom you offend, and keep an expendable companion nearby to hold culpable for your crimes.

	"The ideal of what a male drow can become, Keptolo is handsome, stylish, witty, hedonistic, an outrageous flatterer, and sought after as a lover. He is also dangerous in his aspects as a subtle assassin and a whisperer of rumors. For those attributes, he is worshiped by ambitious males who hope to emulate him. Some succeed admirably and achieve great things beyond the reach of most males, but many more succumb to excesses of the flesh, dissipation, and disease, or they are ruined or murdered by a rival-who is also a true disciple of Keptolo.": "凯普托洛是男性乌鸦的理想人选，他英俊、时尚、机智、享乐主义，是一个令人发指的奉承者，也是一个受欢迎的情人。他也有危险的一面，他是一个微妙的刺客和谣言的耳语者。由于这些特性，他被那些希望效仿他的雄心勃勃的男性所膜拜。有些人取得了令人钦佩的成功，并取得了大多数男性无法企及的伟大成就，但更多的人则屈服于肉体的过度膨胀、放纵和疾病，或者被对手毁掉或谋杀--后者也是凯普托洛的真正弟子。",
	"In most myths, Keptolo resides in the Demonweb Pits alongside Lolth, whom he serves as consort, more than a plaything but much less than an equal. Keptolo is a bitter enemy of Zinzerena, who deceives and uses him as a tool in many of the stories about the Dark Seldarine.": "在大多数神话中，凯普托洛与洛尔思一起居住在魔网坑中，他把洛尔思当作妃子，不仅仅是一个玩物，但远不如一个平等者。克普托罗是辛泽拉的死敌，在许多关于黑暗塞尔达林的故事中，辛泽拉欺骗并利用他作为工具。",
	"Keranos is the god of storms and wisdom. Merciless and impatient, Keranos is equally likely to strike out at mortals with a bolt of inspiration or a blast of lightning. To revere Keranos is to exult in the power of wisdom, clarity of purpose, and the fury of the storm. He is favored by tinkerers, inventors, and sailors as well as those seeking solutions to intractable problems. He doesn't tolerate the company (or the worship) of fools, and he despises vapidity and indecision.": "凯拉诺斯是暴风雨和智慧之神。凯拉诺斯无情而不耐烦，同样可能用灵感或闪电袭击凡人。崇敬凯拉诺斯是对智慧的力量、清晰的目标和风暴的愤怒的赞美。他受到工匠、发明家和水手的青睐，也受到那些寻求棘手问题解决方案的人的青睐。他不容忍傻瓜的陪伴（或崇拜），他鄙视虚浮和优柔寡断。",
	"Keranos rarely appears directly to mortals, preferring to communicate through an epiphany or a crashing bolt of lightning. When he does deign to manifest in the mortal world, Keranos prefers the form of a stout, bearded, male human wearing a purple loincloth girdled in a mithral chain belt with a clasp in the form of a dragon's skull. His bearing is upright and stern, with a clipped, brusque way of speaking. Particularly clever plans and observations bring a hint of a smile to his face. When interacting with mortals, Keranos sometimes appears in the form of a great horned owl with lightning strikes flashing in its eyes.": "凯拉诺斯很少直接出现在凡人面前，他更喜欢通过顿悟或一道闪电来交流。当他出现在凡人世界时，Keranos更喜欢以一个粗壮的、有胡子的男性人类的形式出现，他穿着紫色的腰带，腰带上有一个龙的头骨形式的扣子。他的举止挺拔而严厉，说话的方式简练而粗暴。特别聪明的计划和观察使他的脸上露出一丝微笑。当与凡人互动时，凯拉诺斯有时会以大角猫头鹰的形式出现，眼中闪着闪电。",
	"Keranos is the embodiment of wisdom and insight unhindered by compassion or patience. Just as the storm vents its fury unpredictably and without warning, so does Keranos deliver the wisdom he chooses to impart.": "凯拉诺斯是智慧和洞察力的化身，不受同情心或耐心的阻碍。就像暴风雨毫无预兆地发泄它的怒火一样，Keranos也将他选择的智慧传授给大家。",
	"A storm, for all its unpredictability, can still be weathered by those who apply foresight and knowledge. So it is when dealing with Keranos. He rewards those who act with forethought and decisiveness and punishes the reckless for their stupidity.": "一场风暴，尽管它是不可预测的，但那些运用先见之明和知识的人仍然可以经受住。与Keranos打交道时也是如此。他奖励那些深谋远虑、果断行事的人，惩罚那些鲁莽的人的愚蠢行为。",
	"Those who seek to solve enigmas and create wonders of art and science often invoke his name. The creative process is fraught with frustration, and his insights make short work of such hindrances as easily as the lightning parts a mighty oak.": "那些寻求解开谜团、创造艺术和科学奇迹的人经常引用他的名字。创作过程中充满了挫折，而他的洞察力使这些障碍在短时间内得到解决，就像闪电劈开一棵强大的橡树。",
	"Keranos dispenses inspiration without regard for the morality of its application. He is just as likely to reward the shrewd general seeking to topple a polis as a gentle healer searching for a cure for a malady. Good and evil don't color his thinking, only action and the thrill of birthing new ideas into the world. Furthering the act of creating—be it ideas, weapons, art, or magic—is what matters most.": "凯拉诺斯分配灵感时不考虑其应用的道德性。他对寻求推翻一个政体的精明将军的奖赏，就像对寻找治病良方的温柔医者一样。善与恶并不影响他的思考，只是行动和将新的想法孕育到世界中的快感。推进创造行为--无论是思想、武器、艺术还是魔法--才是最重要的。",
	"For good or ill, Keranos exists as a disruptive force. He doesn't desire authority over other gods and, in fact, doesn't particularly enjoy their company. Keranos finds satisfaction in investing bright mortals with prescient visions to see how they adapt. Those who prove themselves decisive and intelligent, such as the missing Queen Cymede of Akros, earn his grudging respect and continued blessings of precognition. He finds satisfaction not only in granting insight, but also in expressing the awesome fury of the storm. Where others see only chaos and destruction in storms, he sees them as shaping the firmament in ways that challenge and engage mortals. His blasts of lightning set house and forest ablaze, thus rendering the soil clear for new life and new creations. His is a vision he alone is equipped to see. He is content to watch his divine kinfolk scheme and plot while he looks on, stern and inscrutable.": "无论好坏，Keranos都是作为一种破坏性力量存在的。他并不渴望拥有凌驾于其他神灵之上的权威，事实上，他并不特别喜欢他们的陪伴。凯拉诺斯在用预知的眼光投资于聪明的凡人，看他们如何适应方面找到了满足感。那些证明自己果断和聪明的人，比如失踪的阿克罗斯的西米德女王，赢得了他勉强的尊重和预知能力的持续祝福。他不仅在授予洞察力方面找到满足感，而且在表达风暴的可怕怒火方面也找到满足感。别人只看到风暴的混乱和破坏，而他认为风暴是以挑战和吸引凡人的方式塑造苍穹的。他的闪电使房屋和森林燃烧起来，从而为新的生命和新的创造提供了清晰的土壤。只有他才有资格看到他的愿景。他满足于看着他的神性亲属的计划和阴谋，而他则在一旁严阵以待、高深莫测地看着。",
	"Keranos is neither friendly nor sociable, so his dealings with most of the rest of the pantheon tend to be terse, formal, and brief. This doesn't mean that no interactions of note take place, however.": "凯拉诺斯既不友好也不善于交际，因此他与万神殿其他成员的交往往往是简明扼要、正式而简短的。然而，这并不意味着没有任何值得注意的互动发生。",
	"Of all the gods, Thassa has the most cordial relationship with Keranos. He enjoys the sea god's love of ancient lore, introspection, and complex patterns. The two sometimes talk for days at a time debating the flaws in ancient sophistries and discussing the meaning of the stars. Thassa, imperturbable and constant, makes the ideal counter to the wise yet temperamental Keranos.": "在所有的神中，塔萨与凯拉诺斯的关系最为融洽。他很喜欢这位海神对古代传说、内省和复杂模式的热爱。两人有时一谈就是好几天，辩论古代诡辩中的缺陷，讨论星星的意义。Thassa，不善言辞，始终如一，是明智但脾气暴躁的Keranos的理想对手。",
	"Another interesting relationship exists with Purphoros. The passions of the divine blacksmith run hot, as does the need to create. The melding of Keranos's inspiration with Purphoros's passion is a formidable combination. This partnership resulted in the creation of Epiphany, Keranos's mighty javelin.": "另一个有趣的关系存在于珀弗洛斯身上。神圣的铁匠的激情和创造的需要一样，都是热的。凯拉诺斯的灵感与珀弗罗斯的激情的结合是一个强大的组合。这种伙伴关系导致了凯拉诺斯强大的标枪--\"主显 \"的诞生。",
	"Keranos's name is often invoked by those amid a storm who seek safety, or by someone who is faced with a particularly difficult problem. Only the foolhardy call out to Keranos frivolously or in jest, since he might well smite the offender with a bolt from the blue.": "凯拉诺斯的名字经常被那些在风暴中寻求安全的人引用，或者被那些面临特别困难的人引用。只有愚蠢的人才会轻率地或开玩笑地呼唤凯拉诺斯，因为他很可能会以晴天霹雳的方式击倒犯罪者。",
	"In Akros, where Queen Cymede actively promoted the worship of Keranos, elaborate ceremonies are conducted beginning just before the first summer thunderstorm. Intricate, open-framed sand paintings with complex geometric shapes are created by dancers in flowing blue silken wraps. Then, as the rains fall, the paintings are washed away, symbolizing the impermanence of genius and the power of change. Akroan oracles strive to predict the exact time of the first storm in hopes of allowing enough time to stage the celebration. A similar festival in Meletis, called the Lightning Festival, gives its name (Astrapion) to the third month of the year.": "在阿克罗斯，Cymede女王积极推动对Keranos的崇拜，精心设计的仪式就在夏季第一场雷雨前开始进行。穿着流动的蓝色丝绸包裹的舞者创造了复杂的、具有复杂几何形状的开放式沙画。然后，随着雨水的落下，这些画被冲走，象征着天才的无常和变化的力量。阿克罗安的神谕者努力预测第一场暴雨的确切时间，希望能有足够的时间来举行庆祝活动。在梅里提斯有一个类似的节日，叫做闪电节，它的名字（Astrapion）是在一年的第三个月。",
	"On the last day of every month, Keranos's priests and laity bring offerings of fish and distilled spirits to his temples. The fish are cooked under a skylight open to the stars, with a shot of spirits thrown on the fire.": "在每个月的最后一天，Keranos的祭司和俗人都会把鱼和蒸馏酒的祭品带到他的寺庙。鱼在一个向星星敞开的天窗下被煮熟，并在火上撒上一针烈酒。",
	"The myths and legends told of Keranos's deeds demonstrate his wisdom and wrath, dispensed in equal measure.": "关于Keranos事迹的神话和传说显示了他的智慧和愤怒，并以同样的尺度进行了分配。",
	"The lightning bolt is a symbol of both Keranos's fury and his ability to inspire. Pondering this combination, he entreated Purphoros to create a mighty weapon, a javelin that strikes with the force of the storm. Keranos channeled his anger into a furious storm, which Purphoros then captured and smithed into a gleaming javelin that hummed with power. When Keranos wants to send a message, of either destruction or enlightenment, Epiphany is his tool of choice.": "闪电是凯拉诺斯的愤怒和他激励能力的象征。考虑到这一组合，他恳求珀弗洛斯创造一个强大的武器，一个能以风暴的力量进行打击的标枪。凯拉诺斯将他的愤怒转化为一场狂暴的风暴，然后珀弗罗斯将其捕获并熔炼成一把闪闪发光的标枪，发出嗡嗡的力量。当Keranos想要传递一个信息，无论是破坏还是启蒙，Epiphany是他的首选工具。",
	"In ages past, Keranos created a bronze font fed by a pure mountain stream that would grant great oracular power if one drank deeply from it. As Keranos wanted only the wisest and most clever mortals to gain his favor, the font lies at the end of a series of fierce traps and riddles. It exists both in and out of Nyx, hidden to all but the most diligent of seekers.": "在过去的岁月里，Keranos创造了一个青铜字体，它由一条纯净的山溪提供水源，如果人们深深地喝下它，就会获得巨大的神力。由于凯拉诺斯只想让最聪明的凡人获得他的青睐，所以这个字体位于一系列凶猛的陷阱和谜语的尽头。它存在于Nyx内外，除了最勤奋的寻求者之外，对其他所有人都是隐藏的。",
	"Years ago, Keranos received an exquisitely cut sapphire set in a delicate silver diadem as an offering. Deeply appreciative of the skill and craftsmanship required to create it, Keranos imbued the gem with a spark of divine genius. Inventors and philosophers coveted the diadem, for it conferred a fraction of Keranos's inspiration to the wearer—granting incredible insights or fracturing the wearer's sanity. Its last owner, the tormented genius Zexso the Unblinking, is said to have created a massive contraption to assure that the lightning diadem wouldn't shatter the mind of any other mortal. The inventor's machine launched the diadem into the heavens, where it's said to have landed upon a griffin-inhabited island floating in the clouds.": "多年前，Keranos收到了一颗切割精美的蓝宝石，镶嵌在一个精致的银质头饰中，作为礼物。凯拉诺斯对创造它所需的技能和工艺深表赞赏，并为这颗宝石注入了神圣的天才的火花。发明家和哲学家们都觊觎这颗宝石，因为它能将Keranos的一小部分灵感赋予佩戴者--赋予不可思议的洞察力或使佩戴者的理智崩溃。它的最后一个主人，饱受折磨的天才Zexso the Unblinking，据说创造了一个巨大的装置，以确保闪电冠冕不会击碎任何其他凡人的思想。这位发明家的机器将冠冕发射到了天上，据说它落在了一个漂浮在云端的狮鹫居住的岛屿上。",
	"Once, an arrogant oracle boasted of her infallible insight, which flowed from Keranos himself. Bemused, the storm lord arranged for the oracle to meet a particularly cunning sphinx and engage in an epic battle of wits. The objective set forth by Keranos was to solve the Riddle of Lightning, an enigma devised by Keranos himself. After days of deliberation, the oracle realized the answer, only to be struck down by a bolt from the heavens. Among the faithful nowadays, the term \"Riddle of Lightning\" is used to denote a question that one is better off not knowing the answer to.": "有一次，一个傲慢的神谕者吹嘘她无懈可击的洞察力，这来自于凯拉诺斯本人。风暴领主感到困惑，于是安排神谕者与一个特别狡猾的斯芬克斯会面，并进行一场史诗般的智慧之战。凯拉诺斯提出的目标是解决 \"闪电之谜\"，这是一个由凯拉诺斯自己设计的谜团。经过几天的思考，神谕者找到了答案，但却被天上的一道闪电击倒。如今在信徒中，\"闪电之谜 \"一词被用来表示一个最好不知道答案的问题。",
	"Occasionally, Keranos seeks to make his will known with all the subtlety of the master of storms. Should lightning strike the same point multiple times yet never echo with thunder, followers of Keranos claim that is the way their god draws attention to secrets he wishes to share. While repeat lightning strikes would normally cause considerable damage, strikes that convey the god's will often leave a scorch in the shape of Keranos's symbol or no mark at all.": "偶尔，Keranos会以风暴大师的所有微妙手段来表达他的意愿。如果闪电多次击中同一点，但却没有雷声回响，Keranos的追随者声称这是他们的神吸引人们注意他想分享的秘密的方式。虽然重复的雷击通常会造成相当大的损害，但传达神的意志的雷击往往会留下凯拉诺斯符号形状的焦痕，或者根本没有任何痕迹。",

	"Keranos chooses champions who are deliberate and wise, yet able to bring the storm's fury when needed. He expects his champions to be aggressive and self-reliant and disdains the lazy and the foolish, who deserve whatever ill fortune befalls them.": "凯拉诺斯选择的冠军都是深思熟虑和明智的，但在需要的时候能够带来风暴的怒火。他希望他的冠军们积极进取、自强不息，不屑于懒惰和愚蠢的人，他们应该得到任何不幸的命运。",

Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can deal an extra {@dice 1d6} lightning damage to the target. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.": "作为凯拉诺斯的信徒，你已经证明了你的智慧和你对风暴之神的忠诚。在你的每个回合中，当你用武器攻击击中一个生物时，你可以对目标造成额外的（%0%）雷电伤害。你可以使用这个特质的次数等于你的智力修正值（最少一次）。当你完成一个长时间的休息时，你会恢复所有已消耗的使用次数。",
	"When you fail an Intelligence or a Wisdom saving throw, you can reroll the die, and you must use the new roll. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.": "当你的智力或智慧救赎失败时，你可以重新掷骰子，而且你必须使用新的骰子。一旦你使用了这个特性，你就不能再这样做，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"The energy of the storm fills your being, granting you advantage on initiative rolls.": "暴风雨的能量充满了你的身体，使你在主动性掷骰子时获得优势。",
	"The drow god of vengeance and undeath, called the Revenancer, is portrayed in some legends as a fierce female clad in silver and translucent veils, and in others as a banshee. In either version, her hands bear many glittering silver rings, and this image is recognized as her symbol.": "鸦人的复仇和不死之神，被称为亡灵巫师，在一些传说中被描绘成一个身着银色和半透明面纱的凶猛女性，而在另一些传说中则是一个女妖。无论哪个版本，她的手上都有许多闪亮的银环，这个形象被公认为是她的象征。",
	"Drow see Kiaransalee as the patron of vengeance because she is said to have died and returned from death to get her revenge, bringing an army of the dead back with her. Various communities of her worshipers have differing ideas about who killed her and why, but typically the murderer is portrayed as having the features of some kind of creature the drow have great hatred for. Followers of Kiaransalee don't trouble themselves greatly over these details, because all the stories could be true: the Revenancer is believed to have returned from death over and over again.": "鸦人将Kiaransalee视为复仇的守护神，因为据说她已经死了，并从死神那里回来报了仇，带着一支死人的军队回来。她的各种崇拜者群体对谁杀了她以及为什么杀了她有不同的看法，但通常凶手被描绘成具有某种克罗人非常憎恨的生物的特征。Kiaransalee的追随者们并不为这些细节而烦恼，因为所有的故事都可能是真的：Revenancer被认为是一次又一次地从死亡中返回。",
	"Vengeance is the aspect of Kiaransalee that appeals to most drow, because it becomes a necessity in every ambitious drow's life-usually more than once. The state of undeath is of less concern to them, but those who practice necromancy turn to Kiaransalee for guidance and for protection from undead.": "复仇是Kiaransalee吸引大多数乌鸦的方面，因为它成为每个有野心的乌鸦生活中的必需品--通常不止一次。不死的状态对他们来说不那么重要，但那些练习死灵法术的人则向基阿兰萨利寻求指导和保护，以免遭不死之灾。",
	"Some of her most fervent followers seek out the secret of attaining undeath for themselves. Kiaransalee favors them by bringing them back as undead, but unlike other gods of similar sort, Kiaransalee doesn't offer the undeath of lichdom but a lowly existence as a banshee, a revenant, or a wight.": "一些她最狂热的追随者为自己寻找获得不死之身的秘密。Kiaransalee通过让他们复活成为不死之身来帮助他们，但与其他类似的神不同，Kiaransalee提供的不是不死之身，而是作为女妖、复仇者或巫师的卑微存在。",
	"Drow believe that Kiaransalee was driven mad by returning from death as a god so many times, but her followers aren't discouraged by this assessment. Despite her madness, her actions are guided by a deep and devious cunning-a trait that drow attach more importance to than they do to sanity.": "鸦人相信基阿兰萨利因为多次以神的身份从死亡线上回来而被逼疯了，但她的追随者并没有因为这种评价而气馁。尽管她是个疯子，但她的行动是由一种深沉而狡诈的狡猾所引导的--这是鸦人比他们更重视理智的特质。",
	"Believed to have sprung into existence during Theros's earliest days, Klothys is the god of destiny and, along with Kruphix, one of the plane's original deities. She oversees the order of the cosmos, ensuring that all things remain in their proper place, knowing how easily the cosmic balance could be undone if she were not vigilant. On the heels of a near-catastrophic upset of the cosmic order—the rise to godhood and subsequent defeat of the satyr Xenagos—Klothys has emerged from the Underworld for the first time in mortal memory to untangle the strands of destiny and set the world right.": "Klothys被认为是在Theros最早期的时候出现的，她是命运之神，与Kruphix一起是这个星球最初的神灵之一。她监督着宇宙的秩序，确保所有的东西都保持在它们适当的位置上，她知道如果她不保持警惕，宇宙的平衡是多么容易被破坏。在宇宙秩序几乎遭到灾难性破坏之后--萨提尔-塞纳格斯（Xenagos）的成神和随后的失败--克洛蒂斯在凡人的记忆中第一次从冥界出现，解开了命运的束缚，使世界恢复正常。",
	"Klothys typically appears as a woman with six curling horns and an impossibly long mane of pale hair that cascades around her horns, drapes over her eyes, and spools into her spear-like weapon and the various other spindles she carries.": "Klothys通常以一个女人的形象出现，她有六只卷曲的角和一头长得不能再长的苍白的头发，这些头发围绕着她的角，垂在她的眼睛上，并卷进她的长矛般的武器和她携带的其他各种轴上。",
	"Beneath her outward calm, Klothys seethes at the way mortals and gods alike have pulled apart and rearranged the threads of destiny to feed their petty ambitions. Her peaceful mien falls away in the presence of such villains. In her rage, her red-glowing eyes come into view through the veil of her hair, and she wields burning strands of hair as a devastating weapon.": "在她外表的平静之下，克洛蒂斯对凡人和众神为了满足他们的小野心而拆散和重新安排命运之线的做法感到愤怒。在这样的恶棍面前，她平静的神情荡然无存。在她的愤怒中，她那双闪着红光的眼睛透过头发的面纱映入眼帘，她挥舞着燃烧的头发丝作为毁灭性的武器。",
	"Klothys is the embodiment and enforcer of destiny. Largely forgotten after ages spent in the Underworld, Klothys has only recently emerged, brimming with silent frustration at the state of Theros.": "Klothys是命运的化身和执行者。在冥界度过了漫长的岁月之后，克洛蒂斯被遗忘了，直到最近才出现，对特洛斯的状况充满了无言的沮丧。",
	"Each strand of Klothys's hair is part of the fabric of destiny, the natural order that underpins all existence. Her followers claim to see these strands woven into all things, granting them understanding of cosmic truths and insights into how the future should unfold.": "Klothys的每一缕头发都是命运结构的一部分，是支撑所有存在的自然秩序。她的追随者声称看到这些发丝交织在万物之中，赋予他们对宇宙真理的理解和对未来如何发展的洞察力。",
	"Klothys withdrew to the Underworld ages ago to keep watch over the imprisoned titans and ensure they couldn't escape and destroy the order she had established. Due to this undertaking, she is also the god of secrets best kept quiet and powers best untouched.": "Klothys在很久以前就撤退到了冥界，以监视被囚禁的泰坦，确保他们无法逃脱并破坏她所建立的秩序。由于这项任务，她也是最好保持沉默的秘密之神和最好不要碰触的权力之神。",
	"Once content to oversee and preserve destiny from the Underworld, Klothys now endeavors to undo the cosmic damage caused by Heliod, Xenagos, and ambitious mortals in recent years. The ways in which they ravaged reality to realize their selfish dreams has threatened Theros, and only by untangling the strands of destiny can Klothys set things right. The status quo she seeks to restore, however, comes with a cost in mortal casualties and societal upheaval that would accompany this process. She intends to humble the same institutions that condoned or committed these crimes against Theros. When her efforts have laid low the proud, the defiant, and the exploitative, then Klothys will have restored the natural order and ensured the world's survival.": "Klothys曾经满足于从冥界监督和保护命运，现在他努力消除Heliod、Xenagos和野心勃勃的凡人近年来造成的宇宙破坏。他们为了实现自己的自私梦想而蹂躏现实的方式已经威胁到了特洛斯，只有解开命运的绳索，克洛蒂斯才能将事情纠正过来。然而，她所寻求恢复的现状是以死亡和社会动荡为代价的，而这一过程将伴随着死亡和社会动荡。她打算羞辱那些纵容或犯下这些针对特洛斯的罪行的机构。当她的努力让骄傲的人、挑衅的人和剥削的人低下头时，Klothys就会恢复自然秩序，确保世界的生存。",
	"Klothys views many of the gods with disdain, considering them to be complicit in Xenagos's theogenesis, Heliod's acts of arrogance, or both. She reserves special contempt for Heliod and his champions, relishing every opportunity to teach them humility.": "Klothys对许多神灵不屑一顾，认为他们是Xenagos神创的同谋，Heliod的傲慢行为，或者两者都是。她对赫利奥德和他的拥护者特别蔑视，乐于利用一切机会教他们谦逊。",
	"Klothys also clashes with other gods associated with order and progress, seeing their defiance of the natural order as a dangerous affront. Ephara's ravenous colonization, Iroas's passion for overcoming insurmountable odds, and Karametra's taming of nature all run the risk of inspiring ambitious mortals who lust for ever more power and strain to break away from their proper place in the cosmos.": "Klothys还与其他与秩序和进步有关的神发生冲突，认为他们对自然秩序的蔑视是一种危险的冒犯。埃法拉贪婪的殖民化，伊洛亚斯对克服不可逾越的困难的热情，以及卡拉米特拉对自然的驯服，都有可能激发野心勃勃的凡人，他们渴望得到更多的权力，并竭力摆脱他们在宇宙中的适当位置。",
	"Klothys respects the other gods whose interests balance creation and destruction, such as Thassa, Purphoros, and Nylea, considering them better attuned to Theros's needs and destiny's myriad outcomes. Nylea shares Klothys's delight in the world's natural cycles. Purphoros's willingness to build and demolish appeases Klothys—as well as the fact that he despises Heliod as much as she does.": "Klothys尊重其他在创造和毁灭之间取得平衡的神灵，如Thassa、Purphoros和Nylea，认为他们更能适应Theros的需求和命运的无数结果。Nylea与Klothys一样，对世界的自然循环感到高兴。Purphoros愿意建造和拆除，这让Klothys很满意--以及他和她一样鄙视Heliod的事实。",
	"Klothys's relationships with Erebos and Athreos are complicated. Ages spent in the Underworld with Erebos have driven home for her how arrogant and tyrannical he is, as ready to commit the same sins as Heliod if given the opportunity. Even so, Erebos and Klothys maintain a level of mutual respect. Until recently, Klothys and Athreos were unflappable allies. But now her emergence from the Underworld has blurred the borders between the realms, as she draws horrors into the mortal realm with her and thereby raises Athreos's ire.": "Klothys与Erebos和Athreos的关系很复杂。与Erebos一起在冥界度过的岁月使她认识到他是多么傲慢和专横，如果有机会，他准备犯下与Heliod一样的罪过。即便如此，Erebos和Klothys仍然保持着一定程度的相互尊重。直到最近，Klothys和Athreos还是不折不扣的盟友。但现在她从冥界的出现模糊了两界之间的边界，因为她把恐怖的东西一起引到了凡间，从而引起了阿瑟雷斯的愤怒。",
	"Of course, Klothys trusts no other god as much as she does Kruphix, who also recalls Theros's earliest hours. The two have a deep respect for one another.": "当然，Klothys对其他神的信任程度不亚于她对Kruphix的信任，她也记得Theros最早的时候。两人对彼此有着深深的敬意。",
	"Klothys doesn't trace her origins to mortal devotion, and she has languished in obscurity for almost the whole of human history. Unlike the other gods (except Kruphix), she doesn't need worship to sustain or empower her, and she doesn't seek out reverence or demand it. By and large, mortals are irrelevant to her, except insofar as they have played a role in tangling the strands of destiny by defying nature's order.": "Klothys并没有追溯到她对凡人的奉献，而且她几乎在整个人类历史上都是默默无闻的。与其他神灵不同（除了克鲁菲克斯），她不需要崇拜来维持或赋予她力量，她也不寻求敬畏或要求敬畏。总的来说，凡人与她无关，除非他们在违抗自然界的秩序而使命运纠结的过程中发挥了作用。",
	"Klothys is barely remembered in the mortal world, having sequestered herself in the Underworld while human civilization was in its infancy. Some surviving myths speak of a personified \"destiny\" in a way that vaguely suggests the possibility of an actual god's involvement.": "Klothys在凡间几乎不被人记得，当人类文明处于萌芽状态时，她把自己封闭在冥界。一些现存的神话提到了一个人格化的 \"命运\"，隐约表明有可能是一个真正的神参与其中。",
	"The greatest threat to the young world of Theros was the godlike race of titans, born from the same swirling chaos as the world itself. Before any order could be imposed on the world, the titans had to be contained. Kruphix and Klothys worked together to imprison the titans in the deepest pits of the Underworld. Klothys voluntarily bound herself in the Underworld to keep the titans imprisoned, but that is, after all, the nature of destiny: once the natural order of the world had been put in place and preserved, no further action should have been required on her part to maintain it.": "对年轻的塞洛斯世界来说，最大的威胁是神一样的泰坦种族，他们和世界本身一样，都是在混沌的漩涡中诞生。在对世界施加任何秩序之前，泰坦必须被遏制。Kruphix和Klothys一起工作，将泰坦族囚禁在冥界的最深坑中。Klothys自愿将自己束缚在冥界，以保持对泰坦的囚禁，但这毕竟是命运的本质：一旦世界的自然秩序被建立和维护，就不应该要求她采取进一步的行动来维护它。",
	"Hidden far from civilized coasts lies a strand of Klothys's hair that she purposefully plucked. Knotted in on itself, the strand appears as a seething ball of dense smoke. Any who touch the strand risk having it invade them, infecting them with a pernicious destiny that Klothys herself tore from the natural order. None can say what terrible destiny the Smoking Strand drives its possessor toward, but the ruins within which it lies might give some hint—caverns burrowed deep into a mountain of petrified bodies, the twisted obsidian corpses of humanoids and animals alike.": "在远离文明海岸的地方，隐藏着一缕Klothys的头发，是她特意拔掉的。这根头发打结在自己身上，看起来就像一个冒着浓烟的球。任何接触到这根头发的人都有可能被它侵袭，使他们感染上一种恶毒的命运，而这种命运是克洛特丝自己从自然秩序中撕下来的。没有人能够说清烟火线会驱使它的拥有者走向什么可怕的命运，但它所在的废墟可能会给出一些提示--洞穴深埋在石化的尸体山中，人类和动物的扭曲的黑曜石尸体都是如此。",
	"The newly formed gods Kruphix and Klothys emerged from opposite sides of the roiling tangle of possibilities that eventually gave birth to Theros. At first the two battled for supremacy, but they soon realized their conflict left their young world vulnerable to dangers from both inside and out. Putting their rivalry aside, the pair agreed it was better to share and have something than let their struggles destroy all creation.": "新形成的神Kruphix和Klothys来自于最终诞生了Theros的各种可能性的漩涡中的两边。起初，这两位为争夺霸权而战，但他们很快意识到他们的冲突使他们年轻的世界容易受到来自内部和外部的危险。把他们的竞争放在一边，这对夫妇同意，与其让他们的斗争破坏所有的创造，不如分享和拥有一些东西。",
	"The nightmarish creatures known as woe striders are said to be products of Klothys's punishment. These beings descend from an age when some mortals learned to unshackle themselves from the strands of destiny. To what end is a question lost to time, but Klothys put a quick end to these blasphemers and eradicated nearly all knowledge of their methods. Ever since, the shades of these accursed mortals have walked the Underworld as woe striders, monstrosities endlessly seeking strands of destiny that they might use to replace their own discarded lots.": "被称为 \"悲惨流浪者 \"的噩梦般的生物，据说是克洛蒂斯惩罚的产物。这些生物来自一个时代，当时一些凡人学会了将自己从命运的束缚中解脱出来。目的是什么是一个被时间遗忘的问题，但克洛蒂斯迅速结束了这些亵渎者，并消除了几乎所有关于他们方法的知识。从那时起，这些被诅咒的凡人的影子就作为悲惨的流浪者在冥界行走，这些怪物无休止地寻找命运之线，以取代他们自己被抛弃的东西。",

	"Klothys hasn't had a mortal champion before. Upon emerging from the Underworld, she created a host of Nyxborn agents to help her restore Theros to its proper path. You might be one of these so-called Agents of Destiny (if you choose the Nyxborn supernatural gift, described in chapter 1), single-minded in the purpose for which you were made. Or you might be among the first of a new cadre of followers of Klothys. The Klothys's Favor table suggests some possible connections between the god and a mortal follower.": "Klothys以前没有一个凡人的冠军。从冥界出来后，她创造了一大批Nyxborn代理人，以帮助她将Theros恢复到正确的轨道。你可能是这些所谓的命运代理人之一（如果你选择了第一章中描述的Nyxborn超自然天赋），一心一意地完成你被创造的目的。或者，你可能是Klothys的第一批新追随者之一。Klothys的恩惠表显示了神和凡人追随者之间的一些可能联系。",

As a follower of Klothys, consider the ideals on the Klothys's Ideals table as alternatives to those suggested for your background.": "追随Klothys就是接受宇宙的自然秩序和你在其中的位置。它意味着接受你的命运，即使你在努力对抗命运的束缚。作为Klothys的追随者，请考虑将Klothys的理想表上的理想作为你的背景建议的替代。",

	"Kruphix is the eldest of the gods and sees it as his responsibility to rein in the excesses of his younger siblings. Unlike Heliod, Kruphix knows that he isn't powerful enough to impose his will unilaterally. Instead, he plays the other gods against one another and serves as a mediator in their endless disputes. He takes care to ensure that the other gods view him as impartial, which he considers essential to maintaining his authority.": "Kruphix是诸神中最年长的，他认为自己有责任约束弟弟妹妹的过度行为。与赫利奥德不同，克鲁普希克斯知道他没有强大到可以单方面强加自己的意志。相反，他让其他神灵互相对立，在他们无休止的争端中充当调解人。他小心翼翼地确保其他神灵认为他是公正的，他认为这对维持他的权威至关重要。",
	"Kruphix strives to hold himself above the disputes of the gods, but like any other god, he has both rivals and allies. Chief among the former is the sun god Heliod, whom Kruphix sees as an arrogant, dangerous threat to the balance of power among the gods. He seldom acts against Heliod openly, preferring to warn others about the sun god's efforts to seize power at their expense.": "Kruphix努力使自己凌驾于众神的争端之上，但像其他神一样，他既有对手也有盟友。前者中最主要的是太阳神赫利奥德，克鲁普希克斯认为他是一个傲慢的、对众神之间权力平衡的危险威胁。他很少公开反对赫利奥德，而更倾向于警告其他人太阳神以他们为代价夺取权力的努力。",
	"Since every mortal soul must eventually pass beyond the horizon and into death, Kruphix respects both Erebos and Athreos. He sees Erebos as a necessary check on Heliod's power, and he even allowed Athreos to continue his vital work on the fringes of the mortal world when he bound all the other gods within the fabric of Nyx. Erebos and Kruphix blame one another for Klothys's recent emergence from the Underworld, a situation neither seems able to control.": "由于每个凡人的灵魂最终都必须越过地平线，进入死亡，所以克鲁普希克斯同时尊重埃瑞博斯和阿斯雷欧斯。他认为Erebos是对Heliod权力的必要制衡，他甚至允许Athreos在凡人世界的边缘继续他的重要工作，当他把所有其他的神都束缚在Nyx的结构中。Erebos和Kruphix为Klothys最近从冥界出现而互相指责，这种情况似乎谁都无法控制。",
	"Purphoros loathes Kruphix for temporarily hobbling his mind following an attack against Heliod, but Kruphix holds no grudge against Purphoros. That particular punishment upset the balance too far in the other direction, and Kruphix is more likely to side with Purphoros than Heliod in the future.": "Purphoros厌恶Kruphix，因为他在攻击Heliod后暂时阻碍了他的思维，但Kruphix对Purphoros没有怨恨。那次特别的惩罚在另一个方向上打破了平衡，Kruphix在未来更有可能站在Purphoros一边而不是Heliod一边。",
	"Of all the gods, only Klothys truly concerns Kruphix. He hoped that she would remain secret and secluded in the Underworld, and he doesn't know what her emergence portends. She is the only other god whose existence predates mortal belief, and though he is unlikely to draw her ire by manipulating destiny, he doesn't know how her return will affect the pantheon.": "在所有的神灵中，只有克洛特斯真正关心克鲁普希克斯。他希望她能保持秘密，隐居在冥界，他不知道她的出现预示着什么。她是唯一存在于凡人信仰之前的其他神，尽管他不太可能通过操纵命运来引起她的愤怒，但他不知道她的回归将如何影响万神殿。",
	"Many pray to Kruphix when they need to find something lost, but few dedicate themselves to his worship. Cults devoted to Kruphix fiercely guard their secrets, and their initiates refrain from drawing attention to themselves. Some followers and champions of Kruphix travel the world in secret, searching for hidden truths. Many use secret signals to enable them to find safe lodging with other worshipers nearly anywhere.": "许多人在需要找回丢失的东西时都会向克鲁普希克斯祈祷，但很少有人献身于对他的崇拜。献身于克鲁普希克斯的教派严格保护他们的秘密，他们的入门者也避免引起人们的注意。一些Kruphix的追随者和拥护者秘密地周游世界，寻找隐藏的真理。许多人使用秘密信号，使他们能够在几乎任何地方与其他崇拜者找到安全的住所。",
	"Rituals honoring Kruphix are usually performed at boundaries, both temporal and spatial: shorelines, riverbanks, equinoxes, and sunsets. One of the god's greatest festivals is the Agrypnion (\"the Watching\"), which marks the end of winter and the close of the year.": "纪念Kruphix的仪式通常在边界进行，包括时间和空间的边界：海岸线、河岸、分水岭和日落。该神最伟大的节日之一是Agrypnion（\"守望\"），它标志着冬天的结束和一年的结束。",
	"Kruphix appears in stories in an ancillary role, often as the impartial judge who ends a conflict between gods. Initiates in Kruphix's mystery cult know other stories in which he plays a more active role, including special versions of well-known legends, but they seldom share these tales with others.": "Kruphix在故事中以辅助角色出现，通常是作为公正的法官结束众神之间的冲突。克鲁普希克斯的神秘崇拜的入门者知道他在其中扮演更积极的角色的其他故事，包括著名传说的特殊版本，但他们很少与其他人分享这些故事。",
	"According to one tale, it was Kruphix, not Purphoros, who was the first to fashion living Nyxborn creatures from the fabric of Nyx. Kruphix created the divine artisan Nykthos and ordered him to build altars to the gods. Nykthos's story isn't widely known among mortals, but the Shrine to Nyx is still called Nykthos in his honor.": "根据一个传说，第一个用Nyx的织物制造Nyxborn生物的是Kruphix而不是Purphoros。Kruphix创造了神圣的工匠Nykthos，并命令他为诸神建造祭坛。奈克瑟斯的故事在凡人中并不广为人知，但为了纪念他，奈克瑟斯神殿仍被称为奈克瑟斯。",
	"When Purphoros attacked Heliod in a destructive rage, Heliod demanded that Kruphix intervene. Kruphix constrained the forge-god's mind and memory in punishment for his attack. He warned all the gods that if they threatened the mortal realm with their disruptive quarrels, he would bind them to Nyx for as long as he saw fit. As of yet, no god has dared to test Kruphix's threat, but there are certainly those among them who might try if they could see a way to retain their own powers.": "当Purphoros在破坏性的愤怒中攻击Heliod时，Heliod要求Kruphix进行干预。Kruphix限制了锻造之神的思想和记忆，作为对其攻击的惩罚。他警告所有的神，如果他们用破坏性的争吵威胁到凡间，他将把他们绑在尼克斯身上，只要他认为合适。到目前为止，还没有一个神敢于测试克鲁菲克斯的威胁，但他们中肯定有一些人可能会尝试，如果他们能看到一个保留他们自己力量的方法。",
	"When the squabbling of the gods threatened the world once more despite Kruphix's warning, he etched all their names—including his own—in the bark of his great tree at the edge of the world. Immediately, the gods' oracles could no longer hear them, their blessings faded, and the night sky held only unmoving stars. The great Silence of the gods serves as the backdrop for numerous tales of heroism and sacrifice. Many alive today witnessed the sky go dark and the temples grow quiet. Most consider the Silence a terrible mistake that led to the rise of the usurper god Xenagos, but followers of Kruphix know that it was a grim necessity to prevent far worse calamity.": "当诸神的争吵再次威胁到世界时，尽管Kruphix发出了警告，他还是把他们所有的名字--包括他自己的名字--刻在了世界边缘的大树的树皮上。随即，诸神的神谕再也听不见了，他们的祝福也消失了，夜空中只有不动的星星。诸神的伟大沉默成为无数英雄主义和牺牲的故事的背景。许多今天还活着的人目睹了天空的黑暗和神庙的安静。大多数人认为沉默是一个可怕的错误，导致了篡夺者Xenagos神的崛起，但Kruphix的追随者知道，这是一个严峻的必要性，以防止更糟糕的灾难。",
	"Some of Kruphix's worshipers don't identify with their inscrutable deity, but with Theophilia, a legendary naiad who entered Nyx and whose transcendent encounter with Kruphix each initiate strives to duplicate. The naiad's journey is celebrated in hushed chants as blindfolded initiates are led across a boundary—often stepping into a river or over a low stone wall, an act that symbolizes crossing the horizon. Then the blindfolds are removed as the faithful intone a paean to Kruphix. The hope is that Kruphix will choose to reveal himself at the climax of the ritual, whether by the appearance of some omen or in a personal epiphany. Such a revelation isn't always positive, though, as Kruphix often imparts a glimpse of cosmic truths for which mortals have no possible context.": "一些Kruphix的崇拜者并不认同他们高深莫测的神灵，而是认同Theophilia，一个传说中进入Nyx的naiad，每个入门者都在努力复制她与Kruphix的超然相遇。当蒙着眼睛的入门者被带过一个边界时，他们会用低沉的吟唱来庆祝奈德的旅程--通常是踏入一条河流或越过一堵低矮的石墙，这一行为象征着跨越地平线。然后，当信徒们吟唱着对Kruphix的颂歌时，眼罩被摘下。人们希望Kruphix会在仪式的高潮时选择显露自己，无论是通过某种预兆的出现还是个人的顿悟。不过，这样的启示并不总是积极的，因为克鲁普希克斯经常会传授一丝凡人不可能了解的宇宙真理。",

	"Even though elves live far longer than most other humanoids, they show few physical signs of aging until they become very old. By the time an elf's hair turns to silver and wrinkles appear around the eyes, the elf has lived for centuries and probably has only a few decades remaining. For this longevity and long-lasting vitality, they thank and revere Labelas Enoreth.": "尽管精灵的寿命远远长于其他大多数人类，但在他们变得非常老之前，他们几乎没有显示出身体衰老的迹象。当一个精灵的头发变成银色，眼睛周围出现皱纹时，这个精灵已经活了几个世纪，可能只剩下几十年了。为了这种长寿和持久的生命力，他们感谢并崇敬Labelas Enoreth。",
	"Labelas is portrayed as an elderly elf with silver hair, still-active eyes that once were bright blue but now are clouded and gray, fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth, and a right hand slightly impaired by the effects of age. If anything, these symptoms of mortality make the god even more handsome and stately in the eyes of his followers than he was in his youth.": "Labelas被描绘成一个年老的精灵，银色的头发，仍然活跃的眼睛，曾经是明亮的蓝色，但现在是混浊的灰色，眼睛和嘴巴周围有细小的皱纹，右手由于年龄的影响而略微受损。如果有的话，这些死亡的症状使这位神在他的追随者眼中比他年轻时更加英俊和庄重。",
	"Elves tend to give Labelas little regard until they experience Remembrance. Like Corellon and Hanali, Labelas makes few demands on his followers. A few minutes each day spent thanking him for his gift of long life and good health, and occasionally placing a fresh flower in one of his shrines, is generally all that's expected. When an elf develops unusual ailments in old age and appears headed for decrepitude, other elves might wonder if these are the repercussions for not paying Labelas his due.": "精灵们在经历忏悔之前往往对Labelas不屑一顾。像科瑞隆和哈纳里一样，拉贝拉斯对他的追随者没有什么要求。每天花几分钟时间感谢他赐予的长寿和健康，偶尔在他的神龛上放一朵新鲜的花，一般来说就可以了。当一个精灵在年老时出现不寻常的疾病，并且似乎正在走向衰老时，其他精灵可能会怀疑这是否是没有向Labelas支付他应得的回报。",
	"Most settlements have only one or two priests of Labelas. These individuals are elves well past their prime but who have not yet begun to withdraw into themselves. Their duties involve guiding elves who have recently experienced Remembrance, and are thus beginning the journey into introversion in the waning days of one's mortal life. The priests also preside over funeral celebrations, since Labelas is also honored for his role in seeing that elves experience beneficial reincarnations.": "大多数定居点只有一到两个Labelas的牧师。这些人都是已经过了而立之年的精灵，但他们还没有开始退出自己。他们的职责是指导那些最近经历过纪念活动的精灵，从而在一个人的凡人生命的枯萎期开始进入内敛的旅程。祭司们还主持葬礼庆典，因为Labelas也因为他在确保精灵们经历有益的转世方面的作用而受到尊敬。",
	" Shrines and temples to Labelas Enoreth are mostly made of or decorated with ephemeral things. Patterns and images made with colored sand, cut flowers, precariously stacked stones, and images made from thin paper are all commonly found there. These places of veneration are usually located in desolate, high places where the ever-changing sky and the setting sun can be seen and contemplated. Along with the setting sun, images of clouds are a major motif for followers of Labelas, who often tattoo such designs on their bodies or embroider them on their robes to signify the ephemeral nature of the physical world.": " Labelas Enoreth的神殿和庙宇大多是由短暂的东西制成或装饰的。用彩色沙子制作的图案和图像、切开的花朵、岌岌可危的石头、以及用薄纸制作的图像，都是常见的。这些祭祀场所通常位于荒凉的高处，在那里可以看到不断变化的天空和夕阳，并进行沉思。除了夕阳，云的图像也是Labelas信徒的一个主要主题，他们经常在身上纹上这种图案或在袍子上绣上这种图案，以表示物质世界的短暂性。",
	"Labelas Enoreth is the custodian of time, monitoring its passing and making sure that the warp and weft of history isn't torn asunder by powerful maniacs and errant demigods. He is also the eternal witness, watching the souls of the elves as they dance from incarnation to incarnation, each mortal lifetime representing a role an actor would take in a play. From his cosmic perspective, Labelas looks on each elven life as a story to be written, nudging wayward souls toward incarnations that he deems suitable for their overall development, and thus weaving the life of each elven soul into a tapestry that spans the ages. In acknowledgment of this gift, priests and devotees of Labelas often weave modest tapestries of their own and donate them to shines in his honor.": "Labelas Enoreth是时间的监护人，监控着时间的流逝，确保历史的经纬线不会被强大的疯子和错误的半神撕开。他也是永恒的见证者，看着精灵们的灵魂从一个化身跳到另一个化身，每个凡人的一生都代表着一个演员在剧中的角色。从他的宇宙视角来看，Labelas把每一个精灵的生命都看成是一个待写的故事，把不听话的灵魂推向他认为适合他们整体发展的化身，从而把每个精灵灵魂的生命编织成一幅跨越时代的织锦。为了感谢这份礼物，Labelas的牧师和信徒们经常自己编织适度的挂毯，并将它们捐献给闪亮的地方以示敬意。",
	"Despite Labelas's influence in the Seldarine, elves can become psychologically immersed in their mortal incarnations, forgetting about the tick of time and the eventual end of their physical forms. Even Labelas's appearance, with his obvious signs of aging, isn't enough to dissuade some elves from growing attached to their youthful features, long life, and worldly treasures. But all such naive behavior is brought to heel when the Remembrance occurs, and an elf's inward examination begins as one journeys toward death and a new beginning. Priests of Labelas smile with compassion when these wide-eyed elves show up at their temples, suddenly full of contrition and offerings for Labelas, still shaken from the vision of their Remembrance and the gravity of its meaning.": "尽管Labelas在塞尔达林的影响下，精灵们会在心理上沉浸在他们的凡人化身中，忘记了时间的流逝和他们身体形态的最终结束。甚至Labelas的外表，以及他明显的衰老迹象，也不足以劝阻一些精灵对他们年轻的特征、长寿和世俗的宝物产生依恋。但是，当纪念日发生时，所有这些天真的行为都会被制止，当一个人走向死亡和新的开始时，一个精灵的内省开始了。当这些睁大眼睛的精灵出现在他们的寺庙时，Labelas的牧师们露出了同情的微笑，他们突然充满了忏悔和对Labelas的供奉，仍然被他们的纪念会的愿景和其意义的严重性所震撼。",
	"To enhance an elf's Remembrance, the priests of Labelas use a special mirror made of polished black onyx. Small versions of these can be seen at many shrines dedicated to the Seldarine, as a reminder to the passing faithful of the importance of Remembrance. The priests advise those in their care to look into the mirror in order to deepen the trance of Remembrance. In the black void of the mirror, they see the faces of their former selves and scenes from their past lives-a glimpse into the grand tapestry of the each soul's existence as Labelas begins to weave yet another incarnation.": "为了加强精灵的纪念活动，Labelas的牧师们使用一种由抛光的黑玛瑙制成的特殊镜子。在许多供奉塞尔达林的神龛上都能看到这种小镜子，以提醒过往的信徒们纪念的重要性。祭司们建议那些被他们照顾的人看镜子，以加深纪念的恍惚。在镜子的黑色虚空中，他们看到了前世的面孔和前世的场景--当Labelas开始编织另一个化身时，他们可以瞥见每个灵魂存在的宏伟织锦。",
	"Also known as the Grim One, Laduguer was a mighty duergar warrior who liberated his people from the illithids.

	"The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of new communities and the growth of civilization, as long as that civilization gives everyone the potential to succeed. They despise the undead, seeing them as both a corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new beginnings, because undead cling to their old existence rather than moving on.": "拉桑德的信徒们拥护新社区的建立和文明的发展，只要这种文明给了每个人成功的潜力。他们鄙视亡灵，认为它们既是对自然秩序的破坏，也是对新的开始的否定，因为亡灵坚持他们原来的存在而不是继续前进。",
	"Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has been thought to be dead or to be another deity altogether. Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the goddess of illusion and deception.

	"The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it is difficult to know this for certain, because those who favor her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira is the patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, for whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to her when they hope to keep something secret, or placate her with a prayer before making an important decision when they fear being deceived. Some folk perform a swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of beseeching her for aid.": "莱拉的信徒似乎很少，尽管很难确定这一点，因为那些支持她的人很少公开他们的倾向。莱拉是幻术师和说谎者的守护神。除了幻术师和骗子之外，她几乎没有受到任何常规的崇拜，幻术师向雾影祈祷，希望他们的魔法能有效力，而骗子则是她的一种支持者。大多数人在希望保守秘密时都会向她祈祷，或者在做出重要决定前担心被欺骗时用祈祷来安抚她。有些人在说谎话时用手指在背后做旋转动作，以此来祈求她的帮助。",

Rubies and sapphires are sacred to Our Lady of Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see wearing such adornments.": "她的信徒总是至少穿一件颜色鲜艳、欢快的衣服，她的牧师的法衣与节日服装有更多的共同之处，而不是与阴沉的教会服装。红宝石和蓝宝石对欢乐圣母来说是神圣的，她的牧师们看到任何佩戴这种装饰品的人都会给予祝福。",
	"Lliira's followers aren't frivolous, however. To them, divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and one much needed. To that end, they fight those who would bring misery to others. They are fierce against their foes, and joyous revelers when their work is done.": "然而，Lliira的追随者并不轻佻。对他们来说，神圣的快乐是给凡人世界的一个非常真实的礼物，而且是非常需要的。为此，他们与那些会给他人带来痛苦的人战斗。他们猛烈地打击敌人，当他们的工作完成后，又是快乐的狂欢者。",
	"The evil god of deceit, shadows, and spiders, Lolth weaves a complicated web of schemes and treachery through her worshipers, deceiving allies and enemies alike to gain power. It is said that the Spider Queen can see through the eyes of all spiders, and that she is truly all-knowing. Lolth's worship is entwined with the society of dark elves across much of Exandria, but she has lost her influence in Wildemount since the Calamity, when her drow rejected her in favor of the ancient entity known as the Luxon. This slight has drawn her venomous hatred, and she now seeks vengeance against those who betrayed her.": "洛尔思是欺骗、阴影和蜘蛛的邪神，她通过她的崇拜者编织了一张复杂的阴谋和背叛之网，欺骗盟友和敌人以获得权力。据说，蜘蛛女王可以通过所有蜘蛛的眼睛来观察，她是真正的全知者。洛尔思的崇拜与埃克桑德里亚大部分地区的黑暗精灵社会纠缠在一起，但自从灾难发生后，她在荒野山庄失去了影响力，因为她的乌鸦拒绝了她，而选择了被称为卢克松的古老实体。这种轻视引来了她毒辣的仇恨，她现在寻求对那些背叛她的人进行报复。",
	"Lolth sends forth her corrupting poisons and whispers from her realm of the Demonweb, which is tethered to the Abyss and home to her many spider children.": "洛尔思从她的魔网领域发出她的腐败毒药和低语，魔网被拴在深渊上，是她众多蜘蛛孩子的家。",
	"Many Lolthite icons and idols show an alluring woman with dark purple skin and silver hair, her abdomen swelling into the terrifying body of a monstrous spider.": "许多Lolthite的图标和神像显示了一个具有深紫色皮肤和银色头发的诱人女人，她的腹部膨胀成一个可怕的蜘蛛身体。",
	"Lolth holds a searing grudge against Kord, the Storm Lord, for with one throw of his mighty thunderspear he impaled her against a cliffside, leaving her drow armies leaderless during the Calamity. Lolth and Gruumsh also share a burning hatred for Corellon, whom she claims drove her children below the earth, and Lolth often manipulates Gruumsh's followers into attacking her enemies so that the drow may remain safe. While Lolth cannot sense the will or power of the Luxon, the entity that is now worshiped by the dark elves of Xhorhas, she is bent entirely toward the destruction of its followers and their memory.": "洛尔思对风暴领主科德怀有强烈的怨恨，因为他用强大的雷电之矛将她刺穿在悬崖边上，使她的乌鸦军队在灾变期间失去了领导。洛尔思和格鲁姆什对科瑞隆也有着强烈的仇恨，她声称是科瑞隆把她的孩子们赶到了地底下，洛尔思经常操纵格鲁姆什的追随者攻击她的敌人，以便让乌鸦保持安全。虽然洛尔思无法感觉到卢克逊的意志或力量，卢克逊是现在被Xhorhas的黑暗精灵所崇拜的实体，但她却完全倾向于毁灭其追随者和他们的记忆。",
	"It is better to be loved than feared, but you may certainly try to be both.": "被爱比被惧怕好，但你当然可以尝试两者兼而有之。",
	"Misdirection, slander, and shadowed steps have more function than direct conflict.": "误导、诽谤和阴影的步骤比直接冲突有更多的功能。",
	"Death to the elves who live under the sun, and death to all their allies!": "生活在阳光下的精灵们去死吧，他们的所有盟友也都去死吧!",
	"Unlike Corellon, who asks very little of his followers, Lolth is a demanding mistress. What she demands most of all are sacrifices of treasure and blood. Time and time again, the screams of sacrificial victims echo through Lolth's lightless temples as they fall under the knives of her priestesses. Her altars are piled with skulls picked clean of flesh by the giant spiders that lurk in the webdraped stalactites overhead.": "不像科雷隆，他对他的追随者要求很低，洛尔思是一个苛刻的女主人。她最需要的是财宝和鲜血的献祭。一次又一次，牺牲者的尖叫声回荡在洛尔思无光的寺庙里，他们倒在她的女祭司的刀下。她的祭坛上堆满了头骨，这些头骨被潜伏在头顶的钟乳石中的巨大蜘蛛摘得干干净净。",
	"In return for victims and adoration, Lolth grants signs of her favor, such as great success during a slave raid on the surface, the matron of a rival house being struck down by an inexplicable illness, or an heiress to the house being born under propitious omens.": "作为对受害者和崇拜的回报，洛尔思会给予她青睐的迹象，例如在地表的奴隶袭击中取得巨大成功，敌对家族的女主人被一种莫名其妙的疾病击倒，或者家族的女继承人在有利的预兆下出生。",
	"Lolth is far from omniscient, despite what her priestesses say. There are drow who live without bending to the tyranny of her worship. Communities of renegades who dispute Lolth's primacy often raise another of the Dark Seldarine up as their patron. Although this amounts to exchanging one evil oppressor for another, any escape from Lolth's web can feel like freedom.": "尽管她的女祭司们这么说，但洛尔思远非全知全能。有些鸦人在生活中不屈服于对她的崇拜的暴政。对洛尔思的首要地位有异议的叛逆者群体通常会把另一个黑暗塞尔达林作为他们的守护者。虽然这相当于用一个邪恶的压迫者换取另一个压迫者，但任何逃离洛尔兹之网的行为都会让人感觉到自由。",
	"The Acropolis of Thanatos, erected in the ruins of a drow city wiped out by plague in the Underdark of Faerûn, was home to a drow settlement of a few thousand ruled by necromancer clerics of Kiaransalee. It existed for a few decades before worshipers of Lolth and worshipers of Eilistraee teamed up to eliminate its leaders.": "塔纳托斯卫城建立在法鲁恩暗黑区一座被瘟疫消灭的乌鸦城市的废墟上，是几千人的乌鸦定居点的所在地，由Kiaransalee的死灵法师牧师统治。它存在了几十年，后来洛尔思的崇拜者和艾利斯特雷的崇拜者联合起来消灭了它的领导人。",
	"Drow of the world of Eberron worship a scorpion-god named Vulkoor, which is their world's equivalent of Lolth. Vulkoor is often portrayed or envisioned as a giant scorpion or as a hybrid creature with the head, arms, and upper torso of a strong male drow and the lower body of a scorpion. The dark elves of Eberron revere scorpions, seeing spiders and other arachnids to be lesser servitors of Vulkoor. Many drow believe that Vulkoor and the Mockery (one of the group of evil deities known as the Dark Six) are one and the same. Drow from the jungle continent of Xen'drik ritually tattoo themselves using scorpion venom, leaving white scars etched into their skin.": "Eberron世界的乌鸦崇拜一个名为Vulkoor的蝎子神，这相当于他们世界中的Lolth。武库尔经常被描绘成或设想成一只巨大的蝎子，或者是一个拥有强壮的男性乌鸦的头部、手臂和上半身以及蝎子的下半身的混合生物。艾伯伦的黑暗精灵崇尚蝎子，认为蜘蛛和其他蛛形纲动物是沃尔库尔的低级仆人。许多乌鸦相信武库尔和莫克瑞（被称为黑暗六神之一的邪恶神灵）是同一个人。来自Xen'drik丛林大陆的乌鸦用蝎子毒液给自己纹身，在皮肤上留下白色的疤痕。",
	"Drow of other worlds rarely know of Vulkoor. Those who are familiar with his name consider him one of the weakest of the Dark Seldarine, a subordinate of Lolth who is disregarded by the other gods. Both visions of Vulkoor might be accurate, since Lolth seems to have little influence in Khyber but the drow there bear many similarities to the Lolth-worshiping drow of other realms throughout the multiverse.": "其他世界的鸦人很少知道武库尔。那些熟悉他名字的人认为他是黑暗塞尔达林中最弱的一个，是洛尔思的下属，被其他神明所忽视。对武库尔的两种看法可能都是准确的，因为洛神在开伯尔似乎没有什么影响力，但那里的乌鸦与整个多元宇宙中其他领域崇拜洛神的乌鸦有很多相似之处。",
	"Pain isn't a means to an end for Loviatar's faithful, but an end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent as suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest barbarism, to the most sublime torture, to the emotional suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed.": "痛苦对洛菲亚塔的信徒来说不是达到目的的手段，而是目的本身。对他们来说，没有什么比痛苦更超然的了，所有的痛苦都是神圣的，从最粗暴的野蛮，到最崇高的折磨，到伤心人或被背叛者的情感痛苦。",
	"The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady's attention, and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain is also a path to power, in terms of both one's ability to inflict it and one's ability to endure it. A cold, cruel demeanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain adeptness at manipulation.": "一个人感受到的痛苦是夫人关注的证明，因此她的信徒是臭名昭著的自我鞭挞者。痛苦也是通往权力的途径，就一个人施加痛苦的能力和忍受痛苦的能力而言。冷酷无情的举止被认为是最理想的，因为它最能模仿祸害女主人，同样的原因，她的信众也欣赏美貌、文化修养和某种操纵的熟练程度。",
	"Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are more numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is the chosen deity of those who inflict pain as a matter of course, including torturers and others who need to break the will of their victims. She is favored by sadists and masochists, and some of her followers form cultish cells of secret adherents. Each of these groups is led by someone who takes pleasure in administering pain and dominating others, supported and backed up by a number of submissive sycophants.": "虽然洛菲塔尔的庙宇很少，但她的信徒却比想象中要多得多。洛菲亚塔是那些把痛苦当做理所当然的事情的人所选择的神灵，包括施虐者和其他需要摧毁受害者意志的人。她受到虐待狂和受虐狂的青睐，她的一些追随者形成了秘密信徒的邪教细胞。这些团体中的每一个都是由一个以实施痛苦和支配他人为乐的人领导，并由一些顺从的佞臣支持和支援。",
	"Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers except in the more populous cities. When small cadres of faithful operate quietly in such places, few citizens take notice or raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The sufferers who endure the lash, however, aren't always willing participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes operate secret slavery rings, which can draw the attention of the authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and temples clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except in lands where slavery is an accepted practice.": "除了在人口较多的城市，洛维塔的崇拜者很少聚集在一起。当一小批信徒在这些地方悄悄活动时，很少有市民会注意到，或者在看到邪教活动时大惊小怪。然而，忍受鞭打的受难者并不总是心甘情愿地参与，洛瓦塔的邪教有时会运作秘密的奴役团伙，这可能引起当局的注意。除了在奴隶制被接受的地方，很少看到对洛瓦塔尔的公开崇拜和明显献给她的寺庙。",
	"While Gruumsh is the external force that pushes the orcs to victory over their enemies, it is the influence of Luthic, his wife, that binds them together and makes the orcs internally cohesive. She is the force that keeps the explosive rage of Gruumsh from bursting the orcs apart. If it was not for the followers of Luthic, it is possible that the race of orcs would be no more than small bands of warrior-nomads, scratching out a meager existence, rather than a force capable of great destruction.": "虽然格鲁姆什是推动兽人战胜敌人的外在力量，但正是他的妻子卢斯克的影响将他们捆绑在一起，使兽人具有内在凝聚力。她是使格鲁姆什的爆炸性愤怒不至于使兽人迸裂的力量。如果没有卢斯克的追随者，兽人种族有可能只是一小群游牧民族的战士，勉强维持生计，而不是一支能够进行巨大破坏的力量。",
	"Far from the den's war hearth, within the protective depths of the caves, the followers of Luthic tend the orc brood, raising them to be strong and cruel like their progenitors. By invoking the power of superstitions, omens, and traditions, these claws of Luthic hold the tribe together through ritual, fear and, if necessary, force.": "在远离巢穴的战火中，在洞穴的保护性深处，Luthic的追随者们照顾着兽人的孩子，把他们培养成像他们的祖先一样强大而残忍的人。通过调用迷信、预兆和传统的力量，这些卢斯克的爪牙通过仪式、恐惧以及必要时的武力将部落团结起来。",
	"Luthic is often thought to take the guise of an enormous cave bear. Her followers honor this aspect of her by keeping cave bears as pets to guard the whelping pens that are filled with squabbling young. Luthic's devoted also grow their claws long and paint them black to mimic the fearsome talons of their goddess. Luthic rewards them by making their claws as strong and tough as iron.": "人们通常认为Luthic会化身为一只巨大的洞穴熊。她的追随者为了纪念她的这一面，把山洞熊当作宠物来饲养，以守护充满争吵的幼崽的产房。Luthic的信徒们还把自己的爪子留长，并涂成黑色，以模仿他们女神可怕的爪子。卢斯克对他们的奖励是使他们的爪子像铁一样坚固和坚韧。",
	"Along with protecting the young and the tribe's food stores, the worshipers of Luthic also serve as the crafters, engineers, and builders of an orc tribe. They fashion crude weapons, armor, and the few manufactured items that the orcs need for daily life. When the tribe is away on raids, they are expected to dig deeper into the caverns of the den to create more living space for the ever-increasing population.": "除了保护年轻人和部落的食物储备外，Luthic的崇拜者也是兽人部落的工匠、工程师和建造者。他们制作粗糙的武器、盔甲，以及兽人日常生活所需的少数人造物品。当部落外出突袭时，他们要在巢穴的洞穴中挖得更深，为不断增加的人口创造更多的生活空间。",
	"Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that is red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is the center point between life and death - the facing off of hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and who dies. People believe that Malar can't be propitiated and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Malar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who delight in the hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor the fear of their prey.": "马拉尔是自然界黑暗面的缩影，是张牙舞爪的世界。他的信徒认为狩猎是生与死的中心点--猎人和猎物的对峙，迫使谁生谁死的问题。人们相信马拉尔不能被祭祀，也不知道怜悯，所以他只接受那些参与狩猎的人的祈祷。这些祈求者向马拉尔祈祷有两个原因：乞求他作为猎人的无敌技能的帮助，或者采用他可怕的衣钵，从而抵御其他掠夺者。马拉尔是那些以狩猎为乐、不避讳流血、享受猎物恐惧的人的神。",
	"Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine father, as do some other intelligent predators. He has many devotees who are druids and rangers of particularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as ceremonial weapons.": "许多狼人认为马拉尔是他们神圣的父亲，其他一些聪明的掠夺者也是如此。他有许多信徒，他们是德鲁伊和具有特别野蛮倾向的游侠，许多野蛮人把马拉尔作为他凶猛和残忍的守护者。他的祭司使用爪子手镯，令人印象深刻的铠甲，上面有从拳头末端伸出的风格化的爪子，作为仪式上的武器。",
	"Malyk embodies rebellion and chaos. Drow know of his influence from the appearance of wild mages among their number. Such an individual, possessed of sorcerous powers seemingly bestowed at random, is often seen as a threat to the established order. Many drow, especially males and even females of low station, try to attract Malyk's attention by secretly making sacrifices to him. Meanwhile, house matrons and others steeped in the faith of Lolth attempt to purge Malyk's worship from drow society-at the same time that some of them pray to him for power.": "马利克体现了叛乱和混乱。鸦人从他们中出现的野生法师那里知道了他的影响。这样一个拥有巫术力量的人，似乎是随意赋予的，通常被视为对既定秩序的威胁。许多乌鸦，尤其是男性，甚至是地位低下的女性，试图通过秘密向马利克献祭来吸引他的注意。同时，女主人和其他沉浸在洛尔思信仰中的人试图将马利克的崇拜从乌鸦社会中清除出去--与此同时，他们中的一些人还向他祈求权力。",
	"Malyk is associated with rebellion because when a wild mage's true nature is revealed, the individual often has no recourse but to openly attack others and create chaos. Most other drow vie to receive Lolth's blessing by being the one to bring such a blasphemer to justice. In order to survive, a wild mage must defeat or elude all attackers and forge an alliance with those who can be threatened or bribed to provide a safe haven. Most wild mages who are discovered are put to death, some survive as outcasts, and a rare few rise to positions of status, declaring their allegiance to Lolth-or at least pretending to.": "马利克与叛乱有关，因为当一个野生法师的真实本性被揭露时，这个人往往没有办法，只能公开攻击他人，制造混乱。大多数其他鸦人都争先恐后地将这种亵渎者绳之以法，以获得洛尔思的祝福。为了生存，野生法师必须击败或躲避所有的攻击者，并与那些可以威胁或贿赂的人结成联盟，以提供一个安全的避难所。大多数被发现的野生法师被处死，一些人作为被遗弃者生存下来，极少数人上升到有地位的位置，宣布效忠于洛尔兹--或者至少是假装效忠。",
	"Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells, spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in the purview of Mask. People whisper a prayer to Mask whenever stealth is required or intrigue is afoot. Courtiers and diplomats invoke the god's name in hopes of a smooth negotiation.": "面具是一个诡计多端的神，是不务正业者、间谍和盗贼的守护神。所有发生在阴影中的事情都在面具的管辖范围内。每当需要隐蔽或阴谋的时候，人们都会向面具低声祈祷。法院和外交官都会引用神的名字，希望谈判能顺利进行。",
	"Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and other forms of acquisition of what belongs to others, such as pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary folk pray to him to avert his eyes from their valuables, but the cautious sometimes employ \"Mask's purse,\" a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain sight (thus easily cut or lifted) containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask's purse when encountering another person wearing one, and considers the gain a gift from the god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to the Lord of Shadows for accepting a respectful sacrifice of a small portion of his goods. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost Mask's purse, but anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned Mask's ire anyway.": "那些支持面具的人通常追求偷窃和其他形式的获取属于他人的东西，如扒窃、盗窃、抢劫和骗局。普通人向他祈祷，希望他能避开他们的贵重物品，但谨慎的人有时会使用 \"面具的钱包\"，这是一个廉价的小布袋，戴在明处（因此很容易被切割或提起），里面装着少量硬币。按照惯例，扒手在遇到另一个戴着面具的人时，会偷取面具的钱包，并认为这是神的礼物，而丢失钱包的人则感谢阴影之神接受了他一小部分货物的恭敬祭品。当然，没有什么能阻止另一个扒手把目标放在丢了面具钱包的人身上，但任何运气不好的人，在一次出游中吸引了多个扒手，可能已经赢得了面具的愤怒。",
	"Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and often serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or demarchess, and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.": "面具祭司通常是以盗贼为职业，并经常在当地黑社会或犯罪集团中担任高级职务。他们的头衔是Demarche或Demarchess，以牧师身份行事时戴着面纱面具。",
	"The realm of Melora extends to wherever the seas shift and the land grows wild. As the keeper of the wilderness, Melora represents the wild creatures of nature, the rush of the angry rapids, and the heat-heavy stillness of the desert. Elves worship her, as do hunters, accepting her guidance to exist harmoniously within savage lands. Those seeking safe passage across dangerous waters pray to her to guide them.": "梅洛拉的领域延伸到海洋变化和土地生长的地方。作为荒野的守护者，梅罗拉代表着自然界的野生生物、愤怒的急流和沙漠中热浪滚滚的静谧。精灵们崇拜她，猎人也崇拜她，接受她的指导，在野蛮的土地上和谐地生存。那些寻求安全穿越危险水域的人祈祷她为他们提供指导。",
	"Followers of the Raven Queen also show respect to the Wild Mother as the caretaker of what remains when the Matron of Death's work is done. Those of Ki'Nau descent often make offerings to Melora, considering her a collective entity that represents their ancient nature gods within a singular feminine form. Druids of Melora the Wild Mother and clerics of her lover, Erathis the Law Bearer, work together to preserve the balance of nature and civilization. However, worship of Melora was outlawed in the Dwendalian Empire, causing disagreement between clerics of Erathis within Western Wynandir, where many blame poor weather and natural disasters on the ire of their deity's partner.": "乌鸦女王的追随者也对野性之母表示尊敬，因为她是死亡之母工作完成后剩下的东西的看护者。那些拥有Ki'Nau血统的人经常向梅罗拉提供祭品，认为她是一个集体实体，在一个单一的女性形式中代表了他们古老的自然之神。野生母亲梅罗拉的德鲁伊和她的情人、法律持有者埃拉西斯的神职人员一起工作，以保护自然和文明的平衡。然而，对梅罗拉的崇拜在Dwendalian帝国被取缔了，这导致西维南迪尔的Erathis神职人员之间产生了分歧，许多人将恶劣的天气和自然灾害归咎于他们神的伙伴的愤怒。",
	"Eschewing a permanent realm, Melora prefers to wander the planes to oversee natural life. She is often found among the unearthly beauty of Arvandor's infinite expanse of deep woods, hunting unnatural things that corrupt the wilds.": "梅洛拉放弃了一个永久的领域，她更喜欢在各个星球上游荡，监督自然界的生活。她经常出现在阿凡多无边无际的深山老林中，猎杀那些腐蚀荒野的非自然事物。",
	"Immortalized through wooden reliefs and carved idols in hidden, overgrown groves and rural shrines, the Wild Mother is shown as a beautiful woman with green skin nearly swallowed by a wild, tangled wreath of hair, leaves, and vines that dwarf her lithe form.": "野生母亲通过木质浮雕和雕刻的偶像在隐蔽的、杂草丛生的小树林和农村的神庙中被赋予了不朽的地位，她是一个美丽的女人，绿色的皮肤几乎被野生的、纠缠在一起的头发、树叶和藤蔓所吞没，使她婀娜的身姿相形见绌。",
	"Melora's holy day is Wild's Grandeur, which is celebrated on the vernal equinox, usually the twentieth day of the third month. The people of the Menagerie Coast set aside this day to sail for no reason other than the pleasure of observing the natural beauty of their surroundings. Those who still partake in elements of Ki'Nau culture take this day to appreciate the fruits and foods granted by the sea, leaving offerings of delicacies and small handmade crafts at temporary altars of twisted roots and grasses.": "梅洛拉的圣日是 \"野性的伟大\"，在春分时节庆祝，通常是第三个月的第二十天。美娜吉海岸的人们把这一天留出来航行，不为别的，只为观察他们周围的自然美景。那些仍然参与Ki'Nau文化元素的人在这一天欣赏大海赐予的水果和食物，在扭曲的树根和草的临时祭坛上留下美味佳肴和小型手工工艺品的供品。",
	"Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction.": "保护未被驯服的荒野不被开发和破坏。",
	"Slay abominations and other mockeries of nature.": "杀死可憎的人和其他对自然的嘲弄。",
	"Embrace and respect the savage nature of the world. Exist in harmony with it.": "拥抱和尊重世界的野性。与它和谐共存。",
	"People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she reigns supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good folk in any forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki to protect them until they are found.": "除了在安静的森林空间，人们很少谈论米利基。唤起人们好奇心的林地是她统治的地方，但据说她在任何森林里都能看护善良的人们，不管多么黑暗或残酷。当孩子们在森林里迷路时，人们会祈求米利基保护他们，直到他们被找到。",
	"Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual deity - less human-like than many other gods. She's not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest she hides in.": "米利基是森林和生活在森林中的生物的女神。她被看作是一个遥远而有灵性的神灵--比许多其他神灵更不像人。她并不是不关心人，但她的注意力和宠爱很难吸引。她是游侠的守护神，就像米利尔是吟游诗人的守护神一样，但即使游侠也很少直接向她祈祷。他们转而向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦（Gwaeron Windstrom）祈祷，他们相信格瓦隆-温德斯特伦会把他们的话带到女神那里，跟踪她到她所藏身的森林。",
	"Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to think of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen of the Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are thought to be boon companions. Mielikki's relationships with other deities of the natural world are more complex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her own path through the wilds.": "米利基的标志是一只独角兽，这使一些人认为她是独角兽，并将她与独角兽女王和它们的实际女神卢鲁伊混为一谈。但大多数故事将米利基描绘成一个美丽的女人，鲁鲁修允许她作为骑手骑在背上，两人被认为是好伙伴。米利基与自然界的其他神灵的关系更为复杂。希尔瓦娜斯有时被认为是她的父亲，艾尔达斯被认为是她的姐姐，但米利基在荒野中走着自己的路。",
	"She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a unicorn's head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the goddess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber cutters safe during the work.": "她有许多神龛，特别是在野蛮人的边境地区。大多数都是由一棵枯树干组成，上面刻着她的神圣象征--独角兽的头像。或者，这个肖像可能被刻在一块单独的木头上，然后粘在一棵活树上。这些神龛通常标志着森林中的一个点，当地人知道超过这个点就不能砍伐木材或狩猎。这些神龛通常是由伐木工人在伐木结束后创建的，以感谢女神提供木材并在工作中保证伐木工人的安全。",
	"Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is a god of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents the finished thought, the result of the process that takes an idea from conception to realization. Milil is most venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative endeavor also pray to Milil.": "米利尔是诗歌、口才和歌曲之神。他是创意和灵感之神，是整首歌的神，而不仅仅是歌词或音乐。他代表完成的思想，是一个想法从构思到实现的过程的结果。米利尔最受吟游诗人、游吟诗人和其他艺人的敬仰，但任何准备在众人面前表演或讲话的人都可以向米利尔作简短的祈祷，以获得成功的表演。那些在创造性工作中寻求灵感的人也向米利尔祈祷。",
	"His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes a human, sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places (such as Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. He is variously depicted as young or old, but his identity is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation.": "他的图标将他描绘成一个英俊的男性，有时是人类，有时是精灵，在有大量半精灵人口的地方（如阿格拉隆），甚至是半精灵。他被描述为年轻或年老，但他的身份总是显而易见的，因为他的五弦琴是由银色的树叶制成的，他一直带着它。他是所有表演者所向往的理想：姿态自信，魅力四射，是聆听他的人的灵感来源。据说，他能完全记住他所听到的或在音乐播放时所说的任何东西，并具有极强的即兴创作能力。",
	"Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in performance venues and schools of music. Whether the site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts of performance at his shrines and temples.": "献给米利尔的圣地经常出现在表演场所和音乐学校中。无论该场所是一个巨大的音乐厅还是一个小的合唱室，它都必须有良好的声学质量。米利尔的祭司除了自己是表演者外，还是艺术的赞助人，他们经常在他的神殿和庙宇里担任表演艺术的导师。",
	"Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, Milil is the god's left hand, also referred to as the One True Hand. This expression isn't meant to denigrate the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact that left-handedness is more often associated with great artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes from the acceptance of truth.": "与德内尔一样，米利尔有时被认为是为奥格玛服务的。在这些对神的描绘中，米利尔是神的左手，也被称为 \"唯一的真手\"。这种说法并不是要诋毁右手（Deneir）；相反，它源于这样一个事实，即左撇子更经常与伟大的艺术能力和最伟大的艺术来自于对真理的接受这一信念相关联。",
	"Mogis is the god of slaughter, violence, and war. He is hatred unrestrained, empathy denied, and mercy forgotten, an entity whose very presence incites mortals to violence. Soldiers fear succumbing to his blood lust lest they dishonor themselves, but the vengeful and forsaken call to him for the gift of his rage. He is the brother of Iroas, god of victory, and his antithesis in matters of warfare.": "莫吉斯是屠杀、暴力和战争之神。他是无拘无束的仇恨，被拒绝的同情心，被遗忘的怜悯，他的存在煽动了凡人的暴力。士兵们害怕屈服于他的血腥欲望，以免他们玷污了自己，但复仇者和被遗弃者却向他呼唤他的愤怒的礼物。他是胜利之神伊洛亚斯的兄弟，也是他在战争方面的对立面。",
	"The anger and malice radiating from Mogis is almost palpable. He exercises no control over his temper or his urges and lashes out at subordinates at the slightest provocation. Akroan soldiers are warned that to give in to his seductive battle rage is to risk becoming an {@i androphage}—a bloodthirsty killer wholly consumed by Mogis's fury.": "从莫吉斯身上散发出来的愤怒和恶意几乎是可以感觉到的。他无法控制自己的脾气和冲动，只要稍有挑衅就会对下属大打出手。阿克罗安的士兵被警告说，如果屈服于他诱人的战斗怒火，就有可能成为一个{@i androphage}--一个完全被莫吉斯的怒火所吞噬的嗜血杀手。",
	"Mogis cuts a terrifying figure, appearing as a four-horned minotaur of incredible size clad in spiked bronze armor and wielding a massive ebon greataxe. He doesn't debase himself by appearing in other guises to mortals—to behold him is to behold the cruelty of war personified. He hungers endlessly to defeat his brother Iroas in combat and thus become the sole avatar of war among mortals.": "莫吉斯是一个可怕的人物，他以一个四角牛头人的形象出现，体型惊人，身穿带刺的青铜盔甲，挥舞着巨大的乌木大斧。他不会因为以其他身份出现在凡人面前而贬低自己--看到他就是看到了战争的残酷性。他无休止地渴望在战斗中击败他的兄弟伊洛亚斯，从而成为凡人中唯一的战争化身。",
	"Mogis, like his brother, governs the sphere of warfare. But while Iroas thrives on the glory of honorable victory, Mogis revels in sadism, destruction, and the utter humiliation of the vanquished. He drives warriors to acts of cruelty and malice in their pursuit of victory. Only those who have experienced the terror and violence of war truly understand the seductive nature of Mogis's power. To feel rage, to be an instrument of wrath—these emotions override the fear of battle. In hatred there is strength, and Mogis revels in this fact. But mortals must beware, for the price he exacts in exchange for this strength is the sacrifice of decency, honor, and compassion.": "莫吉斯，像他的兄弟一样，管理着战争领域的事务。但是，当伊鲁阿斯在光荣的胜利中茁壮成长的时候，莫吉斯却陶醉于虐待狂、破坏和对被征服者的彻底羞辱。他驱使战士们在追求胜利的过程中采取残酷和恶意的行为。只有那些经历过战争的恐怖和暴力的人才能真正理解莫吉斯力量的诱惑性。感受愤怒，成为愤怒的工具--这些情感超越了对战斗的恐惧。仇恨中蕴含着力量，而莫吉斯就陶醉于这个事实。但凡人必须小心，因为他为换取这种力量而付出的代价是牺牲了体面、荣誉和同情心。",
	"To Mogis, the world is a canvas upon which he paints in blood. His goals are easy to understand, thus easily fulfilled by his minions. Mogis wants to unmake the world through savagery. Let every polis fall and the works of mortals burn—everything comes to ruin in time, and Mogis believes that time should be now. Only the most brutal and savage among the mortals should survive—his chosen few. Once the world lies in ruin with his brother dead at his feet, Mogis's goals will be achieved.": "对莫吉斯来说，世界是一块画布，他在上面用鲜血作画。他的目标很容易理解，因此很容易被他的奴才们实现。莫吉斯想通过野蛮的方式解除对世界的塑造。让每一个政体沦陷，让凡人的作品被烧毁--万物终将毁灭，而莫吉斯认为这个时间应该是现在。只有凡人中最残忍、最野蛮的人才能生存下来--他所选择的少数人。一旦世界陷入废墟，他的兄弟死在他的脚下，莫吉斯的目标就会实现。",
	"Mogis's existence is defined by his eternal struggle against his twin brother, Iroas. (Only a handful of contradictory myths address the parentage of these gods, but they are universally described as twins.) Any of Mogis's actions and endeavors contribute to undermining and ultimately destroying Iroas. Any divine relationships Mogis might enter into are born of convenience and as a means to the end. Mogis is incapable of loyalty and should be expected to break any pact or agreement once it has outlived its usefulness.": "莫吉斯的存在是由他与他的孪生兄弟伊罗亚斯的永恒斗争所决定的。（只有少数矛盾的神话涉及这些神的亲子关系，但他们被普遍描述为双胞胎）。莫吉斯的任何行为和努力都有助于破坏并最终摧毁伊鲁阿斯。莫吉斯可能建立的任何神性关系都是出于方便，作为达到目的的手段。莫吉斯没有忠诚的能力，一旦任何契约或协议失去了作用，就应该被期望打破它。",
	"Erebos appreciates Mogis's single-minded desire to destroy because it serves as a means to bring ever more souls into his realm. Also, Erebos occasionally steers Mogis's rampages in directions that inconvenience Heliod. This disruption inevitably leads to Heliod calling on Iroas to battle his brother, perpetuating the endless cycle of conflict between the twins.": "Erebos很欣赏Mogis一心一意的破坏欲望，因为这可以让更多的灵魂进入他的领域。此外，埃里伯斯偶尔会把莫吉斯的横冲直撞引向给赫利奥德带来不便的方向。这种干扰不可避免地导致赫利奥德召唤伊洛亚斯与他的兄弟作战，使这对双胞胎之间无休止的冲突循环持续下去。",
	"Of all his fellow gods, Mogis holds the most respect for Phenax. Mogis can't help but smile at the chaos Phenax is able to cause and the carnage the Returned wreak on the world. Phenax has a talent for inciting conflict, which allows Mogis to revel in the resulting strife.": "在他所有的同胞神中，莫吉斯对Phenax最为尊敬。莫吉斯忍不住微笑着看着菲纳克斯能够造成的混乱和回归者对世界造成的破坏。Phenax有煽动冲突的天赋，这让Mogis陶醉于由此产生的纷争。",
	"Mogis harbors an abiding disrespect, verging on hatred, for Ephara and Karametra. Ephara's neat, orderly cities are a delight to destroy, especially given her fussy, precise adherence to rules. Likewise, Ephara's close relationships with Iroas and Heliod provoke Mogis's disgust. Mogis disdains Karametra because she aids mortals and provides succor to the weak. These are acts of foolishness because the weak don't deserve aid—they are fodder for the strong. Setting fertile fields ablaze and witnessing the resulting famine is a source of enjoyment for Mogis, though he has been surprised more than once by the ferocity of Karametra's reprisals.": "莫吉斯对埃法拉和卡拉米特拉怀有持久的不敬，甚至是憎恨。埃法拉整齐有序的城市让人欣喜若狂，尤其是考虑到她对规则的挑剔和精确遵守。同样，埃法拉与伊洛亚斯和赫利奥德的亲密关系也引起了莫吉斯的厌恶。莫吉斯不屑于卡拉米特拉，因为她帮助凡人，为弱者提供救助。这些都是愚蠢的行为，因为弱者不值得援助，他们是强者的炮灰。焚烧肥沃的田地并目睹由此产生的饥荒是莫吉斯的乐趣所在，尽管他不止一次地被卡拉米特拉的凶残报复所惊讶。",
	"Mogis exhorts his followers to channel their hatred and rage into ever greater acts of cruelty and violence. He demands actions over words, making his followers an active and dangerous lot. From the spurned lover thirsting for revenge to the blood-drenched warrior on the battlefield, all honor Mogis with the shedding of blood in anger.": "莫吉斯劝说他的追随者将他们的仇恨和愤怒转化为更大的残忍和暴力行动。他要求行动胜于言语，使他的追随者成为活跃而危险的人群。从渴望复仇的被抛弃的情人到战场上血流成河的战士，所有的人都在愤怒中以流血的方式向莫吉思致敬。",
	"Minotaurs are the most ardent worshipers of Mogis and regularly hold bloody rites in his honor. Warchanters, the minotaur clergy of Mogis, whip their marauders into a near-mindless frenzy before battle; the ensuing slaughter gives glory to Mogis's name.": "牛头人是莫吉斯最狂热的崇拜者，经常举行血腥的仪式来纪念他。Warchanters是莫吉斯的牛头人神职人员，他们在战斗前鞭打他们的掠夺者，使其陷入一种近乎无意识的狂热；随后的屠杀使莫吉斯的名字得到了荣耀。",
	"The appearance of the blood moon is a most holy occasion for the faithful of Mogis, since the moon represents his hateful crimson eye. At such times, his followers prepare and consume a feast of meat, either raw or barely cooked, along with copious amounts of intoxicants, followed by ritual self-mutilation—scarring themselves to demonstrate their devotion to Mogis.": "血月的出现对莫吉斯的信徒来说是一个最神圣的时刻，因为月亮代表着他可恨的深红色眼睛。在这种时候，他的追随者们会准备并消费一场肉的盛宴，要么是生的，要么是勉强煮熟的，再加上大量的麻醉剂，然后是自我残害的仪式，以显示他们对莫吉斯的虔诚。",
	"The tales of Mogis's deeds exemplify his need to unmake, his brutality, and his desire to destroy his hated brother.": "莫吉斯的事迹故事体现了他对解构的需求，他的残暴，以及他对摧毁他憎恨的兄弟的渴望。",
	"One legend claims that Mogis and Iroas were once a single being, the act of war personified. But the inherent tension between honor and brutality in combat led to a dichotomy of purpose too great for a single god to reconcile. Ripping himself apart, the god split in two, and so did Mogis and Iroas come into existence, embodiments of the two aspects of war that are forever in conflict. Though no tales of either Mogis or Iroas's faith speak of such, whispers among the servants of other gods claim that there might be a way to piece the fractured god back together. Doing so would require an incredible feat, though, likely involving the cooperation of both Mogis and Iroas themselves.": "一个传说称，莫吉斯和伊罗亚斯曾经是一个单一的存在，是战争行为的化身。但是，战斗中荣誉与残暴之间固有的紧张关系导致了目的的两极分化，单一的神灵无法调和。撕开自己，神一分为二，于是莫吉斯和伊罗亚斯出现了，他们是战争的两个方面的化身，永远处于冲突之中。虽然莫吉斯和伊洛亚斯的信仰故事中都没有提到这一点，但其他神的仆人之间的窃窃私语声称，可能有办法将分裂的神重新组合在一起。不过，这样做需要一个不可思议的壮举，很可能涉及到莫吉斯和伊洛亚斯本人的合作。",
	"Mogis generally fights alone, because he often loses control of his temper and strikes allies as well as foes in the heat of battle. Still, Mogis sought a creature that would go before him, instilling fear in his foes before his mighty axe fell upon them. Mogis took a ferocious cerberus and bound it together with the fires of his eternal rage. This terrible new creation became his personal harbinger and battle companion. The god of slaughter didn't name his pet, refusing to do so until the beast had claimed a hundred thousand lives and so proved itself truly worthy of his esteem.": "莫吉斯一般都是单独作战，因为他经常会失去对自己脾气的控制，在激烈的战斗中对盟友和敌人都进行打击。不过，莫吉斯还是寻找一种能走在他前面的生物，在他强大的斧头落在敌人身上之前，给他们灌输恐惧。莫吉斯取了一只凶猛的地狱犬，用他永恒的愤怒之火将其捆绑起来。这个可怕的新造物成为他个人的预言家和战斗伙伴。屠杀之神没有给他的宠物起名字，他拒绝这样做，直到这只野兽夺走了十万条生命，从而证明自己真正值得他尊敬。",
	"In ages past, a warrior of tremendous strength stalked the battlefield. As a lone combatant, he was unbeatable, but he suffered when groups rose to oppose him. After one such defeat, the warrior was so filled with wrath that he murdered his entire village in Mogis's name. The god, delighted by this display, gifted the warrior with his own ferocity, remaking him as a reflection of Mogis's wrath and an engine of destruction in combat. This warrior became the first minotaur, and many minotaurs still worship Mogis, as he is their creator and they were made in his image.": "在过去的岁月里，一个拥有巨大力量的战士在战场上徘徊。作为一个孤独的战斗者，他是不可战胜的，但当群体起来反对他时，他就会受到伤害。在一次失败后，这位勇士满腔怒火，以莫吉斯的名义杀害了他的整个村庄。神为这种表现感到高兴，将自己的凶残赠予了这位勇士，使他成为莫吉斯愤怒的反映和战斗中的毁灭引擎。这个战士成为第一个牛头人，许多牛头人仍然崇拜莫吉斯，因为他是他们的创造者，他们是按照他的形象制造的。",
	"The summer festival of the Megasphagion is a domesticated version of Mogis's typical rites. It involves the sacrifice of many cattle to avert Mogis's wrath. The meat is then cooked and distributed among all who attend the festival. The grand feast that follows tends to devolve into a drunken revel. In some tales, individuals or communities with long-held grudges find themselves incensed during the festival, leading them to seek violent ends to their rivalries.": "夏季的Megasphagion节是Mogis典型仪式的驯化版。它涉及到用许多牛作为祭品以避免莫吉斯的愤怒。然后，肉被煮熟并分给所有参加节日的人。随后的盛大宴会往往会演变成一场醉酒狂欢。在一些故事中，有长期积怨的个人或社区在节日期间被激怒，导致他们以暴力结束他们的争斗。",
	"Shortly after his birth, Mogis decided to create a weapon with which to kill his brother. Mogis assembled his champions and sent them out to battlefields, where they collected the essences of rage, hatred, and bloodlust. Under a blood-red moon, Mogis used those ingredients to forge a black iron greataxe of manifest violence, Wrathbringer.": "在他出生后不久，莫吉斯决定创造一种武器，用来杀死他的兄弟。莫吉斯召集了他的冠军，并将他们派往战场，在那里他们收集了愤怒、仇恨和嗜血的精华。在一轮血红的月亮下，莫吉斯用这些成分铸造了一把明显暴力的黑铁大斧--愤怒使者。",

	"Mogis's favor isn't difficult to earn for someone who lacks a moral compass. Mogis demands that blood be spilled in his service, preferably the blood of Iroas's followers. Would-be champions should realize, though, that the god of slaughter invests in his followers with the expectation of receiving great returns. Those who disappoint, proving themselves incapable of sufficient cruelty or bloodshed, might find themselves on the wrong end of his blade.": "对于一个缺乏道德底线的人来说，莫吉斯的青睐并不难获得。莫吉斯要求在他的服务中洒下鲜血，最好是伊洛亚斯的追随者的血。不过，有意成为冠军的人应该意识到，屠杀之神在他的追随者身上投资，期望得到巨大的回报。那些令人失望的人，证明自己没有足够的残忍或流血能力，可能会发现自己在他的刀锋上吃了亏。",
	"To Mogis, the ideal follower is one who sheds all moral compunctions in the course of bringing suffering to the world. He also cultivates grievances and bitterness in those not ordinarily disposed to acts of wanton violence. Over the eons, he has found that the betrayed, the disgusted, and the disfavored are readily turned to a life of murderous service, to be discarded just as easily if they don't satisfy him. The Mogis's Favor table suggests a few ways that a mortal might come to Mogis's attention, or vice versa.": "对莫吉斯来说，理想的追随者是一个在给世界带来痛苦的过程中舍弃所有道德上的顾虑的人。他还在那些通常不喜欢肆意暴力的人身上培养怨恨和苦闷。长久以来，他发现被背叛的人、厌恶的人和不受欢迎的人很容易转而从事杀人的工作，如果他们不能满足他，也会被轻易抛弃。莫吉斯的恩惠表表明，凡人可能通过一些方式引起莫吉斯的注意，反之亦然。",

Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can death itself truly ever die? Myrkul's faithful see him as the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to Kelemvor to be judged.": "米尔库是一个古老的神，是三个前凡人中的一个，当杰格尔对他的神职感到厌倦并在他们之间分配他的影响时，他们被提升到神的地位。米尔库成为死亡和亡灵之神，统治亡灵之城达数百年之久，直到他反过来被杀。随着时间的推移，Myrkul回来了，因为死亡本身真的会死吗？Myrkul的信徒将他视为收割者，他对灵魂提出要求，并将它们带到Kelemvor接受审判。",

Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and obsessed with the dead and the undead. Like many followers of Kelemvor and Jergal, priests of Myrkul serve as undertakers and typically keep their patron's identity secret.": "密尔库尔是死亡、腐烂、年老、疲惫、黄昏和秋天的神灵。他是事物结束和无望之神，就像拉坦德是开始和希望之神一样。民间并不向米尔库尔祈祷，而是害怕他，把骨头疼痛和视力减退归咎于他。Myrkul被认为是没有激情的，甚至对他最虔诚的崇拜者也毫不关心。那些把米尔库尔当做守护神的人往往情绪低落、沉默寡言，并且对死人和亡灵着迷。像许多凯勒莫和杰格尔的追随者一样，米尔库尔的祭司担任殡仪员，通常对其守护者的身份保密。",
	"Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol appear in many places where humans bury their dead, but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles around are brought for internment, even if they were not of Myrkul's faith. There is little space set aside for the living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that throne sits the doomwarden - the preserved corpse of the most revered saint in the history of the temple (often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to kneel before a temple's doomwarden, where they must spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in complete darkness.": "在人类埋葬死者的许多地方都有米尔库尔的神龛或他的神圣标志的雕刻，但正式的寺庙却很少。少数存在的寺庙是神圣的地方，周围数百英里的死者被带到这里安葬，即使他们不属于Myrkul的信仰。在这样的地方，为生者预留的空间很少，通常只有一个简陋的神龛，但它的地下墓穴和骨髓库却很庞大。在每个神庙的最深处有一个宝座，宝座上坐着末日使者--神庙历史上最受尊敬的圣人（通常是其创始人）的保存的尸体。信仰的入门者会被带到寺庙的守夜人面前跪下，他们必须在完全黑暗的环境中禁食和冥想一晚和一天。",

The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.": "Mystra的信仰在Faerûn无处不在，这对于一个被魔法触及的土地来说是可以预期的。她的崇拜者包括那些使用魔法或与之密切合作的人，如炼金术士和圣人。神秘人寺庙的蓝衣祭司中也有魔法师和巫师，以及偶尔出现的吟游诗人。米斯特拉的信徒们的目标很简单：在整个王国中保存和推广魔法。她的追随者们通常会留意那些在使用魔法方面表现出高度潜力的人，并帮助安排这些人找到合适的导师进行指导。",
	"Once a powerful balor pursuing total annihilation of the Feywild, Naviask was transformed into a fey spirit by Queen Titania of the Summer Court after falling into one of her traps. Titania's magic changed Naviask's mission to destroy into a quest to heal scarred lands with nature. After the Calamity, Naviask was drawn to Exandria, where he currently remains, seeking to heal the devastation and ruin that still plague the world.": "纳维亚克曾经是一个强大的巴罗尔，追求彻底消灭仙界，在落入夏日宫廷的泰坦尼亚女王的陷阱后，他被她转化为仙界的灵魂。泰坦尼亚的魔法将纳维亚克的毁灭任务变成了用自然治愈伤痕累累的土地的追求。灾难过后，纳维亚克被吸引到了埃克桑德里亚，目前他仍然留在那里，寻求治愈仍然困扰着这个世界的破坏和毁灭。",
	"Naviask's followers say that the strange demon-turned-fey wanders the wastes of Xhorhas but is only glimpsed by those he wishes to see him. He aims to heal the land, but the magics that destroyed Ghor Dranas do not easily fade. He searches for those of similar heart and offers to share his power, so that the land might finally be healed.": "纳维亚克的追随者说，这个由恶魔变成的奇怪的精灵在Xhorhas的荒野上游荡，但只有他希望看到他的人才能瞥见。他的目标是治愈这片土地，但摧毁戈尔-德拉纳斯的魔法不会轻易消退。他寻找那些有相似心志的人，并提出分享他的力量，这样土地就可能最终被治愈了。",
	"Naviask retains his balor shape, but his demonic profile is softened by a verdant hue, and the flowers and vines that adorn his body. The former demon's inner fire has been replaced with sunlight, and he wields a whip made of pure radiance.": "纳维亚克保留了他的巴洛尔形状，但他的恶魔轮廓被青翠的色调以及装饰他身体的花朵和藤蔓所软化。前任恶魔的内在火焰已被阳光取代，他挥舞着由纯粹的光芒制成的鞭子。",
	"Nebelun, also known as the Meddler, is fearless, perhaps foolishly so. Every invention of Nebelun's starts with a wild idea, nothing goes entirely according to plan, and her greatest exploits often spring from mistakes. Who else would stroll in and steal Semuanya's tail as the lizardfolk god splashed in his favorite pool? Who else would use Thor's hammer to pound a nail and thus be inspired to invent the lightning rod? Garl never needs to persuade Nebelun to join an excursion, but he and the rest of the pantheon do have to focus her attention on the task at hand, so that her madcap inventiveness doesn't derail the effort.": "内贝伦，也被称为 \"爱管闲事的人\"，无所畏惧，也许是愚蠢的。内贝伦的每一项发明都是从一个疯狂的想法开始的，没有什么事情是完全按照计划进行的，她最伟大的成就往往来自错误。还有谁会在蜥蜴人之神在他最喜欢的池子里嬉戏时漫步进来，偷走塞穆尼亚的尾巴？还有谁会用雷神的锤子敲打钉子，从而受到启发发明了避雷针？加尔从来不需要说服内贝伦参加一次旅行，但他和万神殿的其他成员必须把她的注意力集中在手头的任务上，这样她疯狂的创造力才不会使工作脱轨。",
	"All gnomes see Nebelun as the delightful spirit of invention and discovery, even those whose livelihoods have nothing to do with the construction of odd devices. Any accident that fortuitously results in a new discovery might be credited to Nebelun's benevolent meddling in the affairs of mortal gnomes.": "所有的地精都把Nebelun看作是令人愉快的发明和发现的精神，即使是那些生计与建造古怪装置无关的人。任何偶然产生的新发现都可以归功于尼伯伦对凡人地精事务的仁慈干预。",
	"Nylea is the wild, carefree god of the hunt. She claims dominion over the whole of the natural world, particularly hunger and predation, the seasons, metamorphosis and rebirth, and the forest.": "奈拉是狂野的、无忧无虑的狩猎之神。她声称对整个自然界拥有统治权，特别是饥饿和捕食、季节、蜕变和重生以及森林。",
	"Nylea is among the most gregarious of the gods, and can be spotted frolicking joyfully with her Nyxborn lynx, Halma, or her favorite nymph, Theophilia. But she also savors solitude, and on the hunt she is deadly serious, almost animalistic, in her mood. She is nearly as quick to anger as her brother Purphoros, enacting swift revenge on those who harm the natural realm.": "奈拉是最善于交际的神灵之一，可以看到她与她的尼克斯族猞猁哈尔玛或她最喜欢的仙女西奥菲莉亚一起快乐地嬉戏。但她也喜欢孤独，在狩猎时，她的情绪是致命的严肃，几乎是兽性的。她几乎和她的兄弟珀弗罗斯一样，很快就会发怒，对那些伤害自然界的人进行迅速的报复。",
	"Nylea usually appears as a green-skinned dryad with woody extremities. Her hair is made of vines and leaves that change with the seasons. She might also appear as a majestic specimen of any animal, most frequently a lynx or a wolf. When she desires stealth or solitude, she might take the form of a tree, usually an oak or an olive.": "奈拉通常以绿色皮肤的干尸出现，四肢呈木质。她的头发是由藤蔓和树叶组成的，随着季节的变化而变化。她也可能以任何动物的雄伟标本出现，最常见的是猞猁或狼。当她渴望隐身或独处时，她可能会变成一棵树的形状，通常是橡树或橄榄树。",
	"Nylea is worshiped by hunters, but her concerns go far beyond humanity's ability to subsist on the bounty of the natural world. She controls the turning of the seasons. Usually, she ushers each one in and out on schedule, but when angered, she might refuse to change to the next season, or even call upon one out of its proper time. Mortals pray to her to ward off unseasonable weather, both natural and supernatural in origin.": "Nylea受到猎人的崇拜，但她所关心的问题远远超出了人类靠自然界的丰收来维持生计的能力。她控制着季节的交替。通常情况下，她会按计划迎接每一个季节的到来和结束，但当她被激怒时，她可能会拒绝换成下一个季节，甚至会在适当的时间之外召唤一个。凡人向她祈祷，以抵御反季节的天气，包括自然和超自然的天气。",
	"Nylea is the best archer in the world, and contests of archery are often held in her name. Those who hunt their own food pray to Nylea for success, and Nylea blesses their natural predation. Poachers and those who kill for sport, however, know that she loathes such activity, and they try to stay hidden from her at all costs. Nylea has personally slain many of those who killed wantonly in her sacred Nessian Wood.": "奈拉是世界上最好的射手，射箭比赛经常以她的名义举行。那些自己狩猎食物的人向Nylea祈祷成功，Nylea也祝福他们的自然捕食。然而，偷猎者和那些以杀戮为目的的人知道她厌恶这种活动，他们不惜一切代价也要躲避她。Nylea曾亲自杀死了许多在她神圣的Nessian Wood中肆意杀戮的人。",
	"Nylea's association with metamorphosis makes her the target of prayers from those who seek to dramatically change their own nature or identity. She is worshiped by those who want to reform or transform society in ways less violent than those favored by gods such as Purphoros and Mogis. She is also revered by those who cherish the solitude and serenity of the forest.": "奈拉与蜕变的关系使她成为那些寻求大幅度改变自己的性质或身份的人的祈祷目标。她被那些希望以比普尔福罗斯和莫吉斯等神所青睐的更少暴力的方式改革或改造社会的人所崇拜。她还受到那些珍惜森林的孤独和宁静的人的敬仰。",
	"Birth falls under Nylea's influence as well, and her priests often double as midwives in their communities, blessing babies as they come into the world.": "出生也属于奈拉的影响范围，她的牧师经常在他们的社区中兼任助产士，在婴儿来到这个世界时为他们祝福。",
	"Compared to the other gods, Nylea's goals are modest. She wants only to keep the natural world free and healthy, shepherd the seasons through their yearly cycle, and enjoy the beauty of the land. But in her darker moments, she realizes that the very existence of civilization on Theros is a mounting threat to nature—perhaps even an effort by the rest of the pantheon to destroy her. If it were up to her, she might well wipe away all the poleis and larger communities, leaving only scattered tribes of mortals to live in an enforced balance with nature. She isn't out to eradicate sapient beings, blaming her fellow gods for the spread of civilization rather than the mortals themselves.": "与其他神灵相比，奈拉的目标并不高。她只想保持自然界的自由和健康，在每年的周期中牧养四季，并享受土地的美丽。但在她的黑暗时刻，她意识到特洛斯上文明的存在对自然构成了越来越大的威胁--也许甚至是万神殿的其他成员想要毁灭她的努力。如果由她来决定，她很可能会抹去所有的极地和大型社区，只留下分散的凡人部落，在与自然的强制平衡中生活。她并不是要消灭有智慧的人，她把文明的传播归咎于她的同胞神，而不是凡人本身。",
	"Nylea seldom comes into open conflict with the other gods, and she would say that all her clashes with them result from their encroachment on her territory. The most frequent targets of her irritation are the gods who encourage the spread of civilization. Heliod and Ephara brought law and ambition to mortals, persuading them to congregate in stone-walled cities and consider themselves separate from her realm.": "奈拉很少与其他神明发生公开冲突，她会说她与其他神明的冲突都是因为他们侵占了她的领土。她最常激怒的对象是那些鼓励文明传播的神灵。赫利奥德和埃法拉给凡人带来了法律和野心，说服他们聚集在石墙的城市里，并认为自己与她的王国是分开的。",
	"Purphoros oversees some of the natural processes of earth and fire that help Nylea's realm flourish, but he also gave mortals the gift of bronze, enabling them to make axes and spears. In both his destructive and creative guises, Purphoros might threaten what Nylea holds dear. As a result, she remains wary of his designs.": "珀弗罗斯负责监督一些帮助奈拉王国繁荣的土和火的自然过程，但他也给了凡人青铜的礼物，使他们能够制造斧头和长矛。在他的破坏性和创造性的双重身份下，Purphoros可能会威胁到Nylea所珍视的东西。因此，她对他的设计保持警惕。",
	"Nylea is disappointed in Karametra, precisely because of the overlap in their spheres of influence. Karametra insists on transforming nature into a mockery of itself, yoking once-wild beasts and contorting plants through agriculture to feed the ever-swelling population centers.": "奈拉对卡拉米特拉感到失望，正是因为他们的影响范围有重叠之处。卡拉米特拉坚持把自然界改造成对自己的嘲弄，把曾经的野生野兽拴在一起，通过农业来扭曲植物，以养活不断膨胀的人口中心。",
	"Iroas and Mogis are harbingers of warfare, which is always devastating to the natural world. Nylea is virtually incapable of distinguishing between the \"noble\" and \"brutal\" aspects of their shared bailiwick, considering all forms of war a senseless waste of life and energy.": "伊洛亚斯和莫吉斯是战争的预言家，战争对自然界总是毁灭性的。奈拉几乎无法区分他们共同辖区内的 \"高贵 \"和 \"残酷\"，认为所有形式的战争都是对生命和能量的无谓浪费。",
	"Nylea acknowledges death as a crucial part of the life cycle, but scorns Erebos's obsession with the afterlife. What matters is that nature takes nourishment from the bodies of the deceased, not from the disposition of their intangible souls. She blames Erebos, Athreos, and Phenax in equal measure for the existence of the Returned, which she considers abominations.": "Nylea承认死亡是生命周期的一个重要部分，但蔑视Erebos对来世的迷恋。重要的是，大自然从死者的身体中获取营养，而不是从他们无形的灵魂的处置中获取营养。她指责Erebos、Athreos和Phenax在同等程度上是为了回归者的存在，她认为他们是可憎的。",
	"Mortals all over Theros pray to Nylea when they rely on hunting or nature's whims for their livelihood. Her most ardent followers are satyrs, centaurs, humans (particularly those who live in Setessa and in the wilds), and nymphs of all kinds, especially dryads. Few leonin worship any of the gods, but of those who do, many favor Nylea with their prayers.": "泰罗斯各地的凡人在依靠狩猎或自然界的奇思妙想维持生计时都会向奈拉祈祷。她最热心的追随者是萨提尔、半人马、人类（尤其是那些生活在塞特萨和荒野中的人），以及各种仙女，尤其是干尸。很少有雷恩人崇拜任何神灵，但在那些崇拜的人中，许多人用他们的祈祷支持奈拉。",
	"Nylea blesses those who are kind to animals, considering such acts as wordless prayers. Those who must kill a dangerous natural animal or cut down trees often pray to Nylea for forgiveness, sometimes leaving food for other animals or planting new trees as atonement.": "Nylea祝福那些善待动物的人，认为这种行为是无言的祈祷。那些必须杀死危险的自然动物或砍伐树木的人经常向Nylea祈求宽恕，有时为其他动物留下食物或种植新树作为赎罪。",
	"Most of the myths about Nylea are cautionary tales about the fate of mortals who profane her sacred forests.": "大多数关于奈拉的神话都是关于亵渎她的神圣森林的凡人的命运的警示性故事。",
	"Each spring, communities observe the festival of the First Hunt, the Protokynion. In ancient times, the festival involved hunting, but in the modern form of observance, it is a day of picnics, outdoor games, and frolicking that has little to do with Nylea except that it celebrates the full flowering of spring. Tales tell of Nylea being passingly bitter about the celebration and, annually, visiting a First Hunt celebration in disguise. If she finds herself duly honored during the revelry, she blesses the event and might personally participate. If she finds no mention of her works, she curses those in attendance, sometimes sending rampaging beasts to disrupt the event or turning participants into game animals for true hunters to stalk.": "每年春天，各社区都会举行第一次狩猎节，即Protokynion节。在古代，这个节日涉及狩猎，但在现代的庆祝形式中，它是一个野餐、户外游戏和嬉戏的日子，除了庆祝春暖花开，与奈拉没有什么关系。传说中，奈拉对这一庆祝活动顺手拈来，每年都会乔装打扮去参加第一次狩猎庆祝活动。如果她发现自己在狂欢中获得了应有的荣誉，她就会祝福这个活动并可能亲自参加。如果她发现没有人提到她的作品，她就会诅咒那些参加活动的人，有时会派狂暴的野兽来扰乱活动，或者把参与者变成猎物，让真正的猎人来跟踪。",
	"When a herder boasted that his cattle were Theros's finest because Heliod and Nylea had created them, Heliod persuaded Mogis to curse the cattle, transforming them into the first {@creature Catoblepas|VGM|catoblepases}. Heliod had hoped to win Nylea's favor by defending her honor in this way, but she was outraged to be associated with the creation of these abominations. To this day, Nylea offers a boon to anyone who hunts down a catoblepas and brings its head to her sacred grove.": "当一个牧民吹嘘他的牛是Theros最好的牛，因为是Heliod和Nylea创造了它们，Heliod说服Mogis诅咒这些牛，把它们变成了第一种牛（%0%）。Heliod曾希望通过这种方式捍卫Nylea的荣誉来赢得她的好感，但她对与创造这些可憎的东西联系在一起感到非常愤怒。直到今天，Nylea还为任何猎杀catoblepas并将其头颅带到她的圣林的人提供恩惠。",
	"Three young men from wealthy families were hunting for sport in the Nessian Wood. Nylea accosted them before they had taken any prey and gave each man a chance to bring her a gift that would atone for his intentions. The first man killed a stag and made an offering of it in her name, so she turned him into a stag to compensate for the one he had killed. The second offered wealth from his family coffers, so she turned him into a tree clinging to a cliff face by one root. The third, remorseful, threw himself on a bed of moss, and a cerulean butterfly came to rest on his hand. Carefully, he carried the butterfly back to Nylea. She not only spared him, but blessed his house and all his descendants.": "三个来自富裕家庭的年轻人在尼西亚森林里打猎玩耍。奈拉在他们捕获任何猎物之前就与他们搭讪，并给每个人一个机会给她带来一份礼物，以弥补他的意图。第一个人杀了一只雄鹿，并以她的名义将其献给了她，于是她将他变成了一只雄鹿以补偿他所杀的那只。第二个人提供了他家库房里的财富，于是她把他变成了一棵树，用一根树根固定在悬崖上。第三个人懊悔不已，把自己扔在苔藓床上，一只青色的蝴蝶停在他手上。他小心翼翼地把这只蝴蝶带回给奈拉。她不仅放过了他，还保佑他的房子和他所有的后代。",
	"In ages long past, Nylea loved her dryad companion, Arasta, as a sister and the two spread wonders across Theros. One day, Phenax, envious of the pair and stung by some forgotten slight, transformed Arasta into a terrible monster to prove that the goddess's love was based on beauty, not true kinship. Seeing the unfamiliar creature, Nylea was horrified and drove her away. Shattered, Arasta retreated and has terrorized the gods' servants ever since. To this day, Nylea remains deeply pained by Arasta's loss. Knowing that only Phenax can undo the curse he laid upon the dryad, Nylea often sends her champions to learn the secret of what might restore her friend.": "在很久以前，Nylea爱她的干尸伙伴Arasta，就像爱自己的妹妹一样，两人在整个Theros创造了奇迹。有一天，菲纳克斯嫉妒这对夫妇，并被一些被遗忘的轻视所刺痛，将阿拉斯塔变成了一个可怕的怪物，以证明女神的爱是基于美丽，而不是真正的亲属关系。看到这个陌生的生物，奈拉惊恐不已，将她赶走。受到打击的阿拉斯塔退缩了，并从那时起一直恐吓着众神的仆人。时至今日，奈拉仍对阿拉斯塔的离去深感痛苦。由于知道只有菲纳克斯可以解除他对干尸的诅咒，奈拉经常派她的冠军们去学习可能恢复她朋友的秘密。",

	"Nylea chooses champions who will tirelessly defend the natural world, regardless of their mortal ties and associations. She cares more for consistency of actions than for vows of loyalty and expressions of devotion. Whether you are silently devoted to her or vociferous in your praise, it is your actions in her name that will prompt her to continue her support—or withdraw it.": "Nylea选择了那些会不知疲倦地捍卫自然世界的冠军，而不管他们的凡人关系和关联。她更关心的是行动的一致性，而不是忠诚的誓言和奉献的表达。无论你是默默地奉献给她，还是大声地赞美她，你以她的名义采取的行动才会促使她继续支持她，或者撤回她。",
	"Because her interests are often tied to natural forces, Nylea's attentions can be unpredictable. What made the god turn her attention to you? What act of charity or feat of skill made her think you would be a good champion? The Nylea's Favor table offers a handful of suggestions.": "因为她的兴趣往往与自然力量相联系，奈拉的注意力可能是不可预测的。是什么让神灵把注意力转向了你？是什么慈善行为或技能的壮举让她认为你会是一个好的冠军？奈拉的恩惠表提供了少量的建议。",

	"Help relieve the suffering of the innocent.": "帮助减轻无辜者的痛苦。",
	"Deliver the light of Pelor where darkness dwells, with kindness, compassion, and mercy.": "以仁慈、同情和怜悯的心态，将Pelor的光芒传递到黑暗所居住的地方。",
	"Pharika is a god of affliction and medicine, alchemy and aging. In the earliest days of Theros, Pharika seeded the world with countless secret truths—mysteries of medicine, minerals with strange properties, nexuses of magic, and the like—which she hid among Nylea's wilds and the shadows of Erebos's Underworld, leaving clues where mortals might find them. It isn't altruism that drives her; she studies the innovation and suffering of mortals, deciphering in them ever greater mysteries as she treats Theros as her personal laboratory.": "法里卡是一位掌管痛苦和医药、炼金术和衰老的神。在Theros最早的时候，法里卡给这个世界种下了无数的秘密真理--医学的奥秘、具有奇怪属性的矿物、魔法的纽带等等--她把这些东西藏在Nylea的荒野和Erebos的地下世界的阴影中，在凡人可能发现它们的地方留下线索。驱使她的并不是利他主义；她研究凡人的创新和痛苦，在他们身上破译出更大的奥秘，因为她把塞洛斯当作她的个人实验室。",
	"Pharika typically takes the form of a green-skinned human woman with the lower body of a snake. Her hands are thickly scaled and a pair of bronze-scaled vipers seamlessly emerge from her chest. She is never without her kylix, a drinking cup within which she can produce virtually any medicine or toxin. When her aims require subtlety, Pharika often takes the form of a serpent or a medusa, or sometimes an aged human.": "法里卡的典型形态是一个绿色皮肤的人类女性，下半身是一条蛇。她的双手有厚厚的鳞片，一对青铜色鳞片的毒蛇从她的胸部无缝地钻出来。她从来没有离开过她的Kylix，这是一个饮水杯，她可以在里面生产几乎任何药物或毒素。当她的目的需要微妙的时候，法里卡经常采取蛇或冥王的形式，有时也会采取年老的人类的形式。",
	"Little escapes Pharika's cool gaze. Even when outwardly friendly, she is cunning and calculating, watching for the slightest sign of weakness or desire that she can exploit later. Those who offend her rarely recognize their misstep until she strikes.": "没有什么能逃过法里卡的冷酷目光。即使表面上很友好，她也很狡猾，很有心计，观察着最轻微的弱点或欲望的迹象，以便日后加以利用。那些冒犯她的人很少意识到他们的失策，直到她出手。",
	"Pharika represents the duality of life and death distilled into a single draught that can serve as tonic or toxin, depending on the dosage. She is most associated with affliction, whether that phenomenon takes the form of a disease, a venom, a drug, or the passage of years. Her cures are reliable but come at a cost. In some cases, that cost is pain as the medicine courses through the imbiber's body. In other cases, she demands years of life, either from the patient's lifetime or the researcher's labor.": "法里卡代表着生命和死亡的双重性，它被提炼成一种单一的饮料，可以作为补品或毒素，取决于剂量。她与苦难联系最紧密，无论这种现象是以疾病、毒液、药物还是岁月的形式出现。她的治疗方法是可靠的，但也是有代价的。在某些情况下，这种代价是药物在服用者体内流动时的疼痛。在其他情况下，她要求病人的生命年限或研究人员的劳动年限。",
	"In her oversight of life and death, Pharika acts as a patron of alchemists. Pharmacists offer prayers to her while crafting potions, as do the ill or infirm before imbibing a supposed remedy. Likewise, a body's slow transformation is sacred to her, whether it be the inevitable effects of aging or the petrification of her medusa children's victims.": "在她对生命和死亡的监督中，法里卡充当了炼金术士的守护者。药剂师在制作药水时向她祈祷，就像病人或体弱者在吸食所谓的补救措施之前向她祈祷一样。同样，身体的缓慢转变对她来说也是神圣的，无论是衰老的不可避免的影响还是她的美杜莎孩子的受害者的石化。",
	"To Pharika, Theros is an ongoing experiment and mortals are her agents in carrying it out. Rather than limit her knowledge to what her own insights yield, she revels in watching mortals decipher the world's wisdom and unearth its hidden knowledge, and she delights in seeing each sage interpret their findings in novel ways. She is willing to do anything to perpetuate experimentation and discovery, even at the cost of turning her less devout followers into specimens.": "对法里卡来说，Theros是一个正在进行的实验，而凡人是她实施实验的代理人。她并不把自己的知识局限于自己的洞察力，而是陶醉于看着凡人破译世界的智慧和发掘其隐藏的知识，她乐于看到每个圣人以新颖的方式解释他们的发现。她愿意做任何事情来延续实验和发现，甚至不惜把她不太虔诚的追随者变成标本。",
	"Despite her venomous reputation, Pharika has provided nearly every god with a cure or an otherwise essential tonic at a crucial moment. As a result, she's rarely in outright conflict with her fellow gods, yet she's always willing to jeopardize peace with her peers if it means indulging some audacious new experiment.": "尽管她的名声很毒，但法里卡几乎为每一位神灵在关键时刻提供了解药或其他必要的补药。因此，她很少与她的同伴发生直接冲突，但她总是愿意破坏与同伴的和平，如果这意味着放纵一些大胆的新实验。",
	"The gods of the Underworld have cordial relations with Pharika. She and Athreos enjoy each other's silent company, and Erebos appreciates her agenda, which ultimately bolsters his realm. Pharika rankles somewhat at the attention Erebos gets from dying mortals, chafing at their tendency to appeal to him when they could beg her for healing or for a painless death.": "冥界的诸神与法利卡关系融洽。她和阿斯雷欧斯享受着彼此无声的陪伴，而埃瑞博斯欣赏她的计划，这最终支持了他的境界。法丽卡对埃瑞博斯从垂死的凡人那里得到的关注有些不满，对他们向埃瑞博斯求助的倾向感到不满，因为他们可以向她乞求治愈或无痛的死亡。",
	"Pharika and the gods of civilization cautiously maneuver around one another's territory, with Ephara and Karametra recognizing Pharika's medicinal virtues, and she is always seeking subtle ways to use city-states in her experiments without provoking her peers. She disdains Ephara's and Karametra's desire to tame the world rather than understand it.": "法里卡和文明之神谨慎地在彼此的地盘上周旋，埃法拉和卡拉米特拉认识到法里卡的药用价值，她一直在寻找微妙的方法在她的实验中利用城邦而不激怒她的同僚。她不屑于艾法拉和卡拉米特拉想要驯服世界而不是了解它。",
	"Pharika has her most complex relationships with the gods of knowledge. Pharika loathes that Keranos gifts wisdom to the undeserving, while Kruphix represents mysteries even she has yet to fathom.": "法利卡与知识之神的关系最为复杂。法丽卡厌恶凯拉诺斯把智慧送给不值得的人，而克鲁普希克斯则代表着连她自己都还没有摸透的神秘事物。",
	"No god is more precious to Pharika than Nylea. She adores Nylea as the source of nature's abundant bounty and delights in Nylea's warmth. Anyone who threatens or offends Nylea is likely to also earn Pharika's enmity.": "对法利卡来说，没有哪个神灵比奈拉更珍贵。她崇拜Nylea，认为它是自然界丰富物产的来源，并以Nylea的温暖为乐。任何威胁或冒犯Nylea的人都有可能赢得法利加的敌意。",
	"The diseased and the dying alike often make written entreaties to Pharika for a remedy. Prayers are written on scraps of paper or shards of pottery, sealed in small pots, and buried in bogs, leaving them as secrets for others to exhume years later. Many people pray to her before undergoing a medical procedure, picking herbs, or confronting a venomous animal. Nights of a waxing crescent moon (roughly the first week of each month, when a sliver of moon lingers in the early evening) are sacred to Pharika and are thought to be an auspicious time to harvest medicinal plants.": "患病的人和垂死的人都经常向法里卡写下恳求，希望得到补救。祈祷词被写在纸屑或陶器碎片上，封在小罐子里，埋在沼泽里，作为秘密留待他人多年后挖掘出来。许多人在接受医疗程序、采摘草药或面对有毒动物之前都会向她祈祷。腊月的夜晚（大约是每个月的第一周，当一丝月亮停留在早期的晚上）对法里卡来说是神圣的，并被认为是收获药用植物的吉时。",
	"Pharika's followers include members of several small mystery cults, which embrace varying aspects of her divine nature. The most infamous of these is the Cult of Frozen Faith, led by a medusa. Initiates receive a lethal dose of poison, become {@condition petrified}, and then are restored to flesh one year later. Petitioners who have Pharika's favor emerge alive and healthy; those she doesn't care for fail to survive the transformation.": "法里卡的追随者包括几个小型神秘教派的成员，这些教派拥护她神性的不同方面。其中最臭名昭著的是冰冻信仰教，由一个冥王领导。入教者会接受一剂致命的毒药，变成（%0%），然后在一年后恢复成肉体。得到法里卡青睐的请愿者会活蹦乱跳地出现，而那些她不关心的请愿者则无法在转变中存活。",
	"Tales of Pharika emphasize her secret knowledge, with many legends hinting at apocrypha that a listener might track down to discover the god's most exalted lore.": "法利卡的故事强调她的秘密知识，许多传说都暗示了听众可能会追踪到的启示录，以发现神的最崇高的传说。",
	"So impressed was she with the deeds of her champion Aestraste that Pharika offered to fill her kylix with any draught for Aestraste to imbibe. The champion asked to taste the nectar of pure joy, and the god obliged. But when Aestraste took a sip, passion took hold of her, and she quaffed the entire elixir. Overwhelmed with ecstasy, the champion perished, having forgotten that too much of anything—even happiness—can be fatal.": "她对她的冠军Aestraste的事迹如此印象深刻，以至于Pharika提出将她的Kylix装满任何水，让Aestraste喝下。冠军要求品尝纯洁的快乐的甘露，而神也答应了。但当Aestraste喝下一口时，激情占据了她，她喝下了整瓶药水。冠军被狂喜冲昏了头脑，死了，因为他忘记了任何东西吃多了--即使是幸福--也是致命的。",
	"In Pharika's earliest days, her mind overflowed with knowledge, and she retreated to a secret, verdant glen. There, she set to scribing her secrets into the garden's fruits, hiding within each a dozen deaths and their cures. When she retired wearily to bathe, a lizard crept into her grove and gobbled up much of the fruit. It's said that this original basilisk and its progeny are still heavy with undigested secrets, and that if basilisk blood is distilled into ink, it can be used to write out forgotten lore.": "在法里卡最早的时候，她的头脑中充满了知识，她退缩到一个秘密的、青翠的峡谷中。在那里，她开始把她的秘密写进花园的果实里，在每一个果实里都藏着一打死亡和它们的治疗方法。当她疲惫地退休去洗澡时，一只蜥蜴爬进了她的小树林，吞食了许多水果。据说，这只最初的巴斯里斯克和它的后代仍然带着未消化的秘密，如果将巴斯里斯克的血提炼成墨水，就可以用来写出被遗忘的传说。",
	"During the first week of the eleventh month, Meletis observes Pharika's winter festival, the Cheimazion. The sick and infirm sleep in the god's temples during this festival in hopes of receiving a miraculous cure, and the truly devout imbibe near-lethal doses of poison, trusting Pharika to oversee their recovery. In some tales, a cobra with rainbow scales appears in Pharika's temple and bites some incurable soul. The envenomed victim pitches and babbles for three days, but their disjointed words prove to be a font of alchemical truths, sometimes bearing the secrets to healing others around them. In most of these myths, the victim expires at the end of these three days—Pharika's price for sharing her secrets—but in some, the patient recovers, thereafter exhibiting remarkable resistance to illness and poisons.": "在第11个月的第一周，梅莱蒂斯会庆祝法里卡的冬季节日--Cheimazion。在这个节日里，病人和体弱者在神的庙宇里睡觉，希望得到神奇的治愈，而真正虔诚的人则吸食接近致命剂量的毒药，相信法里卡会监督他们的康复。在一些传说中，一条长着彩虹色鳞片的眼镜蛇出现在法里卡的神庙里，咬伤了一些无法治愈的灵魂。被蛇咬伤的人在三天内不停地呻吟，但他们杂乱无章的话语被证明是一种炼金术真理的字体，有时还带有治疗周围其他人的秘密。在大多数神话中，受害者在这三天结束时死亡--这是哈里卡分享她的秘密的代价，但在一些神话中，病人恢复了，此后表现出对疾病和毒药的非凡抵抗力。",
	"Some texts of Pharika claim that within the chemical makeup of each individual dragon lies the cure to one specific disease or venom. Those desperate for a cure to a rare affliction often pray to the goddess to reveal the monster that embodies the malady tormenting them. Such insight, though, rarely decreases the danger of dragon hunting.": "一些关于法里卡的文献声称，在每条龙的化学构成中，都有对某种特定疾病或毒液的解药。那些急于治愈罕见疾病的人经常向女神祈祷，希望她能揭示出体现折磨他们的疾病的怪物。不过，这种洞察力很少能减少猎龙的危险。",
	"To seed the world with knowledge, Pharika gathered her medusa children and granted a hundred secrets to each, bidding them to hide their revelations throughout the mortal realm. Selfishly, the medusas each kept secrets for themselves, using these as currency to bargain with mortals. Angered that her children would hoard any of her secrets, Pharika cursed them, so that they could never after behold their own reflections without risking death.": "为了给世界播种知识，法丽卡召集了她的美杜莎孩子，并授予每个孩子一百个秘密，要求他们在整个凡人界隐藏他们的启示。自私的美杜莎们各自为自己保留秘密，用这些秘密作为货币与凡人讨价还价。法利加对她的孩子们囤积她的任何秘密感到愤怒，于是诅咒他们，让他们以后再也不能冒着死亡的危险看到自己的影子。",

	"Pharika craves champions who support her ongoing experiments, torment her enemies, and deliver cutting-edge aid to the suffering. Yet, just because someone serves Pharika doesn't mean they are immune to her whims. Why did Pharika turn her gaze upon you, and how did you survive long enough to earn her approval? The Pharika's Favor table provides several suggestions.": "法里卡渴望那些支持她正在进行的实验，折磨她的敌人，并为受苦的人提供最先进的援助的冠军。然而，仅仅因为有人为法里卡服务，并不意味着他们可以不受她的影响。为什么法里卡将她的目光投向你，你又是如何生存到足够长的时间来赢得她的认可？法利卡的青睐表提供了一些建议。",

	"Phenax is the masked patron of lies and cheats. He is Heliod's ethical antithesis, governing the spheres of gambling, deception, and betrayal. Phenax was once a mortal who was trapped in the Underworld, but he learned how to forsake his identity to prevent Erebos from detecting what he was doing. He crossed back over the Rivers That Ring the World wrapped in the tattered cloak of Athreos, the River Guide, who ushers the dead to their final rest. Hidden by illusion as he was, neither Athreos nor Erebos could find Phenax and bring him back.": "Phenax是蒙面的谎言和欺骗的守护者。他是赫利奥德的道德对立面，管理着赌博、欺骗和背叛的领域。Phenax曾经是一个被困在冥界的凡人，但他学会了如何放弃自己的身份以防止Erebos发现他在做什么。他穿过环游世界的河流，裹着河流向导阿斯雷欧斯的破烂斗篷，将死者送入最后的安息。由于他被幻象所掩盖，阿斯雷欧斯和埃瑞博斯都无法找到菲纳克斯并把他带回来。",
	"Able to play whatever role the situation calls for, Phenax is a consummate actor.

	"Phenax is a shadowy and mysterious figure. When appearing before mortals, he prefers the form of a willowy humanoid with ashen gray skin, clad in elegant robes. He has also been known to appear in a variety of animal forms, including the shapes of asps, mockingbirds, or rats. Regardless of his shape, a mask forever conceals the blank face of the first Returned.": "Phenax是一个阴暗而神秘的人物。当出现在凡人面前时，他更喜欢以柳叶状的人形出现，皮肤呈灰白色，身穿优雅的长袍。他也曾以各种动物形态出现，包括天鹅、嘲弄鸟或老鼠的形状。无论他的形状如何，一个面具永远掩盖了第一个回归者的空白脸。",
	"Subtlety and manipulation—of mind, word, and deed—are the cornerstones of Phenax's power and his influence over mortals and immortals alike.

	"He takes pleasure in finding ways to subvert or corrupt champions of law, order, and justice, turning them to his cause. Whether by feeding the hubris of a champion of Heliod or subverting the moral code of a stalwart of Iroas, he tempts mortals by confronting them with seemingly inconsequential decisions, each of which offers an opportunity for the person to compromise their principles. One by one, these acts move the needle of a person's moral gauge by a small amount. Over time, these choices accumulate until the individual's fall from grace is complete.": "他以寻找方法颠覆或腐蚀法律、秩序和正义的拥护者为乐，使他们转向他的事业。无论是通过喂养赫利奥德冠军的傲慢，还是颠覆伊洛亚斯中坚力量的道德准则，他都通过让凡人面对看似无关紧要的决定来诱惑他们，而每一个决定都为这个人提供了一个妥协的机会。这些行为一个接一个地将一个人的道德标准的指针移动了一小段。随着时间的推移，这些选择会不断累积，直到个人完全失去优雅。",

	"Erebos and Athreos despise Phenax, which delights him to no end. Phenax revels in the fact that, as a lowly mortal, he was able to outwit both the Lord of the Underworld and the River Guide.

Were he to discover a method to slay Phenax and return him to the Underworld, the god of the dead would pursue it over all other goals.": "Erebos和Athreos鄙视Phenax，这让他高兴不已。Phenax陶醉于这样一个事实：作为一个卑微的凡人，他能够智取冥界之主和河流向导。埃里伯斯仍然对菲纳克斯的欺骗感到痛苦，他想出了一些办法来折磨这个新晋的神。如果他发现了杀死Phenax并将其送回冥界的方法，亡灵之神将追求它而不是其他所有的目标。",
	"Phenax finds Heliod and Iroas overbearing and insufferable. Both represent ideologies diametrically opposed to Phenax's, and both have followers who regularly try to foil his schemes. In turn, Phenax does his best to upend their plans through lies and deception. After all, a fair fight isn't worth fighting.": "Phenax发现Heliod和Iroas盛气凌人，令人难以忍受。两人都代表着与Phenax截然相反的意识形态，并且都有经常试图挫败他的计划的追随者。反过来，Phenax也尽力通过谎言和欺骗来颠覆他们的计划。毕竟，一场公平的战斗是不值得一战的。",
	"Nowhere is Phenax's commitment to upending the status quo and angering his fellow gods more evident than in his role in the rise of Xenagos, the now destroyed god of revels. Xenagos's attacks left many of the gods disconnected from their followers, inciting a panic in Nyx. Phenax, basking in the chaos of Xenagos's plot, found myriad ways to covertly aid him until the satyr's apotheosis. Helping another mortal ascend to godhood was, to Phenax, the ultimate subversion of authority.": "Phenax对颠覆现状和激怒同僚的承诺，在他对Xenagos的崛起所起的作用中体现得淋漓尽致，Xenagos是现在被摧毁的狂欢之神。赛纳戈斯的攻击使许多神灵与他们的追随者失去联系，在尼克斯引发了一场恐慌。Phenax沉浸在Xenagos阴谋的混乱中，找到了无数的方法来暗中帮助他，直到萨提尔的神化。对菲纳克斯来说，帮助另一个凡人升为神是对权威的最终颠覆。",
	"Every lie is an homage to Phenax. Because his most devout followers are criminals and gamblers, his influence is keenly felt in gambling halls and dens of thieves. But everyone has their own reasons to stray from the truth at times, and thus, they also find small ways to seek Phenax's favor as they go about their daily lives.": "每一个谎言都是对Phenax的一种敬意。因为他最虔诚的追随者是罪犯和赌徒，所以在赌馆和贼窝里能敏锐地感受到他的影响。但每个人都有自己的理由，有时会偏离真相，因此，他们在日常生活中也会找到小方法来寻求Phenax的青睐。",
	"Formal services to Phenax are conducted at night, with the most sacred rituals performed on nights of the new moon. Offerings are made to attract Phenax's favor, with valuables from successful robberies, parchment filled with lies, or loaded dice being thrown into deep crags or buried at crossroads. Such sacrifices often vanish soon after, claimed by the god or his servants. Devout criminals often offer Phenax stolen goods as part of their preparations for premeditated crimes.": "对Phenax的正式仪式是在晚上进行的，最神圣的仪式在新月之夜进行。祭品是为了吸引Phenax的青睐，成功抢劫后的贵重物品、写满谎言的羊皮纸或装好的骰子被扔进深山峭壁或埋在十字路口。这些祭品往往很快就消失了，被神或他的仆人领走。虔诚的罪犯们经常向佩纳克斯提供赃物，作为他们为预谋犯罪所做准备的一部分。",
	"Phenax is worshiped openly in the necropoleis of Asphodel and Odunos, though the Returned who are loyal to Erebos's agent, Tymaret, refuse to worship the god they're hunting (see {@book chapter 3|MOT|3|Odunos}).

He was able to cross the Rivers That Ring the World wrapped in a shred of Athreos's cloak. Since he had no identity, Athreos couldn't detect him, and thus Erebos couldn't use his great lash to pull Phenax back. When he emerged back into the realm of mortals, he did so as the first of the Returned. In time, others discovered this quandary of metaphysics, which is now known as the Path of Phenax.": "Phenax曾经是一个凡人，像所有的凡人一样，当他在活人中的时间结束时，他被送到了地下世界的Erebos的照顾下。但Phenax找到了一种方法，通过将他的身份献给其中的记忆之水来逃离冥界。他能够裹着阿斯琉斯的斗篷碎片穿越环游世界的河流。由于他没有身份，阿斯雷欧斯无法发现他，因此埃瑞博斯无法用他的大鞭子把菲纳克斯拉回来。当他重新出现在凡人的领域时，他是作为第一个回归者出现的。随着时间的推移，其他人发现了这个形而上学的窘境，现在被称为Phenax之路。",
	"Before Odunos became a necropolis, it was a thriving city akin to Akros or Meletis. When the city fell before Phenax's assembled forces, some of the populace begged the god of lies to spare them the touch of Erebos's dread lash. Never one to miss an opportunity to cheat Erebos, Phenax made a solemn promise to those asking for his mercy, assuring them that they wouldn't be forced into the Underworld, on his honor. Soon afterward, the Returned that had invaded the city murdered these people to the last one—whereupon Phenax, true to his word, bound their bodies and souls to a great oak, making a terrifying amalgam of undeath to guard Odunos and haunt the living for eternity.": "在Odunos成为一个死城之前，它是一个繁荣的城市，类似于Akros或Meletis。当这座城市在Phenax的集结部队面前沦陷时，一些民众乞求谎言之神让他们免于遭受Erebos可怕的鞭打。菲纳克斯从不放过任何一个欺骗埃雷伯斯的机会，他向那些请求他怜悯的人做出了庄严的承诺，保证他们不会被强迫进入冥界，这是他的荣誉。不久之后，入侵城市的回归者将这些人杀得一干二净，而菲纳克斯则信守诺言，将他们的身体和灵魂捆绑在一棵大橡树上，形成一个可怕的不死之身，守护着奥杜诺斯，并永远困扰着生者。",
	"A pair of accomplished hunters, both fervent followers of Nylea, had a bet with one another to prove who was better with a bow. After countless tests found them equally matched, the hunters' rivalry drew Phenax's attention. Assuming the form of a dryad, Phenax goaded and taunted the hunters. Though amusing at first, Phenax's words cut deep, making the hunters careless. Thus, when the dryad suggested a blindfolded test of marksmanship, the hunters agreed. Once blinded, Phenax positioned the hunters to shoot one another. In the moment they fired, though, Nylea noticed Phenax's trick. She curved her hunters' arrows mid-flight and multiplied their number. Phenax's disguise shattered as he was riddled with arrows that pinned him to a great tree. Nylea appeared to the trapped god, mocked his pointless duplicity, and warned him never to threaten her followers again. She then left him to struggle free from the deeply embedded arrows, an escape that took him over a week. During that time, the god concocted plot after plot to have his revenge on Nylea. Some tales claim that this embarrassment directly led to tragedy for Nylea's favorite dryad companion, while others warn that Phenax's revenge has only just begun.": "一对有成就的猎人，都是Nylea的狂热追随者，他们互相打赌以证明谁的弓箭更厉害。经过无数次的测试，他们不相上下，猎人的竞争引起了Phenax的注意。Phenax化身为一只旱鸭子，挑逗和嘲弄着猎人们。虽然一开始很有趣，但Phenax的话语深入人心，使猎人大意。因此，当干尸建议蒙上眼睛测试枪法时，猎人们同意了。一旦被蒙住眼睛，Phenax就让猎人们互相射击。不过，在他们开枪的那一刻，奈拉注意到了皮纳克斯的诡计。她将猎人的箭在飞行中弯曲，并使其数量成倍增加。菲纳克斯的伪装破灭了，他被箭射中，被钉在一棵大树上。奈拉出现在被困住的神面前，嘲笑他毫无意义的两面性，并警告他不要再威胁她的追随者。然后她让他挣扎着从深深嵌入的箭中逃脱，这次逃脱花了他一个多星期。在那段时间里，神捏造了一个又一个的阴谋，向奈拉复仇。一些故事声称，这种尴尬直接导致了奈拉最喜欢的干尸伴侣的悲剧，而另一些故事则警告说，菲纳克斯的复仇才刚刚开始。",

	"Procan's domain is the sea, and whatever the oceans touch, he bears witness to. His mood shifts to darkness as he witnesses a brutal murder on the docks of a squalid port, then lifts in pride as he watches a brave mariner leap into the sea and save a drowning child. Every story of the oceans courses through his mind, and he in each moment curses and blesses mortals for their endless follies, heroism, and hatreds.": "普罗坎的领域是海洋，无论海洋接触到什么，他都会见证。当他目睹一个肮脏港口的码头上发生的残酷谋杀案时，他的心情转为黑暗；当他看到一个勇敢的水手跃入海中，救起一个溺水的孩子时，他又升起了自豪感。海洋的每一个故事都在他的脑海中闪过，他在每一个时刻都在诅咒和祝福凡人的无尽的愚蠢、英雄主义和仇恨。",
	"When the sea reaches its limit at the shore, so too does Procan's power. His clerics and priests rarely venture inland, and he cares little for what happens beyond his waters. At sea, he expects sacrifices in the form of fine food, potent alcohol, or valuable treasures thrown overboard at the start of a voyage. Due to this ritual, Procan holds all treasures lost at sea as part of his domain. He curses those who plunder shipwrecks without the blessings of his clerics, dogging their steps with wretched weather until his attention is drawn elsewhere.": "当大海在岸边达到极限时，普罗坎的力量也达到了极限。他的神职人员和祭司很少到内陆去冒险，他也很少关心在他的水域之外发生的事情。在海上，他希望祭品的形式是精美的食物、烈性的酒，或者在航行开始时被扔到海里的贵重财物。由于这种仪式，普罗坎把所有在海上丢失的财宝都视为他的领域的一部分。他诅咒那些在没有他的神职人员的祝福下掠夺沉船的人，用恶劣的天气拖住他们的脚步，直到他的注意力被吸引到其他地方。",

	"Purphoros is the god of the forge, the restless earth, and fire. He rules the raw creative force that infuses sapient minds. Purphoros is also the god of artisans, obsession, and the cycle of creation and destruction.": "珀弗罗斯是锻造之神，不稳定的土地和火。他统治着注入有智慧的头脑的原始创造力量。珀弗罗斯也是工匠之神，痴迷之神，以及创造和毁灭的循环之神。",
	"As a forge radiates heat in the area around it, Purphoros's influence provides inspiration to mortals. He makes exquisitely crafted objects almost constantly, sometimes absentmindedly working while he holds conversations with the other gods, only to destroy the finished product and begin again. Impulsive and mercurial, Purphoros is prone to bouts of either joyous productivity or frustrated anger. He often feels constrained by the limits of imagination, yearning to realize ideas that seem just out of reach.": "就像锻炉在其周围地区散发热量一样，珀弗罗斯的影响为凡人提供了灵感。他几乎不断地制作精美的物品，有时在与其他神灵交谈时心不在焉地工作，只是在销毁成品后又重新开始。珀尔福罗冲动而多疑，很容易爆发出喜悦的生产力或沮丧的愤怒。他经常感到受制于想象力的限制，渴望实现那些似乎遥不可及的想法。",
	"Purphoros's preferred form is that of a muscular man whose coal-hued skin is mostly covered in mutable organic bronze. He might also appear in the form of a fiery phoenix or a bull made of cooling lava, and for that reason, both of those creatures are associated with him. When angered, he might appear as an enormous mass of lava, a blazing fire, or a volcanic eruption. Mortals who see Purphoros in one of those forms seldom live to tell about it.": "珀弗罗斯喜欢的形态是一个肌肉发达的男人，他的煤色皮肤大部分被可变的有机铜所覆盖。他也可能以火红的凤凰或冷却熔岩制成的公牛的形式出现，因此，这两种生物都与他有关。当被激怒时，他可能会以巨大的熔岩块、熊熊烈火或火山爆发的形式出现。凡人如果看到珀弗罗斯以这些形式出现，很少能活着讲述它。",
	"The raw creative force that Purphoros embodies is chaotic, but Purphoros isn't a god of unbridled chaos. Rather, he shows mortals how to harness that primal energy, shaping it through passion and labor into something usable.": "珀弗洛斯所体现的原始创造力是混乱的，但珀弗洛斯并不是一个不受约束的混乱之神。相反，他向凡人展示如何利用这种原始能量，通过激情和劳动将其塑造为可用的东西。",
	"Purphoros is primarily associated with forging, metallurgy, and related activities. It was his followers who first brought bronze to Theros, and a few of his most favored have begun working with a new metal—iron—said to come directly from their god's forge-fires.": "珀弗洛斯主要与锻造、冶金和相关活动有关。是他的追随者首次将青铜带到了特洛斯，而他最宠爱的几个人已经开始使用一种新的金属--铁--据说是直接来自他们神的锻火。",

Keranos also inspires new ideas, but it is Purphoros who oversees the advancement of the craft that brings these ideas to life in the world.": "虽然珀弗罗斯主要对物理工艺感兴趣，但他对所有形式的创造都有影响。凯拉诺斯也激发了新的想法，但正是珀弗洛斯监督了工艺的发展，使这些想法在世界范围内得以实现。",
	"Purphoros is always ready to obliterate what is to make room for what could be, and to start the cycle again when what could be becomes what is. When he is inspired, the night sky glitters with new constellations, and anvilwrought creatures appear in the countryside. When he is wrathful, stars vanish in molten rain, and his hammer blows annihilate whole mountaintops.": "珀弗洛斯总是准备抹去现在的东西，为可能的东西腾出空间，并在可能的东西变成现在的东西时再次开始循环。当他受到启发时，夜空中闪烁着新的星座，乡间出现了铁砧锻造的生物。当他发怒时，星星在熔化的雨中消失，他的锤子击碎了整个山顶。",
	"Purphoros acts not because of grand plans or high ideals, but on the whims of his restless, creative mind. On the rare occasions when he contemplates what he would do if he were ascendant in the pantheon, his most fervent wish is to be left alone. To Purphoros, that would mean spending time by himself in his forge, creating anything he desires. But it also would mean being free to uproot mountains, topple cities, and reroute rivers without any of the other gods interfering.": "珀弗洛斯的行为不是因为宏伟的计划或崇高的理想，而是他那颗不安分、有创造力的心的突发奇想。在很少的情况下，当他考虑如果他是万神殿的长老会做什么时，他最热切的愿望是独处。对珀弗罗斯来说，这意味着他要在他的锻造厂里花时间，创造他想要的一切。但这也意味着他可以在没有其他神明干涉的情况下，自由地拔除山脉、推翻城市、改变河流的走向。",
	"Purphoros has few strong relationships with his fellow gods, considering most of them arrogant ingrates. According to legend, it was he who created the weapons of the gods, asking nothing in return. But his infrequent though memorable bouts of destructive fury have earned him more ill will in the pantheon than he realizes.": "珀尔福罗斯与他的同胞们很少有牢固的关系，认为他们大多数都是傲慢的忘恩负义之徒。根据传说，是他创造了众神的武器，不求回报。但他不常有的、但令人难忘的破坏性狂怒为他在万神殿赢得了比他意识到的更多的恶意。",
	"Heliod despises Purphoros's unpredictable impulses even as he envies the forge god's ability to create grand works. Purphoros resents Heliod's attempts to impose laws that constrain the passion of creation. In many ways, the two gods represent opposing approaches to the contradictions and challenges of mortal life, and they have more than once fought titanic battles in Nyx.": "Heliod鄙视Purphoros不可预知的冲动，即使他羡慕这位锻造之神创造宏伟作品的能力。珀弗罗斯对赫利奥德试图强加法律以限制创造的激情的做法感到不满。在许多方面，这两位神代表了应对凡人生活的矛盾和挑战的对立方法，他们在尼克斯不止一次地进行了激烈的争斗。",
	"Thassa is Purphoros's closest ally in the pantheon. Imbued as she is with the malleable, quenching power of water, she knows that he can neither destroy her waves nor reforge them. Because she has no fear of him, she treats him as a friend. Purphoros frequently makes wondrous gifts for Thassa, and her underwater palace holds countless unique creations of the god of the forge.": "Thassa是Purphoros在万神殿中最亲密的盟友。由于她被赋予了水的可塑性和淬炼的力量，她知道他既不能摧毁她的波浪，也不能重塑它们。因为她对他没有恐惧，所以她把他当作朋友。珀弗罗斯经常为萨萨制作奇妙的礼物，她的水下宫殿里有无数锻造之神的独特作品。",
	"Purphoros holds Kruphix in contempt for hobbling his mind after he engaged in a particularly destructive battle with Heliod. The forge god spent years addled and incomplete. He has since recovered his faculties, but he mourns the things he might have made during that lost time. Taking revenge on Kruphix would require careful planning, however, and Purphoros is unlikely to undertake such an effort unless another god goads him into it.": "珀弗罗斯蔑视克鲁普希克斯，因为他在与赫利奥德进行了一场破坏性特别大的战斗后，他的思想变得蹒跚。锻造之神花了好几年时间来沉迷于此，无法完成。他后来恢复了他的能力，但他为他在那段失去的时间里可能做出的东西感到悲哀。然而，向克鲁普希克斯复仇需要仔细的计划，除非有其他神灵怂恿他，否则珀弗洛斯不太可能进行这样的努力。",
	"Ephara and Karametra are, like Purphoros, deeply involved in the project of civilization. Purphoros's desire to overturn the established order with violence stands in stark contrast to their measured ways. As a result, Purphoros stands aloof from them.": "埃法拉和卡拉米特拉和珀弗罗斯一样，都深深地卷入了文明的工程中。珀弗罗斯想用暴力颠覆既定秩序的愿望与他们有节制的方式形成了鲜明的对比。因此，Purphoros对他们敬而远之。",
	"Purphoros holds dominion over everything that springs from mortal ingenuity. Most artisans say a small prayer to him upon beginning or completing the construction of nearly anything, from swords to fortresses to ships.": "珀弗罗斯主宰着凡人智慧所产生的一切。大多数工匠在开始或完成从剑、堡垒到船只等几乎所有的建筑时都会向他做一个小小的祈祷。",
	"Naturally, Purphoros is strongly associated with the forge, and nearly every smithy on Theros is a sort of ad hoc temple to him. Charms and idols of Purphoros hang from the walls in such places, intended both to inspire the artisans and protect them against accidents. Regardless of their professions, worshipers of Purphoros often light small fires in the god's honor, burning wooden crafts or drawings of their inventions to gain his favor.": "自然，Purphoros与锻造有着密切的联系，Theros上几乎每个铁匠铺都是一种临时性的神庙。这些地方的墙上挂着珀弗罗斯的符咒和神像，目的是激励工匠并保护他们免受意外伤害。无论他们的职业如何，珀弗罗斯的崇拜者经常为神的荣誉点燃小火，燃烧木制工艺品或他们发明的图纸，以获得他的青睐。",
	"The myths about Purphoros revolve around one of two themes: his wonderful creations or his explosive anger.": "关于普尔福罗斯的神话围绕着两个主题中的一个：他奇妙的创造或他爆炸性的愤怒。",
	"Long ago, mortals on Theros fought and hunted using weapons made of stone and wood. According to legend, it was a satyr smith named Tecton who discovered how to refine copper ore and work it into tools and weapons. Purphoros, delighted, saw this as the mortals' first tentative steps toward true craft. Some smiths, hastily copying Tecton's methods, devised a way to blend copper and arsenic into a crude form of bronze, but the forging method was dangerous and often yielded defective results.": "很久以前，塞洛斯的凡人使用石头和木头制成的武器进行战斗和狩猎。根据传说，是一个名叫泰特顿的萨提尔铁匠发现了如何提炼铜矿石并将其加工成工具和武器。Purphoros很高兴，认为这是凡人向真正的工艺迈出的第一步。一些铁匠匆匆忙忙地复制了Tecton的方法，设计了一种将铜和砷混合成粗略的青铜形式的方法，但这种锻造方法很危险，经常产生有缺陷的结果。",
	"To reward the smith who took the first steps, Purphoros appeared to Tecton and granted the satyr the secret of smelting copper and tin into true bronze. The manufacture and use of bronze weapons spread across Theros, launching an age in which heroes conquered the wilds and founded great civilizations. Bronze is still the most used metal on Theros—and will remain so, at least until Purphoros decides that more than a few are ready for the secret of iron.": "为了奖励迈出第一步的铁匠，Purphoros出现在Tecton面前，并授予这位萨提尔将铜和锡冶炼成真正的青铜的秘密。青铜武器的制造和使用传遍了整个塞洛斯，开启了一个英雄们征服荒野和建立伟大文明的时代。青铜仍然是特洛斯最常用的金属--而且会一直如此，至少在珀弗洛斯决定有更多人准备好学习铁的秘密之前。",
	"When the world was young, Purphoros was jealous of Iroas and Mogis and wanted a twin of his own. He created Petros, a Nyxborn double of himself crafted of divine bronze with a touch of mortal flesh. Petros aged as the eons passed, and Purphoros was forced to patch cracks with strips of bronze and refill the vessel of his Nyxborn twin. Petros lacks the spark of true life, though, and can't speak. He toils day and night in Purphoros's forge, making wonders that would shame any mortal smith but can never match Purphoros's work in beauty or originality.": "当世界还很年轻的时候，Purphoros嫉妒Iroas和Mogis，想要一个属于自己的双胞胎。他创造了佩特罗斯，一个由神圣的青铜和凡人的肉体组成的Nyxborn替身。随着岁月的流逝，佩特罗斯逐渐衰老，珀弗罗斯不得不用青铜条来修补裂缝，并重新填充他的Nyxborn双胞胎的容器。虽然佩特罗斯缺乏真正生命的火花，也不能说话。他在Purphoros的锻造厂里日夜劳作，制造出让任何凡人铁匠都感到羞愧的奇迹，但在美感和原创性方面却永远无法与Purphoros的作品相比。",
	"In Theros's earliest days, the people vociferously honored Heliod, Nylea, and Thassa for the comforts of nature. Gradually, Purphoros grew bitter that mortals never acknowledged his flames, which kept the earth warm and fertile. So, Purphoros quenched the world's core. For a year, a lifeless winter gripped the world, with neither the sun nor the seasons warming the corpse-chill earth. Ultimately, it was the mortal engineer Chersio who brought about the winter's end. Instead of cursing the situation, Chersio sought a solution, creating a hypocaust system to bring warmth to her community. Delighted with the innovation, Purphoros waited until Chersio completed and lit her substructure furnace. When she did, the god returned warmth to the entire world. Today, an autumnal festival called the Kindling or the Forge-Lighting (the Chalcanapsion) lends its name to the seventh month in the Meletian calendar. During this festival, worshipers keep a bonfire burning from sundown to sunrise, acknowledging that Purphoros warms the earth and makes the harvest possible.": "在Theros最早的时候，人们对Heliod、Nylea和Thassa的大自然的舒适性大加赞赏。渐渐地，Purphoros对凡人从不承认他的火焰感到痛苦，他的火焰使大地保持温暖和肥沃。于是，珀弗洛斯熄灭了世界的核心。一年来，一个毫无生气的冬天笼罩着世界，太阳和季节都没有温暖这个尸骨未寒的大地。最终，是凡人工程师谢尔西奥促成了冬天的结束。谢尔西奥没有咒骂这种情况，而是寻求解决办法，创造了一个暖气片系统，给她的社区带来温暖。珀弗罗斯对这一创新感到高兴，他一直等到谢尔西奥完成并点燃她的下层结构炉。当她这样做时，神将温暖还给了整个世界。今天，一个被称为 \"点燃 \"或 \"锻造-点燃\"（Chalcanapsion）的秋季节日被命名为Meletian日历中的第7个月。在这个节日里，崇拜者从日落到日出一直燃烧着篝火，承认普尔福罗斯温暖了大地并使收获成为可能。",

Leaving a sizable portion of its wounded body behind, a slimy fragment of Quajath burrowed deep beneath the surface and slumbered in the cold earth beneath Eiselcross to recover and regrow. When the Undermaw attempted to rise once more, the elemental ice of Eiselcross proved too strong, and Quajath remains entombed within the frozen north to this day.": "夸贾斯到底是被创造出来的还是托罗格的直接后代，这个谜团不得而知，但这个在灾变中侦察爬行之王前进路线的疯狂的巨大蠕虫生物被认为是在凶猛的最后战斗中被杀死了。它留下了相当大一部分受伤的身体，一个粘稠的Quajath碎片钻进了地表深处，沉睡在艾瑟克罗斯下面的冰冷土地上，以恢复和重新生长。当Undermaw试图再次崛起时，Eiselcross的冰元素被证明过于强大，Quajath至今仍被埋在冰冻的北方。",

	"God of atonement and compassion, Raei spreads the message of understanding and optimism in even the darkest of places. She believes that the corrupt can be redeemed, a mindset that led to a betrayal by the Lord of the Nine Hells, who decimated her followers during the Calamity. This misplaced trust caused many priests to strike her name from historical records, leaving her title and faith scattered to obscurity for much of the recent age. Only recently has her faith been rediscovered and her temples returned to prominence. The Everlight's followers are often rural healers and community philosophers, offering a voice of reason and empathy in angry and cynical times.": "赎罪和慈悲之神，雷伊在最黑暗的地方也传播着理解和乐观的信息。她相信堕落的人可以得到救赎，这种心态导致了九层地狱之主的背叛，他在灾变期间消灭了她的追随者。这种错误的信任导致许多牧师将她的名字从历史记录中删除，使她的头衔和信仰在近代的大部分时间里散落在民间。直到最近，她的信仰才被重新发现，她的寺庙也重新获得重视。长明灯的追随者通常是乡村治疗师和社区哲学家，在愤怒和愤世嫉俗的时代提供了理性和同情的声音。",

	"Like the other elven deities, Rillifane Rallathil was once a primal elf sprung from droplets of Corellon's blood.

	"When the other elven deities decided on humanoid forms, Rillifane took a different approach. He took as his principal form that of an enormous oak tree, taller and wider than any other. Its roots are so deep and far-reaching that they touch the roots of every other plant in the world, or so it's said. Through this network of tendrils, Rillifane remains aware of everything that happens in the forest.": "当其他精灵神祗决定采用人形时，瑞利凡采取了不同的方法。他采取的主要形式是一棵巨大的橡树，比其他任何树都要高和宽。它的根是如此之深，如此之远，以至于它们触及了世界上所有其他植物的根部，据说是这样。通过这个卷须网络，瑞利法恩对森林中发生的一切都保持着了解。",
	"When he chooses to travel to other planes and worlds, Rillifane takes the appearance of an uncommonly tall and strong wood elf with dark skin, handsome features, and twigs and leaves protruding from his hair.": "当他选择去其他星球和世界旅行时，瑞利凡会变成一个不寻常的高大强壮的木精灵的样子，皮肤黝黑，五官英俊，头发上有树枝和树叶突出来。",
	"In either guise, his main concerns are the welfare of forests and prairies, the passing of the seasons, and the lives of beasts. Most of his followers and priests are elf druids. They're just as insular and secretive as any other druids, which means their motives are often not clear to those around them.": "无论是哪种身份，他主要关注的是森林和草原的福利、季节的流逝以及野兽的生活。他的大多数追随者和祭司都是精灵德鲁伊。他们和其他德鲁伊一样孤僻和神秘，这意味着他们的动机往往不被周围的人所了解。",
	"Energetic debates have been held over whether Rillifane's oak tree exists only on Arvandor; has roots that extend to all worlds; is duplicated fully on every world that has plant life; or is only a metaphor for Rillifane's deep connection to nature. A growing sentiment among Rillifane's druids holds that the correct answer is \"All of the above or none of the above, depending on Rillifane's mood.\"": "关于Rillifane的橡树是否只存在于Arvandor；是否有延伸到所有世界的根系；是否在每个有植物生命的世界都有完整的复制；或者只是Rillifane与自然的深刻联系的一个隐喻，已经进行了激烈的辩论。在瑞利凡的德鲁伊中，一种日益增长的情绪认为，正确的答案是 \"以上皆是，或以上皆非，取决于瑞利凡的心情\"。",
	" Ancient trees are almost always incorporated into shrines to Rillifane Rallathil. Many forests in elven lands have sacred groves where such trees stand as silent witnesses to the events of the world. At the base of such a tree, amid its immense, gnarled roots, the druids of Rillifane place their offerings. Carvings of animals, golden acorns, snowdrops, and sprigs of holly or witch hazel are all common offerings to the god of the passing seasons and the beasts of the forest. Often a shrine to Rillifane contains resting places where one can bend knee and meditate at the base of the great tree.": " 古老的树木几乎总是被纳入瑞利凡-拉拉蒂尔的神龛。精灵土地上的许多森林都有圣林，这些树作为世界事件的无声证人站在那里。在这样一棵树的底部，在它巨大的、参天的树根中，瑞利凡的德鲁伊们会把他们的祭品放在那里。动物的雕刻、金色的橡子、雪花、冬青或金缕梅的树枝都是常见的供品，供奉给季节变化和森林中的野兽之神。里利法恩的神龛通常包含休息场所，人们可以在大树的底部屈膝冥想。",
	"The druids of Rillifane consider trees to be symbolic of the connection between the mental and the physical, between what is illuminated and what remains mysterious. Trunks and branches reach high into the expanse of the mind and the realm of revelation, while roots sink deep, anchoring themselves in the known and enwrapping what remains hidden. When Rillifane's druids meditate at the site of a great tree, they can receive visions that afford them a new way of seeing the world. Often these flashes compel the devotee to undertake a quest to bring balance to the natural order by delivering a vital message or completing some other task.": "瑞利凡的德鲁伊认为树木象征着精神和物质之间的联系，象征着被照亮的东西和保持神秘的东西。树干和树枝高高地伸向广阔的心灵和启示的领域，而树根则深深地陷下去，将自己固定在已知的事物上，并将隐藏的事物包裹起来。当瑞利凡的德鲁伊在一棵大树下冥想时，他们可以得到幻觉，让他们以新的方式看待这个世界。这些闪光通常会迫使信徒进行探索，通过传递重要信息或完成一些其他任务，为自然秩序带来平衡。",
	"Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few people worship him, but many pray to him when performing small rituals of foresight. For example, young men and women sometimes attempt to divine the names of their future spouses by saying a rhyming chant that calls upon Savras while gazing in a mirror.": "萨弗拉是一个占卜和算命的神。很少有人崇拜他，但许多人在举行预知的小仪式时向他祈祷。例如，年轻男子和妇女有时会在照镜子时，通过念念有词的咒语，呼唤萨瓦拉，试图占卜他们未来配偶的名字。",
	"Savras has no currently active temples in Faerûn, and his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras, including investigators, diviners, judges, and others who have a need to uncover the truth. Such individuals can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras was trapped in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and embellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it a welcoming place to stop for a time.": "萨弗拉斯目前在法鲁恩没有活跃的寺庙，他的神龛也很少，都藏在图书馆和剧本馆的角落里。尽管他的地位并不显赫，但某些人还是经常向萨弗拉斯致敬，包括调查员、占卜师、法官和其他需要揭开真相的人。这些人有时可以通过他们携带的向萨弗拉斯致敬的精致法杖来识别。根据传说，萨弗拉被困于阿祖斯的法杖中已久。只要萨乌斯宣誓效忠，阿祖斯最终释放了萨乌斯，如今这根法杖是那些敬仰萨乌斯的人的有力象征。虔诚的崇拜者不遗余力地装饰和修饰他们的法杖，每个人都希望萨弗拉斯能发现它是一个受欢迎的地方，可以停留一段时间。",
	"The gnomes know Segojan Earthcaller as a kind, modest hero. He is said to be the best cook among the gnome gods and to have the power to heal any sickness, because he knows the medicinal and culinary uses of every creature and plant that lives underground. During the misadventures of the gnome pantheon, Segojan contributes to the group through his healing abilities and the restorative power of his meals, and on many occasions the other gnome gods call upon him to use his ability to burrow through any substance.": "地精们知道Segojan Earthcaller是一个善良、谦虚的英雄。据说他是地精诸神中最好的厨师，并且有能力治愈任何疾病，因为他知道每一种生活在地下的生物和植物的药用和烹饪用途。在地精众神的不幸遭遇中，塞戈扬通过他的治疗能力和他的饭菜的恢复能力为大家做出了贡献，在许多场合下，其他地精神灵都要求他使用他的能力来钻探任何物质。",
	"Forest gnomes believe that their ability to speak with burrowing animals comes from Segojan. All gnomes see Segojan as a healer of the sick and a protector of the hearth. He is also revered in his role as a guide for gnomish souls after death, as long as the body is buried before worms claim it. If a gnome's body isn't entrusted to Segojan by interring it, the soul is forced to find its own way to the afterlife.": "森林地精相信，他们与穴居动物对话的能力来自Segojan。所有的地精都认为Segojan是病人的治疗者和炉灶的保护者。他还被尊称为地精死后灵魂的向导，只要尸体在虫子来之前被埋葬。如果地精的尸体没有被埋葬而委托给Segojan，那么灵魂就会被迫自己寻找来世的路。",
	"Sehanine is the god of moonlight and the autumn season, as well as the patron of illusions and misdirection. Widely worshiped in halfling and elven cultures, she is considered to be the deity of love, protecting the trysts of lovers with shadows of her own making. Those who work in darkness and trickery often ask for her blessing.": "Sehanine是月光和秋季之神，也是幻觉和误导的守护神。她在半身人和精灵文化中受到广泛的崇拜，被认为是爱情之神，用她自己制造的影子保护恋人的尝试。那些从事黑暗和诡计的人经常要求她的祝福。",

	"The Moon Weaver's depictions are as numerous as the myths and stories of her meddling with the unions of mortals. She is most often painted as a young girl with light-blue skin and white hair, her body and limbs merely wavy silk strands of silver moonlight that caress and create the edges of the shadows around her.": "对织月者的描述就像她插手凡人婚姻的神话和故事一样多。她最常被画成一个有着浅蓝色皮肤和白色头发的年轻女孩，她的身体和四肢只是银色月光的波浪形丝线，抚摸和创造她周围阴影的边缘。",
	"Sehanine has no holy day but is celebrated by the elves on the night of the decade's largest full moon. Elven astronomers track the moon's phases and how it grows closer and farther to Exandria to predict these days with great accuracy. Many haughty elves use this festival as an excuse to be sly and mischievous, while younger elves use costumes and illusions to prank their peers. Some elves of Bysaes Tyl hold a secret festival in the Pearlbow Wilderness during the full moon, since the Dwendalian Empire doesn't allow worship of the Moon Weaver.": "Sehanine没有圣日，但精灵们会在十年中最大的满月之夜进行庆祝。精灵天文学家追踪月相以及它与埃克桑德里亚的距离如何拉近和拉远，以非常准确地预测这些日子。许多傲慢的精灵利用这个节日作为狡猾和调皮的借口，而年轻的精灵则利用服装和幻觉来恶搞他们的同伴。比塞斯-泰尔的一些精灵在满月时在珍珠弓荒野举行秘密节日，因为德文达利亚帝国不允许崇拜织月者。",

	"No god of the Seldarine is as intertwined with Corellon or presents so many paradoxes for worshipers to unravel, but this role befits Sehanine, for she is a god of mysteries as much as anything else. Many non-elves find it easiest to think of Sehanine as the companion of Corellon and the god of the moon, but to elves she is much more than that. The moon passes from one phase to the next, and Sehanine watches over all such cycles, be it from season to season or cradle to grave. She is midwife to elf mothers, ushering souls into the world. She is also thought to stand beside dying elves, to greet their departing spirits and set them on the path to Arvandor. Sehanine serves as patron of the lost and any who travel, as well as those who seek meaning. Elves beseech her to provide relief from madness, and they mark her symbol on graves and tombs to invoke her protection of the dead. In these comforting aspects, Sehanine is often imagined as a willowy, gentle male elf with shining eyes that reveal both melancholy and tenderness in their gaze when depicted alongside his beloved Corellon.": "没有哪位塞尔达林神与科里隆交织在一起，也没有哪位神提出如此多的悖论供崇拜者解开，但这个角色适合塞哈宁，因为她是一位神秘之神，就像其他东西一样。许多非精灵认为把塞哈宁看作是科里隆的伙伴和月亮之神是最容易的，但对精灵来说，她的作用远不止于此。月亮从一个阶段转到下一个阶段，而塞哈尼恩监视着所有这些周期，无论是从季节到季节还是从摇篮到坟墓。她是精灵母亲的助产士，将灵魂带入世界。她也被认为是站在垂死的精灵身边，迎接他们离去的灵魂，让他们走上通往阿凡多的道路。Sehanine是迷失者和任何旅行者的守护神，也是那些寻求意义的人的守护神。精灵们恳求她为他们提供解脱疯狂的方法，他们在坟墓和墓穴上标记她的符号，以祈求她对死者的保护。在这些令人欣慰的方面，塞哈宁经常被想象成一个柳树般的、温柔的男性精灵，当他和他心爱的科瑞隆一起被描绘时，他闪亮的眼睛在目光中透露着忧郁和温柔。",
	"In stories of the Seldarine, Sehanine is Corellon's steadfast companion, the one being who can persuade Corellon to pause and reflect rather than allow his emotions to rule him. Corellon can be resplendent with joy or shaking with anger, but a word or a look from Sehanine is enough to check or subtly alter Corellon's mood and behavior, redirecting the god to a less extreme course of action. Some elven legends treat Sehanine as Corellon's spouse or as a favored child, but other stories hint at a deeper truth. They say Sehanine was formed from the first drop of blood spilled from Corellon's body, and so she reminds Corellon that even as a divine being, he can be harmed.": "在塞尔达林的故事中，塞哈宁是科里隆坚定的伙伴，是能够说服科里隆暂停和思考而不是让他的情绪支配他的一个存在。科瑞隆可以因喜悦而灿烂，也可以因愤怒而颤抖，但塞哈尼恩的一句话或一个眼神就足以检查或巧妙地改变科瑞隆的情绪和行为，将神重新引导到一个不太极端的行动方案。一些精灵的传说将塞哈宁视为科里隆的配偶或受宠的孩子，但其他故事暗示了更深层次的真相。他们说Sehanine是由Corellon身体里溢出的第一滴血形成的，因此她提醒Corellon，即使是作为一个神圣的存在，他也会受到伤害。",
	"Sehanine's priests often seek her guidance by entering into a state of true sleep and sifting through their dreams for signs. But Sehanine has another way of sending messages to the elves of the world. The crescent-shaped cataracts that appear in the eyes of an elderly elf at Transcendence are symbolic of the moonbow, an astronomical phenomenon with which she is associated. It appears in the night sky above the moon as a luminous arc of refracted light, no brighter than the moon itself. Only elves and some half-elves can perceive this sign, for it is meant only for Corellon's people. What it signifies depends on the phase of the moon. Above a full moon, when it is most often detected, it means that an elf of great importance and advanced age will soon journey to Arvandor. Elves who see the sign might be compelled to seek out this individual to commune with and learn from before the elder departs the world. The moonbow appearing above the moon during its other phases can be interpreted in many ways, depending on the season and the timing of its appearance. A moonbow appearing above a new moon is the most dreaded sign, for it is said to signal a coming period of great upheaval and many deaths.": "Sehanine的祭司们经常通过进入真正的睡眠状态来寻求她的指导，并在他们的梦中筛选出各种迹象。但是Sehanine还有另一种方式向世界上的精灵们传递信息。在 \"超凡 \"的一个老年精灵眼中出现的新月形白内障，象征着月弓，一种与她有关的天文现象。它出现在月亮上方的夜空中，是一个发光的折射弧，不比月亮本身更亮。只有精灵和一些半精灵能察觉这个标志，因为它只针对科瑞隆的人。它所象征的东西取决于月球的阶段。在满月之上，也就是它最常被发现的时候，它意味着一个非常重要和年长的精灵不久将前往阿凡多。看到这个征兆的精灵可能会被迫寻找这个人，在长者离开世界之前与之交流并向其学习。在其他阶段出现在月亮上方的月弓可以有多种解释，这取决于季节和出现的时间。出现在新月之上的月弓是最可怕的标志，因为据说它预示着一个巨大的动荡和许多人死亡的时期即将到来。",
	" Temples to Sehanine Moonbow are almost always aligned with the heavens to enable the priests to track the motion and phases of the moon. The sleeping quarters of the priests are positioned such that a shaft of light from the full moon falls on them while they are sleeping, and this silver light of Sehanine can influence their dreams and impart messages to them.": " Sehanine Moonbow的寺庙几乎总是与天体保持一致，以使祭司能够跟踪月球的运动和阶段。祭司们的睡房被安排在这样的位置：当他们睡觉时，满月的光柱落在他们身上，塞哈宁的这种银光可以影响他们的梦境并向他们传授信息。",
	"Offerings to Sehanine are mostly made from silver, often shaped in a way that is reminiscent of the full moon. Cups, bowls, cloak pins, and plates of silver are found at her shrines, as well as those dedicated to the Seldarine collectively. The weapons and gear used by her followers, such as silver arrowheads, knife blades, and wooden shields, are often decorated with a stylized image of Sehanine's eye with rays coming out of it-a warning to the elves' enemies that Sehanine's gaze has fallen upon them.": "献给塞纳琳的祭品大多由银制成，其形状往往让人联想到满月的样子。杯子、碗、斗篷针和银盘在她的神殿以及那些集体供奉塞尔达林的神殿中都能找到。她的追随者使用的武器和装备，如银制箭头、刀刃和木制盾牌，通常都装饰有塞纳琳眼睛的风格化图像，并有光线射出--这是对精灵的敌人的警告，塞纳琳的目光已经落在他们身上。",
	"Drow regard Selvetarm as the Champion of Lolth and the patron of drow warriors. He is portrayed as an eightarmed drow that represents the epitome of fighting prowess. But Lolth rarely looses her champion to do her bidding, keeping him snared by unbreakable webs that she removes only in times of direst need.": "鸦人将塞尔维塔姆视为洛尔思的冠军和鸦人战士的守护神。他被描绘成一个八臂的乌鸦，代表着战斗力的缩影。但洛尔思很少让她的冠军听从她的命令，她用牢不可破的网将他套住，只有在最需要的时候才会将他解开。",
	"The dark elves believe that Selvetarm walked in solitude for many centuries, spurning both Lolth and Corellon, for he was not wholly given over to evil but neither was he fully aligned with the forces of light. Eventually his path crossed that of Eilistraee, and he began to appreciate the goodness of the Dark Maiden, as exhibited in her teachings and deeds. By aiding in Selvetarm's redemption, Eilistraee hoped to begin to heal the breach between drow and the Seldarine. That hope was dashed, however, by the insidious plotting of Lolth.": "黑暗精灵认为塞尔维塔姆在孤独中行走了许多个世纪，拒绝了洛尔思和科瑞隆，因为他并没有完全被邪恶所征服，但也没有完全与光明的力量结盟。最终，他的道路与埃利斯特雷的道路相交，他开始欣赏黑暗少女的善良，正如她的教义和行为所展示的那样。通过帮助塞尔维塔姆的救赎，伊利斯特雷希望能够开始弥合鸦人和塞尔达林之间的裂痕。然而，这个希望被洛尔思阴险的阴谋打破了。",
	"The Queen of Spiders had long resented the existence of Zanassu, a minor demon lord that competed with her for divine authority over spiders. She hated almost as much the possibility of Eilistraee's winning an ally among the drow pantheon. A prime opportunity arose when the spider demon lost much of its power in a conflict on the Material Plane. Lolth convinced Selvetarm to destroy Zanassu in its depleted state and seize the spider demon's burgeoning divine power. She did so by suggesting to Selvetarm that a victory would win him favor in the eyes of Eilistraee, whom he greatly admired. But when Selvetarm prevailed in battle over the spider demon, the wholly evil and chaotic nature of the divine power he absorbed overwhelmed Selvetarm's innate goodness and weakened him enough that the Spider Queen could bound his will tightly to her own.": "蜘蛛女王长期以来一直憎恨扎那苏的存在，一个与她争夺蜘蛛神权的小恶魔领主。她几乎同样痛恨艾利斯特雷在乌鸦万神殿中赢得盟友的可能性。当蜘蛛妖在物质界的冲突中失去大部分力量时，一个最好的机会出现了。洛尔思说服塞尔维塔姆摧毁处于枯竭状态的扎纳斯苏，并夺取了蜘蛛妖正在膨胀的神力。她这样做是为了向塞尔维塔姆暗示，一场胜利会让他在埃利斯特雷眼中赢得好感，他非常敬佩埃利斯特雷。但当塞尔维塔姆在战斗中战胜了蜘蛛妖时，他所吸收的完全邪恶和混乱的神力压倒了塞尔维塔姆与生俱来的善良，并削弱了他的力量，以至于蜘蛛女王可以将他的意志与自己的意志紧紧绑在一起。",
	"Enraged by Lolth's duplicity, Selvetarm is an engine of destruction, an eight-limbed maestro of slaughter. If allowed to operate unchecked, he could rend his way through an entire drow city in a berserk rage. Keeping him restrained is one of the few acts of Lolth that can be described as merciful.": "塞尔维塔姆被洛尔思的阴谋所激怒，他是一个毁灭的引擎，一个八肢发达的屠杀大师。如果允许他不受控制地行动，他可以在狂暴的愤怒中撕碎整个鸦人城市。对他进行约束是洛尔思为数不多的可以被称为仁慈的行为之一。",
	"Because of his status as a captive, Selvetarm draws little attention from drow of high status. Low-caste drow warriors who are themselves slaves or indentured servants, or who have no chance to rise in rank, can beseech Selvetarm for prowess in battle without suffering any shame. Anyone of high standing or who hopes to attain high standing shies away from openly expressing reverence for Selvetarm, though such an individual might still beg his aid privately.": "由于他的俘虏身份，塞尔维塔姆很少引起地位高的鸦人的注意。那些本身是奴隶或契约仆人的低种姓乌鸦战士，或者没有机会提升等级的人，可以向塞尔维塔姆求取战斗力，而不会受到任何羞辱。任何地位高的人或希望获得高地位的人都不敢公开表达对塞尔维塔姆的敬意，尽管这样的人仍然可以私下里求他帮助。",
	"Selûne is thought to be among the most ancient of Faerûn's deities. Most humans in Faerûn consider the moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, those who work honestly at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the lost, and the questing.": "塞鲁尼被认为是法鲁恩最古老的神灵之一。法鲁恩的大多数人类认为天空中的月亮就是女神在凝视着这个世界，而月亮后面的拖曳光斑就是她的眼泪。她也是星星和导航的女神，也是母亲和生殖周期的女神。她被视为一种平静的力量，经常被女性人类以及其他民间混合体所敬仰：航海家和水手，那些在夜间诚实工作的人，那些在黑暗中寻求保护的人，迷路的人，以及探索的人。",
	"There are many legends about Selûne, chief among them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of time between Selûne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of Selûne, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the goddess's joy, sorrow, or both.": "有许多关于塞卢恩的传说，其中最主要的是塞卢恩和她的妹妹沙尔在时间之初的战斗故事。塞卢恩的眼泪，是跟随月亮在天空中出现的一簇星光，被认为是由女神的快乐、悲伤或两者同时带来的。",
	"Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites performed by the worshipers of Selûne, as are trances and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl of milk outside on each night of the full moon.": "牛奶是母性的象征，在塞鲁尼的崇拜者举行的许多仪式中，都会用到牛奶，就像安眠和冥想一样。赞成她的人通常在每个月圆之夜在外面放一碗牛奶。",
	"The dark twin of Selûne, Shar is the goddess of darkness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as the goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. She represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and vengeances carefully nurtured away from the light. She is said to have the power to make folk forget their pain or become inured to a loss, and many people in distress pray to Shar for such a blessing.": "沙尔是塞鲁恩的黑暗双胞胎，是黑暗的女神，无论是物理形式还是存在于凡人的思想和灵魂中。人们把夏尔当作黑夜、秘密、损失和遗忘的女神来崇拜。她代表着隐藏但不被遗忘的痛苦，以及远离光明而精心培育的复仇。据说她有能力让人们忘记他们的痛苦，或对损失变得麻木不仁，许多处于困境的人向夏尔祈求这种祝福。",
	"Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark places and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, as well as by those who have fallen into melancholy and despair, who wish to forget something, or who have lost something and wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark secrets, which in their minds makes them best suited to console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout the world's history, many followers of Shar have done dark deeds in her name - most notably the shadovar of Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The tragedies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her followers have caused many places to outlaw her worship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but such prohibitions only heighten the priests' umbrage at authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebellion and revenge against whoever rules.": "Shar受到那些必须冒险进入黑暗之地并因此向她祈求保护的人的敬重，例如矿工，以及那些陷入忧郁和绝望的人，他们希望忘记一些东西，或者失去一些东西并希望找回它。被吸引来为夏尔服务的牧师往往养育着他们自己的深层伤口或黑暗的秘密，在他们心中，这使他们最适合安慰那些遭受类似疾病的人。在整个世界的历史中，许多夏尔的追随者以她的名义做了一些黑暗的事情--最引人注目的是尼瑟尔的沙多瓦，一个致力于夏尔的整个社会。她的追随者的狂热所带来的悲剧和损失导致许多地方禁止对她的崇拜，从而使她的大多数祭司陷入隐秘之中，但这种禁令只会加剧祭司对当局的不满，并使信徒们成为叛乱和报复谁的焦点。",
	"Shargaas is a god of darkness and the unknown. He is a secretive and murderous deity, dangerous to all except Gruumsh. His realm is the darkness that no creatures but those devoted to him can see through.": "Shargaas是一个黑暗和未知的神。他是一个神秘而凶残的神，对除格鲁姆什以外的所有人都很危险。他的领域是黑暗，除了献身于他的人之外，没有任何生物能够看穿。",
	"To other orcs, the followers of Shargaas are depraved and twisted creatures that have no honor and skulk in the shadows. Rejected by Yurtrus as too unsuitable to serve as custodians of the dead, these orcs live even deeper inside the lair, close to where the entrance to Shargaas's realm is located. There in the darkness, orcs exiled to meet their fate are either brought into the fold as members of the tribe's Shargaas cult, or are torn to pieces and devoured as sacrificial tributes by the worshipers  of the Night Lord.": "对于其他兽人来说，沙迦斯的追随者是堕落和扭曲的生物，他们没有荣誉感，躲在阴影里。这些兽人被尤特鲁斯拒绝，认为他们不适合担任死者的监护人，他们住在巢穴更深的地方，靠近沙迦斯领域的入口。在那里的黑暗中，被流放的兽人迎接他们的命运，要么被带入部落的沙迦斯崇拜者的行列，要么被撕成碎片，作为夜神的崇拜者的祭品吞食。",
	"Although most followers of Shargaas are exiles, living in the farthest reaches of the lair away from the rest of the tribe, others remain within the main body, posing as ordinary warriors. These agents single out the weakest members of the fighting force, because removing these weak links strengthens the rest of the group. Soon after being born, an orc must be able to show that it will grow into a capable warrior, or else it will be visited by the cultists of Shargaas. The cultists also waylay orcs that have proved themselves ineffectual in leadership or combat, then drag them into Shargaas's dark caverns to be ritually murdered and devoured.": "尽管大多数沙迦斯的追随者都是流亡者，住在远离部落其他成员的最远的巢穴里，但其他人仍留在主体内，冒充普通战士。这些特工把战斗力最弱的成员挑出来，因为除去这些薄弱环节可以加强团体的其他成员。兽人出生后不久，就必须能够证明自己会成长为一名有能力的战士，否则就会被沙迦斯的邪教徒们拜访。邪教徒们还会劫持那些被证明在领导或战斗中无能为力的兽人，然后把他们拖进沙迦斯的黑暗洞穴，让他们被仪式性地谋杀和吞噬。",
	"This culling of the weak and the unworthy is accepted as necessary by the tribe, but speaking about it is taboo. Those that disappear are simply said to be \"with Shargaas\" and are spoken of no more.": "部落认为这种对弱者和不值得的人的清除是必要的，但谈论它是禁忌。那些消失的人被简单地说成是 \"与Shargaas一起\"，不再被提及。",
	"When faced with a particularly skilled foe able to withstand direct assaults, a war chief might call upon the cultists of Shargaas to assassinate an enemy leader, kidnap an influential hostage, or steal a valuable item.": "当面对一个特别熟练的、能够抵御直接攻击的敌人时，战争首领可能会召唤沙迦的崇拜者来刺杀敌人的领袖，绑架一个有影响力的人质，或者偷一个有价值的物品。",
	"Gruumsh doesn't always look kindly on acts of subterfuge and indirectness, because orcs are meant to take and do what they want through straightforward assault and brutality. Nonetheless, when the chief seeks the aid of Shargaas to accomplish such a task, the leader of the cult is willing to comply-for a price. In exchange for its less than honorable services, the leader will strike a deal with the war chief to provide food, tools, slaves, or some other commodity that the cult prizes.": "格鲁姆什并不总是善待潜伏和间接的行为，因为兽人就是要通过直接的攻击和残暴来获取和实现他们想要的东西。尽管如此，当酋长寻求沙迦斯的帮助来完成这样的任务时，邪教领袖愿意服从，但要付出代价。作为对其不太光彩的服务的交换，该领袖将与战争首领达成协议，提供食物、工具、奴隶或其他一些邪教所珍视的商品。",
	"Every halfling village sets aside a place for paying respects to Sheela Peryroyl. In a grove of trees, a raspberry patch, or a swath of wildflowers, villagers leave a small offering whenever they walk by, or tip their caps, or whisper a blessing in her honor. A village counts itself lucky if this place is cared for by a druid. Creatures that attack a village under the protection of the god's druids soon learn the error of their ways when all manner of plants lash out to grapple and sting the intruders, as though nature herself were aiding the halflings' cause.": "每个半身人村落都会留出一个地方，用来祭奠希拉-佩雷罗尔。在一片树林里，一片覆盆子地，或者一片野花丛中，村民们每次经过时都会留下一点祭品，或者给他们戴上帽子，或者低声祝福她。如果这个地方得到德鲁伊的照顾，村庄就会认为自己很幸运。攻击神的德鲁伊保护下的村庄的生物很快就会知道他们的错误，因为各种植物都会伸出手来抓取和刺痛入侵者，就好像大自然本身在帮助半身人的事业。",
	"On nights when the moon is full, especially during the planting and harvesting seasons, the elders tell stories about Sheela Peryroyl. After becoming a hero though her glorious adventures, Sheela joined with the earth, fusing her spirit with the flowers, plants, and trees so she could better provide for her kin. A halfling who accidentally steps on a flower often says, \"Begging your pardon, Sheela.\" Before halflings cut down a tree to use its wood for a new house, it is customary for them to stand before the tree with their caps doffed, humbly asking permission from Sheela to continue.": "在月圆之夜，特别是在种植和收获季节，长者们会讲述关于希拉-佩里罗尔的故事。在成为英雄的光荣冒险之后，希拉与大地结合，将她的精神与花草树木融合在一起，以便更好地供养她的亲属。一个不小心踩到花的半身人经常说：\"请原谅，希拉。\" 在半身人砍伐一棵树来建造新房子之前，他们习惯于站在树前，脱下帽子，谦卑地请求希拉允许他们继续。",
	"Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as well as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the North, who contend with the dangers of forests, mountains, and plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those places. Silvanus is thought of as a grim and severe father figure who metes out flood and drought, fire and ice, and life and death in the wilderness. In legends he often commands other nature deities, dealing out rewards and punishments to them as is fitting.": "希尔瓦娜斯代表整个自然界，沙漠和森林，鲨鱼和鹿一样多。但在北方，与森林、山脉和平原的危险抗争的人们，更多地将希尔瓦娜斯视为这些地方的神。希尔瓦娜斯被认为是一个严酷的父亲形象，他在荒野中施展洪水和干旱、火焰和冰块、生命和死亡。在传说中，他经常指挥其他自然神灵，对他们进行适当的奖励和惩罚。",
	"Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the dogma of Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the total situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint isn't confined to one person's or one nation's idea of what is best. The loss of a farming community to goblin raids is a tragedy for some, but the event provides an opportunity for the wilderness to grow up and make the land fertile again, which in turn provides new challenges for those who would return to tame it.": "自然及其公正的公平性是希尔瓦娜斯信仰教条的核心。他的牧师们寻求了解整体情况，观察宏观世界；他们的观点并不局限于一个人或一个国家对什么是最好的想法。一个农业社区因地精的袭击而消失，对一些人来说是个悲剧，但这一事件为荒野提供了一个机会，使土地重新变得肥沃，这反过来又为那些将返回驯服土地的人提供了新的挑战。",
	"The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature's glory must be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its expanses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only wasteful but blasphemous.": "西尔瓦努斯的信条规定，自然界的光辉必须得到保护，不仅仅是因为自然界是美丽的，还因为野生自然界是世界的真实状态。它的广袤让凡人的灵魂焕发活力，并给所有的世界带来气息。他的许多信徒反对将定居点扩展到野外，并认为对自然资源的过度消耗不仅是浪费，而且是亵渎。",
	"Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in wild lands, explorers, and residents of rural communities far from the protection of a local lord or a great city. The oak leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedicated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies a sacred site.": "希尔瓦娜斯经常受到野地旅行者、探险家和远离当地领主或大城市保护的农村社区居民的敬仰。橡树叶是希尔瓦娜斯的象征，村子里或郊区的橡树林常常被作为圣地献给他。在不生长橡树的农村地区，将橡树叶刻在另一种树的树皮上，象征着一个圣地。",
	"Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its forms - not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite pleasures of the flesh, from a lover's caress to the brush of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself.": "苏妮-弗海尔是一位激情和感官享受的神灵。她是各种形式的美的女神--不仅仅是令人愉悦的景象，还有迷人的声音、奢华的味道和气味，以及肉体的精致快乐，从情人的爱抚到皮肤上的丝绸刷。她的崇拜者在生活中寻求这些快乐，不是出于单纯的颓废，而是因为快乐的体验就是苏妮本人的触摸。",
	"The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine.": "苏妮的追随者有享乐主义的名声，在某种程度上，他们也是如此。不仅如此，她的祭司们还在世界范围内培养美。他们通过创造艺术，作为有前途的人才的赞助人，以及投资于将奢侈品带到从未见过绸缎或品尝过美味葡萄酒的遥远地方的商人，来做到这一点。",
	"Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune's priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that many take pride in their ability to present themselves as stunningly attractive examples of either gender.": "她的牧师们认为美丽是他们最大的使命之一，所有的人都接受过礼仪、时尚和化妆品方面的培训。事实上，苏妮的牧师们在创造美丽的外表方面是如此有天赋，以至于许多人都为自己能够作为两性中令人惊叹的例子而感到自豪。",
	"But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's true face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all in the purview of Sune.": "但是，苏尼人说，美不仅仅是皮肤上的，它来自一个人的核心，向世界展示一个人的真实面目，无论是公平的还是肮脏的。苏妮的追随者相信浪漫，相信真爱能战胜一切，相信跟随自己的心去寻找真正的目的地。命中注定的比赛，不可能的爱情，以及丑小鸭变成天鹅，都在苏妮的职权范围内。",
	"Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mirrored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while checking one's appearance. The spot might feature a shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cosmetics so that those without the funds to purchase such items can still make themselves feel beautiful.": "献给苏妮的寺庙在人类的土地上很常见，它们经常作为公共浴室和放松的地方。寺庙通常有一个有镜子的、光线充足的沙龙，人们可以在那里梳妆打扮，也可以看到别人，被别人看到。在没有寺庙的地方，或者在大城市里，最近的寺庙可能太远，无法步行前往，苏妮的小神龛往往矗立在街角附近。这些场所由悬挂在小屋顶下的镜子组成，人们可以在那里一边祈祷一边检查自己的外表。这个地方可能有一个架子或一个柜子，里面放着各种香水和化妆品，以便那些没有资金购买这些物品的人仍然可以让自己感到美丽。",
	"One of the most often beseeched of Faerûn's deities, Talona is the goddess of disease and poison, blamed for everything from common illnesses to crop failure to brackish wells to plague. Depicted in temple iconography as a withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the varieties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the use of three drops of blood or three tears - to be dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It's common practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image on the homes of the infected.": "塔罗娜是法鲁恩最常祈求的神灵之一，她是疾病和毒药的女神，从普通疾病到庄稼歉收，再到咸水井和瘟疫，她都要负责。塔罗娜在神庙中被描绘成一个枯萎的老妪，手里拿着一个杯子或花瓶，里面装着各种疾病和毒药，塔罗娜是一个可怕的女神，很多人都在祈祷，希望她能保护自己免受疾病和毒药的伤害。安抚她的各种仪式包括使用三滴血或三滴眼泪--滴入变坏的井中，滴入被咳嗽困扰的人的手帕中，滴入燃烧枯萎作物的火中，滴入瘟疫患者的口中，等等。通常的做法是在装毒药的容器上标上她的神圣符号，即三角形中的三个水滴，而在流行病期间，民间也会在感染者的家里画上同样的图案。",
	"Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona has almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A cult or a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suffers from pestilence, when some of those who survived decide to revere her or even become priests.": "虽然她经常接受祈祷，但塔罗娜几乎没有寺庙，也很少有崇拜她的人。在一个地区遭受瘟疫后，当一些幸存的人决定敬仰她甚至成为祭司时，可能会出现对她的崇拜或神殿。",
	"Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that might strike at any time. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those who favor him see life as a succession of random effects in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they can - for who can say when Talos will strike and send them into the afterlife?": "塔洛斯是自然界的黑暗面，是无情的破坏性力量，随时都可能发作。他是风暴、森林火灾、地震、龙卷风和一般破坏之神。他的追随者中包括掠夺者、袭击者、掠夺者和强盗。那些支持他的人把生命看作是混乱之海中的一连串随机效应，因此，虔诚的人应该在他们可以的时候抓住他们可以的东西--因为谁能说得准塔洛斯什么时候会袭击并把他们送入来世？",
	"Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded young man with a single good eye, the other covered by a dark patch. He is said to carry a collection of three staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three lightning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes.": "塔洛斯被描绘成一个宽肩的、有胡子的年轻人，只有一只好眼睛，另一只眼睛被一个黑斑覆盖。据说他手持三根法杖，这三根法杖是由世界上第一棵被砍伐的树、第一块被冶炼的银和第一块被锻造的铁制成的。他用这些法杖刮起破坏性的风，引起可怕的风暴，并在愤怒中分裂土地。他的神圣标志中的三道闪电代表这些法杖，当他向世界发泄愤怒时，人们认为他将这些法杖作为闪电从天上扔下来。",
	"Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked more often out of fear than out of reverence. He does have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact.": "虽然塔洛斯是一个受欢迎的神灵，但他的名字更多的是出于恐惧而不是崇敬而被引用。他确实有祭司，大多是旅行中的预言家，他们警告即将到来的灾难，并接受慈善以换取保护的祝福。他的许多信徒都戴着黑色的眼罩，即使两只眼睛都是完整的。",
	"Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct during war, using force of arms over talk for settling disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be riding with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who envision him.": "坦帕斯是一位战神，关注战争期间的勇敢行为，使用武力而不是谈话来解决争端，并鼓励流血。战争之神的宠爱是随机的，这意味着他的混乱本性对所有各方的宠爱是平等的。坦普斯勋爵可能在某一天成为一支军队的盟友，而第二天又成为其敌人。他可能会在战斗前显灵，出现在一方或另一方。如果他被看到骑着一匹白色的母马（Veiros），那么军队就会成功。如果他骑着一匹黑色的骏马（Deiros），那么失败是肯定的。最常见的情况是，他在骑马时，每匹坐骑都有一只脚踩在马镫上，表示战斗的不可预测性。在这样的幻象中，坦普斯总是一个身强力壮的战士，按照设想他的人的风格为战斗而打扮。",
	"Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but over the centuries his priests have made an effort to spread and enforce a common code of warfare - to make war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and professional behavior. This code, called Tempus's Honor, has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself with bravery; train all for battle; and don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all considered sinners.": "Tempus的宠爱可能是随机分配的，但几个世纪以来，他的祭司们努力传播和执行共同的战争准则--使战争成为一种规则、尊重名誉和专业行为的东西。这套被称为 \"坦普斯的荣誉 \"的守则的目的是使冲突简短、果断，并且对那些没有直接参与的人来说尽可能的安全。守则中的规则包括以下内容：武装任何需要武器的人；不贬低任何敌人；勇敢地证明自己；为战斗训练所有人；不参与争斗。那些在井中投毒、玷污田地、杀害非战斗人员或以战争的名义从事酷刑的人都被视为罪人。",
	"Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained don't serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given battle, a mortal might be slain or might become a great leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm that civilization brings about by its very existence.": "崇拜坦普斯的人很多，他的名字经常出现在士兵的口中。他的祭司是战术家，通常精通战争艺术。他的许多受戒者不在寺庙中服务，而是作为军队和雇佣兵公司的战场牧师，用语言和刀剑鼓励他们的士兵。坦普斯的祭司们教导说，正确进行的战争是公平的，因为它平等地压迫所有各方，而且在任何特定的战斗中，一个凡人可能被杀，也可能成为他或她的同伴中的伟大领袖。凡人不应该害怕战争，而应该把它看作是一种自然力量，是文明的存在所带来的风暴。",
	"It is darkness unending, less like a god and more like another world. Life and death do not exist within Tharizdun, only utter destruction and madness. Even the other Betrayer Gods treat this mad god with caution. In its endless imprisonment, Tharizdun dreams the infinite depths of the Abyss into reality, along with all its demonic legions. The Prime Deities had thought it locked away during the Founding until it nearly returned to ruin the world during the conflicts of the Calamity.": "它是无止境的黑暗，不像是一个神，而更像是另一个世界。生命和死亡在塔里兹敦不存在，只有彻底的毁灭和疯狂。即使是其他背叛者之神也对这个疯狂的神灵持谨慎态度。在其无尽的囚禁中，塔里兹敦将深渊的无限深渊与它所有的恶魔军团一起梦入现实。在建国时期，主神们一直认为它被锁住了，直到它在灾变的冲突中差点回来毁掉世界。",
	"Now, its chaotic mind has fallen into more frightful dreams, imagining nightmarish aberrations into existence deep beneath Exandria. The Chained Oblivion's demented cultists work without word from their twisted patron, awaiting the Epoch of Ends, when its freedom will be attained and all beings shall be consumed in deathlessness unending.": "现在，它混乱的头脑已经陷入了更可怕的梦境，想象着噩梦般的反常现象存在于埃克桑德里亚的地下深处。被锁住的遗忘者的疯狂崇拜者在没有得到他们扭曲的守护者的消息的情况下工作，等待着末日纪元的到来，届时它将获得自由，所有的生命将在无尽的死亡中被吞噬。",
	"Tharizdun is believed to be chained in the deepest pits of the Abyss, bound by divine shackles that slowly weaken, leaking its madness into the planes.": "人们相信塔里兹敦被锁在深渊的最深处，被神圣的枷锁束缚着，慢慢地削弱，把它的疯狂泄露到各个星球。",
	"Few visual attempts to depict Tharizdun exist, but the texts speak of a creature of rolling, hungry ink and darkness, a spreading cloud of lightless destruction born from a thousand ravenous mouths. Current references show the nightmare constrained by chains of gold and black, barely keeping the dark at bay.": "很少有描绘塔里兹敦的视觉尝试，但文本中提到了一个由滚动的、饥饿的墨水和黑暗组成的生物，一个由无数张贪婪的嘴诞生的无光毁灭的扩散云。目前的参考资料显示，这个噩梦被金色和黑色的锁链束缚着，勉强维持着黑暗的状态。",
	"The few remaining followers of Ioun are dedicated to ensuring that Tharizdun is never again unchained. Ioun led the charge against the all-consuming destroyer god's reemergence, and her bravery allowed the other Prime Deities to shackle their enemy, though the victory nearly cost her immortal life. Some say Ioun can only be fully restored if the Chained Oblivion is destroyed for good.": "伊欧恩仅存的几个追随者致力于确保塔里兹敦再也不会被解开枷锁。伊欧恩领导了对全能的毁灭者之神重新出现的冲锋，她的勇敢让其他主神给他们的敌人戴上了枷锁，尽管这场胜利几乎让她付出了不朽的生命。有人说，只有当被锁住的遗忘之神被永远摧毁时，伊欧恩才能被完全恢复。",
	"Offer and siphon power to Tharizdun until his liberation comes.": "向塔里兹敦提供并抽调力量，直到他的解放到来。",
	"Uncover, restore, and exalt forgotten shrines and relics in his honor.": "揭开、恢复和升华被遗忘的神龛和遗物，以纪念他。",
	"Ruin and raze the realms to prepare for the Epoch of Ends.": "毁坏和蹂躏王国，为末日纪元做准备。",
	"Thassa is the god of the sea, aquatic creatures, and the unknown depths. She also holds sway over less tangible concepts such as ancient knowledge, long voyages, and gradual change.": "塔萨是海洋、水生生物和未知深渊之神。她还掌握着不太具体的概念，如古代知识、长期航行和逐渐变化。",
	"Impassive and slow to anger, Thassa is secure in the knowledge that there are no mortals and few gods who can threaten her status. Once her ire is aroused, however, it is as unstoppable as a cresting wave. She often speaks in the future tense, referring to what tomorrow will bring. She seldom laughs, and when she does, it is usually out of smugness rather than genuine mirth.": "Thassa无动于衷，对愤怒反应迟钝，她确信没有任何凡人和神灵能威胁到她的地位。然而，一旦她的怒火被激起，就会像波浪一样不可阻挡。她经常用未来时态说话，提到明天会带来什么。她很少笑，当她笑的时候，通常是出于自鸣得意而不是真正的欢笑。",
	"Thassa usually appears to mortals in the form of a female triton-like being with octopus-tentacle hair and a crown of crab legs. She seldom adopts the same size as her followers, preferring to be seen from a distance as she towers over the ocean. When she moves closer to the view of mortals, she takes many other forms, often shifting from one to another: a giant squid, an ocean storm, a school of sharks, a fog bank, or a crab, her favored animal. She sometimes speaks out of the ocean itself, in droplets hissing across the surface of the waves.": "塔萨通常以女性三叉戟的形式出现在凡人面前，她有着章鱼触角的头发和蟹腿的头冠。她很少采用与她的追随者相同的体型，更喜欢从远处看到她在海洋中高高耸立。当她靠近凡人的视线时，她会采取许多其他形式，经常从一种形式转变为另一种形式：一只巨大的乌贼、一场海洋风暴、一群鲨鱼、一个雾岸，或一只螃蟹，她最喜欢的动物。她有时会从海洋本身中说话，在波浪表面嘶嘶作响的水滴中说话。",
	"To most mortals, Thassa is the sea, and the sea is Thassa. The wind and waves, the tides, and the ocean's bounty, ranging from small fish to the enormous krakens—all these are Thassa's dominion. The sea has many metaphorical aspects that Thassa oversees as well: ancient knowledge, long-term change, introspection, voyaging, and repetitive patterns such as the tides.": "对大多数凡人来说，塔萨就是海，而海就是塔萨。风和浪，潮汐，以及海洋的财富，从小鱼到巨大的海怪--所有这些都是塔萨的管辖范围。大海也有许多隐喻的方面，塔萨也负责监督：古老的知识、长期的变化、反省、航行和重复的模式，如潮汐。",
	"Thassa governs the slow changes wrought by the passage of time, such as the weathering of rocks and the erosion of beaches. Where Nylea controls the eternal cycle of the seasons and Kruphix monitors the flow of time, Thassa holds sway over the slow-acting but irresistible forces that alter the world over hundreds or thousands of years.": "塔萨掌管着时间流逝所带来的缓慢变化，如岩石的风化和海滩的侵蚀。奈拉（Nylea）控制着四季的永恒循环，克鲁菲克斯（Kruphix）监控着时间的流逝，而塔萨（Thassa）则控制着那些在数百年或数千年内改变世界的缓慢但不可抗拒的力量。",
	"Krakens and other behemoths of the deepest oceans move at Thassa's command. She is protective of what she calls the greatest of her children, and she usually keeps them out of harm's way in the darkest depths. A mighty kraken sighted close to shore is a sure sign of Thassa's displeasure.": "克拉肯和其他海洋深处的庞然大物在塔萨的指挥下行动。她保护她所谓的最伟大的孩子，她通常让他们在最黑暗的深处不受伤害。如果在岸边看到强大的海怪，肯定是塔萨不高兴的标志。",
	"Thassa is never satisfied with the status quo, and she also never advocates hasty, uncontrolled change. She constantly resculpts the physical world, altering coastlines and upending familiar trade routes. There is no ultimate goal to this ongoing transformation; the purpose is change itself. Thassa believes that change is essential to existence, and she opposes anyone who tries to establish or maintain a permanent order to the universe. She aids and inspires forces of change, the rivers that wear down mountains and the tides that claim whole continents. She sometimes seems disinterested in the intrigues of the present, even in her own current schemes, as her thoughts drift toward what the future holds.": "塔萨从不满足于现状，她也从不提倡仓促的、不受控制的变化。她不断重塑物理世界，改变海岸线，颠覆熟悉的贸易路线。这种持续的转变没有终极目标；目的是变化本身。塔萨相信变化是存在的必要条件，她反对任何试图建立或维持宇宙永久秩序的人。她协助并激发变化的力量，如磨灭山脉的河流和夺取整个大陆的潮汐。她有时似乎对当前的阴谋不感兴趣，甚至对她自己目前的计划也不感兴趣，因为她的思想在向未来漂移。",
	"Thassa disdains the shortsightedness of her fellow gods, most of whom have convinced themselves that they can impose lasting order on the cosmos. At the same time, her realm is unassailable, and she believes that the changes she advocates are inevitable in the long term. So although Thassa frequently disagrees with the other gods, she doesn't fear them.": "塔萨不屑于她的同伴们的短视行为，他们中的大多数人都相信自己可以将持久的秩序强加给宇宙。同时，她的境界是不可动摇的，她相信她所倡导的变革从长远来看是不可避免的。因此，尽管塔萨经常与其他神灵意见相左，但她并不害怕他们。",
	"Heliod considers Thassa his favorite sibling, despite her unwillingness to agree with his plan for a permanent order. Thassa, who rules depths that have never seen the sun, considers most of Heliod's schemes pointless and opposes them if they seem to threaten harm.": "Heliod认为Thassa是他最喜欢的兄弟姐妹，尽管她不愿意同意他建立永久秩序的计划。Thassa统治着从未见过太阳的深渊，她认为Heliod的大部分计划都是毫无意义的，如果这些计划似乎会威胁到伤害，她就会反对。",
	"Thassa took pity on Purphoros and aided him when Kruphix hobbled his mind, and Purphoros has not forgotten it. The two of them agree that old things must make way for new things, but Purphoros's bursts of destructive energy stand in sharp opposition to Thassa's gradual alterations. Purphoros regularly makes gifts for Thassa, most recently gifting her a new spear to replace her lost weapon.": "Thassa怜悯Purphoros，在Kruphix阻碍他的思想时帮助了他，Purphoros也没有忘记。他们两人一致认为，旧事物必须为新事物让路，但Purphoros爆发出的破坏性能量与Thassa的渐进式改变形成鲜明对比。珀弗罗斯经常为萨萨制作礼物，最近一次是送给她一把新的长矛，以取代她失去的武器。",
	"Thassa has little use for the gods who oversee work she believes best left to mortals: Ephara with her cities, Karametra with her fields, Pharika with her tinctures, Mogis and Iroas with their armies. To Thassa's mind, her peers are building castles in the sand, unaware or unmindful that the tide will sweep them away.": "塔萨对那些监督她认为最好留给凡人的工作的诸神没有什么用处。埃法拉有她的城市，卡拉米特拉有她的田地，法里卡有她的酊剂，莫吉斯和伊罗亚斯有他们的军队。在塔萨看来，她的同龄人正在沙地上建造城堡，没有意识到或没有注意到潮水会把他们扫走。",
	"Most of Thassa's dedicated worshipers are tritons, and the vast majority of tritons are wholly devoted to Thassa. Tritons spend much of their lives in Thassa's realm, with their god omnipresent. They weave prayers to Thassa into nearly everything they do.": "大多数塔萨的忠实崇拜者都是三体人，而绝大多数三体人都完全献给了塔萨。特里顿人一生中大部分时间都在塔萨的领域里，他们的神无所不在。他们几乎将对塔萨的祈祷融入到他们所做的一切之中。",
	"Among humans, Thassa is worshiped by those who rely on bountiful seas for sustenance or calm waters for safety. Sailors, fishers, and residents of Theros's coasts and islands all pay her at least nominal respect and sacrifice. Her center of worship on land is in the coastal polis of Meletis, where sailors and philosophers pray to her for guidance. The week-long Lyokymion festival (the Feast of the Melting Swell) marks the start of the new year by celebrating the bounty of the sea.": "在人类中，塔萨被那些依靠丰饶的海洋来维持生计或依靠平静的水域来保证安全的人所崇拜。水手、渔民以及特洛斯海岸和岛屿的居民都至少在名义上对她表示尊敬和祭祀。她在陆地上的崇拜中心是在沿海的梅里提斯（Meletis），水手和哲学家们在那里向她祈祷指导。为期一周的Lyokymion节（融化膨胀节）标志着新一年的开始，庆祝海洋的丰收。",
	"Thassa's most fervent human worshipers offer prayers at high and low tide. If possible, they do so at the water's edge. At low tide they walk barefoot out onto the tidal flats, relishing the touch of Thassa's seabed.": "Thassa最狂热的人类崇拜者在涨潮和退潮时都会进行祈祷。如果可能的话，他们会在水边进行。退潮时，他们赤脚走到潮滩上，津津有味地触摸着塔萨的海床。",
	"Tales about Thassa typically demonstrate that she is often patient, but never kind.": "关于塔萨的故事通常表明，她常常是有耐心的，但从来都不善良。",
	"During the last great Silence of the gods, a triton appeared, impersonated a mariner named Callaphe, and traveled the waves aboard Callaphe's living ship,The Monsoon. This false Callaphe misled the tritons with false prophecies and pulled a kraken from the depths, hoping to harness his power. When the Silence was lifted and Thassa returned to the world, she struck the impostor down with such fury that she shattered her {@item Dekella, Bident of Thassa|MOT|bident}. Purphoros, remembering Thassa's kindness to him on many occasions, replaced her sacred weapon.": "在最后一次诸神的大沉默中，一个三体人出现了，他冒充一个名叫卡拉佩的水手，在卡拉佩的活船 \"季风号 \"上航行。这个假的卡拉佩用错误的预言误导了三体人，并从深海中拉出一只海怪，希望能利用它的力量。当寂静被解除，塔萨回到这个世界时，她以极大的愤怒击倒了这个冒牌货，粉碎了她的（%0%）。珀弗洛斯想起塔萨在许多场合对他的恩惠，取代了她的神圣武器。",
	"While Purphoros is renowned for his endless creations and desires to bring new ideas into being, Thassa secretly shares similar creative desires. Endlessly bored with the predictable denizens of the land and sky, in the deepest ocean trenches, Thassa wills immortal dreams and nightmares into being. Delicate beauty, undulating grace, and tentacular terrors are birthed in the absolute dark, iterate for generations, and suffer swift extinctions at the god's whim, never knowing the sun's touch. Sapient mortals aren't welcome in these maddening ateliers; Thassa remains bitterly unwilling to reveal her work until her creations—and the time—are absolutely perfect.": "珀尔福罗斯以其无尽的创造和将新的想法付诸实施的欲望而闻名，而萨萨则秘密地拥有类似的创造欲望。Thassa对陆地和天空中可预测的居民感到无趣，在最深的海沟里，他将不朽的梦想和恶梦变成了现实。精致的美，起伏的优雅，以及触目惊心的恐怖都在绝对的黑暗中诞生，世代迭代，并在神的意志下遭受迅速的灭绝，永远不知道太阳的触摸。这些令人疯狂的工作室不欢迎有智慧的凡人；塔萨仍然痛苦地不愿意透露她的工作，直到她的作品和时间都绝对完美。",
	"Few myths tell of those who escaped Thassa's wrath. This isn't one of them. When the infamous explorer Rasiao failed to steal one of Thassa's Tidelock Pearls, wave-controlling treasures protected by vicious mollusks, she spent years avoiding the waves before finding her way back to the mainland. Although she'd failed to abscond with one of Thassa's treasures, she'd avoided the sea god's wrath, a claim she valued more preciously than gold. For years, Rasiao lived far from ocean or river, making her home in the driest reaches of Theros. She lived a long life, but on one trip to Akros to resupply and brag, she drowned in a bowl of ox stew. Those who found Rasiao discovered a pearl, too large to pass her lips, lodged in her mouth. Fearing further reprisal, Rasiao's daughters committed their mother's body to the Deyda River and Thassa's clutches. The explorer's daughters never forgot that just as countless drops make the sea, so too is every raindrop, tear, and cup part of Thassa's domain.": "很少有神话故事讲述那些躲过塔萨之怒的人。这并不是其中之一。当臭名昭著的探险家Rasiao没能偷到塔萨的一颗Tidelock珍珠（由凶恶的软体动物保护的控制海浪的宝物）时，她花了数年时间避开海浪，才找到回到大陆的路。虽然她没能带着塔萨的一件宝物潜逃，但她避免了海神的愤怒，这是她比黄金更珍贵的要求。多年来，拉西奥一直生活在远离海洋和河流的地方，她的家在特洛斯最干燥的地方。她活了很久，但在一次去阿克罗斯补给和吹牛的路上，她淹死在一碗炖牛的汤里。发现拉索的人发现她的嘴里塞着一颗珍珠，大到无法通过她的嘴唇。由于害怕进一步的报复，拉肖的女儿们将母亲的尸体投入了代达河和塔萨的魔掌中。探险家的女儿们从未忘记，就像无数的水滴构成了大海一样，每一颗雨滴、眼泪和杯子也是塔萨领域的一部分。",
	"According to legend, a mortal sailor once stole Thassa's bident and used it to sink an enemy fleet. Thassa cared nothing for the vanquished fleet, but punished the sailor for his thievery by turning his family into eels. The sailor tried to care for the eels, but they blamed him for their fate and disappeared into the sea, leaving the sailor weeping on the shore.": "据传说，一个凡人水手曾经偷了塔萨的铁叉，并用它击沉了一支敌人的舰队。塔萨对被击溃的舰队毫不关心，但为了惩罚这个水手的偷窃行为，把他的家人变成了鳗鱼。水手试图照顾这些鳗鱼，但它们把自己的命运归咎于他，并消失在海里，留下水手在岸边哭泣。",
	"Acolyte, outlander, sage, sailor": "圣徒、外乡人、圣人、水手",
	"Thassa's champions typically work on behalf of change, embrace new ideas, don't automatically defend the status quo, and wish to serve the god who controls pounding waves and massive krakens.": "塔萨的拥护者通常代表变革工作，接受新的想法，不会自动捍卫现状，并希望为控制汹涌波涛和巨大克拉肯的神服务。",
	"In much the same way that the sea and its secrets simply exist, Thassa trusts that the lives and actions of her champions will serve her long-term goals because of their connection to her. What made the god of the sea turn her attention to you or how did she show her interest? The Thassa's Favor table offers a few possibilities.": "就像大海和它的秘密仅仅存在一样，塔萨相信她的冠军们的生活和行动将为她的长期目标服务，因为他们与她有联系。是什么让海神将她的注意力转向你，或者她是如何表现出她的兴趣的？塔萨的青睐表提供了一些可能性。",

	"You have no idea why Thassa showed interest in you, and you might sometimes wish she hadn't.": "你不知道为什么塔萨对你表现出兴趣，而且你有时可能希望她没有这样做。",
	"Following Thassa means devoting yourself to a particular way of perceiving the world. Thassa herself seldom takes a stand on moral issues, preferring to let matters play out, but her mortal champions can't usually afford to be so patient. As a follower of Thassa, consider the ideals on the Thassa's Ideals table as alternatives to those suggested for your background.": "追随塔萨意味着将自己投入到一种感知世界的特殊方式中。塔萨本人很少在道德问题上表态，她更喜欢让事情发展下去，但她的凡人拥护者通常无法承受如此的耐心。作为塔萨的追随者，请考虑将塔萨的理想表上的理想作为你的背景建议的替代。",

	"Rumored to be the oldest hag and progenitor of all other hags in Exandria, the Hag Mother arrived in the world just after the Founding. She has a soft spot for humanoids in peril that caused her original coven to exile and bind her to Exandria with a magical curse. She wanders the land, making deals with people in dire straits, offering the power to save themselves in return for their service. The tasks the Hag Mother asks of those who accept her deals are always dangerous and sometimes grotesque and cruel. Some of these quests save lives, while others end them. Others still result in the creation of more hags. Many of the missions seem to serve no purpose, but the Hag Mother always has a plan. Whether her endgame is to destroy her enemies, break her curse, or rule Exandria is known only to the Hag Mother herself.": "据传是最古老的女巫，也是艾克珊德里亚所有其他女巫的祖先，女巫之母在建国后才来到这个世界。她对处于危险中的人类情有独钟，这使得她原来的女巫团将她流放，并用一个魔法诅咒将她束缚在艾克桑德里亚。她在这片土地上游荡，与处于困境中的人们进行交易，为他们提供拯救自己的力量作为回报。巫婆要求那些接受她的交易的人完成的任务总是很危险，有时甚至是怪诞和残酷的。有些任务可以拯救生命，而有些任务则可以结束生命。还有一些任务的结果是创造出更多的巫婆。许多任务似乎没有任何目的，但巫婆之母总是有一个计划。她的最终目的是摧毁她的敌人，打破她的诅咒，还是统治埃克桑德里亚，只有巫婆妈妈自己知道。",

	"Very few throughout Exandria have heard of the Luxon, and fewer still believe they even exist. The Luxon is the central deity of the Kryn Dynasty and their way of life, but study of the Luxon beyond the borders of Xhorhas has only recently begun—and such study is mostly motivated by the Dwendalian Empire's desire to gain an advantage in the war.": "整个Exandria很少有人听说过Luxon，更少有人相信他们存在。卢克逊是克莱恩王朝和他们生活方式的核心神灵，但对卢克逊的研究在Xhorhas的边界之外最近才开始--这种研究主要是出于Dwendalian帝国想要在战争中获得优势的动机。",
	"The Luxon doesn't have an active consciousness or personality. The worship of them is largely a system of pure faith, backed by scientific and metaphysical truths that stem from the discovery of the beacons and the Umavi who interpret their meaning (see \"{@book Kryn Dynasty|EGW|3|Kryn Dynasty}\" in chapter 2). Priests of the Luxon often study dunamis and its primal arcane nature, while others are born with dunamantic gifts granted by the reality-bending powers of the beacons. Those that do call on the rarer threads of divinity use the beacons themselves as a source of magic.": "卢克逊没有活跃的意识或人格。对他们的崇拜在很大程度上是一种纯粹的信仰体系，由科学和形而上学的真理所支持，这些真理源于对信标的发现和解释其含义的Umavi（见第二章中的\"（%0%）\"）。卢克逊的祭司们经常研究杜纳米斯和它的原始奥术性质，而其他人则天生就有杜纳米斯的天赋，这是由信标的现实弯曲力量赋予的。那些召唤更稀有的神性之线的人将信标本身作为魔法的来源。",
	"By all accounts, the Luxon's original form is believed to be a colossal, shapeless body of impossibly bright light, like a burning star. Followers of the Luxon carry small, often hollow, dodecahedrons as a symbol of their faith.": "根据各种说法，卢克逊的原始形态被认为是一个巨大的、无形状的、不可能有的亮光体，就像一颗燃烧的星星。卢克逊的追随者携带小型、通常是空心的十二面体，作为他们信仰的象征。",
	"According to the teachings of the Kryn and the Umavi who scribe their faith, it is believed that long before the gods of Exandria came to shape this world, there was a time when a single Light came from the dark nothingness. Other lights came into being around them, settling as the stars in the cosmos. This one Light, however, resisted the force that beckoned them to burn like their star-fated brethren. This one Light wanted to understand what they were and chose to wander alone, choosing a different path. This choice led to endless stretches of lonely dark, the voices of the stars silent to the Light that walked away. Lonely, they wandered until they found a cold, dark rock: a world. The Light grew fond of this rock, seeing it as lonely as they were, and embraced it. They sparked a fire within, cracking the surface and giving fiery life to the cold world.": "根据克里恩人和记载他们信仰的乌玛维人的教义，人们相信，在艾克桑德里亚的诸神来塑造这个世界之前，曾有一段时间，有一束光从黑暗的虚无中走来。其他的光在它们周围出现，像宇宙中的星星一样沉淀下来。然而，这一束光抵制了那些召唤他们像他们的星辰一样燃烧的力量。这一束光想了解他们是什么，并选择独自徘徊，选择了一条不同的道路。这个选择导致了无尽的孤独的黑暗，星星的声音对走掉的光无声无息。他们孤独地游荡着，直到找到一块冰冷、黑暗的岩石：一个世界。光越来越喜欢这块石头，看到它和他们一样孤独，于是拥抱了它。他们在里面点燃了一把火，炸裂了表面，给这个寒冷的世界带来了火热的生命。",
	"From within the fiery core, the Light began to watch the world change and turn, the chaos giving birth to the first souls: the Primordials. Amazed with their children, the Light wanted to guide them to learn of themselves, which in turn would help the Light discover their own purpose—but the children warred amongst themselves and killed one another, their souls born of the Light becoming lost to the dark beyond. Confused but determined, the Light decided that a time of learning was required, and that a cycle of trial and error must be enacted for their children of chaos to better themselves. Sacrificing a majority of their own essence, the Light created beacons of their own self, crystals of great power that enacted a cycle of rebirth for those who were bound to the Light.": "从火热的核心中，光明开始观察世界的变化和转变，混乱中诞生了第一批灵魂：原始人。光明对他们的孩子感到惊讶，想引导他们了解自己，这反过来又会帮助光明发现他们自己的目的--但孩子们彼此争斗，互相残杀，他们从光明中诞生的灵魂在黑暗中迷失。光明感到困惑，但又下定决心，决定需要一个学习的时间，必须为他们的混沌之子制定一个试验和错误的循环，以改善他们自己。光明牺牲了他们自己大部分的精髓，创造了他们自己的信标，即具有巨大力量的晶体，为那些被光明束缚的人制定了一个重生的循环。",
	"This act exhausted the Light, and they fell into a deep slumber within the core of the world, awaiting a time where the children of their own mind would learn from life to life, through eons of struggle and self-reflection, until the knowledge had matured enough to reassemble them, awaken them, and the children could grant the answer to the question the Light had sought from the very beginning: what are they and what was their purpose? This Light is now referred to by the mortal followers of the Kryn as the Luxon.": "这一行为使光明疲惫不堪，它们在世界的核心中陷入了深深的沉睡，等待着一个时机，让自己的孩子们从生活中学习，通过漫长的斗争和自我反省，直到知识成熟到足以重新组合它们，唤醒它们，孩子们可以给予光明从一开始就寻求的问题的答案：它们是什么，它们的目的是什么？这道光现在被克里恩的凡人追随者称为卢克松。",
	"The Mockery is the patron of treachery and of terror in battle. He guides those who seek victory through guile, both warriors and assassins. He was once the brother of Dol Dorn and Dol Arrah, but he was stripped of his skin and his name after betraying them.": "嘲笑者是背叛和战斗中的恐怖的守护神。他引导那些通过诡诈寻求胜利的人，包括战士和刺客。他曾经是多尔-多恩和多尔-阿拉的兄弟，但在背叛他们之后，他被剥夺了皮肤和名字。",
	"Master of the skein of fate and the mistress of winter, the Raven Queen is the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the border between life and death and ensuring the natural transition is undefiled. Many funerals ask her blessing to protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath. Those who study ancient lore believe that the Matron of Death was once mortal herself and is the only known mortal to have ascended to godhood. Her rise instantly obliterated the previous, now-forgotten god of death, and the other gods quickly and fearfully destroyed the secrets to the rites of ascension.": "乌鸦女王是命运之线的主人，也是冬天的女主人，她是死亡之神。她的目光追随并标志着每个凡人生命的结束，监视着生与死之间的边界，确保自然过渡不受玷污。许多葬礼都请求她的祝福，以保护死者免受不死的可怕诅咒。研究古代传说的人认为，死亡之母曾经是凡人，是唯一已知的升为神的凡人。她的崛起瞬间抹去了先前的、现已被遗忘的死亡之神，而其他的神也迅速而恐惧地销毁了升天仪式的秘密。",

What was once a night of cheery celebration of the dead in the Dwendalian Empire has recently become an occasion to burn effigies and decry the Kryn Dynasty for their unnatural relationship with death.": "乌鸦女王的圣日被称为升天之夜，庆祝她的神化。她成神的实际日期并不清楚，但升天之夜是在第十个月的第十三天庆祝的。在德文达尔帝国，这曾经是一个欢快地庆祝死者的夜晚，但最近却成了焚烧遗像和谴责克莱恩王朝与死亡不自然关系的场合。",
	"Death is the natural end of life. There is no pity for those who have fallen.": "死亡是生命的自然结束。对那些堕落的人没有任何怜悯。",
	"The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully attempt to cast off their destiny must be punished.": "命运的道路是神圣不可侵犯的。那些傲慢地试图抛弃自己命运的人必须受到惩罚。",

	"The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy. Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellowship. They believe wars are won by the best planning, strategy, and tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is filled with doctrine about strategy, such as: \"Every war is a series of battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing the war.\" \"In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war.\" \"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies.\"": "红骑士是计划和战略的女神。那些拥护她的人称自己为红色团契。他们相信战争是由最好的计划、战略和战术赢得的。对红骑士的崇拜充满了关于战略的学说，例如。\"每场战争都是一系列的战斗。输掉一场并不意味着输掉这场战争\"。\"在战争中，为和平做打算。在和平中，要为战争做打算。\" \"在敌人的敌人中寻找盟友\"。",
	"Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread.": "乱世之后不久，在泰特希尔的一个崇拜英雄的修道会中出现了对红骑士的崇拜。由于她的追随者称之为 \"伟大的计谋\"，红衣骑士从此变得越来越受欢迎：几十年来，她的牧师们一直前往战争之地，向将军和国王们传授战略和战场战术的艺术。起初，他们接触的许多领导人都拒绝了他们，但很快就发现，那些接受深红将军的追随者的建议的人获得了明显的好处。感激的胜利者们为战略女神建造了寺庙，她的信仰也逐渐传播开来。",
	"Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past century. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general population, but those who revere her can frequently be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight looks upon with special favor.": "今天，几乎所有在过去一个世纪里发生过战争的土地上都能找到红骑士的追随者。红骑士的崇拜者在普通人中很少见，但在军队的高级指挥官、战争学院的教官、军需官和战略书的作者中，经常可以看到崇敬她的人。每座红衣骑士的神庙都有一个供奉天普斯的祭坛，因此这样的地方很可能是雇佣兵和士兵经常光顾的地方。寺庙周围有一个巨大的亭子和院子，士兵和雇佣兵公司可以租用这些地方进行练习和训练。她的牧师们认为，在寺庙的院子里操练军队是一种祭祀的形式，红衣骑士会特别看重。",
	"The Shadow is the dark side of knowledge and ambition. It's said to be Aureon's shadow, given malign life when Aureon mastered magic. The Shadow is the maker of monsters and the keeper of forbidden secrets, and it offers malevolent spells to warlocks and wizards.": "阴影是知识和野心的黑暗面。据说它是奥瑞恩的影子，在奥瑞恩掌握魔法时被赋予了恶毒的生命。影子是怪物的制造者和禁忌秘密的守护者，它向术士和巫师提供恶毒的咒语。",
	"This powerful archfey of selfish and anarchic intent, who was once known by the name Artagan, drew the ire of Corellon a millennium ago when his prank-like dabblings on the Material Plane left an entire nascent elven culture worshipping a whale carcass. Banished to the Feywild and barred from the mortal realm, Artagan wandered his home plane for hundreds of years, sowing chaos for his own enjoyment—until he struck a deal with the heroes of Vox Machina that enabled him to return to the Material Plane. There, he embarked on his latest plot of dubious divinity under a new identity: the Traveler.": "这个强大的大法师有着自私和无政府主义的意图，他曾经被称为阿尔塔根，在一千年前引起了科里隆的愤怒，因为他在物质世界的恶作剧般的掺杂使整个新生的精灵文化都在崇拜一个鲸鱼的尸体。Artagan被放逐到仙界，并被禁止进入凡间，他在自己的家园游荡了几百年，为自己的乐趣播种混乱--直到他与Vox Machina的英雄们达成协议，使他能够返回物质界。在那里，他以一个新的身份开始了他最新的可疑的神性阴谋：旅行者。",
	"Eccentric, fickle, and prone to whimsy and impulse, the Traveler wanders Exandria, seeking allies and followers who entertain him. Lending his powerful fey magics in the guise of divine boons and weaving a spreading myth surrounding his secretive purpose, the Traveler appears when least expected and leaves when least preferred. Those who hear of his tenets are prone to disbelief, but the occasional \"miracle\" serves to reinforce his influence. Does he wish to become a new god, or is this all still just a game?": "旅行者古怪、善变、容易异想天开和冲动，他在埃克桑德里亚游荡，寻找盟友和为他服务的追随者。旅行者以神圣的恩赐为幌子借出他强大的精灵魔法，并围绕他的秘密目的编织了一个传播的神话，他在最不希望的时候出现，在最不喜欢的时候离开。那些听到他的信条的人很容易不相信，但偶尔的 \"奇迹 \"会加强他的影响力。他是否希望成为一个新的神，或者这一切仍然只是一个游戏？",
	"The Traveler is often depicted as a tall elf man hidden within a billowing green cloak, the hood obscuring his face except for his knowing grin.": "旅行者经常被描绘成一个高大的精灵男子，藏在一件绿色的斗篷里，除了他那知性的笑容，兜帽遮住了他的脸。",
	"The Traveler asserts that chaos drives evolution and that change makes us stronger. The Traveler is a trickster and the giver of dangerous gifts. Some artificers worship the Traveler, seeing it as the lord of innovation, but the gifts of the Traveler always have unexpected consequences.": "旅行者断言，混乱推动进化，变化使我们更强大。旅行者是一个诡计多端的人，是危险礼物的提供者。一些工匠崇拜旅行者，将其视为创新的主宰，但旅行者的礼物总是有意想不到的后果。",
	"The evil queen of dragons is a fearsome god of greed, envy, and hoarded wealth. While chromatic dragons are her foremost worshipers, Tiamat accepts the worship of any who crave wealth. All chromatic dragons have a fearful reverence for their tyrannical queen, but many dragons of near-deific power and ambition chafe under her rule.": "邪恶的龙后是一个可怕的贪婪、嫉妒和囤积财富的神。虽然色龙是她最重要的崇拜者，但提亚马特接受任何渴望财富的人的崇拜。所有的色龙都对他们的暴虐女王有一种可怕的崇敬，但许多具有近乎神圣力量和野心的龙在她的统治下感到不安。",

	"The Scaled Tyrant's hatred for Bahamut is as old as the Founding, and her cults are ever hunted by his justice. For centuries, the zealous paladins of Bahamut have limited her worship to the chromatic dragons, but a rise in cult activity in the underbelly of Dwendalian society has priests of the Platinum Dragon on edge.": "鳞甲暴君对巴哈姆特的憎恨与建国之初一样久远，而她的邪教也一直被他的正义所追捕。几个世纪以来，热心的巴哈姆特圣骑士们将她的崇拜限制在色龙身上，但德文达利亚社会底层的邪教活动的增加使白金龙的祭司们感到紧张。",

	"Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those who face danger to bring about a greater good. Those who favor Torm believe that one's salvation can be found through service, that every failure to perform one's duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm's faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that most human paladins have Torm as their patron.": "托尔姆是责任和忠诚之神，受到那些为实现更大利益而面临危险的人的敬重。赞成托尔姆的人相信，一个人的救赎可以通过服务找到，每一次失败都会削弱托尔姆，而每一次成功都会增加他的光辉。那些把托尔姆放在心上的人必须努力履行他的戒律，走向世界，成为一支积极的正义力量，纠正错误，帮助无望的人。他们必须努力维护和平与秩序，同时反对不公正的法律。托尔姆的追随者对腐败保持警惕，并被期望迅速而严厉地打击凡人心中的任何腐败证据。作为正义的剑臂，托尔姆的信徒被期望对背叛者进行快速的死亡。考虑到这些信条，大多数人类圣骑士将托尔姆作为他们的守护者就不足为奇了。",
	"Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built on heights. These structures offer austere quarters for residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls.": "大多数供奉托尔姆的寺庙都是建在高处的堡垒。这些建筑为居民和来访的骑士提供了简朴的住所、训练场和马厩。白色花岗岩、狮子雕像和盔甲人物在建筑中占主导地位，大殿的墙壁上还装饰着阵亡英雄的纹章。",
	"Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and true must pause before acting to judge whether their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this principle.": "托尔姆被看作是泰尔的好右手，因此他的象征是为右手制作的白色铠甲。它代表泰尔的剑手，但也是宽容的象征。托尔姆经常被描绘成右臂向前伸出的手掌，崇拜者称之为 \"坚定之手\"。它象征着这样一个原则：公正和真实的人在行动之前必须暂停，以判断他们的意图是否符合托尔姆的理想。寺庙、市政建筑和信徒的家中经常装饰着坚决之手的图像，以不断提醒人们注意这一原则。",
	"Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The faithful know that all of them will stumble from time to time while following in Torm's footsteps, but Torm's priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to Torm's standards.": "托尔姆的崇拜者来自各行各业，因为他欢迎任何在自己和他人身上寻求最好的人，维护他的忠诚、责任、义务和仁慈的信条，或者愿意为阻止邪恶在世界中占据优势而做出牺牲。信徒们知道，在追随托尔姆的脚步时，他们所有人都会时不时地跌倒，但托尔姆的牧师们教导说，轻微失足的耻辱远没有拒绝将自己提升到托尔姆的标准那么严重。",
	"The dark god of the endless tunnels and caverns beneath Exandria, Torog is the patron of torturers, slavers, and jailers across the realms. His violent tears carved the pathways under the world, and his realm of imprisonment is a network of deadly caves and manacles from which few return. Creatures that wander the desolation of Carceri often construct prisons in his image. Those who rob others of their freedom offer prayers to him in cellars and other subterranean domains, and many creatures who live in the darkness below worship him and seek his guidance.": "托罗格是艾克桑德里亚地下无尽的隧道和洞穴的黑暗之神，他是整个王国的刑讯者、奴隶主和狱卒的守护神。他暴力的眼泪刻画了世界地下的通道，他的监禁领域是一个由致命的洞穴和手铐组成的网络，很少有人能从这里返回。在卡塞里的荒凉中游荡的生物经常以他的形象建造监狱。那些掠夺他人自由的人在地窖和其他地下领域向他祈祷，许多生活在地下黑暗中的生物崇拜他并寻求他的指导。",

	"The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is \"Fortune favors the bold.\" Someone might say words to Tymora before any endeavor in which a little good luck would help, but not when an incidence of bad luck might occur. (On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both goddesses.) One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it.": "泰莫拉的追随者的战斗口号是 \"命运眷顾大胆者\"。有人可能会在任何努力之前对泰莫拉说些话，因为在这些努力中，一点好运气会有所帮助，但在可能发生坏运气的时候则不会。(在这种情况下，人们会向贝沙巴祈祷，让他们免于厄运；向两位女神祈祷被认为会激怒两位女神）。一种常见的占卜方法是向陌生人（通常是乞丐）抛出一枚硬币，问其是否是正面。如果是，就把硬币留给陌生人，作为对泰莫拉的回报。如果不是，陌生人可以选择保留它（和坏运气）或归还它。",
	"Those who favor Tymora - as distinct from folk who invoke her name by mumbling over the dice - tend to be daring sorts. Adventurers and gamblers make up much of their ranks. They all have the belief that what is good about their lives is the result of having both good luck and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora has worshipers among all sorts of folk: the dashing young noble, the risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and the scheming ne'er-do-well.": "那些喜欢泰莫拉的人--与那些通过对着骰子喃喃自语来召唤她的名字的人不同--往往是大胆的人。冒险家和赌徒占了他们队伍的大部分。他们都相信，他们生活中的美好事物都是拥有好运气和勇于寻找的结果。泰莫拉在各种人群中都有崇拜者：潇洒的年轻贵族、敢于冒险的商人、做白日梦的农夫，以及诡计多端的新手。",
	"Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck are scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need for intermediaries: \"Let the lucky man and the Smiling Lady suss it out,\" as the old saying goes. Shrines to Tymora at gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, and sometimes such establishments attract a priest and effectively become temples.": "泰莫拉的牧师和致力于幸运女神的寺庙很少，因为她的信仰往往不强调对中介的需求。俗话说：\"让幸运的人和微笑的女士来解决这个问题\"。然而，在赌博场所中供奉泰莫拉的神龛并不罕见，有时这种场所会吸引一名牧师，并有效地成为寺庙。",
	"Before the Dawn Cataclysm, there was but one goddess of luck, Tyche. Ever flirting with fortune and disaster, Lady Luck bestowed and withdrew her favor at a whim. When her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and wandered off to explore the world.": "在黎明大灾变之前，只有一位幸运女神，泰切。幸运女神总是与财富和灾难调情，她随心所欲地赐予和收回她的恩惠。当她现在的姘头拉坦德（Lathander）在众神之间挑起争斗时，泰切以不幸的方式亲吻了晨曦之神，并漫步去探索世界。",
	"During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful token, which she assumed was a peace overture from Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to her amazement, Lady Luck couldn't pluck the rose from its bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed the rose with bad luck, and the flower's stem broke in her hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. The severed rose stem crept into Tyche's ear and subtly began to rot her from the inside out.": "在她的旅行中，幸运女神发现了一朵美丽无比的含苞待放的玫瑰。泰切对这一偶然事件感到高兴，伸手摘下了这朵令人愉快的信物，她认为这是拉坦德的和平姿态，他想重新获得她的好感。令她惊讶的是，无论她如何努力，幸运女神都无法将这朵玫瑰从花丛中摘下。沮丧之余，她诅咒这朵玫瑰不吉利，花茎在她手中折断。泰切把摘下的玫瑰放在耳后，继续走她的路。泰切不知道，这朵玫瑰是腐败和衰败之神莫安德的化身。被折断的玫瑰花茎悄悄地进入了泰切的耳朵，并巧妙地开始从里到外腐蚀她。",
	"When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear friend, the goddess Selûne, waiting to speak with her. Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the dispute between the two. Selûne wept great tears as she saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and before Tyche could discern her intent, Selûne lashed out with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche's rotted core split down the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to save that which was good and pure in her friend. However, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, and were separated only by the combined efforts of all three visitors.": "当泰切回到家时，她遇到了她的挚友塞鲁恩女神，她在等着和她说话。等待她的还有希望重新获得她的感情的拉坦德，以及前来调解两人之间争端的阿苏特。当塞卢恩看到她的朋友被腐败从内部摧毁时，她流下了巨大的泪水，在泰切能够看出她的意图之前，塞卢恩用一道净化的光束打了出去。泰切腐烂的核心从中间裂开，一个更小、更明亮的幸运女神走了出来，让月亮女神拯救了她朋友身上的善与纯。然而，紧随这第一个人物走出腐烂的外壳的是另一个令人惊叹的形式，但充满了黑暗的恶意和反复无常的恶意。当这两个形体出现时，它们立即互相仇视，疯狂地挣扎着，只有在所有三个来访者的共同努力下才得以分开。",
	"It is said that Tymora, Tyche's Fair-Haired Daughter, embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while Beshaba, Tyche's Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. Since their birth, the twin aspects of Tyche - Tymora, Lady Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune - have battled each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of nations and as small as the flip of a coin.": "据说泰莫拉，泰切的白发女儿，体现了她母亲所有的优雅和善良，而贝沙巴，泰切的不愉快的女儿，只得到了她的外表。自出生以来，泰切的两个方面--泰莫拉，幸运女神，和贝沙巴，不幸的女仆--一直在相互争斗，争夺大到国家的命运，小到一枚硬币的翻转的问题。",
	"Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice - all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerûnian god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in an act of bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes wrapped in cloth to signify his blindness, caused by a wound dealt to him by Ao when he questioned the justice of the Overgod's actions.": "Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice - 所有这些名字都说明了Faerûnian正义之神的本质。泰尔作为一个高贵的战士出现，他的右手在一次勇敢和牺牲的行动中被混沌猎犬凯泽夫夺走，他的眼睛被布包裹着，表示他的失明，这是因为他质疑超神行动的正义性时被奥打伤了。",
	"Tyr's followers devote themselves to the cause of justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of vengeance. This devotion isn't necessarily concerned with equality or fairness, but rather the discovery of truth and the punishment of the guilty. Those who favor Tyr tend to be stiff-necked about matters of theology and laws, seeing things in terms of black and white. Tyr's credo of lawfulness and honesty is a demanding one, and his priests remind the faithful not to hold in contempt others who can't live by it - it wouldn't be an honorable calling if everyone could muster the strength of will to follow it.": "泰尔的追随者致力于正义的事业，致力于纠正错误和传递复仇的力量。这种献身精神不一定与平等或公平有关，而是与发现真相和惩罚罪犯有关。那些支持泰尔的人往往对神学和法律的问题持僵硬态度，以黑白分明的方式看待问题。泰尔的合法和诚实的信条是一个苛刻的信条，他的牧师们提醒信徒们不要蔑视那些不能按照信条生活的人--如果每个人都能鼓起意志力来遵守它，那就不是一个光荣的使命。",
	"Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, including the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword. Such knights-as well as judges and priests, clerics, and paladins who worship Tyr - sometimes wear thin strips of diaphanous cloth over their eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice.": "许多骑士团都献身于泰尔，包括神圣审判骑士团和仁慈之剑骑士团。这类骑士--以及法官和牧师、教士和崇拜泰尔的圣骑士--有时会在眼睛上戴上薄薄的布条，以提醒其他人注意正义的盲目性。",
	"Uk'otoa was created by Zehir and terrorized the seas of Wildemount until the Divergence left the leviathan without master or purpose. The surviving indigenous people of the Swavain Islands, the Ki'Nau, took Uk'otoa as their guide and god to rule the waters and bring them prosperity. The leviathan elevated the Ki'Nau to conquer the southern coasts of the continent until the jealous will of Zehir reached beyond the Divine Gate and discovered the insolence of his creation, commanding his followers to seal away Uk'otoa in the bedrock beneath the Lucidian Ocean.": "乌克奥托亚是由泽希尔创造的，他一直恐吓着威尔德蒙的海洋，直到分歧使这只利维坦没有主人或目的。斯瓦文群岛幸存的原住民，基诺人，把乌克奥托亚当作他们的向导和神来统治水域，给他们带来繁荣。利维坦提升了Ki'Nau人的地位，征服了大陆的南部海岸，直到泽希尔嫉妒的意志达到了神门之外，发现了他的创造物的无礼，命令他的追随者将乌克奥托亚封存在琉璃洋下面的基岩中。",
	"Uk'otoa now reaches out to the dreams of nautical wanderers and shipwrecked sailors, lending his power to those who wish to rule the sea as he once did, beckoning them to free him from his suboceanic prison with promises of arcane gifts and the blessing of the blade known as the Sword of Fathoms, an extension of Uk'otoa's will and influence. His consciousness has found the minds of Desirat and Quajath, and the three have a tenuous accord to convince mortals to find and free them from their binds.": "乌克托亚现在向航海者和遇难水手的梦想伸出援手，把他的力量借给那些希望像他曾经那样统治海洋的人，召唤他们把他从海底监狱中解救出来，并承诺提供神秘的礼物和被称为 \"深海之剑 \"的剑的祝福，这是乌克托亚的意志和影响的延伸。他的意识找到了德西拉和夸贾斯的思想，三人达成了一个脆弱的协议，说服凡人找到他们并将他们从束缚中释放出来。",
	"Uk'otoa takes the form of an incredibly massive sea serpent. His coiled and twisting length is covered with fins, scales, and amber eyes, with a head ending in a pointed, fanged jaw and a face of three amber eyes.": "乌克奥托亚的外形是一条巨大无比的海蛇。他盘旋扭曲的身躯上布满了鱼鳍、鳞片和琥珀色的眼睛，头部以尖锐的獠牙下巴结束，脸上有三只琥珀色的眼睛。",
	"No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influence of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestuous nature reflects and is reflected by the waters of the deep. Any such community makes sure to host festivals to propitiate the Wavemother and seek her favor. Although mercurial in temperament, she can be generous to those who do her honor, as is any great queen.": "任何生活在海边的社区都不能忽视翁贝利的影响，这位愤怒的女神，其暴躁的本性反映了深海的水，也被深海的水所反映。任何这样的社区都一定会举办节日来祭祀波浪母亲，并寻求她的青睐。虽然性情多变，但她对那些为她服务的人却很慷慨，正如任何伟大的女王一样。",
	"The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over the side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most common moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and cruel with no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage place, and those who travel it had best be willing to pay the price of challenging her domain.": "人们对女巫的崇拜是出于恐惧，而不是崇拜，船员们把她的宝石扔到船舷上，以平息风暴带来的水灾。正如她最常见的名字所暗示的那样，她被视为任性和残忍，没有坚定的道德观；大海是一个野蛮的地方，那些旅行者最好愿意为挑战她的领域而付出代价。",
	"There is little in the way of an organized clergy of Umberlee. Her priests roam coastal cities, warning of doom and demanding free passage on ships in return for ensuring the goddess's pleasure. Often they wear the colors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves with items that remind others of the sea's dangerous nature - a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped about a human bone, and so on. The preserved hand of a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy object, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.": "翁贝雷没有什么有组织的神职人员。她的祭司在沿海城市游荡，警告厄运，并要求船只免费通行，以确保女神的快乐。他们经常穿戴着海浪和风暴的颜色，并以提醒他人海洋危险性质的物品来装饰自己--鲨鱼牙齿的项链、包裹着人骨的海草等等。淹死的人保存下来的手被认为是特别神圣的物品，她的一些少数神职人员把这种断手作为神圣的象征。翁贝里在沿海城市确实有大量的神龛，水手们经常在神龛前留下鲜花或小糖果，希望她能在下一次航行中放过他们。沃特迪普和博德之门都有真正的神庙供奉着翁贝里，工作人员主要是在海上失踪的水手的遗孀。",
	"Many pantheons include in their number a miscreant or an outlier-someone not to be emulated in the customary way, and often an entity whose existence serves as an object lesson and an example of what befalls mortals who conduct themselves the same way. For the gnomes, this niche is filled by Urdlen, also known as the Glutton for its selfish and cruel behavior.": "许多万神殿中都有一个恶棍或离群索居者--有些人不应该以惯常的方式效仿，而且往往是一个实体，它的存在是一个客体教训，是一个凡人以同样方式行事的例子。对于地精来说，这个利基是由乌德伦填补的，因为其自私和残忍的行为，乌德伦也被称为贪食者。",
	"Though the details differ from telling to telling, all gnomes know the story of how Garl banished Urdlen from the Golden Hills because Urdlen refused to go on an important quest. Despite Garl's efforts and the pleas of the rest of the pantheon, Urdlen selfishly refused to set his own interests aside and contribute to the group. Every version of this story ends in some sort of tragedy-perhaps the loss of Gaerdal's hand, the affliction that caused Flandal to need new skin, or the disappearance of Baravar's shadow-and each one concludes with \"And that is why Garl sent Urdlen into exile.\" In tales of his later life, Urdlen is no longer a gnome but has become a greedy and destructive monster, a great blind and hairless mole with iron claws and teeth.": "虽然不同的说法有不同的细节，但所有的地精都知道加尔如何将乌德伦驱逐出黄金山的故事，因为乌德伦拒绝去做一个重要的任务。尽管加尔的努力和万神殿其他成员的恳求，乌德伦还是自私地拒绝将自己的利益放在一边，为团体做出贡献。这个故事的每个版本都以某种悲剧结束--也许是盖达尔的手被夺走，导致弗兰德需要新皮肤的痛苦，或者是巴拉瓦尔的影子消失，而每个版本都以 \"这就是加尔将乌德伦流放的原因 \"作为结尾。在他晚年的故事中，乌德伦不再是一个地精，而是变成了一个贪婪和破坏性的怪物，一个巨大的瞎子和无毛的鼹鼠，有着铁爪和牙齿。",
	"Gnomes believe that Urdlen exerts influence on their lives when they experience jealousy, greed, petulance, or envy. Individuals are more likely to fall prey to these feelings when they don't spend enough time in activities with others, and so tales of Urdlen serve as a somber reminder of the importance of participating in society.": "地精们认为，当他们遇到嫉妒、贪婪、娇气或羡慕时，Urdlen会对他们的生活施加影响。当个人没有花足够的时间与他人一起活动时，他们更有可能成为这些情绪的牺牲品，因此，乌德伦的故事是对参与社会的重要性的沉痛提醒。",
	"In ancient times the halfling hero Urogalan left his village with his faithful hound to venture into the afterlife-and then, much to the villagers' amazement, he returned. They could see that Urogalan had been deeply affected by his experiences, since he didn't speak for a long time. He merely sat in a white robe with his hound by his side, watching the world go by. When he did speak at last, he told of a place he called the Green Fields, where the halflings' god-heroes live alongside mortals who have passed on, enjoying lush farmland, bright sunshine, and all the comforts of home.": "在古代，半身人英雄乌洛加兰带着他忠实的猎犬离开了他的村庄，去冒险进入后世--然后，令村民们惊讶的是，他回来了。他们可以看出，乌洛加兰被他的经历深深地影响了，因为他有很长一段时间没有说话。他只是穿着白袍，带着他的猎犬坐在身边，看着世界的变化。当他最后开口说话时，他讲述了一个他称之为绿色田野的地方，在那里，半身人的神英雄与已经去世的凡人生活在一起，享受着郁郁葱葱的农田、明媚的阳光和所有舒适的家庭生活。",
	"Urogalan declared that all who have gone before still watch over their loved ones from this place of eternal peace, sending messages to the material world. In acknowledgement of this assertion, halflings look for signs from their departed loved ones. One might be thinking about catching butterflies with his grandmother long ago, when suddenly a butterfly lands on his hand-clear evidence that, as Urogalan promised, she is still looking out for her grandson from beyond the veil of death.": "乌拉格兰宣称，所有以前离开的人仍然在这个永恒的和平的地方看着他们的亲人，向物质世界发送信息。为了承认这一论断，半身人寻找来自他们逝去的亲人的迹象。一个人可能正在想很久以前和他的祖母一起抓蝴蝶的事，突然一只蝴蝶落在他的手上--这清楚地证明，正如乌洛加兰所承诺的那样，她仍然在死亡的面纱之外关注着她的孙子。",
	"As a divine being, Urogalan can move freely through the earth and across the planes of existence. He holds aloft a magic lantern that protects him on his journeys. With his black hound leading the way, Urogalan scours the multiverse and shepherds deceased halflings to their eternal home in the Green Fields.": "作为一个神圣的存在，乌洛伽兰可以在地球上和存在的各个层面上自由移动。他高举着一个魔法灯笼，在旅途中保护着他。在他的黑色猎犬的带领下，乌罗格兰在多元宇宙中搜寻，并将已故的半身人牧养到他们在绿色领域的永恒家园。",
	"Unlike other halfling deities, Urogalan is surrounded by a cloud of melancholy. He is gaunt, with his dusky skin covered by white robes. Priests who venerate Urogalan emulate this practice of dress and demeanor.": "与其他半身人神祗不同，乌罗格兰被一团忧郁的云雾所包围。他面容憔悴，昏暗的皮肤被白袍覆盖。崇敬乌洛伽兰的祭司们在穿着和举止上都模仿这种做法。",
	"The lich lord Vecna presides over villainous mages, conspiring politicians, and envious servants as the dark god of necromancy, undeath, and secrets. Once a dangerously clever and powerful archmage-turned-lich, his hunger for dominion over all mysteries and obsession with conquering the pantheon led to his own dissolution, leaving behind only his left hand and eye. His enduring spirit reformed through the ages and managed to reconstruct the Raven Queen's rites of ascension to become the newest of gods to walk Exandria. Defeated by the legendary heroes Vox Machina and sealed behind the Divine Gate, the Whispered One now quietly rules over that which is not meant to be known.": "巫师领主Vecna作为死灵、不死和秘密的黑暗之神，主持着邪恶的法师、阴谋的政客和嫉妒的仆人。他曾经是一个危险的聪明而强大的大法师，后来变成了陈设师，他对支配所有神秘事物的渴望和对征服万神殿的迷恋导致了他自己的解体，只留下了他的左手和眼睛。他那不屈不挠的精神经过岁月的洗礼，成功地重建了乌鸦女王的升天仪式，成为行走在埃克桑德里亚的最新神灵。被传奇英雄Vox Machina击败并被封印在神门之后，低语者现在静静地统治着那些不为人知的东西。",
	"Vecna calls no place among the planes his home, instead wandering in search of powerful artifacts and secrets to further his unknowable plots.": "维克纳不以任何地方为家，而是四处寻找强大的神器和秘密，以推进他不可知的阴谋。",
	"Those who claim to have looked on Vecna's form speak of a tall, skeletal lich swathed in tattered robes and enchanted jewels, missing both his left hand and left eye.": "那些声称看到过韦克纳形态的人说，他是一个高大的骷髅巫师，身穿破烂的长袍，佩戴着魔法珠宝，缺少左手和左眼。",
	"While Vecna loathes all other gods and wishes to destroy them and become the sole divine power in the planes, he has a particular hatred for Ioun. Ioun seeks to share with the world the same secrets Vecna guards for himself, and his followers work diligently to undermine and destroy the Library of the Cobalt Soul and any others who follow her path. The Raven Queen also despises Vecna, and sees his presence as a mighty affront to her purpose.": "虽然韦克纳厌恶所有其他的神灵，并希望摧毁他们，成为各星球上唯一的神力，但他对伊昂有着特殊的憎恨。伊欧恩试图与世界分享韦克纳为自己守护的同样的秘密，他的追随者努力工作，以破坏和摧毁钴魂图书馆以及任何其他追随她的人。乌鸦女王也鄙视韦克纳，并认为他的存在是对她的目的的极大侮辱。",
	"Learn all you can, and keep hidden that which you know. Reveal what pieces you must, but never the whole.": "尽可能地学习，并把你知道的藏起来。披露你必须披露的部分，但绝不是全部。",
	"Express and cultivate the evil within yourself, and in doing so, recognize it in others to exploit them for your own benefit.": "表达和培养自己内心的邪恶，并在这样做的时候，认识到别人身上的邪恶，为自己的利益利用他们。",
	"Seed the ruin of all who worship other deities, until only those who kneel before Vecna remain.": "毁灭所有崇拜其他神灵的人，直到只剩下跪在Vecna面前的人。",
	"None know whether Vesh is a witch or a demigod, but she has walked Exandria for centuries, seducing those who pry into forbidden magics and drawing them to her as possible suitors. Acolytes cultivate sects of worshipers who engage in ritualistic orgies and masochistic rites, these hedonistic rituals culminating with her selection of a mate. Vesh feeds on the unchosen in a bloody massacre before laying with her selected survivor and vanishing to her realm. Their essences intertwined, she then lends her strength to her mate, watching over them for life.": "没有人知道维希是女巫还是半神，但她已经在埃克桑德里亚行走了几个世纪，引诱那些窥探禁忌魔法的人，并把他们引向她作为可能的追求者。崇拜者们培养了一些教派，他们参与仪式性的狂欢和受虐仪式，这些享乐主义的仪式在她选择配偶时达到了高潮。维希在一场血腥的屠杀中吸食未被选中的人，然后与她选中的幸存者躺在一起，消失在她的领域。他们的精髓交织在一起，然后她将自己的力量借给她的伴侣，终生守护着他们。",
	"A being with conflicting duality, Vesh has moods that demand sacrifice and pain, and others that ask for benevolence and mercy. Because Vesh's whims are truly unknown, many who wish to gain her favor and attention commit terrible acts. While she has many partners, she is a jealous patron who demands the true heart of her chosen. Those who stray are never heard from again.": "维希是一个具有矛盾的双重性的存在，她有要求牺牲和痛苦的情绪，也有要求仁慈和怜悯的情绪。由于维希的想法确实不为人知，许多希望获得她的青睐和关注的人都做出了可怕的行为。虽然她有很多伙伴，但她是一个嫉妒心强的守护者，要求她所选择的人真心实意。那些离经叛道的人再也听不到他们的消息了。",
	"Vesh resembles a nude woman with faintly glowing gray skin, long purple hair, and unnaturally long arms and fingers that end in claw-like nails. Her eyes are pale white with no iris, and her expression varies from alluring to monstrous depending on her mood.": "维希像一个裸体女人，有微弱发光的灰色皮肤，长长的紫发，不自然的长臂和手指，末端是爪子一样的指甲。她的眼睛是苍白色的，没有虹膜，她的表情从诱人到怪异不一，取决于她的心情。",
	"Vhaeraun stands for the dark elves' superiority over other races and for the primacy of individual drow over other drow. He is a god of arrogance, and thus he condones all acts of avarice, fair and foul alike. Those who take what they want from whom they wish, whether through stealth or bullying, pay homage to Vhaeraun. He is patron to thieves and often the object of prayer before drow embark on a raid.": "瓦伊伦代表着黑暗精灵对其他种族的优越性，也代表着个别乌鸦对其他乌鸦的优先权。他是一个傲慢的神，因此他纵容所有的贪婪行为，无论是公平的还是肮脏的。那些从他们想要的人那里夺取他们想要的东西的人，无论是通过偷窃还是欺负，都会向瓦伊拉恩致敬。他是盗贼的守护神，常常是鸦人开始突袭前的祈祷对象。",
	"Among the male gods of the Dark Seldarine, he is as widely recognized and accepted as Keptolo. But Vhaeraun represents a different aspect of drow masculinity: strong, silent, obedient, swift, and deadly. He is thought of as Lolth's favored son, in contrast to Keptolo's role as her beautiful consort.": "在黑暗塞尔达林的男神中，他和凯普托洛一样被广泛认可和接受。但Vhaeraun代表了鸦人男子气概的另一个方面：强壮、沉默、顺从、迅捷和致命。他被认为是洛尔思的宠儿，与凯普托洛作为她美丽的妃子的角色形成对比。",
	"Due to his high status in the Dark Seldarine (for a male) and because of his arrogance, a few of his worshipers look on him as an advocate of equality between male and female drow. That heresy, when it is expressed openly, is liable to be savagely crushed by the priestesses of Lolth. So most of Vhaeraun's male followers honor him simply by trying to carve out better lives for themselves, and that activity is tolerated. Even so, adherents of Vhaeraun don't appear in public without wearing masks. This practice exists in part because Vhaeraun is never portrayed unmasked, and partly because anonymity is a wise precaution when one challenges the social structure of the drow in even a small way.": "由于他在黑暗塞尔达林的地位很高（对于一个男性来说），也由于他的傲慢，他的一些崇拜者把他看成是男女鸦人平等的倡导者。这种异端，一旦公开表达出来，很可能会被洛尔思的女祭司们野蛮地粉碎。因此，大多数Vhaeraun的男性追随者只是通过努力为自己开辟更好的生活来纪念他，而这种活动是被容忍的。即便如此，Vhaeraun的追随者不戴面具就不会出现在公众面前。这种做法的存在，部分原因是Vhaeraun从未被描绘成不戴面具的样子，部分原因是当一个人以哪怕是很小的方式挑战鸦人的社会结构时，匿名是一种明智的预防措施。",
	"To quash any challenge to the matriarchy that Vhaeraun might inspire in his followers, some drow communities preach that he wears a mask to hide the terrible scars from the wounds inflicted on him by Lolth as punishment for his arrogance. His silence, too, is part of his punishment, for his tongue was removed for questioning Lolth's orders. Worshipers of Vhaeraun who believe this dogma sometimes ritually scar and silence themselves as signs of their devotion, and then serve as voiceless, masked bodyguards for the matrons of their house.": "为了平息Vhaeraun可能在他的追随者中激发的对母权制的任何挑战，一些鸦人社区宣扬他戴着面具，以隐藏洛尔思对他造成的可怕伤痕，作为对他傲慢的惩罚。他的沉默也是对他的惩罚的一部分，因为他的舌头因为质疑洛尔兹的命令而被切除。相信这一教条的瓦伊伦崇拜者有时会在仪式上给自己留下疤痕并保持沉默，以表示他们的虔诚，然后为他们家的女主人充当无声的蒙面保镖。",
	"Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both sides of the law. Her most ardent worshipers include shopkeepers, members of trading costers, wealthy merchants, caravan guides, itinerant peddlers, moneychangers, and smugglers. She is interested in anything that increases trade and the flow of money, whether new trade routes, new inventions, or the whim of changing fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a patron can be reliably thought of as greedy, but the Coinmaiden is said to frown upon misers and smile upon the industrious and the profligate, and thus priests who bear her holy symbol find themselves welcome in many towns and cities.": "沃基恩是财富和贸易的女神，在法律的两边。她最热心的崇拜者包括店主、贸易商成员、富有的商人、商队向导、流动的小贩、货币兑换商和走私者。她对任何能增加贸易和资金流动的东西都感兴趣，无论是新的贸易路线、新的发明，还是不断变化的时尚的心血来潮。那些以沃肯为赞助人的人可以被可靠地认为是贪婪的，但据说Coinmaiden对守财奴不屑一顾，对勤劳和挥霍的人微笑，因此，带有她神圣标志的牧师发现自己在许多城镇都很受欢迎。",
	"Temples of Waukeen resemble guildhalls and often serve as meeting places for trade consortiums. Those who follow Waukeen's ethos seek to create more opportunity for all and see competition for wealth as one of society's main means of progress. Thus, the faithful of Our Lady of Gold often find themselves at odds with trade guilds and others who would form monopolies. It's common practice among those who seek Waukeen's favor to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their profits, but rather than being given to a temple, the money is meant to be spent to help a struggling business, to finance a new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous fun.": "Waukeen的寺庙类似于市政厅，经常作为贸易联盟的会议场所。那些遵循Waukeen精神的人寻求为所有人创造更多的机会，并将财富竞争视为社会进步的主要手段之一。因此，黄金圣母的信徒经常发现自己与贸易行会和其他会形成垄断的人发生冲突。在那些寻求沃基恩恩惠的人中，通常的做法是留出他们利润的10%作为什一税，但这些钱不是交给寺庙，而是用来帮助陷入困境的企业，资助新的努力，或者，如果一切都失败了，用于轻浮的娱乐。",
	"The Calamity took the lives of mortals and immortals alike. Many angels that fought with the Prime Deities were slain, and most that survived were wounded. The solar Xalicas, the right hand of the Arch Heart, was so injured that even the magic of the gods cannot help the angel regain the ability to see, fly, or leave Exandria. For over a century, Xalicas lay broken and blinded in the Greying Wildlands, moss and plants covering her body, until she had the strength to move, blaming herself for the small part she played in the Calamity.": "灾难夺去了凡人和仙人的生命。许多与主神作战的天使被杀，大多数幸存下来的人都受了伤。太阳神夏利卡斯，拱心的右手，受了很大的伤，甚至诸神的魔法也无法帮助这位天使恢复视觉、飞行或离开埃克桑德里亚的能力。一个多世纪以来，夏利卡斯一直躺在灰暗的荒野中，苔藓和植物覆盖着她的身体，直到她有力量移动，她为自己在这场灾难中扮演的小角色而自责。",
	"Now Xalicas wanders Wildemount to make up for the sins of the Calamity and prevent another devastating war. Her followers attempt to heal war-scarred lands and repair the natural world. Xalicas knows that alone and in her injured state she cannot stop all the evils in the world, so the angel lends her power to those she finds worthy: creatures who wish to stop unnecessary war, stand up to tyranny, and defend the innocent.": "现在，Xalicas在Wildemount徘徊，以弥补灾难的罪孽，防止另一场毁灭性的战争。她的追随者试图治愈被战争破坏的土地，修复自然界。Xalicas知道，在她受伤的情况下，她无法阻止世界上所有的邪恶，所以天使将她的力量借给那些她认为有价值的人：那些希望阻止不必要的战争、反对暴政和保护无辜的生物。",
	"Xalicas is a silver-skinned solar who wears a clean white bandage around her eyes. Her body is covered in scars, and one of her wings is blackened and burned.": "Xalicas是一个银色皮肤的太阳，她的眼睛周围戴着干净的白色绷带。她的身体上布满了伤痕，她的一只翅膀被烧得发黑。",
	"The story of Yondalla begins at the dawn of the world, when halflings were timid wanderers, scraping out a meager existence. The goddess Yondalla took note of them and decided to adopt the halflings as her people. She was a strong leader with a vision for her people, and she dedicated her life to gathering them together and protecting them. Over time, she elevated to godhood those halflings who were the most adept at the skills halflings needed to survive. Those legendary halflings comprise the rest of the pantheon.": "Yondalla的故事开始于世界的黎明，当时半身人是胆小的流浪者，勉强维持着微薄的生活。女神Yondalla注意到了他们，决定收养半身人作为她的子民。她是一个强大的领导者，对她的人民有远见，她把自己的生命献给了聚集他们和保护他们。随着时间的推移，她将那些最擅长半身人生存所需技能的半身人提升为神。这些传奇的半身人组成了万神殿的其他成员。",
	"Yondalla created the first halfling villages and showed the people how to build, plant, and harvest. She knew that the bounty of a halfling village would be tempting plunder for any brigand or monster, so she used her powers to conceal their homes from easy discovery, blending them into the landscape so that most travelers would pass by without a second glance.": "Yondalla创造了第一批半身人村庄，并向人们展示了如何建造、种植和收获。她知道半身人村庄的赏金对任何强盗或怪物来说都是诱人的掠夺，所以她用她的力量掩盖了他们的家园，使其不容易被发现，与风景融为一体，使大多数旅行者不经意间就会路过。",
	"To the halflings, Yondalla is responsible for the spring in their step and the bubbly excitement they feel from knowing that luck is on their side. When a pumpkin grows to enormous size or a garden yields twice as many carrots as usual, credit goes to Yondalla. When a halfling trips, slides down a hillside, and lands on a nugget of gold, that's Yondalla turning bad luck into good.": "对半身人来说，Yondalla是他们步履轻盈的原因，也是他们知道运气在他们身边而感到兴奋的原因。当一个南瓜长到很大，或者花园里的胡萝卜产量是平时的两倍时，都要归功于Yondalla。当一个半身人绊倒，从山坡上滑下，落在金块上时，那是Yondalla把坏运气变成了好运气。",
	"Yurtrus is often depicted as consumed by rot and covered in oozing pustules, utterly repulsive except for his hands, which are pure white and free of any blemish. Yurtrus has no mouth and never utters a sound, so that he may come in absolute silence for his chosen.": "尤特鲁斯经常被描绘成被腐烂所吞噬，浑身长满了渗出的脓包，除了他的双手是纯白的，没有任何瑕疵外，完全令人生厌。尤特鲁斯没有嘴，从不发声，所以他可以在绝对安静的情况下为他所选择的人而来。",
	"The followers of Yurtrus are allowed to dwell on the fringes of the tribe, but are looked upon with distaste and unease. They interact with the tribe mostly on occasions of death, claiming the bones of fallen warriors to add to the ossuary shrines of Yurtrus, and sometimes during shamanic rites when contact with spirits occurs.": "尤特鲁斯的追随者被允许居住在部落的边缘地带，但他们被看做是厌恶和不安的。他们与部落的互动主要是在死亡的场合，索取阵亡战士的遗骨以添加到尤尔图斯的骨灰龛中，有时在萨满教仪式中与神灵接触时也是如此。",
	"Shamans who heed the telepathic whispers of Yurtrus walk the perilous line between the living and the dead, and gain uncanny powers from doing so. Through this nonverbal communion, they begin to comprehend how to use the magic of death. These shamans, known as White Hands, cover their hands in white ash or wear pale gloves made of elf skin to symbolize their connection to the power of Yurtrus. The necromancy practiced by the shamans of Yurtrus is a force considered taboo by orcs, which makes them both revered and feared by the rest of the tribe.": "听从尤特鲁斯心灵感应的巫师们在活人和死人之间的危险线上行走，并从中获得不可思议的力量。通过这种非语言的交流，他们开始理解如何使用死亡的魔法。这些被称为 \"白手 \"的巫师将自己的双手覆盖在白灰上，或戴上精灵皮肤制成的苍白手套，以象征他们与尤尔图斯的力量的联系。尤尔图斯的巫师们所修炼的死灵法术是一种被兽人视为禁忌的力量，这使得他们既被其他部落的人所敬重，又被他们所惧怕。",
	"Orcs who die \"a good death\" are sent to Gruumsh by the priests of Yurtrus. The priests seek out the bodies of such fallen heroes and sever their heads, boil or smoke them to rid them of most of the flesh, and then use a ritual punch to break out the bridge of the nose and leave the skull with a single eye. Orcs that appreciate the strength and ferocity of a foe might choose to honor that enemy by giving it the same treatment. The bodies of orcs that die in a failed battle are left behind; they were weak and don't deserve to join Gruumsh. Those that die of old age have typically already been taken into Yurtrus's fold, and their bones are used to build furnishings and structures in the area of the lair dedicated to the worship of Yurtrus.": "那些 \"死得其所 \"的兽人被尤尔图斯的祭司送到格鲁姆什。祭司们会寻找这些死去的英雄的尸体，割下他们的头颅，煮沸或烟熏以去除大部分的肉，然后用仪式性的拳头打掉鼻梁，留下头骨和一只眼睛。欣赏敌人的力量和凶猛的兽人可能会选择以同样的待遇来纪念这个敌人。在失败的战斗中死去的兽人的尸体被留下；他们很弱，不值得加入格鲁姆什。那些老死的兽人通常已经被带入了尤尔图斯的阵营，他们的骨头被用来在巢穴中专门用于崇拜尤尔图斯的区域建造家具和结构。",
	"Orcs that suffer from gruesome diseases are brought into Yurtrus's fold and tended like prized cattle. These orcs are called nurtured ones, and they are considered the chosen of Yurtrus because they have been picked for the special purpose of spreading his virulent message among the enemy. At night, or during a heavy fog, these infected orcs rush toward an enemy's encampment, often through a hail of arrows, in order to spread their affliction within their foe's ranks.": "患有可怕疾病的兽人被带入尤特鲁斯的阵营，像珍贵的牛一样被照顾。这些兽人被称为 \"养育者\"，他们被认为是尤特鲁斯的选民，因为他们被选中的特殊目的是在敌人中传播他的病毒性信息。在晚上，或者在大雾中，这些被感染的兽人冲向敌人的营地，通常是在箭雨中，为了在敌人的队伍中传播他们的痛苦。",
	"A wanderer in the shadows and the creator of snakes and serpentkin, Zehir is the evil god of poisons, assassins, and darkness. The ancient serpentkin worship him over all other deities, dragging screaming offerings to their temples in his honor. Most of the Cloaked Serpent's worshipers were annihilated during the Calamity, and the rest are either suspended in self-induced stasis or hunted for sport by the servants of Lolth and Torog. But perhaps Zehir is merely biding his time, waiting for the proper moment to unleash his hidden armies on the world once more.": "泽希尔是阴影中的流浪者，是蛇和蛇人的创造者，是毒药、刺客和黑暗的邪神。古老的蛇人对他的崇拜超过了其他所有的神灵，他们拖着尖叫的祭品到他们的寺庙里向他致敬。大多数斗篷蛇的崇拜者在灾变中被消灭了，剩下的人要么在自我诱导的静止状态中悬浮，要么被洛尔兹和托罗格的仆人猎杀为乐。但也许泽希尔只是在等待时机，等待适当的时机再次向世界释放他隐藏的军队。",
	"Zehir subverts and poisons Exandria from the shadowed Towers of Night, hidden among the ever-shifting winds of the Astral Plane.": "泽希尔从隐藏在星界不断变化的风中的暗夜之塔中颠覆和毒害艾克桑德里亚。",
	"Many forgotten temples were once built to the Cloaked Serpent, and within these chambers his image was embedded within much of the architecture. He is shown as a human body with six arms and a gargantuan serpentine head, fanged and frilled in aggression. Strands of thick, dark hair that sprout from his scaled body form layers of swirling shadow, obscuring his form.": "许多被遗忘的寺庙曾经为斗篷蛇而建，在这些房间里，他的形象被嵌入许多建筑中。他被显示为一个拥有六条手臂的人体和一个巨大的蛇头，长着獠牙和流苏的攻击性。浓密的黑发从他的鳞片状身体上冒出来，形成一层层旋转的阴影，掩盖了他的形态。",
	"Zehir loathes Erathis and Melora, for he despises life, order, and love above all things. His surviving worshipers use poison and fire to undermine civilization and consume nature, hoping to infuriate both gods and cast Exandria into chaos.": "泽希尔厌恶埃拉西斯和梅洛拉，因为他蔑视生命、秩序和爱，而不是一切。他幸存的崇拜者使用毒药和火焰来破坏文明和吞噬自然，希望激怒这两位神，使埃克桑德里亚陷入混乱。",
	"Keep your acts obfuscated and secret. The night is your greatest ally.": "保持你的行为的模糊性和秘密性。夜晚是你最大的盟友。",
	"Strike quickly and without reason. Blind the target with their own confusion.": "迅速而毫无理由地出击。用自己的混乱蒙蔽目标。",
	"Kill slowly. Agonizingly. Or worse, make them enjoy it.": "慢慢地杀。痛苦地杀。或者更糟的是，让他们享受它。",
	"As the patron of assassination, illusions, and lies, Zinzerena personifies cruelty, stealth, misdirection, and survival by any means necessary. In some ways, Malyk is her reflection, and in many interpretations of the age-old stories, the two gods are siblings or lovers. But Zinzerena is more palatable to female drow than Malyk, and she condones the study of arcane magic.": "作为暗杀、幻觉和谎言的守护神，辛泽拉代表着残忍、隐蔽、误导和不择手段的生存。在某些方面，马利克是她的反映，在许多对古老故事的解释中，这两位神是兄弟姐妹或恋人。但津泽娜对女性乌鸦来说比马利克更容易接受，而且她容忍对神秘魔法的研究。",
	"The liturgy of Zinzerena is passed on in the form of folk tales, for her faith has no place among the leadership of drow society. Her tales usually describe her hiding and waiting until her foes are weakened or lax in their attention before she attacks. Those who respect or revere Zinzerena are almost always of modest social status, or worse. Even the most prestigious of noble estates, where a high priestess reigns supreme, might have a number of her followers among the commoners who work as servants and staff. Only the most capricious of nobles would enter her priesthood, though some have done so. Inevitably, when such traitors are discovered, they are cast out from their houses. Ironically, these maverick nobles often become leading figures in Zinzerena's cult, for they are the best educated and most politically experienced of her followers. Her adherents come from a wide range of occupations, including common thieves, laborers, guides, physicians, poets, and nearly any other profession. What they all share is a rebellious spirit and a desire for change.": "Zinzerena的礼仪是以民间故事的形式流传的，因为她的信仰在乌鸦社会的领导层中没有地位。她的故事通常描述她躲藏起来，等到她的敌人被削弱或注意力涣散时才发动攻击。那些尊敬或崇敬辛泽瑞娜的人几乎都是社会地位不高的人，甚至更差。即使是最有声望的贵族庄园，在高阶女祭司统治的地方，也可能在作为仆人和工作人员的平民中拥有一些她的追随者。只有最任性的贵族才会进入她的神职，尽管有些人已经这么做了。不可避免的是，当这种叛徒被发现时，他们会被赶出家门。具有讽刺意味的是，这些特立独行的贵族往往成为辛泽瑞娜崇拜的主角，因为他们是她的追随者中受教育程度最高、政治经验最丰富的。她的追随者来自各种职业，包括普通的小偷、工人、导游、医生、诗人，以及几乎所有其他职业。他们的共同点是具有反叛精神和对变革的渴望。",
	"In some stories, Zinzerena is Lolth's daughter, who was spirited away and hidden from her by illusions. In other tales, she begins life as a mortal elf who uses glamors to trick her way into the company of the gods. Regardless, Zinzerena always has some element of illusion magic about her, and she uses it and other deceptions to get the better of more powerful opponents. Deceit and taking advantage of others' weaknesses are recurring themes in the tales of her exploits. The only figure in the Dark Seldarine immune to Zinzerena's deceptions is Lolth, although even the Queen of Spiders is sometimes tricked when Zinzerena shifts blame for her actions onto others.": "在一些故事中，辛泽瑞娜是洛尔思的女儿，她被幻觉驱赶并隐藏起来。在其他故事中，她开始时是一个凡人精灵，利用魅力骗取了众神的青睐。不管怎么说，辛泽瑞娜身上总是有一些幻觉魔法的元素，她利用它和其他欺骗手段来获得更强大的对手的青睐。欺骗和利用他人的弱点是她的经历故事中反复出现的主题。黑暗塞尔达林中唯一不受辛泽瑞娜欺骗的人物是洛尔思，尽管当辛泽瑞娜将自己的行为责任推给他人时，连蜘蛛女王有时也被骗了。",
	"Not many female drow devote their lives to the study of magic, because it's held to be a low-status avocation more suited to males. Most females who pursue it seriously do so in secret. Even rumors that a drow matron practices arcane magic, if they aren't quashed, can sabotage her standing in society. Yet there's no denying that knowledge of arcane magic could be a great boon to an ambitious female. Zinzerena's worshipers encourage this pursuit and offer tutelage and tools in exchange for a candidate's alliance with Zinzerena's secret cult.": "没有多少女性鸦人把自己的生命献给了魔法研究，因为这被认为是一种地位低下的职业，更适合男性。大多数认真追求魔法的女性都是秘密进行的。即使是关于鸦人女仆练习奥秘魔法的谣言，如果不加以制止，也会破坏她在社会中的地位。然而，不可否认的是，对奥术魔法的了解对一个有野心的女性来说是一个巨大的福音。Zinzerena的崇拜者鼓励这种追求，并提供指导和工具，以换取候选人与Zinzerena的秘密教派结盟。"
