She can speak using one or both of her mouths.": "一年多前，贝兰和她的哥哥科瓦短暂地进入了远界，在那里他们融合成了一个单一的身体形态。这种融合抹去了科瓦的大部分身体和个性，给贝兰留下了曾经属于她哥哥的一张嘴和一双手臂。她还继承了他的一些内部器官和个性特征。她可以用她的一张嘴或两张嘴说话。",

	"This creature used to be two separate duergar, a male named Blork and a female named Muatha. Arcturia fused them together into a single creature by using magic that only a {@spell wish} spell can undo.

Muiral learned enough magic to transform himself into a half-scorpion monstrosity, becoming known as Muiral the Misshapen. He then retired to the level of Undermountain that would later be called Muiral's Gauntlet, driving out and slaying its original drow denizens.
