	"Originating from the dream-warped elven realm of Silvanesti, dream eaters are violent manifestations of nightmares and subconscious terrors. The true appearance of a dream eater is obscured, as the dream eater twists its hazy form into surreal illusions of its foes' greatest fears. However, all dream eaters share one thing: a gaping, always-smiling mouth, which it reveals before engulfing its prey in a phantasmagorical nightmare.": "噬梦者来自Silvanesti的梦境，是噩梦和潜意识中的恐怖的暴力表现。食梦者的真实面貌是模糊的，因为食梦者将其朦胧的形态扭曲成敌人最恐惧的超现实幻觉。然而，所有食梦者都有一个共同点：一张张开的、总是微笑的嘴，它在将猎物吞噬在幻觉般的噩梦中之前会露出来。",
	"The key to defeating a dream eater lies not in brute force but in the ability to pierce its illusions and wrest others from its terrors. As such, bards and other persuasive adventurers find themselves uniquely poised to confront a hungering dream eater.": "打败食梦者的关键不在于蛮力，而在于能否戳穿它的幻觉，把别人从它的恐怖中解救出来。因此，吟游诗人和其他有说服力的冒险家发现他们在面对饥饿的食梦者时有独特的准备。",
	"Emperor Ariakas,": "阿里亚卡斯皇帝。",
	"Glory to the Dragon Queen's name! Our designs on Abanasinia unfold according to your plans. This is no thanks to the so-called \"adviser\" I've been saddled with, the dragon Ember. The beast is terrifying, both in might and cunning, but it undermines my every design and terrorizes my forces. It's too canny to be caught, but I'm certain some portion of the troops we've lost to Qualinesti ambushes in fact smolder in the wyrm's gut. It thinks I don't hear, but it whispers curses in reply to my every command. Were it not one of our queen's favored children, I would have replaced my bed linens with its hide.": "荣耀归于龙女王的名字! 我们对阿巴纳西尼亚的设计是按照你的计划展开的。这并不归功于我的所谓 \"顾问\"--巨龙微光。这头野兽无论是力量还是狡猾都很可怕，但它破坏了我的每一个设计，让我的部队感到恐惧。它太狡猾了，不可能被抓住，但我确信，我们在奎林斯提的伏击中损失的部分部队实际上是在这头巨龙的肠子里燃烧。它以为我听不见，但它在回答我的每一个命令时都在低声咒骂。如果它不是我们女王宠爱的孩子之一，我就会把我的床单换成它的皮。",
	"I will complete our queen's work with the troops at my disposal, but when I return to Neraka, I would have this viper reassigned. I recommend to Icewall.": "我将用我掌握的部队完成我们女王的工作，但当我回到内拉卡时，我会让这条毒蛇重新被分配。我向冰墙推荐。",

	"Highlord of the Red Dragon Army": "红龙军的领主",
	"Also known as Pyros, Ember is an imperious and ruthless red dragon who serves the Dragon Queen Takhisis. In his service to the Dragon Queen, Ember has taken on many roles at her behest—including that of a black-robed human member of the Mages of High Sorcery—but he is best known as the adviser of Dragon Highlord Verminaard, leader of the Red Dragon Army.": "微光也被称为派罗斯（Pyros），是一条专横无情的红龙，为龙后塔克西丝服务。在为龙后服务的过程中，微光在她的授意下扮演了许多角色--包括高阶巫术法师中的黑袍人成员，但他最出名的是龙族大领主弗米纳德的顾问，红龙军团的领袖。",
	"Empowered by Takhisis herself, Ember's innate fire can sear those nearby, and his breath weapon is a molten storm of ash and flame. In combat, Ember wears a set of magic plate armor that bolsters his already-impressive might, allowing him to annihilate entire cohorts with terrifying ease.": "在塔克西丝本人的授权下，微光的天生之火可以灼伤附近的人，他的呼吸武器是灰烬和火焰的熔化风暴。在战斗中，微光穿着一套魔法板甲，加强了他已经令人印象深刻的力量，使他能够以可怕的速度消灭整个同伙。",
	"Said to be older than the trees themselves, the Forest Master is a wise and powerful unicorn who rules over the creatures of Darken Wood in Krynn. The ancient being's body is wreathed in protective briars, and moonlight dances around the unicorn's horn. Those who threaten the Forest Master's lands find themselves beguiled by magical mist and nigh-impregnable thorny thickets, but those who gain the Forest Master's favor are blessed with healing and protected as they traverse the woods.": "据说森林大师比树木本身还要古老，他是一只睿智而强大的独角兽，统治着克莱恩的黑暗森林的生物。这个古老的生物的身体被保护性的石楠缠绕着，月光在独角兽的角上飞舞。那些威胁到森林主人的土地的人发现自己被神奇的迷雾和难以攻克的荆棘丛所迷惑，但那些获得森林主人青睐的人在穿越森林的时候会受到治疗和保护。",

Armed with spectral armor and weaponry, a foresworn maintains the martial prowess it had in life and can call on magic and its fallen brethren for aid.": "预言家是堕落的索拉姆尼克骑士的灵魂，他们在死后长期履行自己的职责。装备有幽灵盔甲和武器的前驱者可以保持生前的武功，并可以向魔法和死去的兄弟们求援。",
	"Like revenants, foresworn fixate on a singular purpose, and they refuse to abandon their undead state until the duty they had in life is fulfilled. For example, a foresworn might be pledged to protect a family's bloodline from harm or guard a dangerous artifact against thieves. If a foresworn is destroyed before it can complete its duty, it returns within a few days, its strength and purpose renewed.": "像复仇者一样，预言者专注于一个单一的目的，他们拒绝放弃他们的不死状态，直到他们生前的职责得到满足。例如，一个预言者可能被承诺保护一个家族的血脉不受伤害，或者保护一个危险的神器不受盗贼侵害。如果一个预言者在完成其职责之前被摧毁，它将在几天内返回，其力量和目的将被更新。",
	"Irda seekers are skilled spies who use their magic to disguise themselves and gather intelligence for their allies. In combat, irda seekers can momentarily cloak themselves as they dart around the battlefield.": "伊尔达寻求者是熟练的间谍，他们利用自己的魔法来伪装自己，为他们的盟友收集情报。在战斗中，伊尔达探索者可以在战场上飞奔时暂时隐身。",
	"The Dragon Queen created the irda long ago. While most irda embraced their wicked creator's teachings, some of them adopted the philosophies of other deities. Those irda who don't serve the Dragon Queen live in hidden communities across Krynn, avoiding the eyes of their creator and her minions.": "龙后在很久以前创造了伊尔达。虽然大多数伊尔达接受了他们邪恶的创造者的教义，但他们中的一些人却采用了其他神祗的哲学。那些不为龙后服务的伊尔达生活在整个克莱恩的隐秘社区，避开他们的创造者和她的爪牙的眼睛。",
	"Distantly related to oni, ogres, and other giant folk, irda have shimmering skin that ranges through shades of indigo and sea green. Their innate magic provides them with limited shape-shifting abilities and the power to create illusions.": "伊尔达与鬼怪、食人魔和其他巨型民族有着遥远的联系，他们的皮肤闪烁着靛蓝和海绿的色泽。他们与生俱来的魔法为他们提供了有限的变形能力和创造幻觉的能力。",
	"Masters of their innate illusory powers, irda veil keepers protect their companions by weaving magical mirages that disorient foes. Rumors say that the most skilled irda veil keepers can keep entire enclaves hidden, guarding a community's inhabitants from the outside world for centuries.": "伊尔达面纱守护者是他们与生俱来的虚幻力量的大师，他们通过编织神奇的海市蜃楼来保护他们的同伴，使敌人迷失方向。有传言说，最熟练的伊尔达面纱守护者可以将整个飞地隐藏起来，在几个世纪内保护社区居民不受外界影响。",

	"First, thanks to the work of esteemed elavationist, Rirordinees Thrump, we created lifts to climb the heights of Mount Nevermind. Then, with the gnomeflinger, we brushed the heavens as gracefully as skipping stones. Now, let me present the next stage in automated ascendancy: the cloud clinger!": "首先，由于尊敬的阐释学家Rirordinees Thrump的工作，我们创造了电梯，以攀登Nevermind山的高度。然后，通过地精，我们像跳石一样优雅地拂过天际。现在，让我介绍一下自动化登顶的下一个阶段：\"云朵\"（clinger）!",

	"The gnome masterminds of Mount Nevermind temper their creativity with years of experience. While they still create wild inventions on a whim, these masterminds also wield at least one more stable clockwork invention—typically something that affords the mastermind more movement, extends their reach with extra appendages, or both.": "内华达山的地精大师们用多年的经验来调节他们的创造力。虽然他们仍然会随心所欲地创造出狂野的发明，但这些大师们也至少拥有一个更稳定的发条发明--通常是能让大师们有更多的行动力，用额外的附属物扩展他们的触角，或者两者兼而有之。",

	"Often at odds with the monstrous creatures that live in the frozen wastes, thanoi are adept hunters. In addition to their tusks, they use harpoons on long ropes that they can quickly reel back. Groups of thanoi hunters work together to take down monsters far larger than themselves, including remorhazes and white dragons.": "比目鱼经常与生活在冰冻的荒原上的畸形生物发生冲突，它们是善于狩猎的人。除了他们的獠牙，他们还使用长绳上的鱼叉，可以迅速收线。比目鱼猎人团体一起工作，打倒远比自己大的怪物，包括雷莫哈兹和白龙。",
	"In their experimentation with corrupting dragon eggs, the Dragon Armies created traag draconians, the precursor to what would become baaz draconian foot soldiers. Unlike their draconian brethren, traag draconians are little more than bloodthirsty engines of carnage. Few commanders have successfully used a traag draconian's reckless violence to their advantage in battle; for most, a traag draconian is as much of a danger to its allies as it is to its enemies. Even magic cannot tame a traag draconian's thirst for violence.": "在腐蚀龙蛋的实验中，龙军创造了特拉格龙人，也就是后来的巴兹龙人步兵的前身。与他们的龙族兄弟不同，特拉格龙人只不过是嗜血的屠杀引擎而已。很少有指挥官能在战斗中成功地利用特拉格龙人不计后果的暴力；对大多数人来说，特拉格龙人对它的盟友和对它的敌人都是一种危险。即使是魔法也无法驯服特拉格龙人对暴力的渴望。",
	"A traag draconian's vestigial wings lack the strength to support its hulking body in true flight, and they only minimally help to slow a falling traag's descent. Its metallic scales are coated in a sickly patina. In battle, the draconian can charge its body with vicious fire, burning all in its wake. When a traag draconian dies, its body explodes in a thick, disgusting sludge.": "特拉格龙人的残余翅膀缺乏力量，无法支撑其庞大的身体进行真正的飞行，而且它们只能在最小程度上帮助减缓下降中的特拉格人的下降。它的金属鳞片上有一层病态的铜锈。在战斗中，龙人可以用恶毒的火焰充斥它的身体，燃烧它身后的一切。当特拉格龙人死亡时，它的身体会爆发出浓郁的、令人作呕的淤泥。",
	"Ariakas,": "阿里亚卡斯。",
	"As the Dragon Queen wills me to obey, here is my assessment of your servant, Verminaard of Nidus: Unchanged. The man remains a blustering dastard awash in blessings earned by his blood rather than his brains. He glories in Takhisis's favor and wields her power in manners both frivolous and brutal. In their bunks, his troops whisper of his zealotry and claim that those missing from their ranks have been sacrificed on his secret altar. I don't dismiss this possibility.": "按照龙后的意愿，我对你的仆人，尼杜斯的弗米纳德的评价如下。没有变化。这个人仍然是个虚张声势的卑鄙小人，充斥着由他的血统而不是他的头脑赢得的祝福。他以塔克西丝的宠爱为荣，并以轻浮和残酷的方式挥霍她的权力。在他们的铺位上，他的部队低声议论着他的狂热，并声称他们队伍中失踪的人已经在他的秘密祭坛上牺牲了。我并不否定这种可能性。",
	"While his work progresses, it is the effort of an instrument as blunt as the mace he wields.": "虽然他的工作取得了进展，但这是像他所挥舞的大棒一样钝的工具的努力。",
	"Verminaard thinks himself invincible, and I pray to her majesty that I'm present when she divests him of that delusion.": "弗米纳德认为自己是不可战胜的，我向陛下祈祷，当她让他摆脱这种错觉时，我也在场。",

	"Ember": "琥珀",
	"Dragon Highlord Verminaard leads the Red Dragon Army—the largest and most powerful of the Dragon Queen's forces—with fanatic zeal and ruthless might.

Corrupted by the Dragon Queen, Verminaard rose to become one of her champions, claiming command of the fiercest among the Dragon Armies.": "龙族领主弗米纳德以狂热的热情和无情的力量领导着红龙军--龙后最大、最强大的部队。虽然预言要将邪恶的力量从克莱恩的土地上驱逐出去，但弗米纳德却被塔克西丝和她的荣耀承诺所诱惑。在龙后的腐蚀下，弗米纳德成为了她的拥护者之一，要求指挥最凶猛的龙族军队。",
	"Verminaard's extreme devotion to Takhisis allows him to channel her unholy power on the battlefield, bolstering those under his command while raining cursed fire on his foes. His towering silhouette is often wreathed in the fire of Ember, his red dragon companion and adviser.": "猛敏那对塔克西丝的极度虔诚使他能够在战场上引导她的邪恶力量，支持他手下的人，同时向他的敌人倾泻诅咒之火。他高大的身影经常被他的红龙伙伴和顾问--微光的火焰所笼罩。",
	"Verminaard's stat block references the Draconic Devotion monster trait. Though this trait does not appear in any of the creatures in this compendium, you will find several monsters with the Draconic Devotion trait terrorizing the lands of Krynn in the book {@adventure Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen|DSotDQ}.": "Verminaard的状态块参考了Draconic Devotion的怪物特性。虽然这个特性并没有出现在本纲要中的任何生物身上，但你会发现书中有几只具有德拉库恩奉献特性的怪物在克莱恩的土地上制造恐怖（%0%）。"
