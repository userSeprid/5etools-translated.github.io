	"A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today.": "一个世纪前，矮人法师阿伦迪尔将一些物体制作成动画，以保护铸造厂免受矮人以外的入侵者。这些创造物中有许多至今仍在原地。",
	"These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.": "这些动画物体从不攻击矮人或duergar。此外，一个矮人（包括duergar）可以命令一个物体停止攻击。如果这样命令，该物体会在10分钟内不动，或者直到命令它的人离开这个区域。",
	"An animated table doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一张动画的桌子不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.": "白龙是最小的、最不聪明的、最兽性的色龙，居住在寒冷的气候中，喜欢北极地区或冰山。它们是被饥饿和贪婪驱使的凶恶、残忍的爬行动物。",
	"A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.": "白龙有一双野性的眼睛，圆滑的轮廓，以及一个带刺的徽章。白龙的鳞片闪烁着纯白色的光芒。随着年龄的增长，它的光泽消失了，一些鳞片开始变黑，所以当它老了的时候，它的鳞片上会出现淡蓝色和浅灰色的斑点。这种图案有助于白龙融入它所狩猎的冰石领域，当它在充满云彩的天空中翱翔时，也会从视野中消失。",
	"White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.": "白龙缺乏大多数其他龙的狡猾和战术。然而，它们的兽性使它们成为所有龙族中最好的猎手，只专注于生存和屠杀它们的敌人。白龙只吃被冻住的食物，吞噬被其呼吸武器杀死的生物，而它们仍然是僵硬和冰冷的。它将其他被杀的动物包裹在冰中，或将它们埋在巢穴附近的雪中，发现这样一个储藏室是一个很好的迹象，表明附近住着一只白龙。",
	"A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.": "白龙还将其最大的敌人的尸体作为战利品，将尸体冷冻在它可以看到的地方并幸灾乐祸。巨人、雷莫哈兹和其他龙的遗体通常被放置在白龙巢穴的显眼位置，作为对入侵者的警告。",
	"Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.": "虽然只有中等的智力，但白龙有非凡的记忆。它们记得每一次的轻视和失败，并且已知会对冒犯过它们的生物进行恶意报复。这通常包括银龙，它们与白龙在同一地区筑巢。白龙可以像所有龙一样说话，但它们很少说话，除非被感动。",
	"White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.": "白龙避开所有其他龙，除非是异性的白龙。即使如此，当白龙互相寻找配偶时，它们在一起的时间也只够孕育后代，然后再次逃到隔离区。",
	"White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.": "白龙不能容忍对手靠近它们的巢穴。因此，白龙会在没有挑衅的情况下攻击其他生物，认为这些生物要么太弱，要么太强大，无法生存。唯一通常为白龙服务的生物是聪明的人形生物，它们表现出足够的力量来平息龙的愤怒，并且能够忍受由于龙的饥饿而造成的定期损失。这包括崇拜龙的哥布林，这在他们的巢穴中很常见。",
	"Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.": "强大的生物有时可以通过展示身体或魔法的力量来获得白龙的服从。冰霜巨人向白龙发起挑战，以证明自己的实力并提高自己在族中的地位，他们的碎骨在许多白龙的巢穴中到处可见。然而，被冰霜巨人打败的白龙往往会成为它的仆人，接受一个高级生物的控制权，以换取自己对其他服务于或反对巨人的生物的统治权。",
	"White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.": "白龙喜欢冰的冷光，喜欢具有类似品质的宝物，特别是钻石。然而，在他们偏远的北极地区，白龙的宝藏中更多的是海象和猛犸象牙、鲸骨雕塑、船只的头像、毛皮以及从过于大胆的冒险家那里缴获的魔法物品。",
	"Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.": "松散的硬币和宝石散布在白龙的巢穴中，当光线照射到它们时，像星星一样闪闪发光。较大的宝物和箱子被包裹在白龙的呼吸所产生的石灰层中，并在透明的冰层下保持安全。白龙的巨大力量使它能够轻易地获取财富，而较小的生物必须花上几个小时来削去或融化冰层，才能到达白龙的主要囤积物。",
	"A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.": "白龙的记忆无懈可击，这意味着它知道自己是如何拥有其囤积的每一枚硬币、宝石和魔法物品的，并且它将每一件物品与一场特定的胜利联系起来。白龙是出了名的难以贿赂，因为任何提供的财宝都被视为对它们能力的侮辱，它们可以简单地杀死提供财宝的生物，自己夺取财宝。",
	"True dragons are winged reptiles of ancient lineage and fearsome power. They are known and feared for their predatory cunning and greed, with the oldest dragons accounted as some of the most powerful creatures in the world. Dragons are also magical creatures whose innate power fuels their dreaded breath weapons and other preternatural abilities.": "真龙是有翅膀的爬行动物，具有古老的血统和可怕的力量。它们因其掠夺性的狡猾和贪婪而闻名和畏惧，最古老的龙被认为是世界上最强大的生物。龙也是一种神奇的生物，它们与生俱来的力量为它们可怕的呼吸武器和其他超自然的能力提供动力。",
	"Many creatures, including wyverns and dragon turtles, have draconic blood. However, true dragons fall into the two broad categories of chromatic and metallic dragons. The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons are selfish, evil, and feared by all. The brass, bronze, copper, gold, and silver dragons are noble, good, and highly respected by the wise.": "许多生物，包括狼牙棒和龙龟，都有龙族的血统。然而，真正的龙属于色龙和金属龙两大类。黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙是自私的、邪恶的、人人畏惧的。黄铜色、青铜色、铜色、金色和银色的龙是高贵的、善良的，受到智者的高度尊重。",
	"Though their goals and ideals vary tremendously, all true dragons covet wealth, hoarding mounds of coins and gathering gems, jewels, and magic items. Dragons with large hoards are loath to leave them for long, venturing out of their lairs only to patrol or feed.": "虽然他们的目标和理想有很大的不同，但所有真正的龙都觊觎财富，囤积成堆的钱币，收集宝石、珠宝和魔法物品。拥有大量囤积物的龙不愿意长时间离开它们，只在巡逻或进食时才走出巢穴。",
	"True dragons pass through four distinct stages of life, from lowly wyrmlings to ancient dragons, which can live for over a thousand years. In that time, their might can become unrivaled and their hoards can grow beyond price.": "真正的龙会经历四个不同的生命阶段，从低级的小龙到古龙，它们可以活上一千多年。在这段时间里，他们的力量可以变得无与伦比，他们的囤积物可以增长到无法估量。",

	" Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.": " 色素龙贪恋财宝，这种贪婪使他们的每一个计划和阴谋都充满色彩。他们认为，世界上的财富理所当然地属于他们，而色龙夺取这些财富时，并不考虑那些 \"偷走 \"财富的人类和其他生物。凭借成堆的硬币、闪闪发光的宝石和魔法物品，龙的囤积物是传说中的东西。然而，色龙对商业没有兴趣，它们积累财富的原因无非是为了拥有它。",
	"Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.": "色素龙因其优越感而团结在一起，认为自己是所有凡人生物中最强大和最有价值的。当他们与其他生物互动时，只是为了促进自己的利益。他们相信自己有与生俱来的统治权，这种信念是每条色龙的个性和世界观的基石。试图羞辱一条色龙就像试图说服风停止吹动。对这些生物来说，人类是动物，适合作为猎物或负担的野兽，完全不值得尊重。",
	"A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.": "龙的巢穴是其权力的所在地，也是其财宝的保险库。凭借其天生的坚韧和对严重环境影响的耐受力，龙选择或建造巢穴的目的不是为了避难，而是为了防御，倾向于多个入口和出口，并为其囤积物提供安全保障。",
	"Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.": "大多数色龙的巢穴都隐藏在危险和偏远的地方，除了最大胆的凡人之外，其他的人都无法接近它们。黑龙的巢穴可能在一个巨大的沼泽中心，而红龙则可能在一座活火山的破火山口上。除了巢穴的自然防御外，强大的色龙还使用魔法守护者、陷阱和顺从的生物来保护它们的宝藏。",
	"Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.": "龙后提亚马特（Tiamat）是邪恶龙族的主要神灵。她居住在九层地狱的第一层--阿弗努斯。作为一个小神，提亚马特有能力向她的崇拜者授予法术，尽管她不愿意分享她的力量。她是恶龙贪婪的缩影，认为多元宇宙及其所有的宝藏有一天会属于她，而且只属于她。",
	"Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.": "提亚马特是一条巨大的龙，她的五个头反映了崇拜她的色龙的形态--黑色、蓝色、绿色、红色和白色。她是战场上的恐怖，能够用她的五种呼吸武器、可怕的法术和可怕的爪子消灭整个军队。",
	"Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind. She also holds a special enmity for Asmodeus, who long ago stripped her of the rule of Avernus and who continues to curb the Dragon Queen's power.": "提亚马特最憎恨的敌人是白金龙巴哈姆特，她与他共同控制着龙族的信仰。她还对阿斯莫德抱有特殊的敌意，阿斯莫德很久以前就剥夺了她对阿弗纳斯的统治权，并继续遏制着龙后的权力。",
	"In The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan, characters must contend with a mummified centaur that wants to prevent them from moving any farther into the dungeon.

	"The Red Wizards (Dead in Thay) make use of several kinds of undead minions, including the special servants known as dread warriors. After being created by a secret ritual, a dread warrior is further enchanted so that a Red Wizard can employ the creature in the fashion of a spellcaster's familiar. By creating a psychic link with a dread warrior, a Red Wizard can experience the world through the creature's senses and direct the warrior.": "红袍巫师（Dead in Thay）使用几种不死的奴仆，包括被称为恐惧战士的特殊仆人。在通过一个秘密仪式创造出来之后，恐惧战士被进一步施以魔法，这样红袍巫师就可以以施法者的熟人的方式使用这种生物。通过与恐惧战士建立精神联系，红袍巫师可以通过该生物的感官来体验这个世界，并指挥该战士。",

	"Most duergar (including females) are bald and have ashen gray skin. They wear drab clothing designed to blend in with stone, along with simple jewelry that reflects their severe and utilitarian demeanor.": "大多数duergar（包括女性）都是秃头，皮肤呈灰白色。他们穿着单调的衣服，旨在与石头融为一体，同时佩戴简单的珠宝，反映出他们严厉和功利的举止。",
	"The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.": "杜尔加人曾经是矮人，在他们的贪婪和在地底无休止的探索使他们接触到了心灵传播者。矮人被illithids囚禁了数代，最终在邪神Laduguer的帮助下赢得了独立。然而，奴役永远地改变了他们，使他们的精神变得黑暗，使duergar和他们所逃离的暴君一样邪恶。尽管赢得了自由，但duergar是沉闷、悲观、不信任的生物，总是在劳作和抱怨，不记得什么是快乐或自豪。他们的手艺和成就经久不衰，但他们却缺乏温暖或艺术性。",
	"Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.": "杜尔加人对他们的矮人亲属和所有其他地下种族发动战争。他们在方便的时候结成联盟，然后在他们没有更多的利益时打破这些联盟。他们掳掠并扣留奴隶在地下世界劳作，将他们视为免费劳动力和粗劣的货币。",
	"Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.": "与矮人一样，杜尔加人有强健的体魄。除了身体上的耐力之外，他们还具有令人难以置信的精神毅力，这是由于他们曾是伊里希德人的奴隶。杜尔加人的头脑是一座堡垒，能够抵御符咒、幻术和其他法术。",
	"The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become {@condition invisible} to slip away into the darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their {@sense darkvision}, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.": "暗黑世界充满了奇怪的魔力，这些魔力是杜尔加在几代人的监禁中吸收的。一个duergar可以在短时间内增加它的大小和力量，成为一个强大的食人魔大小的战士。如果它面对的是它无法对抗的敌人，或者在监视接近其领地的生物时，它也可以很容易地变成（%0%），溜进黑暗中。在暗黑中度过的岁月也磨砺了它们的（%1%），使它们的视力比其他矮人高出一倍。然而，这种敏锐的视力是有代价的，因为杜尔加人的视力会受到阳光的影响。",
	"Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves. He offers them divine guidance and vengeance against their enemies while urging them on toward greater acts of tyranny, all the while concealing his true identity.": "九层地狱之主阿斯莫德（Asmodeus），为了培养灰矮人心中的邪恶，一直以来都是以冒充duergar神明而闻名。他为他们提供神圣的指导和对敌人的报复，同时敦促他们走向更大的暴政行为，同时隐瞒自己的真实身份。",

	"Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.": "霍布金人有深橙色或橘红色的皮肤，头发从深红褐色到深灰色不等。黄色或深棕色的眼睛在他们的眉毛下探出头来，他们宽大的嘴里有锋利而发黄的牙齿。男性霍布林斯人可能有一个蓝色或红色的大鼻子，这在霍布林斯人中象征着阳刚之气和力量。霍布林人可以像人类一样长寿，尽管他们对战争和战斗的热爱意味着很少有人能做到。",
	"Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.": "霍布林属于一个叫做地精的生物家族。他们经常被发现霸占他们的表亲，较小的哥布林和凶猛的虫熊。",

	"Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices.

	"Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point.

A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.": "妖精们将自己组织成被称为军团的部落队伍。在他们的军事社会中，每个妖精都有一个等级，从强大的领导者和冠军，到普通的步兵，再到发现自己被驱赶到前线的矛头的妖精。一个军团由一个军阀领导，有几个队长在其指挥下工作。妖精军阀是一个无情的暴君，对战略、胜利、荣耀、声誉和统治权更感兴趣，而不是带领部队作战。",

Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.": "霍布林人在训练动物服务方面有着悠久的历史。像更多的文明种族一样，他们使用牛和马来长途运输货物和武器装备。他们用训练有素的乌鸦相互交流，并饲养恶狼来看守囚犯和保护霍布林人的营地。哥布林骑兵使用训练有素的虫子作为骏马，就像哥布林骑狼一样。有些部落甚至饲养食肉猿作为战斗兽。",
	"Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found.

Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.": "除了他们所崇敬的龙之外，哥布林还崇拜一个名叫库图尔马克的较小的神。传说中，库图尔马克在九层地狱担任提亚马特的附庸，直到地精之神加尔-闪金从龙后的囤积物中偷走了一个饰品。提亚玛特派库图尔马克（Kurtulmak）去取回饰品，但加尔-闪金（Garl Glittergold）对他耍了个花招，使大地崩塌，将哥布林神困在地下迷宫中，直到永远。由于这个原因，哥布林讨厌地精和任何形式的恶作剧。库图尔马克最忠实的崇拜者致力于寻找并将他们失去的神从迷宫中释放出来。"
