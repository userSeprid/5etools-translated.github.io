	"Second son of Duke Thalamra Vanthampur of Baldur's Gate. Amrik loves to exchange pleasantries over drinks before conducting business. He has trained Laraelra's staff to recognize a variety of innocuous hand gestures that signal them to deliver drinks to the table. If he wants poison added to his clients' drinks, he has a secret sign for that. Hidden behind the bar is a small bottle containing four doses of torpor (see \"Poisons\" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide), which the kenku bartender can use to spike drinks when Amrik gives the signal.": "博德之门公爵Talamra Vanthampur的第二个儿子。阿姆利克喜欢在开展业务之前先在酒桌上寒暄一番。他训练拉雷拉的员工识别各种无害的手势，示意他们把酒送到桌上。如果他想在客户的饮料中加入毒药，他有一个秘密信号。吧台后面藏着一个小瓶子，里面有四种剂量的torpor（见《地下城主指南》第八章的 \"毒药\"），当Amrik发出信号时，kenku酒保可以用它来给饮料加料。",

	"This eladrin adventurer from the Feywild became stranded in Avernus after his companions abandoned him. He has spent the past seventy years roaming Avernus, making deals with fiends to survive. Smiler eventually sold his soul to a pit fiend, who gave him the means to topple a nycaloth warlord named Yarrasto. Smiler took control of the nycaloth's warband and their infernal war machines. Smiler's gang came to be known as Smiler's Defilers, and their ferocity terrified the other warlords of Avernus for a while.": "在他的同伴抛弃了他之后，这位来自精灵国度的冒险家被困在了阿弗纳斯。在过去的七十年里，他一直在阿弗纳斯游荡，为了生存而与恶魔做交易。斯米勒最终将自己的灵魂卖给了一个坑道魔人，后者给了他推翻一个名叫亚拉斯托的狼人军阀的手段。斯米勒控制了尼卡洛特人的战队和他们的地狱战争机器。斯米勒的团伙被称为 \"斯米勒的诽谤者\"，他们的凶残让阿弗纳斯的其他军阀害怕了好一阵子。",
	"Three of Smiler's rivals—Bitter Breath, Feonor, and Princeps Kovik—joined forces to wipe out Smiler's Defilers. Smiler escaped and tears around Avernus on a Devil's Ride, looking for adventurers willing to help him get revenge on the warlords who ganged up on him. Mad Maggie remains his only ally, though he refuses to join her gang.": "Smiler的三个对手--Bitter Breath、Feonor和Princeps Kovik--联合起来消灭了Smiler的捍卫者。斯米勒逃了出来，骑着 \"恶魔之路 \"在阿弗纳斯四处游荡，寻找愿意帮助他向那些联合起来对付他的军阀们报仇的冒险者。疯婆子仍然是他唯一的盟友，尽管他拒绝加入她的团伙。",
	"Thurstwell is a pale and sullen recluse in his forties. A veritable shut-in, he uses imps to spy on his brothers, Amrik and Mortlock. Thurstwell resents both of them—Amrik for being their mother's favorite, and Mortlock for being a monstrous dolt.": "瑟斯韦尔是一个四十多岁的苍白而闷闷不乐的隐士。他是一个名副其实的闭门不出的人，他利用小精灵监视他的兄弟Amrik和Mortlock。瑟斯韦尔憎恨他们两个--阿姆利克是他们母亲的最爱，而莫特洛克是个畸形的傻瓜。",
	"Ulder Ravengard is a fearless soldier who rose up through the ranks of the Flaming Fist to become its supreme marshal. Ravengard used his military position and influence to secure for himself a seat on the Council of Four. Following the deaths of two council members amid a cloud of corruption and scandal, he persuaded the Parliament of Peers to back his election to grand duke.": "乌尔德-拉文加德（Ulder Ravengard）是一名无畏的士兵，他通过火焰之拳的等级晋升为最高元帅。拉文加德利用他的军事地位和影响力，为自己争取到了四人议会的席位。在两名议会成员在腐败和丑闻的阴云中死亡后，他说服议会支持他当选为大公爵。",
	"Upon ascending to the highest position in the city government, Ravengard refused to relinquish command of the Flaming Fist, making him the most powerful figure in the city by far. This decision has not endeared him to anyone, but Ravengard could care less about his popularity. His only concerns are the stability and prosperity of Baldur's Gate, and he doesn't trust any of the other dukes or anyone in the Parliament of Peers to put the city's interests before their own.": "在登上市政府的最高职位后，拉文加德拒绝放弃对火焰之拳的指挥权，使他成为迄今为止城市中最有权力的人物。这个决定并没有让他得到任何人的青睐，但拉文加德可以不在乎他的人气。他唯一关心的是博德之门的稳定和繁荣，他不相信其他公爵或议会中的任何人会把城市的利益放在自己的利益之前。",
	"Ravengard rose to grand duke on a platform largely backed by idealistic commoners and enemies of the other established dukes. While he won election handily, Ravengard has struggled in performing his duties, finding his hands tied at every turn by both overt and {@condition invisible} bureaucracy. Despite this, he's been a voice of reason and common sense on the Council of Four—if not the egalitarianism some hoped. He's also proven largely resistant to scandal and corruption, though many of his fellow dukes and those in the Parliament of Peers still regularly outmaneuver him politically. One of his only obvious pleasures remains the surprise inspections he regularly visits upon the troops at Wyrm's Rock.": "拉文加德在一个主要由理想主义的平民和其他既定公爵的敌人支持的平台上晋升为大公爵。虽然他顺利地赢得了选举，但拉文加德在履行职责时却很挣扎，发现他的双手处处被公开的和（%0%）官僚主义束缚。尽管如此，他在四人议会中一直是理性和常识的代言人--即使不是一些人希望的平等主义。他也被证明在很大程度上抵制了丑闻和腐败，尽管他的许多公爵伙伴和议会中的那些人仍然经常在政治上战胜他。他唯一明显的乐趣之一仍然是他定期在巫妖石的部队中进行的突击检查。",
	"Ravengard was recently tricked into attending a diplomatic summit in Elturel, unaware that his political enemies in Baldur's Gate orchestrated this meeting in a fiendish plot to remove him from power. In his absence, the Flaming Fist is leaderless, the council rudderless.": "拉文加德最近被骗去参加在艾尔图勒举行的外交峰会，他不知道他在博德之门的政敌精心策划了这次会议，是为了把他赶下台的邪恶计划。在他缺席的情况下，火焰之拳失去了领导，议会失去了舵手。"
