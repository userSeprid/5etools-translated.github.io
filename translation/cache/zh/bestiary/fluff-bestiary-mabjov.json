	"Dwelling mostly in the Underdark, achaierai are cunning avian quadrupeds originally from the plane of Acheron. Tribalistic and organized, they possess a strong—if skewed—sense of justice and will often band together to seek bloody vengeance against those who have wronged their kin. They are highly intelligent, with a strong streak of sadistic cruelty, compelling them to devise new and inventive strategies of torture for their victims.": "主要居住在地下世界，achaierai是狡猾的禽类四足动物，最初来自Acheron平面。它们是部落主义的，有组织的，拥有强烈的--尽管是歪曲的--正义感，并经常联合起来寻求对那些对他们的亲属不利的人进行血腥的报复。他们非常聪明，有强烈的虐待狂的残忍倾向，迫使他们为他们的受害者设计新的和创造性的折磨策略。",
	"Achaierai have razor sharp beaks, and each of their four legs are tipped with savage talons that can rip an opponent to shreds. They typically hunt in flocks, using coordinated strategy to maximize the efficiency of their attacks. If an achaierai is threatened, it can expel a toxic cloud to distract its enemies and flee... only to resume the fight again later under more favorable conditions.": "Achaierai有剃刀般锋利的喙，它们的四条腿上都有野蛮的爪子，可以把对手撕成碎片。它们通常成群结队地捕食，利用协调的策略使其攻击的效率最大化。如果一只Achaierai受到威胁，它可以释放出一种有毒的云雾来分散敌人的注意力，然后逃离......只是在以后更有利的条件下再继续战斗。",
	"Social creatures by nature, the achaierai typically form small flocks of up to a half-dozen members. However, these flocks are not family. The leader is simply the largest and strongest member, and in times of food scarcity the weakest members are routinely cannibalized. Achaierai can only breed on their home plane. To increase their numbers in the Underdark, they capture wizards and torture them until they summon more of their kind from Acheron. Because of this, wizards are the only captives the carnivorous achaierai don't eventually eat.": "天生的社会动物，Achaierai通常形成小群，最多有半打成员。然而，这些鸟群并不是家庭。领导者只是最大和最强壮的成员，在食物匮乏的时候，最弱的成员通常会被吃掉。Achaierai只能在其母体上繁殖。为了增加他们在暗黑世界的数量，他们会抓捕巫师并折磨他们，直到他们从阿凯隆召唤出更多的同类。正因为如此，巫师是肉食性的Achaierai唯一没有最终吃掉的俘虏。",
	"Flocks of achaierai have been known to band together to wage war upon a svirfneblin village or drow outpost. These attacks come with little warning, and there are typically no survivors as the ravenous achaierai devour everything in sight. For this reason, the other Underdark races despise the achaierai, and will even work together to wipe out a flock whenever one is discovered. Inevitably, this triggers retaliation from other achaierai, leading to an endless cycle of vicious and bloody reprisals.": "成群的Achaierai已经知道他们会联合起来向斯维尔芬布林村庄或乌鸦前哨发动战争。这些攻击几乎没有任何警告，而且通常没有幸存者，因为贪婪的Achaierai会吞噬眼前的一切。出于这个原因，其他地下城种族鄙视阿凯拉人，甚至在发现一个阿凯拉人的时候，他们会一起合作来消灭这个族群。这不可避免地会引发其他achaierai的报复，从而导致无休止的恶性和血腥的报复循环。",
	"Aribeth was once an elven paladin of Tyr, the Blind God of Justice. Renowned for her beauty and beloved for her kindness, she was the personal guard of Nasher Alagonder, the lord of the city of Neverwinter. But when her fiancé, Fenthick Moss, was unjustly hanged for treason, grief and a desire for vengeance corrupted her once noble spirit. She started down a path of revenge against her lord, her people, and even her god that ultimately ended with her own death.": "艾瑞贝斯曾经是盲目的正义之神泰尔的精灵圣骑士。她因其美丽而闻名，因其善良而受人喜爱，是永夜城城主纳舍-阿拉贡德的私人护卫。但当她的未婚夫芬蒂克-莫斯因叛国罪被不公正地绞死时，悲伤和复仇的欲望腐蚀了她曾经高贵的精神。她开始了对她的领主、她的人民、甚至她的神的复仇之路，最终以她自己的死亡告终。",
	"After she was killed, the arch devil Mephistopheles sought out Aribeth's spirit in Hell. He made a bargain with the fallen paladin, offering her a chance to mete out justice once again as she had done when she served Tyr. Aribeth accepted and was returned to the world of the living.": "在她被杀之后，大魔王梅菲斯特在地狱里找到了艾瑞贝斯的灵魂。他与这位堕落的圣骑士进行了交易，为她提供了一个再次伸张正义的机会，就像她为泰尔服务时那样。艾瑞贝斯接受了，并被送回了活人的世界。",
	"The decades Aribeth had spent in hell, along with the betrayals she had experienced in her first life, had transformed her into a shell of a person. Devoid of conscience, remorse, and compassion, Mephistopheles made her into a hunter of those who had broken pacts made with the powers of Hell.": "艾瑞贝斯在地狱中度过的几十年，加上她在第一世中经历的背叛，使她变成了一个空壳。没有良知、悔恨和同情心，梅菲斯特使她成为那些违反与地狱力量签订的契约的人的猎手。",
	"But despite his efforts to completely break her, Mephistopheles soon recognized that a tiny spark of Aribeth's former kindness and compassion remained, buried deep within her. In acknowledgement of this, he bestowed upon Aribeth an unholy sword called Void that would eat the souls of its victims, sparing them from being damned to the eternal suffering of the Nine Hells. However, Mephistopheles only granted Aribeth permission to use this sword to spare one out of every nine victims, knowing that choosing who to save and who to let suffer would be a constant burden that would eventually corrupt the last noble vestiges of Aribeth's soul.": "但是，尽管梅菲斯特努力想彻底打垮她，但他很快就认识到，艾瑞贝斯以前的善良和同情心的微小火花仍然存在，深深地埋在她的体内。为了承认这一点，他赐予了艾瑞贝斯一把名为 \"虚无 \"的邪恶之剑，它可以吞噬受害者的灵魂，使他们免于被诅咒到九层地狱的永恒痛苦中。然而，梅菲斯特只允许艾里贝斯使用这把剑来拯救每九个受害者中的一个，因为他知道选择拯救谁和让谁受苦将是一个持续的负担，最终会腐蚀艾里贝斯灵魂的最后高贵的残余。",
	"But Aribeth was smart enough to understand her overlord's true plan. Instead of actively selecting who Void will spare, she makes the choice by using a simple, but extremely precise, scale that resembles the holy symbol she once carried as a priest of Tyr. When she encounters her victims, she asks them for a gold piece. If they give it to her, she places it on the scale, measuring the weight to the thousandth of an ounce. If the scale comes to balance on the last digit of \"9\", she will slay them with Void, sparing her the emotional burden of personally deciding who will be cast down and who will be spared.": "但阿里贝斯足够聪明，明白她的霸主的真正计划。她没有主动选择虚空会放过谁，而是通过使用一个简单但极其精确的天平来做出选择，这个天平类似于她曾经作为提尔的牧师所携带的神圣符号。当她遇到她的受害者时，她向他们索要一块金币。如果他们给了她，她就把它放在秤上，测量重量到千分之一盎司。如果天平平衡在最后一个数字 \"9 \"上，她就会用虚空杀死他们，这样她就不用亲自决定谁会被打倒，谁会被放过的情感负担。",
	"Even now, though she still serves as an avatar of Mephistopheles, Aribeth is not evil in the strict sense. Her victims are never the innocent, and she only unleashes her savage justice upon those who deserve it through their own choices and actions. And she takes no pleasure in her duties; no cruel revelry in the suffering she inflicts. In this way she is more akin to a relentless force of nature—unstoppable and uncaring, but unbiased in her dispensation of dark justice.": "即使现在，尽管她仍然是梅菲斯特的化身，但艾瑞贝斯并不是严格意义上的邪恶。她的受害者从来不是无辜的人，她只对那些因自己的选择和行为而应得的人释放她野蛮的正义。她不以自己的职责为乐；不以自己所造成的痛苦为残忍的狂欢。这样一来，她更像是一种无情的自然力量--不可阻挡，无情无义，但却不偏不倚地执行着黑暗的正义。",
	"I have no idea how the big dolt and his hamster scrounged up information on so many dangerous entities, but it's foolish to write about them if you ask me. There's a reason I've never written a book about the Nine Hells.": "我不知道这个大傻瓜和他的仓鼠是如何搜罗到这么多危险实体的信息的，但如果你问我，写这些东西是愚蠢的。我从未写过一本关于九层地狱的书是有原因的。",
	"Baalzebul, is an archdevil and the lord of Maladomini, the seventh layer of the Nine Hells. He is known as the Lord of the Flies because his tightly woven web of intrigue traps even the smallest fly. In recent centuries he has been cursed with a new hideous form by the Lord of the Nine Hells—Asmodeus. This form has earned him a new title—The Slug Archduke.": "巴尔泽布尔（Baalzebul）是一个大恶魔，是九层地狱第七层马拉多米尼的领主。他被称为 \"苍蝇之王\"，因为他严密编织的阴谋之网甚至能困住最小的苍蝇。近几个世纪以来，他被九层地狱之主--阿斯摩德（Asmodeus）诅咒了一种新的狰狞形态。这种形态为他赢得了一个新的称号--鼻涕虫大公。",
	"Baalzebul was originally known as Triel, one of the most powerful and beautiful angels to be found in Celestia. Triel's selfish acts in the name of achieving his perfection resulted in his corruption and exile from Celestia. After his fall, Asmodeus, perhaps out of some lingering sense of sympathy, quickly promoted Baalzebul to the ranks of devilish nobility. Baalzebul's ruthless lust for power served him well and before long he not only displaced the ancient, original Lord of Maladomini but managed to become the only archdevil to rule two layers of the Nine Hells, although he ruled Malbolge through the devil Moloch.": "巴尔泽布尔原名特里尔，是天体中最强大、最美丽的天使之一。特里尔以实现其完美为名的自私行为导致他堕落并被流放出天体。在他堕落之后，阿斯莫德也许是出于某种挥之不去的同情心，迅速将巴尔泽布尔提拔到恶魔贵族的行列。巴尔泽布尔对权力的无情欲望对他很有帮助，不久，他不仅取代了古老的、最初的马拉多米尼之主，而且成功地成为唯一一个统治九层地狱两层的大魔鬼，尽管他通过魔鬼摩洛赫统治了马尔博格。",
	"However, Baalzebul's pride continued to be his undoing. When he attempted to take Asmodeus's throne, his schemes were discovered and thwarted. Asmodeus inflicted a series of bizarre penalties upon Baalzebul. He was cursed to appear as a slug for one year per lie he had told to a devil. Any deal he struck with a mortal would result in a disaster for the participant. His castle was turned to excrement and filled with filth and his dominion of Malbolge was stripped from him.": "然而，巴尔泽布尔的傲慢仍然是他的败笔。当他试图夺取阿斯莫德的王位时，他的计划被发现并挫败了。阿斯莫德对巴勒泽布施加了一系列奇怪的惩罚。他被诅咒在一年内对魔鬼说的每一个谎言都会变成一个鼻涕虫。他与凡人达成的任何交易都会给参与者带来灾难。他的城堡变成了粪便，充满了污秽，他对马尔博格的统治权被剥夺了。",
	"Despite his punishments, Baalzebul is still dangerously cunning and charismatic. Even if trapped in the form of a slug, he is still the Lord of Lies, whose every deception is made with ease. Every one of his untruths is told with a specific purpose in mind. Only other devils are safe from his lies, as Baalzebul wishes to return to his original beautiful form.": "尽管受到惩罚，巴尔泽布尔仍然是危险的狡猾和有魅力的。即使被困在鼻涕虫的形状中，他仍然是谎言之主，他的每一个欺骗都是轻而易举的。他的每一个不实之词都是带着特定的目的说的。只有其他的魔鬼才能免遭他的谎言，因为巴尔泽布尔希望回到他原来的美丽形态。",
	"If forced into combat Baalzebul's first tactic is to belch out gargantuan clouds of flesh-devouring flies. Baalzebul's stench is so putrid that simply trying to get anywhere close to him is sickening. Despite his bloated form, he can still burrow underground and easily scale surfaces. He is easy to track, since he always leaves a thick layer of putrid slime in his wake.": "如果被迫进入战斗状态，巴尔泽布尔的第一个战术是喷出巨大的噬肉苍蝇云。巴尔泽布尔的恶臭是如此的腐烂，以至于仅仅试图接近他就会感到恶心。尽管他的外形臃肿，但他仍能钻入地下，并能轻易地爬上地面。他很容易被追踪，因为他的身后总是留下一层厚厚的腐烂粘液。",
	"It is said that the drow can imprison a Bebilith in a metal shell. This new creation is called a Retriever and is used by the dark elves to track down and exterminate their enemies.": "据说，鸦人可以将贝比利斯囚禁在一个金属壳中。这种新的创造物被称为 \"猎手\"，被黑暗精灵用来追踪和消灭他们的敌人。",
	"Bebiliths, or Creepers of the Abyss, are arachnoid demons that prey upon other demons... though whether they do so out of hunger, cruelty, or a strange compulsion to inflict justice on their chaotic evil kin is unknown. Other demons typically leave the bebilith alone and killing them is considered a great taboo. Further adding to the intrigue of their strange mystique, it is believed several greater demonic beings pay homage to the bebiliths.": "Bebiliths，或称深渊爬行者，是捕食其他恶魔的蛛网状恶魔......尽管他们这样做是出于饥饿、残忍，还是一种奇怪的强迫，对他们混乱的邪恶亲属施以正义，我们不得而知。其他恶魔通常会放过贝比里斯，杀死他们被认为是一个大禁忌。这进一步增加了他们奇怪的神秘感，据说有几个更大的恶魔向贝比里斯致敬。",
	"Massive, hulking hunters, bebiliths possess foreleg claws that can carve through the thickest armor like warm butter. They can cast webs imbued with searing green fire, and the venom from their bite causes victims to ignite with green flames that burn them alive from the inside out. While their spiderlike appearance suggests the demon queen Lolth created them, most Abyssal scholars have refuted that theory. Their origins are seemingly lost in time, though most suspect the bebilith are natural predators that roamed the Abyss long before other demons spread across it in their teeming hordes.": "巨大的，笨重的猎手，贝比利斯拥有前腿的爪子，可以像温热的黄油一样切开最厚的盔甲。它们可以撒下充满灼热绿火的网，它们的毒液会使受害者燃起绿色的火焰，从里到外将他们活活烧死。虽然它们像蜘蛛一样的外表表明是恶魔女王Lolth创造了它们，但大多数深渊学者都驳斥了这种理论。它们的起源似乎已经失去了时间，尽管大多数人怀疑贝比里斯是自然捕食者，在其他恶魔以其成群结队的方式蔓延到深渊之前，它们就已经在深渊中游荡了很久。",
	"Though they typically feed upon other demons, a bebilith will attack any creature it encounters without hesitation. During the initial strike, they mark their prey using a combination of pheromones and demonic magic. Once marked, a bebilith can track its victim across any distance—the only way to escape pursuit is by killing the bebilith or fleeing the Abyss. Fortunately, bebiliths cannot be summoned to the prime material plane. However, the drow discovered a way to draw their spirits into mechanical, spider-like constructs called retrievers, which they use to hunt or track their enemies.": "虽然它们通常以其他恶魔为食，但贝比里斯会毫不犹豫地攻击它遇到的任何生物。在最初的攻击中，它们会用信息素和恶魔魔法的组合来标记它们的猎物。一旦被标记，贝比里斯可以在任何距离内追踪它的受害者--唯一能逃脱追捕的方法就是杀死贝比里斯或逃离深渊。幸运的是，bebiliths不能被召唤到主要的物质界。然而，鸦人发现了一种方法，可以将它们的精神引向机械的、类似蜘蛛的构造物，称为检索器，他们用它来狩猎或追踪敌人。",
	"The demodands of the Carcerus prison in Ust Natha have tortured a small number of bebilith into doing their bidding. These bebilith can use their relentless hunter ability on anyone ever imprisoned in Carcerus.": "Ust Natha的Carcerus监狱的Demodands已经折磨了少量的bebilith，让他们听命于自己。这些贝比里特人可以对任何被囚禁在卡尔塞拉斯的人使用他们无情的猎手能力。",
	"When evil knocks on your door, don't ask who's there. Let your SWORD do the talking! But when you knock on evil's door, give it a good, hard KICK. And when evil asks, Who's there? tell them Boo sent you!": "当邪恶敲响你的门时，不要问谁在那里。让你的剑来说话! 但当你敲开邪恶的门时，要狠狠地踢它一脚。当邪恶问道：\"谁在那里？\"告诉他们是布派你来的！\"。",
	"A wholly evil, debased and sadistic god, Bhaal—the God of Murder—is reviled by a majority of Faerûn's pantheon; his divine foes include Chauntea, Helm, Ilmater, Lathander, Lliira and Tyr.": "Bhaal是一个完全邪恶的、堕落的和虐待狂的神，他被Faerûn的大部分神殿所唾弃；他的神敌包括Chauntea、Helm、Ilmater、Lathander、Lliira和Tyr。",
	"Before his ascension to godhood, Bhaal was a power-hungry adventurer on Toril. Along with his companions Bane and Myrkul, he sought to attain the portfolio of Jergal, God of the Dead. Jergal willingly offered his realm to the Dark Three, though they couldn't decide amongst themselves who would rule. Upon Jergal's suggestion, the three divided his power, deciding how to divide it based on the outcome of a game. The three played a game of knucklebones, and Bane emerged as the victor. He claimed the domains of hatred, strife and tyranny as his own. Myrkul, coming second, chose rule over the dead. Finally, Bhaal chose the divine province of death and murder.": "在成神之前，巴哈尔是托里尔星球上一个渴望权力的冒险家。他与他的同伴贝恩和米尔库尔一起，试图获得亡灵之神杰格尔的组合。杰格尔愿意将他的王国献给黑暗三神，尽管他们之间无法决定谁来统治。在杰格尔的建议下，三人分了他的权力，根据一个游戏的结果来决定如何分配。三人玩了一个指骨游戏，贝恩成为了胜利者。他声称仇恨、纷争和暴政的领域都是他自己的。米尔库（Myrkul）排在第二位，选择了对死者的统治。最后，巴恩选择了死亡和谋杀的神圣领域。",
	"A century ago, Bhaal foresaw that he would die in the Time of Troubles and enacted a plan that would allow him to return to life by creating the Bhaalspawn—mortal children imbued with a fraction of his divine essence. While that plan took more than a century to come to fruition, Bhaal has indeed been reborn. Having been dead for more than a century, he now works to rebuild his following, which will augment his divine power. Some of his most powerful and devout followers include his Bhaalspawn son Sarevok and the famous sky captain Pelyious.": "一个世纪前，巴尔预见到他将在动乱时期死去，并制定了一个计划，让他通过创造巴尔之子--被灌注了他的一小部分神性精华的不朽之子来恢复生命。虽然这个计划花了一个多世纪才得以实现，但法尔确实已经重生了。死了一个多世纪后，他现在致力于重建他的追随者，这将增强他的神力。他的一些最强大和最虔诚的追随者包括他的Bhaalspawn儿子Sarevok和著名的天空队长Pelyious。",
	"Bhaal has two avatar forms: a corpse-like male humanoid called the Slayer, and a huge beast known as the Ravager. He hunts victims at night in his Slayer form. When he has killed, it gives him the power to transform into the Ravager.": "巴尔有两种化身形式：一种是类似尸体的男性人形，称为 \"杀手\"，另一种是被称为 \"掠夺者 \"的巨大野兽。他在夜间以杀手的形态猎杀受害者。当他杀了人之后，他就有了变身为掠夺者的能力。",

	"Bodhi was born in the elven city of Suldanessellar. She was the sister of the city's greatest mage, Joneleth Icarus, and shared his interest in the arcane arts, even if she didn't have his talent for it. Jealous of her brother's prestige, she left Suldanessellar, searching for secrets that might make her the equal of Jon. During her journeys she came across the wandering folk known as the Vistani.": "Bodhi出生在精灵城市Suldanessellar。她是这个城市最伟大的法师乔尼斯-伊卡洛斯的妹妹，她和他一样对奥术感兴趣，尽管她没有他的天赋。由于嫉妒她哥哥的声望，她离开了苏尔达内塞拉，寻找可能使她与乔恩平等的秘密。在她的旅途中，她遇到了被称为维斯坦尼的流浪民。",
	"The Vistani showed her paths into the foul regions of the Shadowfell, where Bodhi encountered the sinister Dark Powers. Bodhi made a pact with these enigmatic beings and they showed her secrets that would allow her to draw power directly from the elven gods.": "维斯塔尼人为她指明了进入阴影地带的道路，在那里，波帝遇到了邪恶的黑暗力量。波帝与这些神秘的生物达成了协议，他们向她展示了可以让她直接从精灵之神那里汲取力量的秘密。",
	"Returning to Suldanessellar, Bodhi shared the secrets she had discovered with Joneleth. Her whispers enflamed his desire to gain even greater power. She and her brother embarked on a plot to achieve godhood by draining Suldanessellar's Tree of Life of its magical essence. The ritual would have killed most of the elves in the city, but the pair were thwarted by Ellesime, the city's queen.": "回到Suldanessellar后，Bodhi与Joneleth分享了她所发现的秘密。她的低语激起了他获得更大力量的欲望。她和她的哥哥开始了一个阴谋，通过抽干苏尔达内塞拉的生命之树的魔法精华来实现成神。这个仪式会杀死城市中的大多数精灵，但这对夫妇被城市的女王埃勒西姆挫败了。",
	"For their crimes, the siblings were cursed—stripped of their elven longevity and exiled from their home. Bodhi was enraged at what had happened to her. Despite her brother's protests, she returned to Suldanessellar to try and murder the queen. She slaughtered dozens of her kin before Ellesime finally killed her. But Bodhi did not stay dead. Instead, the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell brought her back as a vampire so that she could continue to corrupt her brother and bring about his final downfall as well.": "因为他们的罪行，这对兄妹被诅咒了--被剥夺了精灵的寿命，并被流放出他们的家园。博蒂对自己的遭遇感到非常愤怒。她不顾哥哥的抗议，回到苏尔达内塞勒，试图谋杀女王。在艾勒西姆最终杀死她之前，她屠杀了几十个她的亲属。但菩提并没有一直死下去。相反，暗影城的黑暗势力把她带回来，变成了一个吸血鬼，这样她就可以继续腐蚀她的哥哥，并使他最终垮台。",
	"With her newfound powers, Bodhi helped her brother capture dozens of powerful individuals from across the nation of Amn. One of the victims she brought to her brother for torture and experimentation was the Bhaalspawn named Abdel Adrian, mortal son of the God of Murder.

	"Borovik's will to survive allowed him to cease being the hunted and instead become the hunter. He learned everything he could in a land overrun with undead and aberrations of nature.

	"Doc Watson (only his mother calls him Cornelius) is the consummate academic. He has an eclectic collection of interests and rarely stays focused on a single subject for longer than a few months. He calls himself a doctor, though strangely, medicine has never been one of his interests. Supposedly the term comes from his time with a man who claimed the highest accolade one could achieve in the study of a single subject was called a \"doctorate\". The one interest that Doc Watson has consistently kept up with is magic and that is mainly because it remains the best tool to help him continue to learn.": "华生医生（只有他的母亲叫他科尼利厄斯）是一个完美的学者。他的兴趣不拘一格，很少在一个主题上停留超过几个月的时间。他自称是一名医生，但奇怪的是，医学从来都不是他的兴趣之一。据推测，这个词来自于他和一个人在一起的时候，这个人声称一个人在研究单一学科时能获得的最高荣誉叫做 \"博士学位\"。华生医生一直保持的兴趣是魔术，这主要是因为魔术仍然是帮助他继续学习的最佳工具。",
	"Doc Watson was born to a minor noble family in Waterdeep. While he was a studious child who loved reading, he was a little aimless and his family despaired of him finding a trade. Luckily, after spending time with his eccentric uncle (who happened to be a minor wizard), Doc Watson discovered that he had a knack for magic.": "华生医生出生在沃特德普的一个小贵族家庭。虽然他是个好学的孩子，喜欢读书，但他有点漫无目的，他的家人对他找到一个行业感到绝望。幸运的是，在与他古怪的叔叔（恰好是个小巫师）相处了一段时间后，华生医生发现他对魔法很有一套。",
	"To the disappointment of his family, Doc Watson didn't apply this magical skill to a respectable profession such as the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, the clergy of Mystra or the Academy of Stargazers. Instead, he tried his hand at an increasingly strange number of jobs, some of which his exasperated mother was certain he had invented entirely on his own. This included being a weather forecaster for the Waterdeep Port Authority and a columnist for the Weekly Waterdeep Gazette. The final straw was when Doc Watson tried his hand as an executive chef at the Inn of Barmy Blowhards. During his time there he claimed to have achieved the optimal Maillard reaction with a localized pyromance (getting the perfect sear on a steak using fire magic). It was at this point that his family cut off his monthly allowance.": "令家人失望的是，华生医生并没有将这种神奇的技能应用于受人尊敬的职业，如魔法师和保护者的观察团、神秘的神职人员或观星者学院。相反，他尝试了越来越多的奇怪工作，其中一些工作是他气急败坏的母亲确信他完全是自己发明的。这包括担任沃特迪普港务局的天气预报员和《沃特迪普周报》的专栏作家。最后一根稻草是华生医生尝试在 \"野蛮人旅馆 \"担任行政主厨。在那里，他声称已经实现了最佳的麦拉德反应与局部火法（用火魔法在牛排上获得完美的烤制效果）。就在这时，他的家人切断了他每月的津贴。",
	"Forced to find a new source of income, Doc Watson was convinced by a friend of his, Flimp Shagglecran, that he should try his hand at the age-old profession of adventuring. Adventuring turned out to be quite lucrative and exposed Doc Watson to all sorts of interesting people, places and monsters. Eventually, he and Flimp had accumulated enough wealth that they were able to found a new guild which they gave a descriptive, but exceedingly unoriginal, name: The Adventurer's Guild.": "华生医生被迫寻找新的收入来源，他的一个朋友Flimp Shagglecran说服他，他应该尝试一下冒险这一古老的职业。冒险被证明是相当有利可图的，并且让华生医生接触到各种有趣的人、地方和怪物。最后，他和弗林普积累了足够的财富，他们能够成立一个新的公会，并给它起了一个描述性的、但极不新颖的名字：冒险家协会。",

	"Cryonax seeks to turn the multiverse into ice. To this end, he strives to unleash eternal winter upon entire worlds.

	"Originally, Dagryn was a powerful black dragon that hunted the Underdark, feasting on everything from beholders to drow to illithid. But he was particularly fond of dwarves, whom he considered a delicacy. Supremely arrogant, Dagryn believe no denizens of the Underdark could challenge his power, until he had the misfortune of angering a coven of hags.": "最初，达格林是一条强大的黑龙，它在暗黑世界中捕食一切东西，从持有者到乌鸦再到伊利希德。但他特别喜欢矮人，他认为矮人是一种美味佳肴。达格利恩极其傲慢，他认为没有任何暗黑世界的居民可以挑战他的力量，直到他不幸激怒了一个女巫团。",
	"The hags trapped and killed the great wyrm, but instead of leaving him for dead, they reincarnated him in the form of a dwarf—a twisted joke on the once fearsome creature. In a final mockery of his former glory, they branded him with the name Dagryn—a bastardized echo of the mighty beast he once had been. Dagryn has now lived so many years as a dwarf that the memories of his life before the reincarnation have mostly faded. In addition to forgetting his true name, he no longer remembers his origin world, though he knows that Faerûn is not where he was born.": "女巫们困住并杀死了伟大的巫妖，但她们并没有让他死掉，而是让他以矮人的形式转世，这是对这个曾经可怕的生物的一个扭曲的玩笑。在对他以前的荣耀的最后嘲弄中，他们给他打上了达格林的名字--一个他曾经是的强大野兽的私生子的回声。达格利恩现在作为一个矮人生活了这么多年，对他转世前的生活记忆大多已经消逝。除了忘记自己的真名之外，他也不再记得自己的起源世界，尽管他知道法鲁恩并不是他的出生地。",
	"In the early years after his transformation, Dagryn discovered another cruel quirk of the hag's curse. After several years his wretched existence as a lowly dwarf became unbearable, and Dagryn was driven to suicide. But upon his death, he woke to discover his body had been restored to its original dragon form. However, his joy was short lived—after 24 hours he once again shifted back into his dwarven shape... but now he had a malformed leg, giving him a painful limp.": "在他变身后的最初几年里，达格利恩发现了女巫诅咒的另一个残酷的怪癖。几年后，他作为一个卑微的侏儒的悲惨生活变得难以忍受，达格利恩被迫自杀。但在他死后，他醒来发现自己的身体已经恢复到了原来的龙形。然而，他的喜悦是短暂的--24小时后，他再次变回了矮人的形状......但现在他有一条畸形的腿，使他痛苦地跛行。",
	"Over the next decades, the true scope of the horror inflicted upon him became apparent. Each time his dwarven body was killed, he would be reborn as a dragon for a single day. And each time he turned back into a dwarf he would find himself afflicted with some new infirmity: arthritic joints; rotting teeth; punishing migraines; constant ulcers.": "在接下来的几十年里，施加在他身上的恐怖的真正范围变得明显。每次他的矮人身体被杀死，他就会重生为龙，时间只有一天。而每次他变回矮人时，都会发现自己被一些新的疾病所折磨：关节炎；腐烂的牙齿；惩罚性的偏头痛；持续的溃疡。",
	"Dagryn now dreads adding new ailments to the relentless, crippling pain of his dwarven body. Whenever he is killed—a somewhat frequent occurrence, as a frail, old dwarf is an easy target—he spends his time as a dragon unleashing mad vengeance upon the world in an orgy of death, destruction, and mayhem. As a result, he has developed two very distinct and contrasting personalities: the timid, subservient dwarf and the raging, hate-filled dragon.": "达格利恩现在害怕在他矮人的身体上增加新的病痛，这是他无情的、残缺不全的痛苦。每当他被杀的时候--这有点频繁，因为一个虚弱的老矮人很容易成为目标--他就会像龙一样，在死亡、破坏和混乱的狂欢中向世界展开疯狂的复仇。因此，他形成了两种截然不同的性格：胆小、顺从的侏儒和狂暴、充满仇恨的龙。",
	"Typically appearing as a beautiful, young elven woman clad in golden jewelry, Darien is usually accompanied by several scantily clad and equally beautiful \"bodyguards\", all of whom seem to be comfortable in any climate, no matter how cold. However, in reality Darien is a powerful half-ogre illusionist and the golden jewelry aren't simply valuable trinkets, but the soul circlets of skeleton warriors—the magically disguised bodyguards that accompany her. Worst of all, Darien is driven by a disturbing obsession for those who call themselves adventurers.": "通常情况下，达里安以一个美丽的、年轻的精灵女子的形象出现，她的身边通常有几个衣着暴露、同样美丽的 \"保镖\"，所有这些人似乎在任何气候下都很舒服，无论多么寒冷。然而，在现实中，达里安是一个强大的半希腊幻术师，而那些金色的珠宝并不是简单的有价值的饰品，而是骷髅战士的灵魂圆环--那些陪伴她的经过魔法伪装的保镖。最糟糕的是，达里安对那些自称是冒险家的人有着令人不安的迷恋。",
	"Born to a human mother who died at birth, Darien was rescued by an elven adventurer from Evereska named Vail. Vail tried to keep Darien's nature a secret from the elves of Evereska, knowing that they would never accept a half-ogre. When Darien was in her teens, Vail taught her illusion magic which she could use to change her appearance and create an entirely different identity. Darien modeled her looks and behavior off an elven girl named Shirri—a young elven princess that Darien idolized to the point of obsession. But Darien lacked the grace and refinement of a true elf and despite looking the part, she was never accepted by the elven youth of Evereska.": "达里安的母亲是人类，但在出生时就死了，他被一个来自埃弗里斯卡的精灵冒险家韦尔救了出来。韦尔试图向埃弗里斯卡的精灵们隐瞒达里安的本性，因为他知道他们不会接受一个半人半兽的人。当达里安十几岁的时候，维尔教给她幻术，她可以用它来改变自己的外表，创造一个完全不同的身份。达里安以一个叫雪莉的精灵女孩为榜样，她的长相和行为是达里安崇拜的年轻精灵公主，甚至到了痴迷的程度。但达里安缺乏真正的精灵的优雅和精致，尽管她看起来很像，但她从未被埃弗里斯卡的精灵青年所接受。",
	"One spring, when Vail was away on a campaign, Darien kidnapped Shirri. She kept her a prisoner for weeks, obsessively studying her in order to learn how to mimic her poise and speech. She both loved and hated Shirri, and her moods would constantly shift between fawning adoration and bitter resentment. She would often shower her prisoner with gifts, like rich cakes and beautiful clothes, but even the smallest, seemingly insignificant thing could trigger a sudden bout of rage, causing Darien to lock Shirri for days in the cellar, naked, cold, and starving.": "有一年春天，当维尔外出参加活动时，达里安绑架了雪莉。她把她当作囚犯关了几个星期，痴迷地研究她，以学习如何模仿她的姿态和言语。她对Shirri既爱又恨，她的情绪会在媚俗的崇拜和痛苦的怨恨之间不断变化。她经常给她的囚犯送礼物，如丰富的蛋糕和漂亮的衣服，但即使是最小的、看起来微不足道的东西也会引发突然的愤怒，导致达里恩将Shirri锁在地窖里好几天，赤身裸体，寒冷和饥饿。",
	"When Vail returned, he was horrified to discover what Darien had done and cast her out of Evereska. Banished, Darien wandered the Greycloak Hills that protect Evereska, hoping to die in the snows of an early winter. Instead, she was found by a force of Elemental Evil: Cryonax, Prince of Ice. A pact was made, and Darien survived the winter to make her way down into the civilized lands of the Sword Coast.": "当维尔回来时，他惊恐地发现了达里安的所作所为，并将她赶出了埃弗里斯卡。被驱逐后，达里安在保护埃弗里斯卡的灰袍山庄徘徊，希望在初冬的雪地里死去。相反，她被一股邪恶元素的力量所发现：冰王子Cryonax。双方达成了协议，达利安熬过了冬天，进入了剑海岸的文明之地。",
	"Darien's natural talent with illusion magic, coupled with the power that Cryonax provided, allowed her to thrive. In her travels, she became obsessed with the men and women that called themselves adventurers. These bands of treasure hunting thrill seekers seemed to exist outside of the normal order of the world. They did what they liked and became rich and powerful doing so. They also reminded her of the one man who had ever showed her love—Vail.": "达里安在幻觉魔法方面的天赋，加上Cryonax提供的力量，使她得以茁壮成长。在她的旅行中，她开始迷恋那些自称为冒险家的男人和女人。这些寻宝探险者的队伍似乎存在于世界的正常秩序之外。他们做自己喜欢的事，并因此而变得富有和强大。他们也让她想起了曾经向她示爱的那个男人--维尔。",
	"Darien is parasitic in nature. The smallest word or act—or even seeing them across a crowded room—will cause her to become obsessed with an individual. From that point on she will use all her powers to insert herself into their life, typically by hiring her victim for a high-paying adventuring job. If her machinations fail, however, she is not averse to resorting to brute force such as enchantment magic or taking loved ones as hostages to compel compliance.": "达里安在本质上是寄生的。最微小的言语或行为--或者甚至在拥挤的房间里看到他们--都会使她迷恋上一个人。从那时起，她会用她所有的力量将自己插入他们的生活中，通常是通过雇佣她的受害者从事高薪的冒险工作。然而，如果她的阴谋诡计失败了，她也不排斥使用蛮力，如施展魔法或将所爱的人作为人质来迫使他们服从。",
	"Ultimately, she wants the targets of her obsessive infatuation to come to love and respect her. If she is not shown the love that she craves, then she will lash out. Often this means that she will wait for an opportune time to \"rescue\" them from a battle not going their way. These adventurers might wake to find themselves hostages of Darien, where they must endure her erratic emotional outbursts and cruel mind games until they either escape, are rescued, or are driven into total madness.": "归根结底，她希望她痴迷的对象能够爱她、尊重她。如果她没有得到她所渴望的爱，那么她就会发怒。通常这意味着她会等待一个合适的时机，把他们从一场不顺的战斗中 \"拯救 \"出来。这些冒险者醒来后可能会发现自己是达里安的人质，他们必须忍受她反复无常的情绪爆发和残酷的心理游戏，直到他们要么逃跑，要么获救，要么被彻底逼疯。",
	"Me and Boo like many sticky things, most especially donuts and Boo's favorite, candied pecans. But some sticky things belong on the pointy end of a sword.": "我和老布喜欢很多粘稠的东西，尤其是甜甜圈和老布的最爱，蜜饯山核桃。但有些粘性的东西是属于剑的尖头的。",
	"Demodands are difficult to study since they usually never leave their native plane of Carceri. However, the prison in Ust Natha presents a unique opportunity to view them up close. Not that I enjoyed the experience.": "德莫丹德是很难研究的，因为他们通常不会离开他们的本土平面卡塞里。然而，Ust Natha的监狱提供了一个独特的机会来近距离观察它们。并不是说我喜欢这种体验。",

	"Though they are trapped in Carceri, the demodands do not consider themselves prisoners. Instead, they are the self-appointed wardens and jailors of the Tarterian Depths. They derive pleasure from tormenting and terrorizing their fellow captives through acts of brutality, cruelly taunting them the entire time. However, they make no distinction between those actually condemned to Carceri, and planar travelers just passing through. As far as the demodand are concerned, all must be prevented from escaping at any cost.": "虽然他们被困在卡塞里，但迪莫丹德人并不认为自己是囚犯。相反，他们是自封的看守人和塔特里亚深渊的狱卒。他们通过残暴的行为来折磨和恐吓他们的同伴，并在整个过程中残酷地嘲弄他们，从中获得快乐。然而，他们对那些真正被判处死刑的人和只是路过的星球旅行者不加区分。就Demodand而言，必须不惜一切代价阻止所有人逃跑。",
	"Demodands have three castes, each with a form so repulsive even other denizens of the Lower Planes view them with disgust. The farastu are forced to do the most menial tasks, under orders from their kelubar and shator superiors. When around weaker creatures they are vicious bullies; around more powerful beings they become whimpering cowards. The kelubars are the bureaucrats of the demodands, acting as intermediaries between the lowly farastu and their shator overlords. The kelubar decide which prisoners are rewarded, and which should be punished with extra torments. The shators make up the ruling caste, effectively serving as prison wardens to the lower-ranked guards.": "德莫丹人有三个种姓，每个种姓都有令人厌恶的外形，甚至下层世界的其他居民也对他们感到厌恶。Farastu在他们的kelubar和shator上级的命令下，被迫做最琐碎的工作。在弱小的生物面前，他们是凶恶的欺凌者；在更强大的生物面前，他们成为呜咽的懦夫。kelubar是demodands的官僚，是卑微的farastu和他们的shator霸主之间的中间人。kelubar决定哪些囚犯可以得到奖励，哪些应该受到额外的折磨。沙特人构成了统治阶层，有效地充当了低级卫兵的监狱看守。",
	"Each shator possesses an obsidian triangle. These powerful magical artifacts grant the demodands access to the collective memory of their kind; a shared recollection stretching back to the very dawn of time. The shators primarily use the triangles to track the identity of every being that has ever escaped Carceri, concocting elaborate, generation-spanning strategies to recapture these fugitive souls.": "每个shator都拥有一个黑曜石三角。这些强大的魔法神器赋予了Demodands进入他们种族的集体记忆的权利；一个共同的回忆可以延伸到时间的黎明。沙特人主要利用这些三角形来追踪每一个曾经逃出卡塞里的人的身份，并制定出精心设计的、跨越世代的战略来重新捕获这些逃亡的灵魂。",

Most dread doppelgangers work alone, though sometimes they will lead a band of younger members of their kind.": "可怕的二重身是该种族的一个古老成员。它已经活了几个世纪，采用了数百甚至数千种不同生物的形式。长年累月地冒充他人已经耗尽了这些年长生命的任何一种同情心。大多数可怕的二重身都是单独行动的，尽管有时他们会带领一帮年轻的同类。",
	"Dread doppelgangers have impersonated the feelings and emotions of so many others that they find it difficult to feel emotions of their own. Because of this they make excellent spies and assassins, for they don't experience remorse for anything that they might have to do. Dread doppelgangers seek out increasingly risky and bizarre behavior in order to instill any kind of emotion. Often this means they will take on dangerous jobs that could bring about their own death.": "可怕的二重身已经冒充了许多人的感情和情绪，以至于他们发现很难感受到自己的情绪。正因为如此，他们是优秀的间谍和刺客，因为他们对自己可能要做的任何事情都不会有悔恨的感觉。恐惧二重身为了灌输任何一种情感，会寻求越来越多的风险和怪异的行为。这往往意味着他们会承担可能导致自己死亡的危险工作。",
	"In their natural form dread doppelgangers move about in a disturbing fashion. They are so used to mimicking the movements of others that their own manner of moving seems broken and chaotic. While they might seem ungainly and clumsy when they move, they can lash out at speeds that often surprise their victims.": "在他们的自然形态下，可怕的二重身以一种令人不安的方式移动着。他们是如此习惯于模仿他人的动作，以至于他们自己的移动方式似乎是破碎和混乱的。虽然他们在移动时可能显得不雅观和笨拙，但他们可以以经常让受害者吃惊的速度冲出去。",
	"In many ways an archetypal Red Wizard, Edwin Odesseiron is an exceedingly arrogant conjuration mage hailing from the eastern nation of Thay. He originally traveled west to the Sword Coast on a mission to kill the Rashemi Wychlaran Dynaheir, both as part of a personal rivalry and under orders from his superior Red Wizards. Once his mission was accomplished, and Dynaheir was dead, Edwin remained on the Sword Coast in order to build up his own personal power without the oversight of the Zulkirs of Thay.": "在许多方面，埃德温-奥德赛隆是一个典型的红袍巫师，他是一个极其傲慢的魔法师，来自东部的泰伊国。他最初前往西边的剑海岸，任务是杀死拉希米-威克拉伦-迪纳希尔，这既是个人竞争的一部分，也是奉他的上级红袍巫师的命令。一旦他的任务完成了，迪纳希尔也死了，埃德温就留在了剑海岸，以便在没有泰伊的祖尔基尔监督的情况下建立起自己的个人力量。",
	"While Edwin had a falling out with the Red Wizards of Thay some time ago, he managed to repair the relationship by delivering one of the Nether Scrolls to the ruler of Thay—Szass Tam. His short time studying the Nether Scroll resulted in some calamitous results, but one of the spells he learned imparted him with the longevity of an elf.": "虽然埃德温前段时间和泰伊的红袍巫师们闹翻了，但他设法修复了关系，把其中一个尼瑟斯卷轴交给了泰伊的统治者--沙斯-谭。他研究尼瑟尔卷轴的短暂时间导致了一些灾难性的结果，但他学到的一个咒语使他获得了精灵般的长寿。",
	"While Edwin will often return to his homeland of Thay, he can most often be found in the city of Baldur's Gate. He has recently taken over Ramazith's Tower and adopted the identity of Lorroakan, the young mage who formerly lived in the tower (now dead by Edwin's hand).": "虽然埃德温经常会回到他的故乡泰伊，但他最常出现在博德之门的城市里。他最近接管了拉玛兹塔，并采用了以前住在塔里的年轻法师罗罗坎的身份（现在死于埃德温之手）。",
	"Despite his inarguably high intelligence, Edwin seems to lack common sense. As a result, his grand schemes and power grabs are typically undone by his own hubris and oversights. Edwin almost universally treats others with disdain, openly insulting his \"lessers.\" As much as Edwin detests those he views as his inferiors, he gets along no better with his betters. (His envy of the legendary wizard Elminster Aumar is particularly venomous.) Edwin has a simulacrum of himself that he uses to augment his power or send into dangerous situations. Since he doesn't respect the intelligence of anyone other than himself, he often finds himself engaged in conversation with his simulacrum.": "尽管埃德温的智力无可争议地很高，但他似乎缺乏常识。因此，他的宏伟计划和权力攫取通常都被他自己的傲慢和疏忽所破坏。埃德温几乎普遍对他人不屑一顾，公开侮辱他的 \"小人物\"。就像埃德温厌恶那些被他视为下级的人一样，他与他的上级也相处得很好。(他对传奇巫师艾尔明斯特-奥马尔的嫉妒尤其毒辣。)埃德温有一个自己的模拟体，他用它来增强自己的力量或将其送入危险境地。由于他不尊重除他自己以外的其他人的智慧，他经常发现自己在与他的模拟人对话。",
	"Born from the experiments of Belic Haphrat, a Red Wizard from the lands of Thay, Eo is a powerful tiefling sorceress. The offspring of a half-dragon and a succubus, Eo was raised by Belic as his own child, and showed an early affinity for magical gifts. As she grew older, Eo became increasingly useful to the Haphrat's families plans and schemes, eventually becoming a key cog in their complex machinations. Only then did Belic realize his daughter had been carefully manipulating him her entire life, working herself into a position of power and influence in his affairs so she could betray him. By then, however, it was too late, and Eo used her power to take control of Belic's mind, his family, and his wealth before ultimately discarding her adopted father when he ceased to be useful.": "Eo是来自泰伊大陆的红袍巫师Belic Haphrat的实验品，她是一个强大的铁皮人女巫。作为一个半龙人和一个魅魔的后代，艾欧被贝利克当做自己的孩子来抚养，并且很早就表现出对魔法天赋的亲和力。随着年龄的增长，Eo对哈菲特家族的计划和方案越来越有用，最终成为他们复杂阴谋中的一个关键齿轮。直到那时，贝利克才意识到他的女儿一生都在小心翼翼地操纵着他，使自己在他的事务中获得权力和影响力，以便她能够背叛他。然而，那时已经太晚了，Eo利用她的力量控制了Belic的思想、他的家庭和他的财富，最终在他不再有用时抛弃了她的养父。",
	"Eo is obsessed with her lineage, believing her bloodline makes her inherently superior to other beings. Her infatuation with her kinfolk—demons, devils, and dragons—has led her to walk the Nine Hells, playing dice games with demon lords and signing contracts with archdevils. She has sought audience with dragons of all kinds, including several of the most ancient wyrms in all of Faerûn. There are even rumors she possess a dragon orb, one of the most rare and powerful magical items.": "埃奥痴迷于她的血统，认为她的血统使她天生就比其他生命优越。她对她的亲属--恶魔、魔鬼和龙--的迷恋使她在九层地狱中行走，与恶魔领主玩骰子游戏，与大恶魔签订合同。她曾寻求与各种龙的交流，包括法鲁恩最古老的几条巫妖。甚至有传言说她拥有一个龙珠，那是最稀有和最强大的魔法物品之一。",
	"The other driving influence in her life is the unbridled pursuit of hedonistic pleasure. Eo believes that the promise of the afterlife is a conspiracy by the gods to trick mortals into living lives of conformity, preparing them to be consigned to an eternity of sheer boredom after they die. In this way, Eo believes, the status quo of the Heavens and the Hells can be more easily maintained. Eo rebels against this status quo by pursuing earthly pleasures in all their forms, regardless of the long-term costs. She lives almost exclusively in the moment, relying on her wealth, fame, and privilege to protect her against any serious consequences of her actions.": "她生活中的另一个驱动因素是对享乐主义快乐的肆意追求。埃奥认为，来世的承诺是诸神的一个阴谋，目的是欺骗凡人过上循规蹈矩的生活，为他们死后被送入纯粹无聊的永恒做准备。埃奥认为，这样一来，天堂和地狱的现状就能更容易维持。Eo反抗这种现状，追求各种形式的世俗快乐，而不考虑长期的代价。她几乎只活在当下，依靠她的财富、名声和特权来保护她免受她的行为带来的任何严重后果。",

Eager to be recognized as the most beautiful and the most powerful woman in history, she has spent much of her ill-gotten Thayvian fortune in a campaign to be elected Duke of Baldur's Gate. In her pursuit of political power, she continually tries to buy the love and loyalty of the populace with extravagant festivals where wine and illicit drugs are freely available in virtually unlimited quantities. While winning many of the ordinary citizens to her side, these public orgies have put her at odds with the reigning political establishment and various religious figures championing a more traditional morality.": "埃奥是一个最高级别的自恋者，在任何时候都渴望得到关注、崇拜和无限制的赞美。她渴望被公认为历史上最美丽和最有权势的女人，在竞选博德之门公爵的过程中，她花费了大量不义之财Thayvian的财富。在追求政治权力的过程中，她不断地试图用奢侈的节日来收买民众的爱和忠诚，在这些节日中，葡萄酒和非法药物几乎可以无限量地自由供应。虽然赢得了许多普通公民的支持，但这些公开的狂欢使她与执政的政治机构和各种倡导更多传统道德的宗教人士发生了冲突。",
	"Eo's only weakness is her children. Her son, Aeshma, has gone missing recently. Rumor has it that Eo gambled his soul away in a drunken game of cards with some fiendish lord, though there is no proof as to his fate.

Never knowing any other family, she grew to become a fervent worshipper of nature and the Shadow Druid's tenets. Over the decades, Faldorn rose through the ranks of her order until she eventually claimed leadership in a battle with the former Shadow Master. She returned to her Uthgardt tribe for a few years to take a husband, but abandoned him and the son that they had together after a few years.": "法尔多恩出生在北方的黑鸦乌斯加特部落。她的部落居住在世界之脊内，这是法鲁恩西北部的一个冰山山脉。在婴儿时期，法尔多恩被提供给一个影子德鲁伊飞地，后来被纳入他们的行列。从未认识过任何其他家庭的她，逐渐成为自然和影子德鲁伊信条的狂热崇拜者。几十年来，法尔多恩在她的教团中步步高升，直到她最终在与前影子大师的战斗中取得了领导地位。她回到她的乌斯加德特部落几年，找了个丈夫，但几年后就抛弃了他和他们一起生的儿子。",

Once she is a member of the Elder Circle, it will be easy for her to subvert the Emerald Enclave to do the bidding of the Shadow Druids.

When such arms are unavailable, gibberlings improvise using rocks, bones, and large sticks. Gibberlings lack any sense of self-preservation; with no concept of retreat, a gibberling always fights to the death.": "即使是一个新手冒险家也能在短时间内解决一只长臂猿，尽管它们总是成群结队地旅行。如果不加控制，这些群体会膨胀成巨大的群落，吞噬掉它们路上的一切。尽管它们有动物性行为，但长臂猿有足够的智慧来挥舞武器，尽管这些武器是从受害者身上偷来的，而不是自己制造的。当这种武器无法使用时，长臂猿就会用石头、骨头和大棍子来凑合。长臂猿缺乏自我保护意识；由于没有撤退的概念，长臂猿总是战斗到死。",

Lothar was infected with lycanthropy when he stayed with a family of wereravens disguised as simple merchants. Initially he searched for a cure to the supernatural affliction, but soon began to hear the whisperings of the Raven Queen. At first, she only spoke to him in his dreams, but her voice became more insistent as time went on. It was not long before her voice would encroach upon his thoughts day and night.

One of his infamous schemes was an alliance between himself, Dispater, Mammon, and Geryon. They conspired to take power from the other archdevils, Baalzebul, Zariel, Belial and Moloch. With this increased power, Mephistopheles would then be able to challenge Asmodeus himself. But he was betrayed by Geryon, who had been secretly siding with Asmodeus. Despite the blatancy of his rebellion, he was the archdevil that suffered the least: not cursed like Mammon or Baalzebul; not cast down like Belial, Moloch or Geryon. This has led many to believe that there is some ancient secret to the relationship between the Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, though what it could be is a mystery none have discovered.": "梅菲斯特是一个古老的实体，在年龄上甚至可以与阿斯莫德相媲美。在他作为大恶魔的时候，他曾负责过许多试图推翻九幽之主的计划。他的一个臭名昭著的计划是他自己、Dispater、Mammon和Geryon之间的一个联盟。他们密谋从其他大魔鬼巴勒泽布、扎里尔、贝利亚和摩洛赫手中夺取权力。随着权力的增加，梅菲斯特将能够亲自挑战阿斯莫德。但他被一直暗中与阿斯莫德站在一起的吉里昂出卖了。尽管他的叛乱很明目张胆，但他却是遭受损失最小的大恶魔：没有像玛门或巴勒泽布那样受到诅咒；没有像贝利亚、摩洛赫或吉里昂那样被抛下。这使许多人相信，阿斯莫德和梅菲斯特之间存在着某种古老的秘密，尽管它可能是一个没有人发现的谜。",

In addition to his barely contained anger, Mephistopheles suffers from obsessive envy, and he is bitterly resentful that he is \"merely\" the second most powerful archdevil.": "梅菲斯特是个出色的战术家和战略家，他对地狱的政治阴谋和每一个计划和联盟的潜在陷阱有着无与伦比的了解。他说话时彬彬有礼，很有魅力，表现出一种狡猾的机智，同时又投射出一种自我克制和镇定的形象。但是，在这种文雅的形象下，潜藏着一种野蛮的、几乎无法控制的脾气，当他独自在宫殿里时，常常会爆发出无法控制的愤怒。除了勉强控制的愤怒之外，梅菲斯特还患有强迫性嫉妒症，他对自己 \"仅仅 \"是第二位最强大的大魔鬼感到非常不满。",
	"As the foremost wizard of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles often resorts to magic when forced to defend himself. But his greatest power comes from the ability to wield Hellfire itself. Created by tapping into the profane essence of Hell, Hellfire is unimaginably, unbearably hot.

Mephistopheles can also shape Hellfire any way he wishes, making it his most potent weapon.": "作为九层地狱中最重要的巫师，梅菲斯特在被迫自卫时经常使用魔法。但他最大的力量来自于挥舞地狱之火本身的能力。地狱之火是通过挖掘地狱的亵渎本质而产生的，它的温度高得难以想象，令人难以忍受。除非他选择压制它，否则他的身体会散发出黑暗的火焰，使任何接触他的人都会被不洁的能量烧焦。梅菲斯特还能以任何方式塑造地狱之火，使之成为他最有力的武器。",

From Neverwinter in the North to Port Nyanzaru on the Chultan peninsula, it is difficult to find a community that doesn't have at least a shrine devoted to the goddess of beauty.": "当他们成年后，这对双胞胎开始在整个王国传播苏妮的爱与美。在教会的历史上，从来没有一个苏妮的信徒像奈斯那样负责建立这么多的新寺庙。从北方的永夜城到楚丹半岛的尼安扎鲁港，很难找到一个社区没有至少一个专门供奉美神的神殿。",
	"Naes's devotion to Sune leads him to be intolerant of other faiths. He believes that Sune represents civilization's best chance to survive in a world that is filled with monsters, evil and ugliness. His sermons on the virtues of Sune can come across as condescending to those whose faiths differ. Naes is self-aware enough to recognize how he can be perceived and tones down his rhetoric when dealing with potential allies.": "奈斯对苏妮的虔诚导致他对其他信仰的不宽容。他认为苏尼代表了文明在这个充满怪物、邪恶和丑陋的世界上生存的最佳机会。他对苏尼的美德的说教，对那些信仰不同的人来说，会显得居高临下。奈斯有足够的自知之明，认识到自己会被人看穿，在与潜在的盟友打交道时，他的言辞会有所收敛。",
	"As the high priest of Sune's faith on Faerûn, Naes leaves most of the evangelizing work to his twin brother, Tiberius. However, if there is an opportunity to convert a significant number of people to Sune's faith, Naes will leave his offices in the Temple of Beauty. He relishes these few chances to return to the road. Naes falls in love easily and if he meets a man or woman that he takes a fancy to, then he will strike up a friendship with the hope of it leading to something more.": "作为法鲁恩上苏尼信仰的大祭司，奈斯将大部分的传教工作留给了他的孪生兄弟提比略。然而，如果有机会让大量的人皈依苏尼的信仰，奈斯会离开他在美神庙的办公室。他很喜欢这些为数不多的机会，回到路上。奈斯很容易坠入爱河，如果他遇到一个他看上的男人或女人，那么他就会建立起友谊，希望它能带来更多的东西。",
	"Once members of the Church of Sune reach 9th level they gain access to Naes as a contact. Naes has connections with some of the most powerful noble families, dynasties and kingdoms. Because of this he is able to arrange marriages, adoptions, titles and other such things. He requires a donation to the Church of Sune before he begins work on the arrangement. The donation is significantly less for those who worship Sune. You can only be married once and you can have noble status in one city.": "一旦苏恩教会的成员达到9级，他们就可以获得与奈斯的联系。奈斯与一些最强大的贵族家庭、王朝和王国都有联系。正因为如此，他能够安排婚姻、收养、头衔和其他此类事情。在开始安排工作之前，他需要向苏内教会捐款。对那些崇拜苏尼的人来说，捐款要少得多。你只能结婚一次，你可以在一个城市拥有贵族身份。",

	"However, unbeknown to most, Pelyious and his crew are also faithful servants of Bhaal, the God of Murder. Beneath his cultured veneer lurks a bloodthirsty monster (a lycanthropic form he learned through an ancient Mezro ritual), and he occasionally plans \"murder rituals\" where he turns his entire Halruaan skyship into a slaughterhouse. Victims in these massacres are not merely killed, but often tortured, mutilated, and eventually skinned. While most of the remains are tossed over the side of the airship when it crosses the oceans, the hearts and other vital organs of his victims are used for ritual feasts to celebrate the slaughter.": "然而，大多数人不知道的是，Pelyious和他的船员也是谋杀之神Bhaal的忠实仆人。在他有教养的外表下，潜藏着一个嗜血的怪物（他通过一个古老的Mezro仪式学会的狼人形态），他偶尔会计划 \"谋杀仪式\"，把他的整个Halruaan飞艇变成一个屠宰场。这些屠杀中的受害者不仅仅是被杀，而且常常被折磨、肢解，最后被剥皮。虽然大部分遗体在飞艇穿越海洋时被扔到了船舷上，但他的受害者的心脏和其他重要器官被用于庆祝屠杀的仪式盛宴。",
	"Pelyious prefers to reserve these ritual killing sprees for those that have insulted him, tried to cheat him, or offended his honor in some manner. However, if no suitable candidates have made themselves available, Pelyious sometimes has to settle on victims that he genuinely likes, for the Lord of Murder can only wait so long for his sacrifices. Pelyious shows no remorse when forced to slaughter those he considers friends, as his devotion to Bhaal supersedes all other loyalties.": "佩利欧斯更喜欢把这些仪式性的杀戮狂欢留给那些侮辱过他、试图欺骗他、或以某种方式冒犯他的荣誉的人。然而，如果没有合适的人选，佩里欧斯有时不得不选择他真正喜欢的受害者，因为杀人魔王对他的牺牲品只能等待这么久。当被迫屠杀那些他认为是朋友的人时，佩里欧斯毫无悔意，因为他对巴哈的奉献超越了所有其他的忠诚。",

Extremely solitary beings, they surround themselves with a retinue of mentally dominated creatures that serve as bodyguards, soldiers, and hunters. When these thralls cease to be useful, they are slaughtered and devoured by their phaerimm master. The phaerimm language is incomprehensible to humanoids, even with the use of magical assistance. However, a phaerimm can use telepathic magic to communicate with other beings through its slaves, though due to their solitary existence they seldom have need to communicate at all. The only real exception occurs on those rare occasions when several phaerimm will work together to defeat an enemy that is too strong for them to face individually.": "辉瑞姆的精神控制能力可与任何精神分裂者或看守者相媲美。他们是极其孤独的生命，周围有一群被精神控制的生物作为保镖、士兵和猎手的随从。当这些随从不再有用时，他们会被他们的辉瑞姆主人宰杀和吞噬。人类无法理解辉瑞姆的语言，即使使用了魔法辅助也是如此。然而，辉林可以使用心灵感应的魔法，通过它的奴隶与其他生物沟通，尽管由于它们的孤独存在，它们很少需要沟通。唯一真正的例外是在那些罕见的情况下，几个辉瑞姆会一起工作，打败一个强大到他们无法单独面对的敌人。",

Their population has been slow to recover from this purge, as a phaerimm is only capable of producing a single egg every century.

When the final days came, Suldil was a veteran dragon rider bonded to a beautiful bronze dragon. She was happily married and the proud mother to a son. In a single night Suldil lost everything.

Once a loyal priestess of Lolth in the great drow city of Menzoberranzan, Viconia and House DeVir first lost the Spider Queen's favor when she refused to sacrifice an infant, an act she saw as pointless. In a desperate attempt to appease Lolth, her own mother arranged for Viconia to be sacrificed herself. She was saved by her devoted brother, Valas, who freed her and slew their mother in the process. For this crime, Valas was transformed into a drider, a monstrous centaur-like creature with a drow torso grafted onto the body of an immense spider. These events contributed to the once great House DeVir's destruction at the hands of House Do'Urden nearly a century ago.": "维康尼亚-德维尔是一名被流放的鸦人牧师，为黑暗和损失女神夏尔服务。曾经是伟大的乌鸦城市Menzoberranzan的Lolth的忠实女祭司，Viconia和DeVir家族第一次失去了蜘蛛女王的青睐，因为她拒绝献祭一个婴儿，她认为这种行为毫无意义。为了安抚洛尔思，她自己的母亲安排维康尼亚自己被献祭。她被她忠诚的哥哥瓦拉斯所救，瓦拉斯释放了她，并在此过程中杀死了他们的母亲。因为这一罪行，瓦拉斯被改造成了一个半人马的怪物，一个将乌鸦的躯干移植到巨大的蜘蛛身上的怪物。这些事件导致了曾经伟大的德维尔家族在近一个世纪前毁于多乌尔登家族之手。",
	"Viconia fled Menzoberranzan and soon left the Underdark altogether to evade retribution from Lolth's minions.

	"Viconia has now lived apart from drow society for almost a century. During that time, she traveled with the Bhaalspawn Abdel Adrian, but eventually their relationship soured.

	"Viktor was born into a large family of simple farmers harvesting cabbage, beets, and potatoes. His family's farmstead sits on the northern reaches of a village called Barovia.

	"The three managed to escape Barovia with the help of the Raven Queen. They adventured together for many years, forming a strong bond of friendship.

So, she sent Viktor a gift: a gold dragon named Thraxis that would be his mount and partner. But Thraxis wasn't a normal dragon; he had been corrupted by the Shadowfell.": "在乌鸦女王的帮助下，三人成功逃离了巴罗维亚。他们一起冒险了许多年，形成了牢固的友谊纽带。乌鸦女王感到她对维克多的控制力在下降，因为他的朋友为他提供了爱和陪伴。因此，她给维克多送了一份礼物：一条名为Thraxis的金龙，将成为他的坐骑和伙伴。但Thraxis并不是一条普通的龙；他已经被Shadowfell腐蚀了。",

These hateful creatures are much more intelligent than a normal wolf and use this preternatural cunning to hunt their favorite prey: humans. Although some believe them to be the offspring of werewolves and normal wolves—and this may very well be their origin—wolfweres are their own species and their form of lycanthropy is not a transmissible curse or disease. Like werewolves, wolfweres are repelled by wolfsbane but are vulnerable to iron rather than silver weapons.": "狼人是变身者，具有大狼的自然形态，但可以随意转变为人形和双足的混合形态。这些可恨的生物比正常的狼要聪明得多，并利用这种超自然的狡猾来猎取它们最喜欢的猎物：人类。虽然有些人认为他们是狼人和普通狼的后代--这很可能是他们的起源--但狼人是他们自己的物种，他们的狼人化形式不是一种可传播的诅咒或疾病。与狼人一样，狼人也会被狼毒击退，但容易受到铁制武器而非银制武器的攻击。",
	"Although some wolfweres are solitary, others choose to stay in familial bands. However, they most often run in packs of normal wolves or worgs. Wolfweres are able to influence and command these beasts, making them much more vicious and bolder. Rarely, a wolfwere may choose to blend in with human society. Wolfweres never associate with werewolves, as the two share a mutual hatred and will attack each other unprovoked.": "虽然有些狼人是独居的，但其他狼人则选择留在家族的队伍中。然而，他们最常在正常的狼群或虫群中运行。狼人能够影响和指挥这些野兽，使它们更加凶恶和大胆。很少有狼人会选择融入人类社会。狼人从不与狼人交往，因为两者有共同的仇恨，会无缘无故地攻击对方。",
	"A wolfwere's natural form is similar in size and appearance to that of a dire wolf. In combat, they usually shift into a hybrid form, which is able to both bite and use weapons with its human-like hands. To trick stronger prey, a wolfwere dons a charismatic human shape. Unlike werewolves, wolfweres have no single humanoid form to revert to. Instead, a wolfwere can transform into any humanoid shape it desires, though they almost universally choose ones with great physical beauty. Wolfweres have the ability to sense what their particular prey would find attractive and assume a seductive disguise. Wolfweres have less control over their appearance when they involuntarily transform under a new moon, though they usually assume a shape they have taken on recently.": "狼人的自然形态在大小和外观上与地狼相似。在战斗中，他们通常会转变为混合形态，既能咬人，又能用类似人类的双手使用武器。为了欺骗更强大的猎物，狼人披上了迷人的人类外形。与狼人不同，狼人没有单一的人形可以恢复。相反，狼人可以变成任何它想要的人形，尽管他们几乎普遍选择具有巨大的身体美。狼人有能力感知他们的特定猎物会发现什么是有吸引力的，并采取诱人的伪装。当狼人在新月下不由自主地变身时，他们对自己的外表控制得较少，不过他们通常会变成他们最近所拥有的形状。",
