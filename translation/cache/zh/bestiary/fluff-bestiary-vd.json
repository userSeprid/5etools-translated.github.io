	"On countless worlds, his name evokes tales of terror and cruelty. Vecna the Undying King. Vecna the Whispered One. Vecna the Lord of the Rotted Tower. Over more than a hundred thousand years, incandescent hatred carried him from the humblest of origins to a conqueror's throne, then to the realms that lie beyond life and death, and finally to godhood. Many have suffered his terrible wrath, but few can recount how a lowly scribe left an aeon-deep scar on the multiverse before ascending beyond the material altogether. Only a few fragments of Vecna's story have ever been unearthed.": "在无数的世界里，他的名字唤起了恐怖和残忍的故事。不朽的国王Vecna。低语者Vecna。腐烂之塔的主人Vecna。在超过十万年的时间里，炽热的仇恨将他从最卑微的出身带到了征服者的宝座上，然后到了超越生死的领域，最后成为神。许多人都遭受过他可怕的愤怒，但很少有人能讲述一个卑微的文士是如何在超越物质之前在多元宇宙中留下一道深深的疤痕。维克纳的故事只有少数片段被发掘出来。",
	"It is said that Vecna was born into a lowly caste on the world of Oerth, son of a hedge witch and a father he never knew. An order of wizards exiled Vecna's mother into the wastes for practicing the forbidden art of necromancy. The order bound her orphaned son into servitude and employed him as first a bootblack, then a scribe. Vecna spent the better part of his childhood secretly educating himself in his masters' arts, stealing into their library of magical treatises each night after midnight. It was during these intense study sessions that he first heard a soothing voice in his head, a whisper from another world that promised him revenge if he would only yield to the hatred that was festering in his heart. Once Vecna learned all he could from his masters and their books, he massacred them. On that very night, the voice urged him to record his every foul thought and dream, and he started to pen his {@item Book of Vile Darkness}.": "据说Vecna出生在Oerth世界的一个低等阶层，是一个篱笆女巫和一个他从未见过的父亲的儿子。一个巫师组织将韦克纳的母亲流放到了荒野，因为她从事了被禁止的死灵术。该组织将她的孤儿捆绑在一起，让他先做擦鞋匠，然后再做抄写员。维克纳在他童年的大部分时间里都在秘密地学习他主人的艺术，每晚在午夜后偷溜进他们的魔法论文图书馆。正是在这些紧张的学习过程中，他第一次在脑海中听到了一个舒缓的声音，一个来自另一个世界的耳语，它向他承诺，只要他愿意屈服于心中的仇恨，就可以复仇。一旦韦克纳从他的主人和他们的书中学到了所有他能学到的东西，他就屠杀了他们。就在那天晚上，那个声音敦促他记录下他的每一个肮脏的想法和梦想，他开始用笔写下他的{@item Book of Vile Darkness}。",
	"According to legend, Vecna went on to forge a kingdom in the world of Greyhawk. He ruled for several centuries from an obsidian tower that rose from the bottom of the black waters of the Nyr Dyv to stretch far above its surface. During this era, at the urging of the voice, Vecna conquered vast realms and swept great cities beneath earth and rock. Generations later, when his physical form finally started to succumb to the ravages of time, Vecna's festering hatred would not permit him to perish. He called upon the forbidden arts of necromancy to transform himself into a {@creature lich}, a frightful being beyond the reach of death.": "根据传说，Vecna继续在灰鹰的世界中建立了一个王国。他在一座黑曜石塔上统治了几个世纪，这座塔从Nyr Dyv的黑水底部升起，远远超过其表面。在这个时代，在声音的催促下，Vecna征服了广阔的领域，并将伟大的城市扫进了土地和岩石之下。几代之后，当他的身体形态终于开始屈服于时间的摧残时，韦克纳溃烂的仇恨不允许他灭亡。他召唤了被禁止的死灵之术，将自己变成了一个{@creature lich}，一个超出死亡范围的可怕的生物。",
	"At some point, Vecna grew bored with his kingdom on Oerth and started visiting his evil on other worlds, still driven by the mysterious voice and his unquenchable hatred for all things true and pure. For a time, he is said to have inhabited a palace known as the Citadel of Cavitius, located in a vast field of ash somewhere near the border between the Planes of Earth and Fire.": "在某些时候，韦克纳对他在Oerth上的王国感到厌烦，并开始在其他世界探访他的邪恶，他仍然被那个神秘的声音和他对所有真实和纯洁事物的无止境的仇恨所驱动。有一段时间，据说他居住在一个被称为 \"卡维提乌斯城堡 \"的宫殿里，该宫殿位于地界和火界边界附近的一个巨大的灰烬地带。",
	"Eventually, a fallen paladin known as Kas the Bloody-Handed rose through the ranks of Vecna's vile minions to become the archlich's personal guard and regent over many of the kingdoms and cults Vecna established across the multiverse. As a symbol of Kas's authority, Vecna forged him a terrifying weapon, the blade now known as the {@item Sword of Kas}. Later, Kas turned on Vecna and used the sword to sever the archlich's hand and put out his eye. No one knows why Kas betrayed Vecna. Some believe the mysterious voice that spoke to Vecna for eons grew to fear the archlich and began whispering to Kas instead.": "最终，一个被称为 \"血手卡斯 \"的堕落圣骑士在韦克纳卑鄙的爪牙中崛起，成为大酋长的私人护卫，并成为韦克纳在多元宇宙中建立的许多王国和教派的摄政者。作为卡斯权威的象征，韦克纳为他铸造了一把可怕的武器，就是现在被称为{@item Sword of Kas}的刀。后来，卡斯背叛了韦克纳，用这把剑切断了大酋长的手，并杀死了他的眼睛。没有人知道卡斯为什么背叛Vecna。有些人认为，那个与Vecna交谈了几个世纪的神秘声音越来越害怕大酋长，并开始对卡斯耳语。",
	"After their clash, Kas and Vecna disappeared for ages. The former later emerged as the ruler of the wasteland domain of Tovag in the Shadowfell. The latter spent several centuries hopping from world to world, questing for his {@item hand of Vecna|DMG|severed hand} and {@item eye of Vecna|DMG|eye}. More recently, Vecna decamped to the Outer Planes, where he grew so powerful that he became a god. He has many ardent worshipers, all hungry for a taste of his immense power.": "在他们的冲突之后，卡斯和韦克纳消失了很久。前者后来成为了影子城中托瓦格荒地的统治者。后者花了几个世纪从一个世界跳到另一个世界，寻求他的（%0%）和（%1%）。最近，韦克纳逃到了外星，在那里他变得非常强大，以至于成为了一个神。他有许多狂热的崇拜者，都渴望尝到他巨大的力量。",
	"The accompanying stat block depicts Vecna in his archlich form prior to Kas's betrayal. Because Vecna is said to have mastered magic allowing him to travel through time, he can appear in this form even on worlds where his {@item hand of Vecna|DMG|severed hand} and {@item eye of Vecna|DMG|eye} are already known artifacts.": "附带的数据块描述了卡斯背叛前Vecna的archlich形态。因为据说Vecna已经掌握了允许他穿越时空的魔法，即使在他的{@item hand of Vecna|DMG|severed hand}和{@item eye of Vecna|DMG|eye}已经是已知神器的世界上，他也能以这种形态出现。",
	"While Vecna always carries the {@item Book of Vile Darkness} on his person—in fact, he fashioned his lich form to encompass the Book—he typically has no need to call upon its foul magic in battle. If the DM wishes to run a more challenging (and more complex) encounter, Vecna may call upon any of the book's abilities as appropriate.": "虽然Vecna总是随身携带{@item Book of Vile Darkness}--事实上，他把自己的巫师形态设计成了包含这本书的样子，但他通常不需要在战斗中调用它的邪恶魔法。如果管理员希望进行一次更具挑战性（也更复杂）的遭遇战，韦克纳可以适当地调用这本书的任何能力。"
