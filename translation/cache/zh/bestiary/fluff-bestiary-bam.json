	"An aartuk's body is shaped like a five-pointed star and is covered with thick, flexible bark. The tips of its branch-like extremities end in suction cups that allow the creature to climb on vertical surfaces and along ceilings. Each suction cup houses three retractable pseudopods that are used to manipulate small objects.": "阿尔图克的身体形状像一个五角星，覆盖着厚厚的、有弹性的树皮。它的树枝状的四肢末端有吸盘，使这种生物能够在垂直表面和天花板上攀爬。每个吸盘内有三个可伸缩的假肢，用于操纵小物体。",

	"Before laying eggs, a female lunar dragon stocks her lair with food; she won't leave the lair again until the eggs hatch and the offspring are old enough to fend for themselves. Lunar dragon eggs have stony shells that are pale white to light gray in color. Lunar dragons are alabaster white when they hatch and gradually turn darker as they age. Ancient moon dragons are the color of slate.": "在产卵之前，雌性月光龙会在巢穴中储存食物；在卵孵化之前，雌性月光龙不会再离开巢穴，而且后代已经长大到可以自食其力。月球龙的蛋有石质外壳，颜色为淡白色至浅灰色。月龙孵化时是雪花石白色的，随着年龄的增长逐渐变深。古代的月龙是石板的颜色。",
	"Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.": "月球龙喜欢剥夺其他生物的财宝，而不是自己获得财宝。在月球龙的囤积物中经常可以发现一个或多个法术干扰头盔（见{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}），这些头盔是从敢于入侵月球龙领地的船只上夺取的。",

In this semi-incorporeal state, roughly half of the dragon's body has a dark, indistinctly spectral form.": "月球龙可以变成无体的，但不能达到可以穿过其他生物或固体物体的程度。在这种半肉身状态下，龙的身体大约有一半具有黑暗的、不明显的幽灵般的形态。",
	"The cave complex where a lunar dragon makes its lair contains ample space for food, as well as one or more hidden chambers where the dragon keeps its treasure.

	"Solar dragons are fond of treasure just as all dragons are, but in the airless void of Wildspace, they value food even more. Solar dragons typically feed on kindori, scavvers, and other forms of space-dwelling wildlife. A solar dragon might mistake a distant spelljamming ship for possible prey and come within range of the vessel's weapons before realizing its error and veering away. A wise or experienced captain won't take the dragon's approach as a sign of hostility. Solar dragons that are fired upon have been known to batter the offending ships to flinders.": "太阳龙和所有的龙一样喜欢宝藏，但在没有空气的荒野空间里，它们更重视食物。太阳龙通常以kindori、scavvers和其他形式的空间居住的野生动物为食。太阳龙可能会把远处的法术干扰船误认为是可能的猎物，并在意识到自己的错误和转向之前进入该船的武器范围。一个明智的或有经验的船长不会把太阳龙的接近当作敌意的标志。据了解，被射击的太阳龙会将违规的船只打成碎片。",
	"Solar dragons are territorial carnivores, and they behave accordingly. A young solar dragon might lay claim to an asteroid belt, where food is relatively plentiful, while an ancient solar dragon might consider an entire Wildspace system its hunting ground. They tend to give a wide berth to Humanoid folk, whom they find violent and tiresome. Trespassers who are detected in a solar dragon's lair can expect to be met with resistance, followed by hostility, especially if the lair contains eggs.": "太阳龙是领土性的食肉动物，它们的行为也是如此。一条年轻的太阳龙可能会声称拥有一个小行星带，那里的食物相对丰富，而一条古老的太阳龙可能会认为整个威尔兹空间系统是它的狩猎场。它们倾向于对人形生物给予广泛的关注，因为它们认为人形生物是暴力的，令人厌烦。闯入太阳龙巢穴的人可能会遭到抵抗，然后是敌意，特别是如果巢穴里有蛋的话。",

	"Astral elves were among the first creatures to dwell in the Silver Void. As other explorers have reached for the stars, astral elves have had to reckon with violent neighbors and strange visitors. Over the eons, astral elves have clashed with numerous invaders, including psurlons, mind flayers, and githyanki. When dealing with others, astral elves customarily cover their faces with ornate visors, becoming faceless extensions of their gods. Their fierce devotion to the pantheon of elven deities is repaid with divine power. For example, the gods invest astral elf warriors with the power to channel the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, just as they empower astral elf leaders with the ability to cast spells and summon solar dragons.": "星际精灵是第一批居住在银色虚空中的生物之一。随着其他探索者向星空进发，星界精灵不得不面对暴力的邻居和陌生的访客。在过去的岁月里，星界精灵与众多的入侵者发生了冲突，包括普鲁隆人、心灵分裂者和吉特安基人。当与其他人打交道时，星界精灵习惯用华丽的面罩遮住自己的脸，成为他们的神的无脸延伸。他们对精灵神殿的虔诚是以神圣的力量来回报的。例如，诸神赋予星际精灵战士通过他们的武器引导星光辐射能量的力量，就像他们赋予星际精灵领袖施法和召唤太阳龙的能力一样。",
	"Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.": "星际精灵乘坐他们自己设计的飞船在星际海和威尔兹空间航行。这些船是由从威尔兹空间系统收获的水晶制成的，并与一种有机的、基于植物的材料结合在一起，像陶瓷一样硬化。精灵们将这些物质雕刻成各种配置，以创造出星蛾（见{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}）和其他船只。精灵们还重塑在银色虚空中发现的死去的神灵的石化尸体，将它们变成漂浮的城市和城堡。",
	"Although the Silver Void is their home, astral elves often venture into Wildspace systems and place their ships and citadels in orbit around stars. Astral elves do this for several reasons. Proximity to a star allows the astral elves to forge pacts with solar dragons and to collect starlight, which the elves use to grow crystals and repair their ships. Most important, astral elves use their time outside the Deep Astral to replenish their numbers by having and raising children.": "虽然银色虚空是他们的家，但星际精灵经常冒险进入威尔兹空间系统，并将他们的飞船和城堡置于恒星的轨道上。星际精灵这样做有几个原因。靠近恒星可以让星界精灵与太阳龙缔结契约，并收集星光，精灵们用星光来种植水晶和修理他们的飞船。最重要的是，星界精灵利用他们在深空之外的时间，通过生育和抚养孩子来补充他们的数量。",
	"Many astral elves are thousands (in some cases tens of thousands) of years old. Whatever their disposition, their longevity gives astral elves a perspective on time that few other kinds of creatures can appreciate. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the far reaches of the multiverse, astral elves tend to see events happening elsewhere as having little or no meaning to them.": "许多星际精灵都有几千年（有些情况下是几万年）的历史。无论他们的性情如何，他们的长寿给了星界精灵一种其他种类的生物所不能欣赏的时间视角。无论他们是选择生活在安静的沉思中，还是出去探索遥远的多元宇宙，星界精灵都倾向于认为其他地方发生的事件对他们没有什么意义。",

A commander channels the radiant energy of starlight through their weapons, and they can rescue warriors from a perilous situation by using their gods-given power of teleportation.": "一个星际精灵指挥官带领战士们投入战斗，通常在他们的指挥下有一艘或多艘法术干扰船。指挥官通过他们的武器引导星光的辐射能量，他们可以通过使用神赐的传送能力将战士们从危险的境地中解救出来。",

It's common for them to serve aboard spelljamming ships, not only as emissaries of the gods but also as spelljammers.": "星际祭司从精灵万神殿中汲取力量，监督星际精灵社会的宗教活动。他们在咒语干扰船上服务是很常见的，不仅是作为神的使者，也是作为咒语干扰者。",

	"An autognome is a mechanical gnome that resembles the rock gnome who created it, though it could never be mistaken for a gnome. Regardless of what its insides are made of, it has a metallic outer casing painted with gnomish features. It walks with a stiff gait, clanking, wheezing, whirring, and buzzing wherever it goes.": "自动识别器是一种机械地精，类似于创造它的岩石地精，尽管它永远不会被误认为是地精。不管它的内部是由什么构成的，它有一个金属外壳，上面画着地精的特征。它走起路来步态僵硬，所到之处叮叮当当，喘着粗气，呼呼作响，嗡嗡作响。",

	"No two autognomes are necessarily made of the same materials; magic is what gives them their intelligence. Most autognomes are programmed to obey the following three directives: defend gnomes who are being attacked by non-gnomes, defend yourself if you are attacked, and protect infants and youngsters from harm. The last directive arose from the best intentions, but it doesn't distinguish between species; if an autognome sees a group of adults battling a lunar dragon wyrmling, for instance, it would come to the wyrmling's defense.": "没有两个自动识别器一定是由相同的材料制成的；魔法是赋予它们智能的原因。大多数自动认知体都被编程为服从以下三个指令：保护被非自动认知体攻击的地精，如果你被攻击了，就保护自己，以及保护婴儿和青少年不受伤害。最后一个指令产生于最好的意图，但它并不区分物种；例如，如果一个自动认知体看到一群成年人在与月球龙的wyrmling战斗，它就会为wyrmling辩护。",
	"B'rohgs are broad-shouldered, four-armed Giants, 15 feet tall, with burnt-orange skin. They have flat noses, pointed ears, and long hair that grows down the backs and sides of their otherwise bald heads. They wear simple garb and like to hurl heavy rocks. A b'rohg can wield a weapon with each of its four arms, but it prefers to pound enemies with its fists and rip smaller creatures apart with its bare hands.": "B'rohgs是宽肩、四臂的巨人，身高15英尺，皮肤呈焦橙色。他们有扁平的鼻子，尖尖的耳朵，长长的头发顺着他们的秃头的背面和侧面生长。他们穿着简单的服装，喜欢投掷重石。巴罗格人的四只手臂都能挥舞武器，但它更喜欢用拳头击打敌人，用手撕碎小动物。",
	"B'rohgs communicate with one another using grunts and basic hand signals; they have no spoken or written language. They prefer to be left alone and for that reason don't normally pose a threat to smaller creatures. Because of their size and strength, they are popular attractions in gladiatorial arenas, where they are coerced into fighting for food.": "B'rohgs使用咕哝声和基本的手势相互交流；它们没有口头或书面语言。它们喜欢独处，因此通常不会对小型生物构成威胁。由于它们的体型和力量，它们是角斗场的热门景点，在那里它们被强迫为食物而战斗。",
	"B'rohgs are accustomed to eking out a meager existence in their natural habitat, and they rarely bond with other kinds of creatures. A b'rohg that benefits from a stranger's act of kindness is at first puzzled by the effort, then wary. If this kindness is sufficient to earn the creature's trust, the b'rohg will try to repay the stranger, perhaps by carrying their gear or helping them navigate perilous terrain. A solitary b'rohg that is befriended by a group of adventurers might follow them around for a while, but it will soon tire of their company and once again seek out others of its own kind.": "B'rohgs习惯于在其自然栖息地勉强生存，它们很少与其他种类的生物结合。从陌生人的善意行为中受益的B'rohg起初会对这种努力感到困惑，然后是警惕。如果这种善意足以赢得生物的信任，b'rohg会试图回报陌生人，也许是为他们携带装备或帮助他们穿越危险的地形。一个被一群冒险者结识的孤独的b'rohg可能会跟随他们一段时间，但它很快就会厌倦他们的陪伴，再次寻找其他同类。",
	"A braxat is a towering, warm-blooded carnivore with a thick, articulated shell covering its back, a squarish head topped with horny protrusions, and thick arms ending in large hands with opposable thumbs.

	"Braxats hunt alone or in pairs, prowling deserts, dry canyons, desolate wastelands, and lonely asteroids in search of prey. Braxats also spew acid, though they tend to do so only as a last resort, since the acid dissolves and ruins the flesh they crave.": "Braxats单独或成对捕猎，在沙漠、干燥的峡谷、荒凉的荒地和孤独的小行星上徘徊，寻找猎物。布拉萨特也会喷出酸液，但他们往往只在最后才这样做，因为酸液会溶解并破坏他们渴望的肉体。",

	"Cosmic horrors are colossal, malevolent entities that occasionally slip the bonds of the Far Realm and find themselves adrift on the Astral Plane. Drawn to the light of distant stars, these creatures invade Wildspace systems and lay waste to worlds.

	"Dohwars are short, pudgy, flightless avians that look and move like penguins. They are inveterate merchants, always looking for an opportunity to turn a profit. Dohwars conduct their dealings in secrecy, preferring to do business in dark alleys and out-of-the-way places even when the items being bought or sold aren't illegal or dangerous. They tend to dress in a garish mishmash of clothing, but many of them also shroud themselves in hooded cloaks. A group of dohwars is called a cartel.": "Dohwars是矮胖的、不会飞的鸟类，看起来和行动都像企鹅。他们是不折不扣的商人，总是在寻找机会来赚取利润。Dohwars的交易是秘密进行的，他们喜欢在黑暗的小巷和偏僻的地方做生意，即使买卖的物品不违法或不危险。他们倾向于穿着花花绿绿的混搭衣服，但他们中的许多人也用连帽斗篷遮住自己。一群多瓦人被称为一个卡特尔。",

In the wake of these encounters, love and fear of clowns has spread to all corners of the multiverse, just as the space clowns have done themselves.": "太空小丑从多瓦商人那里获得了他们的第一个法术干扰头盔（见《多瓦》）。随后对其他Wildspace系统的访问导致了他们与众多其他民俗的接触。在这些接触之后，对小丑的爱和恐惧已经传播到多元宇宙的各个角落，就像太空小丑自己所做的那样。",
	"Marauding space clowns feed on Humanoid flesh. They travel through space in garishly decorated ships and sometimes take up residence on populated worlds, where they set up carnival tents to lure curious onlookers into their clutches. They are armed with colorfully painted ray guns that work only for them; these toys are harmless in the hands of anyone else.": "掠夺性的太空小丑以类人肉为食。他们乘坐装饰华丽的飞船在太空中旅行，有时在有人居住的世界上居住，他们在那里搭起狂欢帐篷，引诱好奇的围观者进入他们的魔掌。他们的武器是色彩斑斓的射线枪，只对他们有效；这些玩具在其他人手中是无害的。",
	"Space eels avoid confrontations with larger creatures unless the eels are starving. These 5-foot-long scavengers might trail a spelljamming ship and feed on barnacles they detach from the ship's hull. Wildspace hunters try to catch and kill the eels for their meat—a task easier to describe than to accomplish.": "太空鳗鱼避免与大型生物发生对抗，除非鳗鱼饿坏了。这些5英尺长的食腐动物可能会跟踪一艘法术干扰船，以它们从船体上分离的藤壶为食。野生空间的猎人试图捕捉并杀死鳗鱼以获取它们的肉--这是一项容易描述而无法完成的任务。",

The magic also made the space hamsters smarter and telepathic.": "第一批太空仓鼠是由巫师创造的，他们用魔法将巨大的太空仓鼠缩小到最小的尺寸，导致他们的创造者将其称为微型巨型太空仓鼠。这种魔法还使太空仓鼠变得更加聪明，并具有心灵感应。",
	"These benign rodents are native to Wildspace, though countless numbers of them have found their way to worlds throughout the Material Plane, where they are known simply as hamsters. They keep their telepathic ability hidden from most other creatures they come near.": "这些良性的啮齿动物原产于威尔兹空间，尽管它们的数量不计其数，已经在整个物质世界找到了自己的方式，在那里它们被简单地称为仓鼠。它们将自己的心灵感应能力隐藏起来，不让其他生物靠近。",
	"Space mollymawks are as common in Wildspace as albatrosses are on the Material Plane. They perch on the hulls of spelljamming ships and move from one ship's air envelope to another's when they need to.": "空间莫利玛克在威尔兹空间就像信天翁在物质界一样常见。它们栖息在法术干扰船的船体上，并在需要时从一艘船的空气包络层移到另一艘船上。",
	"A fully grown specimen is 3 feet tall with a 10-foot wingspan, and it eats whatever it can scavenge. If it finds a reliable food source, it lingers in the area (usually around a ship) until the food becomes scarce. Superstitious Wildspace voyagers consider it bad luck to kill a space mollymawk.": "一个完全长大的标本有3英尺高，10英尺的翼展，它吃任何它能搜刮到的东西。如果它找到了可靠的食物来源，它就会在这个地区（通常是在飞船周围）逗留，直到食物变得稀少。迷信的Wildspace航行者认为，杀死一只太空莫利马沃克会带来厄运。",
	"Space swine are a species of winged boar bred by dohwars for a variety of uses. They can serve as mounts for Small creatures, and they also make fine trackers and capable beasts of burden.

	"A starlight apparition is different from a ghost. While a ghost is doomed to haunt the place where it died until some promise or goal it couldn't achieve in life is fulfilled, the goal of a starlight apparition is to help someone else avoid or overcome a perilous obstacle or accomplish a difficult task. A starlight apparition comes into being when the soul of a deceased individual, from its resting place in the afterlife, projects a spectral copy of itself across a vast distance with the help of a deity or another powerful celestial entity. The apparition lasts only as long as its services are needed to complete the task at hand; then it fades away, never to return.": "星光幻影与鬼魂不同。鬼魂注定要在它死去的地方出没，直到它生前无法实现的某些承诺或目标得到实现，而星光幻影的目标是帮助别人避免或克服危险的障碍或完成一项困难的任务。当一个死者的灵魂从来世的安息之地，在神灵或其他强大的天体的帮助下，将自己的幽灵副本投射到很远的地方时，星光幻影就出现了。幽灵只在需要它的服务来完成手头的任务时才会持续；然后它就会消逝，再也不会回来。",

They ply the void in their ships, plundering unsuspecting vessels and feeding on the life energy of those unlucky enough to cross their path.": "吸血鬼是那些拒绝安静地进入来世的死去的海盗的行走、说话的躯壳。他们驾驶着船只在虚空中游荡，掠夺毫无戒心的船只，并以那些不幸遇到他们的人的生命能量为食。",
	"A vampirate appears as a gaunt figure with milky-white eyes and skin as dry as parchment. Some have a peg leg or a hook in place of a hand—mementos of a life of misadventure. A vampirate has fangs like a vampire's but doesn't use them to draw vital fluids from prey, which vampirates consider an unsavory act. Rather, a vampirate drains life energy from another creature by touching it or by siphoning off its energy from a short distance away. As it feeds on the energy of other creatures, its appearance becomes more robust, although it never truly looks alive.": "吸血鬼以憔悴的形象出现，拥有乳白色的眼睛，皮肤像羊皮纸一样干燥。有些人有一条钉子腿或一个钩子来代替手，这是不幸生活的纪念品。吸血鬼有像吸血鬼一样的獠牙，但不会用它们来吸取猎物的生命体液，吸血鬼认为这是不光彩的行为。相反，吸血鬼通过接触另一个生物或从不远处抽走它的能量来吸取生命能量。当它以其他生物的能量为食时，它的外表会变得更加强壮，尽管它从未真正看起来像活人。",
	"Vampirates eat, drink, and sleep because they like to, not because they must. They rest in wooden coffins or crates full of grave dirt. In the absence of such containers, they can treat their ship's hold as one big coffin and sleep amid their cargo. When they're not sleeping or marauding, a crew of vampirates whiles away the hours by drinking rum and singing grim chanteys.": "吸血鬼吃、喝、睡是因为他们喜欢，而不是因为他们必须。他们在木制棺材或装满墓土的箱子里休息。在没有这种容器的情况下，他们可以把船舱当作一个大棺材，在货物中睡觉。当他们不睡觉或掠夺的时候，一群吸血鬼船员通过喝朗姆酒和唱悲伤的歌谣来打发时间。",
	"A ship crewed by vampirates usually has one or more shadows aboard—the Undead remains of some of the vampirates' victims.": "一艘由吸血鬼组成的船通常有一个或多个影子--一些吸血鬼受害者的不死之身。",
	"How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.": "海盗船员的行为方式完全取决于船长的心情和性情。一艘船的船员可能表现得像一个杀人的暴徒，而另一艘船则可能遵守古老的骑士精神法则。一位船长可能允许被掠夺的船只上的船员活着，而另一位船长则可能在海盗们的身后只留下残骸和碎片。",

	"A ship of vampirates needs a spellcaster to operate the spelljamming helm. A vampirate mage rarely, if ever, leaves the helm.": "吸血鬼的船需要一个施法者来操作法术干扰头盔。吸血鬼法师很少，如果有的话，会离开头盔。",
	"Void scavvers are 20 feet long. Each one is a solitary menace with a pitch-black hide. While most other scavvers are content to feed on kitchen scraps, a void scavver goes after the cook.": "虚空食腐动物有20英尺长。每个人都是一个单独的威胁，有着黑黝黝的皮。当大多数其他食腐动物满足于吃厨房里的残羹剩饭时，虚空食腐动物会去找厨师。",
	"A void scavver can emit an invisible ray from its eye that causes its target to feel fear even more intense than what it might normally experience given the creature's size and nature.": "虚空清道夫可以从它的眼睛中发射出一种无形的射线，使其目标感受到恐惧，甚至比它通常可能经历的恐惧更强烈，因为该生物的大小和性质。",
	"A zodar is a bipedal entity whose body is encased in an obsidian exoskeleton. It has no facial features aside from two narrow, vertical slits that resemble eyes, and its countenance betrays no hint of pain or emotion. Underneath its armored exterior, a zodar's body is composed of tightly knit muscle fibers that make it incredibly strong and heavy. A zodar weighs 1,500 pounds.": "佐达尔是一个双足实体，其身体被黑曜石外骨骼所包裹。除了两个类似于眼睛的狭窄的垂直缝隙外，它没有任何面部特征，而且它的面孔没有透露出一丝痛苦或情绪。在其装甲的外表下，佐达尔的身体是由紧密的肌肉纤维组成的，这使得它具有难以置信的强度和重量。一只佐达尔重达1,500磅。",
	"No one knows how many zodars exist or where they came from, but the most popular hypothesis is that they are the creations of some long-forgotten god. Zodars interact with other sapient creatures in a manner that goes beyond mere aloofness. They simply hover in silence. When a zodar finally performs some significant action, the reasons for that action aren't always clear.": "没有人知道有多少Zodars存在，也没有人知道他们来自哪里，但最流行的假设是，他们是某个早已被遗忘的神的创造物。佐达斯与其他有智慧的生物互动的方式，超越了单纯的冷漠。他们只是在沉默中徘徊。当佐达尔人最终采取一些重要的行动时，行动的原因并不总是很清楚。",
	"One interpretation of this behavior posits that each zodar has a specific mission and is relentless in its pursuit of the goal, but it reacts oddly to situations that don't involve its mission because it doesn't know what else to do. Another theory is that all zodars are working in concert to achieve some master objective. A third, less ominous idea is that zodars lost their sense of purpose when their creator vanished, and they are struggling to find their new role.": "对这种行为的一种解释是，每个zodar都有一个特定的任务，并坚持不懈地追求目标，但它对不涉及其任务的情况会有奇怪的反应，因为它不知道还能做什么。另一个理论是，所有的佐达斯都在为实现某个主目标而协同工作。第三种不那么不祥的想法是，当它们的创造者消失后，zodars失去了它们的目标感，它们正在努力寻找它们的新角色。",
	"A zodar can cause speech to issue from the air around it on three occasions in its lifetime. When it feels compelled to speak, it chooses its words wisely. It can also warp the fabric of the multiverse to cast the wish spell as its final act—it is destroyed once the spell is cast.": "一个Zodar在它的一生中可以有三次机会使它周围的空气中发出声音。当它感到被迫说话时，它要明智地选择它的话语。它还可以扭曲多元宇宙的结构来施放愿望咒语，作为它的最后行为--一旦施放了咒语就会被摧毁。",
	"Lunar dragons enjoy depriving other creatures of treasure more than acquiring the treasure themselves. Often found among the treasures in a lunar dragon's hoard are one or more spelljamming helms (see the {@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}) taken from vessels that dared to invade the dragon's territory.": "月光龙喜欢剥夺其他生物的财宝，而不是自己获得财宝。在月龙囤积的宝物中，通常会发现一个或多个法术干扰头盔（见{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}），这些头盔是从敢于入侵月龙领地的船只上取下来的。",
	"Astral elves ply the Astral Sea and Wildspace in ships of their own design. These ships are fashioned from crystals harvested from Wildspace systems and bound together with an organic, plant-based material that hardens like ceramic. The elves sculpt these substances in various configurations to create star moths (see the {@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}) and other vessels. The elves also reshape the petrified bodies of dead gods found adrift in the Silver Void, transforming them into floating cities and citadels.": "星际精灵乘坐他们自己设计的飞船在星际海和威尔兹空间航行。这些船是由从威尔兹空间系统收获的水晶制成的，并与一种有机的、基于植物的材料结合在一起，像陶瓷一样硬化。精灵们将这些物质雕刻成不同的配置，创造出星蛾（见（%0%））和其他船只。精灵们还重塑在银色虚空中发现的死去的神的石化尸体，把它们变成漂浮的城市和城堡。",
	"Chwingas that live in Wildspace usually dwell on habitable moons and asteroids, though they occasionally stow away on spelljamming ships or ride around on space guppies. Using its Magical Gift ability, a chwinga astronaut can bestow one of the following charms in place of those described in the {@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Other Rewards}.": "生活在荒野空间的温加人通常居住在可居住的卫星和小行星上，尽管他们偶尔也会偷渡到法术干扰船或乘坐太空船。使用它的魔法天赋能力，一个chwinga宇航员可以赋予以下一种符咒，以代替{@book chapter 7|DMG|7|Other Rewards}中描述的符咒。",
	"Neogi pirates are adult neogi that serve as crew members aboard nightspiders (see the {@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}) and other neogi-controlled vessels.": "Neogi海盗是成年的Neogi，他们在夜行者（见{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}）和其他Neogi控制的船只上担任船员。",
	"A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the {@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities—known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar—resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.": "虚空猎手比一般的成年Neogi要大，而且经常担任夜行者（见{@i Astral Adventurer's Guide}）上的队长。虚空猎手向一个或多个恒星实体宣誓效忠，以换取他们巨大的力量。这些实体被称为 \"阿卡玛\"、\"凯蓬\"、\"吉贝斯 \"和 \"哈达\"，它们类似于恒星，体现了邪恶的本质。",
	"Dohwars are short, pudgy, flightless avians that look and move like penguins. Dohwars migrate from the Feywild to Wildspace, where they are typically encountered. They conduct their affairs in secrecy, preferring to meet in dark alleys and out-of-the-way places even when their business isn't illegal or dangerous. They tend to dress in a garish mishmash of clothing, but many of them also shroud themselves in hooded cloaks.": "Dohwars是一种矮小、胖乎乎、不会飞的鸟类，看起来和行动都像企鹅。Dohwars从Feywild迁移到Wildspace，在那里他们通常会被遇到。他们隐秘地处理自己的事务，即使他们的业务不违法或不危险，也喜欢在黑暗的小巷和偏僻的地方见面。他们倾向于穿着花花绿绿的混搭衣服，但他们中的许多人也会用连帽斗篷遮住自己。",
	"The average dohwar stands 3 feet tall and has bright plumage matching a particular color in the rainbow spectrum. This color can change at unpredictable times in the dohwar's life, often in response to the dohwar experiencing an overwhelming emotion. Instead of wings, it has arms and tiny hands.": "普通的杜瓦人身高3英尺，拥有明亮的羽翼，与彩虹光谱中的一种特定颜色相匹配。这种颜色可以在dohwar生命中不可预测的时候发生变化，通常是在dohwar经历了一种压倒性的情绪之后。它没有翅膀，而是有手臂和小手。",

Standing 12 feet tall, they are lanky blue beings who dress in elegant robes and have elongated heads and long, spindly fingers.": "麦卡尼斯是一个或多个神灵的神秘、神奇的创造物，他们的作品围绕着公平的商业。他们身高12英尺，是瘦长的蓝色生物，穿着优雅的长袍，有修长的头和长长的、多骨的手指。",
	"Mercanes conduct most of their business in Wildspace and the Astral Sea. To a mercane, commerce can take many forms, from the trading of goods and services to the trading of ideas and information. Mercanes are best known, however, for procuring and selling magic items, including artifacts and spelljamming helms. It's rare to see more than one mercane at a time, though it's common for a mercane to be accompanied by underlings or bodyguards.": "雇佣兵的大部分业务都是在荒野空间和星海中进行的。对于一个雇佣兵来说，商业可以有多种形式，从商品和服务的交易到思想和信息的交易。然而，佣兵们最出名的是采购和销售魔法物品，包括神器和法术干扰头盔。很少有机会看到一个以上的佣兵，不过佣兵身边有下属或保镖的情况很常见。",
	"Reigar were once cephalopods similar to octopi. They inhabited the stormy seas of Ysgard until the gods of that plane transformed them. Reigar have bioluminescent freckles and the ability to change the coloration of their skin. A glory (or halo) surrounds each of them. This magical display is a cloud of twinkling, glittering motes that changes color randomly and repels attacks.": "雷加尔曾经是类似于章鱼的头足类动物。它们栖息在Ysgard的惊涛骇浪中，直到该星球的诸神将它们改造。雷加尔有生物发光的雀斑，并有能力改变其皮肤的颜色。他们每个人的周围都有一个荣耀（或光环）。这种神奇的显示是一团闪烁的、闪光的斑点，随机改变颜色并击退攻击。",
	"Gifted with audacious hearts, reigar emerged from the Ysgardian seas to test their mettle on land. When the endless battles there grew tiresome, some reigar ventured to the Astral Sea and Wildspace in search of glory. Many are driven by artistic pursuits, but each reigar has their own notion of what constitutes art. For some, warfare is the highest form of artistic endeavor. Other reigar create art of a more benign nature.": "雷加尔人被赋予了大胆的心，他们从伊斯加德的海洋中走出来，在陆地上测试他们的能力。当那里无休止的战斗变得令人厌烦时，一些雷加尔人冒险到星海和荒野空间寻找荣耀。许多人受艺术追求的驱使，但每个雷加尔人对什么是艺术都有自己的概念。对一些人来说，战争是艺术努力的最高形式。其他雷加尔人则创造出更多的良性性质的艺术。"
