	"Aerisi Kalinoth is the air prophet of the Elder Elemental Eye and leader of the Cult of the Howling Hatred. Tall and slender, with dark hair and (illusory) feathered wings that gently fan the air, Aerisi Kalinoth speaks to her people in a whisper that belies her violent temper, which reveals itself whenever she is denied.": "艾瑞西-卡里诺斯是长老元素之眼的空气预言家，也是嚎叫之恨教的领袖。艾瑞西-卡里诺斯身材高大修长，拥有一头黑发和（虚幻的）羽翼，可以轻轻地扇动空气，她用低语对她的族人说话，这掩盖了她暴躁的脾气，每当她被拒绝时就会暴露出来。",
	"Aerisi was a sheltered moon elf princess named Dara Algwynenn Kalinoth who grew up in a remote Faerie realm. Her parents had wished to protect her from the harsh realities of the world, but they only succeeded in spoiling her. When they tried to discipline their wilful daughter, she used the power of elemental air against them. Soon after, her dreams led her to the ancient dwarven ruins where the spear Windvane awaited her.": "爱丽斯是一位受庇护的月精灵公主，名叫达拉-阿尔格温恩-卡里诺斯，在一个偏远的精灵王国长大。她的父母希望保护她远离这个世界的严酷现实，但他们只成功地宠坏了她。当他们试图管教他们任性的女儿时，她用空气元素的力量对付他们。不久之后，她的梦将她带到了古老的矮人遗迹，那里有长矛风神在等着她。",
	"Dara changed her name to Aerisi and pretended to be an avariel (winged elf) princess like the ones from her storybooks. Then Aerisi used her talents for enchantment magic to sway mortals into joining her cult. She has convinced all her followers that she is in fact an avariel, and believes it herself even though she must cast {@spell seeming} each day to \"reveal\" her wings.": "达拉将自己的名字改为艾里西，并假装是一个像她故事书中的阿瓦里尔（有翅膀的精灵）公主。然后，艾里西利用她的魔法天赋，动摇凡人加入她的邪教。她让她所有的追随者相信她实际上是一个阿瓦里尔，而且她自己也相信这一点，尽管她每天必须施展（%0%）来 \"揭示 \"她的翅膀。",
	"Aerisi is prone to deluded flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She sees herself as a beautiful, fierce, and just ruler who wields elemental power because she deserves it.": "爱丽斯很容易出现妄想的飞行和冲动的颓废。她认为自己是一个美丽、凶猛、公正的统治者，因为她值得拥有，所以才会挥舞元素的力量。",

	"As a practitioner of the arcane arts who learned much of his fire magic from Vanifer herself, Bastian relies on his spells in a fight, and he is a \"quick-burning\" sort who tries to deliver maximum impact early in the fight. If he knows a fight is coming but can't preemptively strike, Bastian becomes more cautious, casting wall of fire to protect himself before he hurls magic into the fray.": "作为一个从瓦尼法那里学到很多火系魔法的奥术修行者，巴斯蒂安在战斗中依赖他的法术，他是一个 \"快速燃烧 \"的人，试图在战斗的早期提供最大的影响。如果他知道战斗即将来临，但又不能先发制人，巴斯蒂安就会变得更加谨慎，在他向战场投掷魔法之前施放火墙来保护自己。",
	"Black Earth guards are the warriors of the earth cult. They are brutal, heavily armored thugs devoted to Ogrémoch. That devotion has granted them an uncanny ability to hold their ground against the buffeting assaults. It has also earned them the right to wear special plate armor of elemental stone, which breaks down when the guard is slain.": "黑土卫士是大地邪教的战士。他们是残暴的、全副武装的暴徒，献身于奥格雷莫赫。这种献身精神赋予了他们一种不可思议的能力，使他们能够坚守阵地，抵御猛烈的攻击。这也为他们赢得了穿戴特殊的元素石板甲的权利，当卫兵被杀时，板甲会被分解。",
	"These guards are fanatically loyal to the Black Earth priests and the leaders of the cult. They fight to the death if commanded to do so by their superiors. Those with more potential become burrowsharks.": "这些卫兵狂热地忠于黑土牧师和邪教领袖。如果上级命令他们这样做，他们就会战斗到死。那些有更多潜力的人成为洞穴鲨。",
	"The priests of the Black Earth are the drivers and organizers of Ogrémoch's cult. They are the true believers, seeing Ogrémoch as a divine force, and they have developed a twisted dogma to explain how the evil of elemental earth is destined to remake the world and rule over all. The Black Earth priests form a cabal of leaders whose fanaticism and magical power serve as the backbone of the cult. Individuals of unusual power hold higher rank in the cult, but the priests provide the cult leader with his or her authority over the rest of Ogrémoch's followers.": "黑土的祭司是奥格雷莫赫邪教的推动者和组织者。他们是真正的信徒，将奥格雷莫克视为神圣的力量，他们制定了一个扭曲的教条，解释地球元素的邪恶是如何注定要重塑世界并统治一切。黑土祭司形成了一个由领袖组成的阴谋集团，他们的狂热和魔法力量成为邪教的支柱。权力不凡的人在邪教中拥有更高的地位，但祭司们为邪教领袖提供了他或她对奥格雷莫赫其他追随者的权威。",

While their powerful mounts rend and tear foes to pieces, burrowsharks leap to the ground and cut down their foes without mercy.": "洞穴鲨是大地崇拜的精英战士，他们是骑着训练有素的骡子上战场的凶猛冠军。当他们强大的坐骑将敌人撕成碎片时，钻地鲨则跳到地上，毫不留情地砍杀他们的敌人。",
	"Burrowsharks are much like Black Earth guards, since both have uncanny footing and special armor. For burrowsharks, an additional gift of Ogrémoch's might establishes a magical bond between the burrowshark and a bulette, allowing the rider to burrow with its mount and sense what its mount senses.": "穴居鲨很像黑土卫士，因为两者都有不可思议的脚力和特殊的盔甲。对于洞穴鲨来说，奥格瑞莫赫的力量的额外馈赠可以在洞穴鲨和布列特之间建立一种神奇的联系，允许骑手与它的坐骑一起钻地，并感知它的坐骑所感知的东西。",
	"Crushing Wave priests are the fanatical core of the cult. Gathering in secretive cabals, they perform dark rituals to glorify Olhydra as the embodiment of water's destructiveness. They believe that using water to kill their enemies, such as through ritual drowning, earns them Olhydra's favor.": "碎浪派的祭司是邪教的狂热核心。他们聚集在秘密的小团体中，举行黑暗的仪式，颂扬奥海德拉是水的破坏性的化身。他们相信利用水来杀死他们的敌人，比如通过溺水仪式，可以获得奥海德拉的青睐。",
	"The foot soldiers of the Crushing Wave cult are vicious sea reavers. Many of them were pirates before they fell in with the cult, and they remain eager for blood and plunder. Crushing Wave reavers appreciate the value of stealth and surprise, and look for chances to launch sudden attacks from positions of concealment whenever possible. The soldiers of the Crushing Wave cult are highly loyal to the cult priests, but they rarely fight to the death if an avenue of retreat is open to them.": "碎浪神教的步兵是邪恶的海上掠夺者。他们中的许多人在加入邪教之前是海盗，他们仍然渴望着鲜血和掠夺。碎浪神教的人很欣赏隐蔽和出其不意的价值，并尽可能寻找机会从隐蔽的位置发动突然袭击。碎浪神教的士兵对神教的牧师高度忠诚，但如果有退路的话，他们很少会拼死抵抗。",

	"Dark Tide knights are the elite warriors of the Crushing Wave cult. By drawing upon Olhydra's dark power, they gain the ability to ride sea-creatures that normally wouldn't be suitable as mounts, and can even breathe underwater and share their mount's senses. The knights prefer to fight from or in the water, since they don't like to leave their mounts behind, but they can be fierce opponents on foot at need.": "暗潮骑士是碎浪教派的精英战士。通过汲取奥海德拉的黑暗力量，他们获得了骑乘通常不适合作为坐骑的海洋生物的能力，甚至可以在水下呼吸并分享他们坐骑的感官。骑士们更喜欢在水中作战，因为他们不喜欢离开他们的坐骑，但在必要时，他们也可以成为徒步的激烈对手。",
	"Unlike most other knights, Dark Tide knights disdain heavy armor, relying on the speed and ferocity of their attacks to carry them to victory.": "与其他大多数骑士不同，暗潮骑士不屑于穿重甲，而是依靠他们的攻击速度和凶猛程度来取得胜利。",
	"Drannin is a self-serving dwarf who has always felt that, due to his heritage, he was owed better than he received. When he didn't receive the accolades, he began to see everyone in his way as the problem, trying to keep him down, and he vowed to do whatever it took to turn the tables. He is currently intent on claiming the legendary axe Orcsplitter, the weapon buried with King Torhild Flametongue of Besilmer many centuries ago. The secret doors and puzzles of the Halls of the Hunting Axe have frustrated Drannin for a long time, but he now has a plan to dupe his cousin Gargosh into finding the axe for him (see the \"Halls of the Hunting Axe\" side trek in chapter 6). Drannin believes that with Orcsplitter in his possession he can establish himself as a powerful lord among his clan, and finally win the respect he thinks he deserves.": "德兰宁是一个自以为是的矮人，他一直觉得，由于他的遗产，他应该得到的比他得到的更好。当他没有得到赞誉的时候，他开始把挡在他面前的每个人都看成是问题，试图把他压下去，他发誓要不惜一切代价扭转局面。他目前一心想要得到传说中的斧头Orcsplitter，这把武器在许多世纪前与贝西尔默的托希尔德-弗拉梅通格国王一起埋葬。猎斧大厅的暗门和谜题让德兰宁沮丧了很久，但他现在有了一个计划，欺骗他的表弟加戈什为他找到那把斧头（见第6章中的 \"猎斧大厅 \"侧面的跋涉）。德兰宁相信，有了兽人分身，他就能在部族中建立起自己强大的领主地位，并最终赢得他认为自己应得的尊重。",
	"Drannin's most prized possession is his shield guardian. He stole the amulet that controls the shield guardian from a sorcerer some years back.": "德兰尼恩最珍贵的财产是他的护盾。几年前他从一个巫师那里偷了控制盾牌守护者的护身符。",

	"Eternal Flame guardians are dullards fascinated by the power of fire and eager to show the cult's enemies firsthand what it feels like to burn. They light things aflame to honor elemental fire and just for entertainment, but they don't always think ahead about what else nearby might catch fire.": "永恒之火的守护者是被火的力量所吸引的呆子，渴望向邪教的敌人展示燃烧的第一手感觉。他们点燃东西以纪念火元素，也只是为了娱乐，但他们并不总是提前考虑到附近还有什么东西可能会着火。",
	"Eternal Flame priests see the world around them as impure and unworthy, and believe that only cleansing by fire can set it right. As a result, all fire is deemed holy, from the smallest candle flame to the greatest conflagrations. When traveling in the open, Eternal Flame priests are clever enough to hide their true beliefs, passing themselves off as druids or wizards with a knack for fire magic.": "永恒之火祭司认为他们周围的世界是不纯洁和不值得的，并相信只有通过火的清洗才能将其纠正。因此，所有的火都被视为神圣的，从最小的烛火到最大的火焰。在公开场合旅行时，永恒之火的牧师很聪明，可以隐藏他们的真实信仰，把自己伪装成德鲁伊或精通火魔法的巫师。",
	"Fathomers are cultists who have sealed a pact with Olhydra, Princess of Evil Water. In addition to their spellcasting abilities, fathomers have the ability to transform their bodies into water, taking serpent-like shapes. In their water serpent forms, fathomers gain many of the resistances elemental creatures possess, as well as the ability to grapple and crush their enemies with their watery bodies.": "深海鱼人是与邪水公主奥海德拉（Olhydra）签订了契约的邪教徒。除了他们的法术能力之外，水蛇人还有能力将他们的身体转化为水，形成类似于蛇的形状。在他们的水蛇形态中，法索玛人获得了许多元素生物所拥有的抵抗力，以及用他们水一样的身体抓取和压碎敌人的能力。",
	"Fathomers often serve as spies, infiltrators, and assassins for the water cult, since they can slip under locked doors or pass through bars and similar obstacles with ease.": "法索玛人经常充当水神教的间谍、潜入者和暗杀者，因为他们可以从上锁的门下溜走，或者轻松地穿过铁栅栏和类似的障碍。",

From the backs of hippogriffs or giant vultures, they survey the land around Feathergale Spire, guarding the entrance to the air cult's hidden temple.": "菲瑟盖尔骑士是来自沃特迪普（Waterdeep）等城市的雄心勃勃的富人，他们被空中邪教的权力承诺所诱惑。他们从河马或巨型秃鹰的背上勘察费瑟盖尔尖塔周围的土地，守卫着通往空中邪教隐藏的神殿的入口。",
	"The knights are contemptuous of other elemental cultists, whom they view as depraved lunatics. Under lord commander Thurl Merosska, the Feathergale Knights see themselves as elite men and women who can make hard choices for the good of their realms. In reality, they are bound to Yan-C-Bin and are blind to their own corruption and decadence. Despite their refined manners and social sophistication, each has sealed that pact with the murder of a sentient being-deaths the knights have dubbed necessary for the security of the realm.": "骑士们蔑视其他元素崇拜者，他们认为这些人是堕落的疯子。在主指挥官Thurl Merosska的领导下，Feathergale骑士将自己视为精英，能够为他们的王国做出艰难的选择。在现实中，他们被Yan-C-Bin所束缚，对自己的腐败和堕落视而不见。尽管他们彬彬有礼，社交能力强，但每个人都通过谋杀一个有生命的人来封印这个契约--骑士们认为为了王国的安全，这些人的死亡是必要的。",
	"The knights have access to wingwear, as described in the \"Elemental Magic Items\" section. They are often wearing it when encountered.": "骑士们可以使用翼装，如 \"元素魔法物品 \"一节所述。遇到这种情况时，他们经常穿着它。",
	"A flamewrath is a spellcaster that has earned the favor of Imix, the Prince of Elemental Fire, through a series of painful rites. A flamewrath's skin is burned and scarred.

Melee combatants who draw too close face fires that can dance across the flamewrath's skin and burn attackers.": "火焰巫师是一个通过一系列痛苦的仪式赢得火元素王子伊米克斯青睐的施法者。火焰巫师的皮肤被烧伤并留下疤痕。忍受着痛苦，火焰使者陶醉在战斗中，使用一系列的火系法术来焚烧那些试图浇灭火元素力量的敌人。近战者如果靠得太近，就会面临火焰的袭击，这些火焰会在火焰之神的皮肤上跳舞，并烧伤攻击者。",
	"Gar Shatterkeel is the water prophet of Elemental Evil and the dour leader of the Crushing Wave cult. He is embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others. Pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die at sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar sees the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and has gathered others who feel as he does.": "嘎尔-沙特基尔是邪恶元素的水先知，也是碎浪邪教的沉闷领袖。他因在他人手中遭受的苦难而愤愤不平。在他年轻的时候，海盗杀死了他的家人，他被迫在一艘商船上做奴隶，然后另一伙海盗把他丢在海上等死，在那里他被鲨鱼咬掉了手臂。加尔将水的元素力量视为他生命中唯一有价值的东西，并聚集了与他有同样感受的其他人。",
	"Gar bears the elemental weapon Drown. His missing arm has been replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he wields her innate magic. Other Crushing Wave cultists sense her power in him and follow him out of fear.": "加尔拥有元素武器 \"淹没\"。他缺失的手臂被一个螃蟹爪子形状的假肢所取代。作为奥海德拉邪教的领袖，他掌握着她与生俱来的魔法。其他破碎浪潮的崇拜者在他身上感受到了她的力量，并出于恐惧而追随他。",

Therefore, she hates just about everybody, and barely tolerates the other Black Earth cultists.": "海伦瑞克是一个沉闷的、不苟言笑的女人，习惯性地穿着单调的长袍，戴着没有眼孔的金色妖怪面具。她鄙视任何形式的弱点。因此，她憎恨几乎所有的人，并勉强容忍其他黑土教派。",
	"Howling Hatred initiates are attracted by the cult's philosophy of non-attachment and the rejection of material things, unaware of the cult's true nature.

	"Initiates live on little but air for a month, believing that this regimen purifies them of bodily needs. In truth it makes their bodies so desperate for sustenance that they become susceptible to indoctrination. Soon, they can justify heinous acts within the context of the cult: Human sacrifice isn't an act of murder, but a freeing of the soul from the limitations of a physical shell; conjuring a whirlwind to destroy unbelievers isn't an act of terror but a demonstration of true faith.": "入会者在一个月内只靠空气生活，认为这种生活方式能净化他们的身体需求。事实上，这使他们的身体对营养的需求如此迫切，以至于他们容易受到灌输。很快，他们就能在邪教的背景下为令人发指的行为辩解：人的牺牲不是谋杀行为，而是将灵魂从肉体外壳的限制中解放出来；施展旋风摧毁不信者不是恐怖行为，而是真正信仰的表现。",
	"The most fanatical of the air cultists, the priests push their bodies to physical extremes in order to decrease their density and mass and become as light as leaves. Gaunt and sallow faced, with concave bellies, bulging eyes, and taut skin that enunciates every bone, these living skeletons sustain themselves on nothing more than air and fanatical devotion to the teachings of the cult. The wind serves them at a gesture.": "作为最狂热的空气崇拜者，祭司们将自己的身体推向极端，以减少他们的密度和质量，变得像树叶一样轻。这些活生生的骷髅脸色苍白，腹部凹陷，眼睛凸出，皮肤紧绷，每块骨头都清晰可见，他们只靠空气和对邪教教义的狂热奉献维持自己的生命。风以一种姿态为他们服务。",
	"Howling Hatred priests see themselves as living extensions of Yan-C-Bin, and they help new recruits cast off the shackles of their old lives and embrace a \"higher purpose.\" Once the new recruits are thus purified, the priests decide whether they are worthy for indoctrination as initiates or would better serve the Howling Hatred cult as sacrifices. The priests also uphold the doctrine of their prophet, inoth, and harshly punish any initiate who strays from the path.": "嚎叫之恨的祭司们把自己看作是阎王爷的活生生的延伸，他们帮助新招募的人摆脱旧生活的桎梏，拥抱 \"更高的目标\"。一旦新兵得到净化，祭司们就会决定他们是否值得被灌输为入门者，或者作为祭品更好地服务于嚎叫之恨邪教。祭司们还坚持他们的先知伊诺斯的教义，并严厉惩罚任何偏离道路的入门者。",

When the Prince of Evil Earth gains access to the Material Plane through an elemental node, he begins to methodically locate and destroy every mine, quarry, town, or fortification in the area. It's not that he needs the wealth, but the principle of the thing-extracting treasure from the earth-is anathema to Ogrémoch.": "Ogrémoch特别憎恨任何敢于从地球上移走有价值的金属或石头的凡人，以及那些用石头塑造或建造东西的人。他注意到从他影响下的地区移走的每一块金块或原始宝石，试图夺回从他那里 \"偷 \"来的宝物，并惩罚盗贼。当邪恶的地球王子通过一个元素节点进入物质世界时，他开始有条不紊地找到并摧毁该地区的每一个矿场、采石场、城镇或防御设施。这并不是说他需要财富，而是这件事的原则--从地球上提取宝藏--对奥格瑞莫赫来说是一种厌恶。",
	"Ogrémoch is normally found in the depths of elemental earth, choosing caverns with black crystals and jagged rock spikes to serve as his throne room. He can enter the Material Plane through large and well-established nodes of elemental earth, with a little help from the proper rituals. Within such a node, Ogrémoch wields great power.": "Ogrémoch通常在土元素的深处被发现，选择有黑色水晶和锯齿状岩石尖刺的洞穴作为他的王室。他可以通过大型的、完善的土元素节点进入物质世界，并在适当的仪式中得到一点帮助。在这样的节点中，奥格雷莫赫拥有强大的力量。",
	"Olhydra is the Princess of Evil Water. Sometimes known as the Crushing Wave, the Dark Tide, or the Well of Endless Anguish, she takes the form of a great wave, 20 feet high and 15 feet wide, with opalescent eyes. She prefers to remain in or near large bodies of water-seas, lakes, rivers, or sometimes great subterranean pools. When she needs to, she can surge onto dry land, moving much like a wave rushing up onto the shore, but only great anger or desperation would drive Olhydra to move more than a few hundred feet from her native element.": "奥海德拉是邪恶之水的公主。她有时被称为 \"碎浪\"、\"暗潮 \"或 \"无尽的痛苦之井\"，她的形态是一个大浪，高20英尺，宽15英尺，有乳白色的眼睛。她喜欢呆在大型水体中或附近--海洋、湖泊、河流，或者有时是巨大的地下水池。当她需要的时候，她可以涌上干燥的陆地，就像波浪冲上岸一样，但只有巨大的愤怒或绝望才会驱使奥海德拉离开她的原生元素超过几百英尺。",
	"Olhydra surges forth tirelessly and relentlessly. She delights in creating dangerous and destructive manifestations of elemental water, especially maelstroms and floods. She is eager to assert her power by smashing any vessel that dares to venture into her realm, and lays waste to villages or towns established within her reach. Olhydra erodes that which she can't batter and drown; she is patient, retreating in the face of adversity only to return stronger than before.": "奥海德拉不知疲倦地、无情地涌现出来。她乐于创造危险和破坏性的水元素表现，尤其是漩涡和洪水。她渴望通过粉碎任何敢于冒险进入她的领域的船只来宣示她的力量，并对在她范围内建立的村庄或城镇造成浪费。奥尔海德拉会侵蚀那些她无法打击和淹没的东西；她很有耐心，在面对困境时，她会退缩，但会比以前更强大。",
	"Of all the Princes of Elemental Evil, Olhydra is the one most interested in mortals. She recognizes that pirates and raiders who redden the waters with mortal blood (and occasionally send treasure-laden ships into her clutches) are agents of her hateful outlook, whether they know it or not. Consequently, Olhydra sometimes spares the worst sort of seafarers from her wrath, patiently waiting for the day when they deliver others into her power.": "在所有邪恶元素的王子中，奥海德拉是对凡人最感兴趣的一个。她认识到，那些用凡人的鲜血染红海水的海盗和掠夺者（偶尔也会将满载财宝的船只送入她的魔掌）是她可憎观点的代理人，无论他们是否知道。因此，奥海德拉有时会从她的愤怒中放过最坏的那种海员，耐心地等待着他们将其他人送入她的势力范围的那一天。",
	"The Princess of Evil Water is native to the Elemental Plane of Water, where she can be found in the black depths of vast seas or enthroned among jagged reefs. Olhydra waits for the chance to enter the Material Plane through elemental water nodes or when called by the proper rituals. Whether she is in her elemental domain or temporarily occupying a water node, Olhydra commands the waters around her and can shape them to her will.": "恶水公主原产于水元素界，在那里她可以在广阔的海洋的黑色深处或在嶙峋的珊瑚礁中被发现。奥海德拉等待机会，通过水元素节点或在适当的仪式召唤下进入物质界。无论她是在她的元素领域还是暂时占据一个水结点，奥海德拉都能指挥她周围的水域，并能按照她的意愿塑造它们。",
	"A one-eyed shiver is a fearsome cultist who wields powers of ice and cold. To gain the frigid power of elemental water, the shiver removes one eye and replaces it with a frosty white orb that can blast foes with an icy ray. When the orb isn't in use, the shiver covers its magical eye with an eye patch. Even when hidden, the orb's magical power makes itself felt-a one-eyed shiver has ice-cold blood and is constantly surrounded by an aura of thin, cold fog.": "独眼颤抖者是一个可怕的邪教徒，拥有冰和冷的力量。为了获得水元素的冰冷力量，颤抖者摘下一只眼睛，用一个冰冷的白色球体代替它，可以用冰冷的射线轰击敌人。当球体不被使用时，颤抖者会用眼罩遮住它的魔眼。即使隐藏起来，球体的魔力也能让人感觉到--独眼的颤栗者拥有冰冷的血液，并不断被薄薄的冷雾所包围。",
	"One-eyed shivers inspire dread and fear in all who meet them, including their fellow cultists. Only the leaders of the Crushing Wave cult dare to give commands to these masters of icy magic.": "独眼的颤抖激发了所有见到他们的人的恐惧和害怕，包括他们的邪教成员。只有碎浪邪教的领袖才敢向这些冰冷的魔法大师发出命令。",
	"A lean, black-bearded young noble from Baldur's Gate, Oreioth is more at home among the dead than the living. He was cruel almost from the time he could talk, catching small creatures and killing them in hideously inventive ways to savor the power of life and death. He grew to be an embarrassment to his well-off family, who paid a tutor to channel his undeniable intelligence and curiosity into more positive outlets. They didn't know they had apprenticed the young Oreioth to a necromancer in need of an assistant for his researches.": "一个来自博德之门的精瘦、黑胡子的年轻贵族，Oreioth在死人中比在活人中更自在。他几乎从会说话的时候起就很残忍，捕捉小动物并以狰狞的方式杀死它们，品味生与死的力量。他逐渐成为他的富裕家庭的一个尴尬，他们花钱请了一个家庭教师，把他不可否认的智慧和好奇心引导到更积极的渠道。他们不知道他们已经把这个年轻的Oreioth教给了一个需要助手进行研究的死灵法师。",
	"When Oreioth's master decided he had no more use for his apprentice, he sent Oreioth off to make his own way in the world. Oreioth worked his way northward, robbing graves and using his magic to intimidate or rob anyone weaker than him. Driven out of one decent town after another, he finally sought refuge in an old outlaw's lair he discovered near Lance Rock. There he commenced his newest round of experiments, avoiding all other living souls.": "当Oreioth的主人决定他对他的学徒没有更多的利用价值时，他把Oreioth送走，让他在这个世界上走自己的路。Oreioth一路向北，抢劫坟墓，用他的魔法来恐吓或抢劫任何比他弱小的人。他被赶出一个又一个体面的城镇，最后在兰斯岩附近发现的一个老逃犯的巢穴里寻求庇护。在那里，他开始了他最新一轮的实验，避开了所有其他活人。",
	"What few social graces Oreioth once possessed are fading rapidly. He has become a megalomaniac, styling himself the Lord of Lance Rock and surrounding himself with zombies and skeletons compelled to heed his every whim. Oreioth barely recognizes his own name anymore, and he harbors dreams of founding a kingdom of undead servitors with himself on the throne.": "奥里欧斯曾经拥有的为数不多的社交礼仪正在迅速消退。他已经成为一个自大狂，把自己称为兰斯岩的主宰，周围的僵尸和骷髅被迫听从他的每一个要求。Oreioth几乎不认识自己的名字了，他梦想着建立一个由亡灵仆人组成的王国，并由他自己担任王位。",
	"A razerblast seethes with hate for the enemies of the fire cult. The razerblast's elemental overlords have replaced its heart with a flaming orb that detonates if the razerblast dies.": "一台雷泽爆裂机对火神教的敌人充满了仇恨。火焰喷射器的元素霸主用一个火焰球代替了它的心脏，如果火焰喷射器死亡，它就会被引爆。",
	"Razerblasts remember little of their life before they the power of elemental fire transformed them. Now they follow the orders of the flamewraths and the cult leaders without question. Razerblasts fight confidently because they know that even if they lose, they go out in a blaze of glory.": "在火元素的力量改造他们之前，Razerblasts对他们的生活几乎没有印象。现在，他们毫无疑义地听从火焰之神和邪教领袖的命令。火焰喷射者自信地战斗，因为他们知道即使他们输了，他们也会在荣耀的火焰中死去。",
	"Sacred Stone monks are followers of a martial philosophy that seeks to emulate the strength of rock and stone. They don gargoyle masks and use a finely honed sense of touch to measure their surroundings by contact with the ground. They avoid speaking, or extraneous thought for that matter. They live only to test themselves with deprivation and to punish those who doubt the strength of elemental earth.": "圣石僧侣是一种武术哲学的追随者，旨在模仿岩石和石头的力量。他们戴着石像鬼的面具，用精细磨练的触觉通过与地面的接触来测量周围的环境。他们避免说话，或不相干的思考。他们活着只是为了用匮乏来考验自己，并惩罚那些怀疑土元素力量的人。",
	"A plump water genasi armed with a jovial manner and biting sense of humor, Shoalar Quanderil seems like the last person one would expect to be a cruel member of a destructive cult. Nevertheless, Shoalar is the captain of a pirate ship that harries the Sword Coast, and a high-ranking Crushing Wave cultist. He sees Olhydra's power as a means to making himself as rich as possible.": "作为一个丰满的水系精灵，Shoalar Quanderil有着欢快的态度和尖锐的幽默感，他似乎是人们最不愿意看到的破坏性邪教的残酷成员。然而，肖勒是一艘骚扰剑海岸的海盗船的船长，也是一名高级的碎浪教教徒。他将奥海德拉的力量视为使自己尽可能富有的手段。",
	"Skyweavers brim with rage and desire, which makes them perfect vessels for the wildly destructive magic of the Cult of the Howling Hatred. In contrast to their hurricane counterparts in the air cult, skyweavers embrace the worship of Elemental Evil for a quick path to power. With little experience wielding the might of the elements, skyweavers thrill with the rush of releasing raw elemental energy.": "天空编织者充满了愤怒和欲望，这使他们成为嚎叫之恨教派疯狂破坏性魔法的完美容器。与他们在空气邪教中的飓风同行相比，织空者接受了对元素邪恶的崇拜，以便快速获得力量。由于没有挥舞元素之力的经验，织空者对释放原始元素能量的冲动感到兴奋。",
	"Stonemelders are spellcasters who gain their power from Ogrémoch, using elemental earth magic to sheathe their bodies in carapaces of rock. They are elite champions of the cult and answer only to the cult leaders. Not even the Black Earth priests tell stonemelders what to do.": "石匠是从奥格雷莫赫那里获得力量的施法者，他们使用土元素魔法将自己的身体包裹在岩石的外壳里。他们是邪教的精英冠军，只对邪教领袖负责。甚至黑土祭司也不会告诉石匠该怎么做。",

	"Thurl Merosska is the leader of the Feathergale Knights. Once a griffon rider of Waterdeep, Thurl retired after a storm nearly claimed his life.

	"When Aerisi Kalinoth arose as the chosen prophet of air, Thurl reluctantly pledged the Feathergale Knights to the cause.

	"Vanifer's rough childhood has hardened her heart against others. The world is a corrupt, painful place, she thinks, and deserving of a fiery end. For years, she was a dancer and concubine in a pasha's court in Calimshan. Later, she took up the mantle of prophet when she found Tinderstrike, and the same ruthless ambition and practiced manipulation that enabled her to escape a life of servitude serves her well as the head of a growing cult.": "瓦尼法的坎坷童年使她对别人的心变硬。她认为，这个世界是一个腐败的、痛苦的地方，应该有一个火热的结局。多年来，她在卡里姆山的一个帕夏宫廷里做舞女和妾室。后来，当她找到Tinderstrike时，她接过了先知的衣钵，同样无情的野心和熟练的操纵使她能够摆脱奴役的生活，这对她成为一个不断增长的邪教的首领很有帮助。",
	"For Vanifer, battle is best observed at a distance. She prefers to hurl destructive magic from afar. Those who challenge Vanifer in melee learn a painful lesson, as she and Tinderstrike make a formidable pair.": "对瓦尼法来说，战斗最好在远处观察。她更喜欢从远处投掷破坏性的魔法。那些在近战中挑战瓦尼法的人都会得到一个痛苦的教训，因为她和灰烬之矛是一对可怕的组合。",

	"Wiggan Nettlebee is the patriarch of the Nettlebee clan, a wealthy family of halflings that raise livestock and farm their land. He presents the outward appearance of a modest rancher, and he forbids extravagance on his farm.

He still doesn't know the full extent of the cult's plans.": "威根-奈特比是奈特比家族的族长，这是一个富裕的半身人家庭，他们饲养牲畜并耕种土地。他呈现出一个谦虚的牧场主的外在形象，他禁止在他的农场上奢侈。维根认为自己找到了一个致力于支配自然和利用其黑暗面的邪教，于是加入了黑土教。他仍然不知道该邪教的全部计划。",
	"Wiggan dislikes and distrusts outsiders. He believes they are all evildoers who would steal from him if they could.

	"At Aerisi's insistence, Windharrow recruited a band of flutists from the ranks of new converts to the air cult, calling them the Windwyrds. Most have no musical talent whatsoever, and their music is often a shrill cacophony. Of all the air cultists, the Windwyrds are the least fanatical and the most fearful for their lives. Aerisi disposes of these minstrels on a whim, replacing them with other initiates. Those that master some skill with their instruments survive the longest, but the cost of failure creates a highly competitive environment among the minstrels.": "在爱里西的坚持下，温德哈罗从新皈依空气邪教的队伍中招募了一队长笛手，称他们为Windwyrds。大多数人没有任何音乐天赋，他们的音乐往往是一种尖锐的喧闹声。在所有的空气崇拜者中，Windwyrds是最不狂热的，也是最担心自己生命的。爱丽斯随心所欲地处置这些吟游诗人，用其他入门者取代他们。那些掌握了一些乐器技能的人存活时间最长，但失败的代价在吟游诗人中创造了一个高度竞争的环境。",
