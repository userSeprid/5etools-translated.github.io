	"Quill is a charismatic bard who carries himself with a quiet confidence that doesn't hint at the full extent of his skills or powers. His handsome features are marred by a scar that curves from the top of his left cheekbone down to his jaw, though he doesn't consider the scar disfiguring. If asked about the scar, he explains that he got it years ago when the man who burned down his home village slashed his face with a dagger. It serves as a grim reminder of his past.": "奎尔是一个有魅力的吟游诗人，他带着一种安静的自信，并没有暗示他的技能或力量的全部范围。他英俊的五官被一道疤痕所破坏，这道疤痕从他的左颧骨顶部一直延伸到他的下巴，尽管他不认为这道疤痕会毁容。如果被问及这道疤痕，他解释说，几年前，烧毁他家乡的人用匕首割破了他的脸，他就有了这道疤痕。这是对他过去的一个严峻的提醒。",
	"Although outwardly friendly, Quill is driven by three selfish desires: to preserve his well-being, to alleviate his boredom, and to escape Wisteria Vale. He holds a grudge against the Harpers and Ryllia for imprisoning him in a place that reminds him of the people he lost in his childhood, though he also takes some comfort in being able to live out the life he could've had. His time spent alone with his thoughts in Wisteria Vale has led him to suspect that the Harpers were never going to find a cure, and that they were simply biding their time until he became complacent enough that they could kill him without his being a threat. Quill's corruption has convinced him that the Harpers have become a powerful force that must be taken down; he trusts only himself to identify and eliminate agents of tyranny.": "虽然外表友好，但奎尔被三个自私的欲望所驱使：保护他的健康，减轻他的无聊，以及逃离紫藤谷。他对哈珀斯和瑞丽亚将他囚禁在一个让他想起童年时失去的人的地方心存怨恨，尽管他也对能够过上他本可以拥有的生活感到有些安慰。他在紫藤谷独自思考的时间使他怀疑哈珀人永远不会找到解药，他们只是在等待时机，直到他变得足够自满，以至于他们可以杀了他而不对他构成威胁。奎尔的腐败使他相信哈珀斯人已经成为一股强大的力量，必须将其拿下；他只相信自己能够识别并消除暴政的代理人。",

	"Bak Mei was once an agile and skilled Shou monk famous for upholding justice and helping the needy in his distant homeland to the east of Faerûn. As he grew older, learned more about the world, and began to feel the weight of old age, his worldview changed dramatically.

He began collecting texts on the subject, consulting with practitioners of the necromantic arts, and seeking audiences with dark forces.": "Bak Mei曾经是一个敏捷而熟练的Shou僧侣，在他遥远的家乡Faerûn东部以维护正义和帮助穷人而闻名。随着他年龄的增长，对世界有了更多的了解，并开始感受到老年的重量，他的世界观发生了巨大的变化。由于对死亡的恐惧越来越大，白眉开始痴迷于过无止境的生活。他开始收集关于这个问题的文本，向死灵艺术的从业者咨询，并寻求与黑暗势力的对话。",
	"The abbots of his temple confronted Bak Mei about his radical pursuits and demanded that he cease his activities. In response, he tried to stage a revolt at the temple, a traitorous action that resulted in the excommunication of Bak Mei and his followers, who christened themselves the Order of the Immortal Lotus.

Under Bak Mei's cruel tutelage and eccentric training methods, the order has grown in power and numbers, living in seclusion while he planned his revenge on his former superiors.": "他的寺庙的住持就白眉的激进追求与他对质，要求他停止活动。作为回应，他试图在寺庙里发动叛乱，这一叛徒行为导致白眉和他的追随者被逐出教会，他们自称为不朽莲花会。这个小团体最终定居在博德之门附近的森林里，在那里他们招募新成员。在白眉的残酷教导和古怪的训练方法下，该组织的力量和人数不断增加，在他计划对他以前的上级进行报复时，他隐居在这里。",

	"Chwingas find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it follows them for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid the creature, or it might bestow a magical gift before departing. The aspect that attracts a chwinga to a humanoid can take any form. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.": "丘维加人发现文明的外衣很吸引人。它们对穿戴盔甲、携带武器、使用工具和烹饪食物的生物感到困惑。当楚温加人遇到一个或多个人形生物时，它的好奇心有时会更强，会跟着他们观察很短的时间。如果它喜欢上了一个人形生物，chwinga可能会使用它的咒语来帮助这个生物，或者在离开之前赐予一个神奇的礼物。吸引chwinga的人形生物的方面可以采取任何形式。在某些情况下，chwinga可能只是喜欢一个人形生物的走路方式或梳头方式。其他时候，它可能会被一个人形生物演奏音乐或吃大量食物的能力所迷惑。",

	"Though these constructed villagers can physically interact with the environment around them and hold lengthy conversations, a few clues to their true nature exist. A character who observes one or more of the commoners closely and succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices a faint clicking sound whenever a villager touches a hard surface. The villagers are also cold to the touch, which can be ascertained only through physical contact. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check notices that if the villagers are asked about anything outside Wisteria Vale or their individual talents, they quickly change subjects to small talk about the weather or gossip, and always in Common regardless of their apparent origin.": "尽管这些被建造的村民可以与周围的环境进行物理互动，并进行冗长的对话，但还是有一些关于他们真实性质的线索存在。仔细观察一个或多个平民并成功通过DC15智慧（感知）检查的人物会注意到，每当一个村民接触到坚硬的表面时，就会发出微弱的咔嚓声。村民们的触觉也很冷，这只能通过身体接触来确定。通过DC15智慧（洞察力）检查成功的人物注意到，如果村民被问及紫藤谷以外的事情或他们的个人才能，他们很快就会改变话题，变成关于天气或八卦的小谈话，而且总是用普通话，不管他们的明显来源。",

Its head and body are indeed those of a frog, but its front extremities end in hands with fingers that enable it to manipulate weapons and other objects, and its rear legs have similar digits that it can use for grasping and climbing.
