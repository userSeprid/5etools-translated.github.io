	"Abhorrent overlords are gaunt, bipedal creatures whose gray, leathery skin is in stark contrast to the gleaming jewelry made of Underworld gold that they adorn themselves with. Their appetite for pain and death is eclipsed only by their greed; these fiends delight in searching out treasure and slaughtering all who stand in their way.": "可憎的霸主是憔悴的双足生物，其灰色、皮革般的皮肤与他们所装饰的闪亮的冥界黄金珠宝形成了鲜明的对比。他们对痛苦和死亡的渴望只有在他们的贪婪面前才会黯然失色；这些恶魔以寻找宝藏和屠杀所有挡路的人为乐。",
	"Akroan hoplites, also called stratians, number among the fiercest soldiers on Theros. They train relentlessly and possess unflinching resolve.

	"Hoplites are highly trained warriors, versed not only in strategy and tactics but in the glorification of the warrior's spirit, the basis of an ethos that forges an unbreakable bond between members of a military unit. In combat, hoplites typically work in groups and use coordinated tactics to win victories.": "霍普利特人是训练有素的战士，他们不仅精通战略和战术，还精通对战士精神的颂扬，这是一种精神的基础，它在军事单位的成员之间形成了牢不可破的联系。在战斗中，跳伞兵通常以小组为单位，使用协调的战术来赢得胜利。",

Some are benevolent and aid those who live off the land, while others embody violent aspects of nature. In either case, nymphs generally avoid other sapient creatures, preferring to mind the cycles of nature, the daily interplay of wild animals, or other cosmic forces.

	"The fall of the ancient archon empires left some archons bitter and resentful. Seeking to avoid the spread of human civilization, these archons made their way to the Underworld. The horrors of the place broke their minds, bodies, and spirits and twisted them into the terrifying archons known as ashen riders. When they ride forth upon the mortal world, terrified mortals make offerings in a desperate attempt to appease them, but the ashen riders aren't merciful, and they delight in reducing the paragons of the mortal world to ash.": "古代大拱门帝国的衰落让一些大拱门感到痛苦和怨恨。为了避免人类文明的传播，这些大弓箭手来到了冥界。那里的恐怖打破了他们的思想、身体和精神，并将他们扭曲成可怕的大弓箭手，被称为灰烬骑士。当他们骑着马来到凡间时，被吓坏的凡人为了安抚他们而不顾一切地献上祭品，但灰烬骑手并不仁慈，他们乐于将凡间的典范变成灰烬。",

He was cast out and has since become tragically obsessed with finding a worthy heir.": "他声称自己是一位伟大的国王，在他违背战争顾问的要求，将自己生病但心爱的孩子作为继承人后，被莫吉斯诅咒了。他被赶出了家门，此后便悲惨地迷恋上了寻找一个合格的继承人。",

	"An enormous golem of bronze and iron overlooks the path leading to the polis of Akros. Though it is rarely called on to defend the polis, the sight of its towering form is enough to ease the minds of the populace. In truly desperate times, priests of Purphoros work their magic to call the colossus to life, whereupon the earth rumbles as it steps down from its twin plinths to place itself before the threat.": "一个巨大的青铜和铁制的巨像俯瞰着通往阿克罗斯市的道路。虽然它很少被用来保卫城市，但看到它高大的身躯就足以让民众安心。在真正绝望的时候，普尔福罗斯的祭司会施展他们的魔法召唤巨像，当它从它的双座上走下来，把自己放在威胁面前时，大地会发出隆隆声。",
	"Belief is a powerful force in Theros, capable of bringing about wonders and changing the world—but not always for the better. Doomwake giants arise from pernicious fears that infect a whole city or region. If enough mortals dread destruction for long enough, their terror can manifest as one of these massive Nyxborn beings. Once unleashed, a doomwake giant goes on a rampage, fulfilling the prophecy mortals believed into being. After doing so, these terrors typically roam to the edges of the world, where they either fade away over time or become legends that take on their own terrible life.": "信仰在塞洛斯是一种强大的力量，能够带来奇迹并改变世界--但并不总是为了更好的结果。厄运之醒的巨人来自于感染整个城市或地区的恶性恐惧。如果有足够多的凡人对毁灭恐惧了足够长的时间，他们的恐怖就会表现为这些巨大的Nyxborn生物之一。一旦被释放出来，末日觉醒的巨人就会大肆破坏，实现凡人相信的预言。在这样做之后，这些恐怖的东西通常会游荡在世界的边缘，在那里它们要么随着时间的推移逐渐消失，要么成为传说，拥有自己的可怕的生命。",
	"A spectrum of giants claims territory across Theros, drawing strength from aspects of the world itself—from ancient stone and roiling flames to the depths of the seas and skies. Unlike many creatures of legend, most giants owe their existence not to Nyx and the dreams of mortals, but to natural forces in the land. As a result, Theran giants are typically infused with the elements they embody, which might manifest as flaming beards, frozen skin, hair crackling with lightning, or other primal incarnations.": "一系列的巨人声称他们的领地遍布塞洛斯，从世界本身的各个方面汲取力量--从古老的石头和咆哮的火焰到海洋和天空的深处。与许多传说中的生物不同，大多数巨人的存在不是归功于Nyx和凡人的梦想，而是归功于土地中的自然力量。因此，泰兰巨人通常被注入他们所体现的元素，这可能表现为火焰般的胡须、冰冻的皮肤、闪电般的头发，或其他原始的化身。",
	"Beyond these primal giants, though, other giants fill the tales of Theros.": "不过，除了这些原始的巨人之外，其他的巨人也充满了特洛斯的故事。",

Although these demons can strike down most foes, they prefer to let terror and despair overtake their victims first, letting their victims marinate in fear before the fiend devours them.": "吞噬希望的人内心是痛苦的，对所有形式的生命和快乐都心怀怨恨。虽然这些恶魔可以击倒大多数敌人，但他们更喜欢让恐怖和绝望首先笼罩他们的受害者，让他们的受害者在恶魔吞噬他们之前沉浸在恐惧之中。",
	"Twice the size of normal lions and with resplendent manes of silvery or golden hair, fleecemane lions prowl and protect sites imbued with the power of Nyx. While the specifics of these massive lions' connection to Nyx is unclear, many myths tell of the deadly predators stalking mortals and spreading fear until they're ultimately defeated by a brave hunter. As a result, overcoming a fleecemane lion is widely considered an early step on the road to becoming a true hero.": "绒毛狮的体型是普通狮子的两倍，拥有银色或金色的华丽鬃毛，它们游荡并保护着被Nyx的力量所感染的地方。虽然这些巨大的狮子与尼克斯的具体联系还不清楚，但许多神话都说这些致命的掠食者会跟踪凡人并散布恐惧，直到它们最终被勇敢的猎人击败。因此，战胜绒毛狮被广泛认为是成为真正英雄道路上的早期步骤。",
	"When a mortal soul traumatically sacrifices its identity in order to escape the Underworld as a Returned, its identity manifests as a spirit-like eidolon.

They care nothing for morbid reunions with their lost bodies or Returned remnants.": "当一个凡人的灵魂为了逃离冥界而痛苦地牺牲了自己的身份，作为一个回归者，其身份表现为一个类似精神的Eidolon。虽然Eidolons拥有许多与他们过去生活相关的技能和细节，但他们与这些经历脱节，选择在世界中游荡或在他们死后被吸引的地方沉思。他们不关心与他们失去的身体或回归者的残余物的病态团聚。",

	"The original purpose of gold-forged sentinels is a mystery, and of all Purphoros's original anvilwroughts, this construct is the most difficult to control. A sentinel often operates without a master, stalking the high places of the mortal world or waiting, still as a statue, for what could be decades before reanimating to carry out their mysterious purpose.": "黄金锻造的哨兵的最初目的是个谜，在珀弗罗斯所有的原始砧槽中，这种构造是最难控制的。哨兵经常在没有主人的情况下运作，在凡人世界的高处潜行，或者像雕像一样静静地等待，可能要等上几十年才能复活，以实现他们的神秘目的。",
	"Noble steeds of the sea, hippocamps feature in countless tales as guides and mounts to tritons and other ocean-faring heroes. While these curious but cautious aquatic equines naturally travel in herds, many hold valued places in triton society. Considered to be servants of Thassa, hippocamps are often unpredictable, but their great speed and strength can prove awe-inspiring when harnessed by the god's will.": "海马是海洋中的高贵骏马，在无数的故事中，海马是三文鱼和其他海洋英雄的向导和坐骑。虽然这些好奇但谨慎的水生马匹自然是成群结队地旅行，但许多人在特里顿社会中拥有重要的地位。海马被认为是塔萨的仆人，它们常常是不可预测的，但当它们被神的意志所驾驭时，它们巨大的速度和力量可以证明是令人敬畏的。",
	"Extra pairs of arms magically orbit the bodies of the titanic, nearly forgotten artisans known as hundred-handed ones. These giants often dwell in remote mountains and seaside cliffs, where they carve their memories into the ancient stone, covering their territories with intricate reliefs and massive statues of bygone ages. Some linger near ancient temples and palaces, ruins they once raised to the gods or archons of old.": "额外的一对手臂神奇地围绕着那些被称为百手观音的、几乎被遗忘的工匠的身体。这些巨人经常居住在偏远的山区和海边的悬崖上，他们在那里把自己的记忆刻在古老的石头上，用复杂的浮雕和过去时代的巨大雕像覆盖他们的领土。有些人在古老的寺庙和宫殿附近徘徊，这些废墟是他们曾经向古代的神或大主教提出的。",

	"When Hythonia came to the island of Skathos, the inhabitants worshiped her as an avatar of the god Pharika. The cultists eagerly offered themselves up to the medusa's petrifying gaze in hopes of gaining Pharika's favor. Seeing herself surrounded by willing devotees, Hythonia formulated a cruel plan. After encouraging them to engage in wild rituals, Hythonia began turning her followers to stone, weaving their forms to create a grisly throne made of their petrified bodies.": "当Hythonia来到Skathos岛时，居民们把她当作Pharika神的化身来崇拜。崇拜者们热切地将自己献给冥王的石化目光，希望获得法里卡的青睐。看到自己被自愿的信徒包围，海索尼亚制定了一个残酷的计划。在鼓励他们参与狂野的仪式之后，海索尼亚开始将她的追随者变成石头，将他们的形状编织成一个由他们石化的身体组成的可怕的王座。",
	"While the medusa's victims have dwindled, tales of the medusa queen and the divine secrets she hoards have not. Hythonia eagerly trades the mysteries she knows but demands a constant price: a beautiful individual to become part of her throne.": "虽然美杜莎的受害者越来越少，但关于美杜莎女王和她所囤积的神圣秘密的故事却没有减少。赫索尼亚热衷于交易她所知道的奥秘，但要求一个不变的价格：一个美丽的人成为她王位的一部分。",

	"What krakens are to the sea and dragons are to the sky, hydras are to the lands of Theros. Various hydras dwell at the fringes of civilization, from the bog-dwelling hydras known across the multiverse to massive ironscale hydras that lurk in deep wildernesses.

	"Lampads guard the shadowed paths of the world, depths typically trod by souls destined for the Underworld. These rarely seen nymphs assist Athreos in guiding the dead, moving among the spirits that collect along the Tartyx River and reclaiming wayward souls that try to slip back to the mortal world.

	"While leonin don't deny the existence of the gods, most denounce them, believing the deities are more likely to spread doom than peace and bounty.

	"Prides of leonin roam the plains of Oreskos, protecting the land and its creatures from interlopers, both mortal and immortal. As many leonin suffered at the hands of archon tyrants in ages past, today their prides largely avoid contact with other peoples and spurn the gods that ignored their plight. Since then, the leonin have flourished, finding strength in their bonds with one another and the land.

The occasional star-crossed castaway has even been known to become part of such collections.": "天性好奇的奈德人经常寻找海洋和河流中的东西。因此，他们可能会在沉没的废墟和船只残骸中被发现，在残骸中筛选出任何吸引他们目光的东西。活生生的生物也不能免于这种好奇心。众所周知，Naiads会与水生生物交好，甚至饲养一些小型的动物。偶尔的星际迷航者甚至被称为成为这种收藏的一部分。",
	"Sailors across the world claim that naiads know all the secret aquatic routes of Theros. Using this hidden system of currents and arteries, a ship might reach any destination in record time, be it across the sea or along a river a hundred miles inland. Naiads do nothing to dissuade sailors from this belief, and certainly numerous reports tell of charmed nymphs leading lost seafarers home. Yet, if tales of naiad-led galleys appearing amid the headwaters of mountain rivers are true, only the nymphs know for sure.": "世界各地的水手们声称，Naiads知道Theros所有的秘密水路。利用这个隐藏的水流和动脉系统，一艘船可以在创纪录的时间内到达任何目的地，不管是在海上还是在内陆一百英里的河流上。Naiads并没有劝阻水手们放弃这种信念，当然也有许多报道说魅力十足的仙女带领迷路的海员回家。然而，如果关于仙女带领的大帆船出现在山间河流的源头的传说是真的，那么只有仙女们才知道。",
	"A nightmare shepherd is a gaunt, ashen fiend with leathery wings. It carries a shepherd's crook, which it uses to direct a flock of wandering dead that it torments and occasionally feeds upon.": "梦魇牧羊人是一个憔悴的、灰暗的恶魔，有着皮革般的翅膀。它带着一把牧羊人的拐杖，用它来指挥一群流浪的死人，它折磨这些死人，偶尔也以他们为食。",
	"Touched by the gods, Nyx-fleece rams grow remarkable magical wool. This makes the beasts valuable to heroes and scoundrels alike, who would use their wool for either protection or profit. Divine servants guard the few herds of Nyx-fleece rams dwelling among Theros's loftiest peaks, assuring they don't fall into unworthy hands.": "在众神的感召下，尼克斯绒毛公羊长出了非凡的魔法羊毛。这使得这些野兽对英雄和恶棍都很有价值，他们会用它们的羊毛来保护自己或获取利益。神圣的仆人们守护着居住在特洛斯最崇高的山峰上的几群尼克斯绒毛公羊，确保它们不会落入不值得的人手中。",
	"Oracles posses the ability to interpret the patterns and language of Nyx, divining from it the flow of fates and the will of the gods. Most of these gifted—or cursed—mortals communicate with a single god, interpreting their intentions for the wider world. Others aren't aligned with a god and observe the night sky, reading Nyx like a vast, cryptic scroll for insights.": "奥拉司拥有解释尼克斯的模式和语言的能力，从它那里预知命运的流动和诸神的意志。这些有天赋的或被诅咒的亡灵大多与一个神沟通，解释他们对更广泛世界的意图。其他人则不与某个神灵结盟，而是观察夜空，像阅读巨大的、隐秘的卷轴一样阅读尼克斯，以获得洞察力。",
	"Aggressive oreads number among the most dangerous nymphs, as they embody the wild might of flames, volcanism, and the hidden forces of the earth. These creatures typically dwell in remote mountain crags and near volcanoes, where they caper among the forces of dissolution and rebirth. During avalanches and volcanic eruptions, groups of oreads might race ahead of the destruction, dancing, singing, and doing what they can to maximize the impending devastation.": "攻击性的奥瑞德是最危险的仙女之一，因为他们体现了火焰、火山和地球的隐秘力量的狂野力量。这些生物通常居住在偏远的山区峭壁和火山附近，在那里它们在溶解和重生的力量中游荡。在雪崩和火山爆发期间，一群奥瑞德人可能会在破坏面前奔跑，跳舞，唱歌，并尽其所能，使即将发生的破坏最大化。",
	"Hearkening back to some ages-old conflict, oreads refuse to knowingly destroy any land inhabited by another nymph. While they won't work to alter the natural course of destruction, neither will they make another nymph's home part of any calamity they encourage. As a result, part of what makes an alseid's field or a dryad's grove seem so blessed is that oreads go out of their way to leave such sites alone.": "回溯到一些古老的冲突，Oreads拒绝故意破坏其他仙女居住的任何土地。虽然他们不会努力改变破坏的自然进程，但他们也不会让另一个仙女的家成为他们鼓励的任何灾难的一部分。因此，使阿尔塞德的田地或干尸的小树林看起来如此有福的部分原因是，Oreads不顾一切地离开这些地方。",
	"The followers of Purphoros regard oreads with special reverence, as myths tell of cagey smiths befriending these nymphs and convincing them to aid in creating phenomenal works. In some tales, a smith finds an oread and allows it to relish in the destruction of a novel or remarkable item. In recompense, the oread provides the smith with materials drawn from the burning heart of the world, allowing the smith to create an even greater wonder. In more tales, though, a smith pursues an oread, then later the mortal's associates find familiar tools and a heap of ashes.": "Purphoros的追随者对Oreads抱有特别的敬意，因为神话中讲述了狡猾的铁匠与这些仙女交好，并说服他们帮助创造惊人的作品。在一些故事中，一个铁匠发现了一个Oread，并让它在破坏一个新奇或非凡的物品时津津乐道。作为回报，奥雷德为铁匠提供了从世界燃烧的心脏中提取的材料，使铁匠能够创造出更大的奇迹。不过，在更多的故事中，铁匠追求一个奥德，后来凡人的伙伴们发现了熟悉的工具和一堆灰烬。",
	"These armored skeletal spirits guard the borders of the Underworld and its various wards. Sleepless and merciless, they scrutinize all who would pass, and they slay those who defy them.": "这些身着铠甲的骷髅精灵守卫着冥界的边界和各种防护设施。他们不眠不休，毫不留情，审视着所有要通过的人，并杀死那些违抗他们的人。",
	"Polukranos, called the World Eater, is the mortal manifestation of the eternal ideal of a hydra. In its first incarnation, it fell from Nyx to the mortal world, and so great were its size and strength that the gods Nylea and Heliod combined their power to bind the monster deep within the Nessian Wood. That incarnation was slain, but the eternal ideal remains. A new incarnation of the World Eater is a fearsome omen, as the monster only appears when the pillars of the world tremble and terrible things are afoot in the realm of the gods. Its rampages often presage an age of menace for all civilization.": "Polukranos，被称为世界吞噬者，是九头蛇的永恒理想在凡间的体现。在它的第一个化身中，它从尼克斯坠落到凡间，它的体型和力量是如此之大，以至于奈拉神和赫利奥德神结合了他们的力量，将这个怪物束缚在尼西亚森林深处。那个化身被杀死了，但永恒的理想仍然存在。世界吞噬者的新化身是一个可怕的预兆，因为这个怪物只在世界之柱颤抖和诸神领域发生可怕事情时出现。它的横冲直撞往往预示着一个对所有文明都有威胁的时代。",
	"Many Returned are pitiable souls who managed to escape from the Underworld only to find themselves stripped of the passions that motivated their flight. Lacking purpose and shunned by the living, these Returned typically seek places where they'll be left in peace, such as lonely tombs or the necropoleis of Asphodel and Odunos. There they go through half-hearted parodies of life, impeded by distraction and ennui. Despite this, even the most languorous Returned defend themselves if threatened and might be pressed into the service of their more willful brethren.": "许多回归者都是可怜的灵魂，他们设法逃离了冥界，却发现自己失去了促使他们逃离的激情。由于缺乏目标，又被活人躲避，这些回归者通常会寻找能让他们安然无恙的地方，比如孤独的坟墓或阿斯波德尔和奥杜诺斯的亡灵。在那里，他们通过半心半意的生活模仿，被分心和厌烦所阻碍。尽管如此，即使是最无精打采的回归者在受到威胁时也会保护自己，并可能被逼着为他们更有意志力的兄弟们服务。",
	"Returned have escaped the Underworld and dwell among the living once more, but their second lives are rarely what they expected—not that they remember what it was they expected. As a result of having followed the Path of Phenax (see chapter 4), the Returned lose their identities, which manifest as separate beings known as eidolons. The experience of escaping the Underworld also causes them to lose their faces, which become expressionless surfaces with empty eye sockets and gaping mouths. These blank surfaces they cover with distinctive golden masks.": "回归者已经逃离了冥界，再次居住在活人中间，但他们的第二次生命很少是他们所期望的--并不是说他们记得他们期望的是什么。由于遵循Phenax之路（见第4章），回归者失去了他们的身份，这些身份表现为被称为Eidolons的独立生命。逃离冥界的经历也使他们失去了面孔，变成了没有表情的表面，眼窝空洞，嘴巴张开。他们用独特的金色面具覆盖这些空白的表面。",
	"Returned reenter the world blank and undead. No longer possessing the ability to form long-term memories, they generally can't build meaningful relationships or establish new lives. Instead, most experience fleeting emotions and follow hollow routines, their existences reduced to shadow plays without weight or substance.": "回归者重新进入这个世界时是空白的，是不死的。他们不再拥有形成长期记忆的能力，通常不能建立有意义的关系或建立新的生活。相反，大多数人经历着短暂的情感，遵循着空洞的常规，他们的存在沦为没有重量或内容的影子剧。",
	"Although the dead typically recall little of their lives, some have an obsession with magic that survives both death and rebirth as a Returned. These Returned, called kakomanteis, use their magical prowess to control the energy that suffuses the Underworld.": "虽然死者通常对自己的生活回忆不多，但有些人对魔法有一种痴迷，在死亡和重生后都能成为回归者。这些被称为Kakomanteis的回归者，利用他们的魔法能力来控制充斥在冥界的能量。",
	"Even death and the loss of their identities can't erase the rage that inspires Returned palamnites. These Returned led violent lives, existences filled with such pain and hatred that violence now suffuses their deathless bodies. Such makes them exceptionally dangerous to the living, as these aimless killers know only suffering and seek to spread it whenever the opportunity arises. While palamnites might wander the world as dangerous, lone murderers, many gravitate to Odunos, where they serve the vicious will of Tymaret the Murder King (see chapter 3).": "即使是死亡和身份的丧失也不能抹去激发回归者帕拉曼人的怒火。这些回归者过着暴力的生活，他们的生活充满了痛苦和仇恨，以至于现在暴力充斥着他们没有死亡的身体。这使得他们对活着的人异常危险，因为这些漫无目的的杀手只知道痛苦，只要有机会就会寻求传播痛苦。虽然巴拉曼人可能会作为危险的、孤独的杀人犯在世界各地游荡，但许多人都倾向于奥杜诺斯，在那里他们为杀人王泰玛瑞特的邪恶意志服务（见第三章）。",
	"Most new or purposeless Returned are easily manipulated into serving their more forceful brethren. Having purpose forced upon them, these Returned perform simple, artless tasks with middling efficiency. Their one virtue is their tirelessness, which makes them exceptional guards. In the necropoleis, this sees many Returned employed as sentries, though they might also be messengers or laborers. If threatened, groups of these Returned work well together, sharing the unified goals of overcoming their foes and getting back to the task at hand.": "大多数新的或没有目的的回归者很容易被操纵，为他们更有力量的兄弟们服务。在被强迫的情况下，这些回归者以中等的效率执行简单的、无艺术的任务。他们的一个优点是不知疲倦，这使他们成为特殊的卫兵。在亡灵区，许多回归者被雇用为哨兵，尽管他们也可能是信使或工人。如果受到威胁，这些回归者的群体会很好地合作，分享战胜敌人的统一目标，并回到手头的工作中。",
	"Pursuing lives of endless reverie, satyr revelers eagerly participate in celebrations wherever they find them. Their boisterous natures go far toward tempting others to eat, drink, and carouse with them. Faced with stodgier individuals or outright rivals, satyr revelers don't balk at using the magic of their music, dance, or other performances to charm opponents into joining their festivities. In the aftermath, these satyrs' foes are more likely to suffer embarrassment and groggy mornings than any lasting harm.": "追求无尽遐想的生活，萨提尔狂欢者热衷于参加任何地方的庆祝活动。他们沸腾的天性在很大程度上诱惑着别人和他们一起吃喝玩乐。面对呆板的人或直接的对手，萨提尔狂欢者并不吝啬用他们的音乐、舞蹈或其他表演的魔力来吸引对手加入他们的庆祝活动。在事后，这些萨提尔的敌人更有可能遭受尴尬和昏昏沉沉的早晨，而不是任何持久的伤害。",
	"While most satyrs are known for their high spirits, love of revels, and gregarious personalities, these outgoing people are neither naive nor defenseless. Some satyrs delightedly torment stuffy individuals or pull pranks on the unwary, pastimes that can predictably lead to scuffles. If a satyr can't talk their way out of a conflict—or diffuse it with a good-natured distraction—they readily defend themselves, their friends, and their homes in the Skola Vale. With diversions aside, satyrs bend their cleverness toward tactics and methods of ending conflicts as swiftly as possible. This often means turning the same skills that make them famed celebrants toward battle, be it captivating performances or the aim developed through endless games of skill. Once a threat is overcome, though, satyrs are quick to engage in their favorite part of battle: the victory celebration.": "虽然大多数萨提亚人都以情绪高涨、喜欢狂欢和好客的个性而闻名，但这些外向的人既不天真也不毫无防备。有些萨提尔喜欢折磨那些闷骚的人，或者对那些不知情的人搞恶作剧，这些消遣可以预见地导致混战的发生。如果萨提尔不能通过谈话来解决冲突，或者用善意的分散注意力来化解冲突，他们就会随时保护自己、朋友和他们在斯科拉谷地的家园。除了转移注意力之外，萨提尔还将他们的聪明才智用于尽可能迅速地结束冲突的战术和方法。这往往意味着将使他们成为著名的庆祝者的同样技能转向战斗，无论是迷人的表演还是通过无休止的技能游戏发展的目标。不过，一旦威胁被克服，萨提尔就会迅速投入到他们最喜欢的战斗中：庆祝胜利。",
	"Not all satyrs live lives of pure whimsy. When forced to defend their friends and homes, satyr thornbearers are quick to take up their bows and strike against danger. Particularly amid the dense trees of the Skola Vale, these satyr skirmishers cooperate in loose teams, using guerrilla tactics to harass foes then melt back into the forest. The blessings of Nylea aid the satyrs in protecting their home, and a single arrow from a thornbearer's bow might rain down like a volley from a whole army.": "并非所有的萨提尔都过着纯粹的奇思妙想的生活。当被迫保护他们的朋友和家园时，萨提尔刺客会迅速拿起他们的弓箭，对危险进行打击。特别是在斯科拉谷地茂密的树木中，这些萨提尔小兵以松散的队伍进行合作，使用游击战术来骚扰敌人，然后融进森林里。奈拉的祝福帮助萨提尔保护他们的家园，刺客弓上的一支箭可能会像整个军队的排山倒海一样倾泻下来。",
	"Most Setessan hoplites begin their training as hunters, making them skilled in traversing the woods and adept at both guerrilla tactics and archery. Their strategies often emulate the favored servants of Nylea—especially wild beasts like wolves and lynxes. Typically a few soldiers harry an enemy while the rest capitalize on their foe's distraction.": "大多数塞特桑的跳伞兵都是从猎人开始训练的，这使他们能够熟练地穿越森林，并擅长游击战术和射箭。他们的策略往往模仿奈拉的宠儿--特别是狼和猞猁等野兽。通常情况下，少数士兵会骚扰敌人，而其他士兵则利用敌人的注意力。",

	"The Akroans tell a tale of the first chimera's origin, wherein the god Keranos sought to test Nylea's favorite champion, Renata of Setessa, by creating a beast so deadly that even she would balk at trying to hunt it. When Renata slayed this lion-ram-dragon creation effortlessly, Keranos created another combination of deadlier beasts to challenge her. She slayed that beast, too. Despite countless attempts, Keranos was unable to create a beast that Renata couldn't best.": "阿克罗人讲述了第一个奇美拉的起源，其中凯拉诺斯神试图测试奈拉最喜欢的冠军，塞特萨的雷娜塔，他创造了一个致命的野兽，甚至连她都不敢尝试去猎杀它。当雷娜塔毫不费力地杀死了这只狮子--拉姆--龙的创造物时，凯拉诺斯又创造了另一种更致命的野兽组合来挑战她。她也杀死了那只野兽。尽管做了无数次尝试，凯拉诺斯还是无法创造出雷娜塔无法战胜的野兽。",
	"Chimeras typically roam the deep wilds of the world, constantly seeking a lair that would perfectly suit one of its heads, but then finding it unsatisfying to two-thirds of its being. As a result, a hungry chimera might appear out of a clear sky to pick off prey nearly anywhere. This threat grows even more significant in regions where magic runs rampant or where portals to the realm of Nyx exist, as unrestrained magical energy often causes more chimeras to appear in a region. As such chaotic magic is inherent to a chimera's being, these monsters often manage to shrug off spells cast against them.": "奇美拉通常在世界深处的荒野中游荡，不断寻找一个完全适合它的一个脑袋的巢穴，但后来发现它的三分之二的生命都不满意。因此，一个饥饿的奇美拉可能会从晴朗的天空中出现，几乎在任何地方摘取猎物。在魔法横行的地区或存在通往尼克斯领域的门户的地方，这种威胁会变得更加显著，因为不受约束的魔法能量往往会导致更多的奇美拉出现在一个地区。由于这种混乱的魔法是奇美拉与生俱来的，这些怪物往往能够摆脱针对它们的法术。",

Such isn't the case for mortals, though, and they eagerly set upon those who tread too close to the Underworld's borders.": "双头狼被认为是与凡人狼杂交的较小品种，它们通常在塔提克斯河的凡人一侧游荡。在那里，它们通常无视或只是适度地威胁着死者的灵魂。不过，对于凡人来说，情况并非如此，它们热衷于对付那些过于接近冥界边界的人。",
	"Feared by the living and the dead, cerberi patrol both banks of the Tartyx River. These multiheaded hounds of the Underworld breathe gouts of molten rock that sear and imprison those who trespass upon the borders of life and death.

Villains have been known to exploit that hunger by luring cerberi away from the river and setting them loose on mortal settlements.": "cerberi被生者和死者所惧怕，它在塔提克斯河的两岸巡逻。这些多头的阴间猎犬喷出熔岩，灼烧并禁锢那些闯入生死边界的人。大多数瑟贝里人对新鲜的肉类有着无限的渴望，尤其是人类的肉体。众所周知，恶棍们利用这种饥饿感，将地狱犬从河边引开，让它们在凡人的定居点里放纵。",
	"Titanic horrors of writhing flesh and gnashing maws, typhons slither through the Underworld seeking only to consume. Once the souls of mortal warlords and cruel tyrants, typhons come into being over ages of festering bitterness and rage. Over time, these souls twist into eternally ravenous monstrosities, which rampage through the realm of the dead, consuming souls by the thousands. The Underworld remains their prison, though, and most would relish nothing more than to escape and slaughter the living once more.": "泰坦尼克号的恐怖是由蠕动的肉体和咬碎的大嘴组成的，泰坦尼克号在冥界滑行，只为寻求吞噬。曾经是凡人军阀和残忍的暴君的灵魂，typhons是在长期的痛苦和愤怒中形成的。随着时间的推移，这些灵魂扭曲成永远贪婪的怪物，它们在亡灵界横冲直撞，吞噬成千上万的灵魂。不过，冥界仍然是它们的牢笼，大多数人最想做的就是逃出冥界，再一次屠杀活人。",
	"Three-headed cerberi dwell deep in the Underworld. Terrifying and cunning, they guard portals between the wards of the Underworld, Erebos's greatest treasures, and noteworthy souls who might attempt to escape the realm of the dead. Three-headed cerberi commonly serve demons, but if left to their own devices, they often herd wily souls into labyrinthine Underworld wildernesses, then hunt them for sport.": "三头蛇居住在冥界深处。他们可怕而狡猾，守卫着冥界各区之间的门户，守卫着埃里伯斯最伟大的宝藏，守卫着那些可能试图逃离亡灵界的值得注意的灵魂。三头蛇通常为恶魔服务，但如果让它们自己去做，它们往往会把狡猾的灵魂赶到迷宫般的冥界荒野中，然后猎杀它们为乐。",

	"Woe striders form from the souls of those who've broken the bonds of destiny. Over centuries, these cosmic blasphemers transform into hunched, long-limbed horrors. Sadistic things, woe striders seek ways to reweave themselves into the tapestry of destiny. This leads them to search for answers within the bowels of other beings, performing murderous haruspicy in pursuit of their discarded cosmic purpose. When they fail to find answers, their unnatural cries cause reality to shudder, undermining magic and sane minds alike.": "悲哀的流浪者从那些打破命运束缚的人的灵魂中形成。几个世纪以来，这些宇宙亵渎者变成了驼背、长肢的恐怖。悲惨的事情，悲惨流浪者寻求方法将自己重新编织到命运的织锦中。这导致他们在其他生物的肠子里寻找答案，在追求他们被遗弃的宇宙目的时进行谋杀性的haruspicy。当他们找不到答案时，他们非自然的叫声会使现实颤抖，破坏魔法和理智的头脑。"
