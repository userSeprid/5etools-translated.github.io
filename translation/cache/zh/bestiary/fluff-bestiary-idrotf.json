	"In her first form, Auril appears as a hunched, 7-foot-tall biped with the head of a snowy owl, black talons, cloven hooves, and grayish-white wolf fur covering her body from the neck down. Protruding from her feathery owl's head is a pair of curved goat horns. A cloak and cowl made of pristine white snow conceals much of her tripartite form, which her worshipers refer to as the Cold Crone. This cloak can transform into a pair of owl's wings when Auril sees fit.": "在她的第一形态中，欧瑞尔出现在一个驼背的、7英尺高的双足动物身上，她有一个雪白的猫头鹰的头，黑色的爪子，蹄子，灰白色的狼毛从脖子以下覆盖她的身体。从她那羽翼丰满的猫头鹰头上伸出来的是一对弯曲的山羊角。一件由纯白的雪制成的斗篷和罩子掩盖了她三方的大部分形态，她的崇拜者称其为冷酷的老妪。当奥里尔认为合适时，这件斗篷可以转化为一对猫头鹰的翅膀。",
	"Auril's second form, known to her worshipers as Lady Icekiss or the Brittle Maiden, is that of a 10-foot-tall woman of fearsome aspect made entirely of ice and frost.

When she moves, her body crackles.": "欧里尔的第二种形态，被她的崇拜者称为 \"Icekiss女士 \"或 \"脆皮少女\"，是一个10英尺高的女人，她的可怕之处完全由冰和霜构成。她的眼睛燃烧着冰冷的蓝光，周围形成薄薄的雾状斗篷。冰刃从她的身体里以奇怪的角度生长出来，在它们变得太长之前就会断掉。当她移动时，她的身体发出噼啪声。",

Avarice didn't know who or what the Black Sword was until she was approached by cultists of Levistus bearing swordlike shards of chardalyn worn as pendants around their necks. These self-styled Knights of the Black Sword offered her sanctuary in the keep of Caer-Dineval, where they are based.

	"Months before Ythryn's fall, a circle of mages known as the Telepathic Pentacle tried to fuse their minds together to become a conjoined telepathic force.

Tomb tappers can dig through earth and rock with their claws or use their metal sledgehammers to shatter rock when needed. They absorb water through their skin and crush rock with their jaws to extract mineral sustenance. They can also digest iron from blood and marrow, if mineral-rich rock is unavailable.": "创造这些生物的尼德兰奥术师称他们为 \"thaluud\"，意思是 \"无面\"。这些无性无毛的战士由魔法和土元素融合而成，每个人都有15到21英尺高，拥有对魔法的渴望、继承的记忆（由创造他们时牺牲的灵魂的回忆组成）以及对非人类施法生物的疯狂憎恨。盗墓者可以用他们的爪子挖开泥土和岩石，或者在需要时用他们的金属大锤击碎岩石。它们通过皮肤吸收水分，用颚部压碎岩石以提取矿物养料。如果没有富含矿物质的岩石，它们还可以从血液和骨髓中消化铁。",

	"Since arriving in Icewind Dale, Vellynne has secured the services of six {@creature Icewind Kobold|IDRotF|Icewind kobolds} that act as her valets and guides.
