They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.": "在为Aaqa的风之公爵服务时，Aarakocra在各星球上寻找元素邪恶的神庙。他们监视着邪恶的元素生物，然后要么与这些生物战斗，要么向风公爵报告。",
	"On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind-unburdened and ever moving-yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.": "在物质界，阿拉科克拉在最高的山峰上建立了一个空洞，特别是在通往空气元素界的门户附近的山峰。在这样的高度上，阿拉科克拉人观察着元素入侵的迹象，以及对他们的母体世界的新生威胁。Aarakocra更喜欢像风一样生活--没有负担和不断移动--但他们会监视一个地区很多年，如果这是为了防止元素邪恶的入侵。",

In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.": "Aarakocra没有政治边界或财产所有权的概念，宝石、黄金和其他珍贵材料的价值对Aarakocra来说意义不大。在他们眼里，一个生物应该使用必要的东西，然后把剩下的东西扔到风中供别人使用。",

A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplanar war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty {@i Rod of Law}. In a battle against the queen's greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear.

	"Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest.

Aboleths have never forgotten.": "在诸神到来之前，阿波勒斯潜伏在原始海洋和地下湖泊中。他们用自己的思想伸出手来，控制了凡人界新兴的生命形式，使这些生物成为他们的奴隶。他们的统治地位使他们像神一样。然后，真正的神出现了，粉碎了亚博莱思的帝国，并释放了他们的奴隶。Aboleths从未忘记。",

	" Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.": " Aboleths居住在水的环境中，包括海洋深渊、深湖和水元素界。在这些领域和与之相邻的土地上，阿波勒斯就像神一样，要求他们的臣民进行崇拜和顺从。当他们吞噬其他生物时，boleths将猎物的知识和经验加入他们永恒的记忆。Aboleths使用他们的心灵感应能力来阅读生物的思想，并了解他们的欲望。Aboleth利用这些知识来获得生物的忠诚，承诺满足这些欲望以换取服从。在它的巢穴中，阿波勒斯可以进一步使用它的力量来超越感官，给予生物，比如它的追随者，承诺的奖励的幻觉。",
	"The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die.

	"Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.": "即使像他们一样长寿，所有的龙最终都必须死亡。这种想法对许多龙来说并不合适，其中一些龙允许自己被死灵能量和古老的仪式转化为强大的不死龙人。只有最自恋的龙才会选择这条道路，因为他们知道这样做会切断与他们的亲属和龙神的所有联系。",
	"A dracolich retains its shape and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence of its undead mind.": "德拉科维奇在变身后会保持其形状和大小，它的皮肤和鳞片会紧紧地贴在骨头上，或者剥落下来，留下一个骨架形状。它的眼睛就像漂浮在阴暗的眼眶中的发光点，暗示着它不死之心的恶毒。",
	"Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.": "虽然许多龙都追求破坏和统治的虚荣目标，但龙族比最邪恶的龙更邪恶，他们被驱使着去统治所有的人。德拉科利奇是一个聪明绝顶的暴君，它制定了复杂的邪恶计划网，吸引了以贪婪和权力欲望为动机的仆人。德拉科里奇在阴影中行动，并积极策划保持其存在的秘密，是一个狡猾而富有挑战性的敌人。",
	"Creating a dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon's bones.": "创造一个龙人需要龙和一群能够进行适当仪式的法师或邪教徒的合作。在仪式中，龙会喝下一种有毒的饮料，瞬间将其杀死。然后，随行的法术师将其灵魂捕获，并将其转移到一块特殊的宝石上，该宝石的功能类似于巫师的法器。当龙的肉体腐烂时，宝石中的灵魂就会回到龙的骨头上，使其充满活力。",
	"If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.": "如果龙的身体形态被摧毁，只要两者在同一平面上，它的精神就会回到宝石中。如果宝石接触到另一个龙的尸体，龙的精神可以占有该尸体，成为一个新的龙。如果龙族的精神宝石被带到另一个位面，当龙族的不死之身被摧毁时，龙族的精神就无处可去，只能进入来世。",
	"Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.": "只有古老或成年的真龙才能转化为龙人。试图变身的年轻龙会死亡，其他不是真龙但拥有龙型的生物也会死亡，比如假龙和狼人。影龙不能被转化为龙族，因为它已经失去了太多的身体形态。",
	"When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.": "当龙变成龙族时，除了以下描述外，它保留了它的统计数据。龙失去了任何特质，比如两栖的特质，这些特质具有活体的生理特征。龙可能会保留或失去它的任何或所有巢穴行动，或继承新的行动，这由DM决定。",

Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.": "恐龙，或称巨兽，是世界上最古老的爬行动物之一。掠食性恐龙是野蛮的、领土性的猎手。食草恐龙的攻击性较弱，但它们可能会为了保护自己的孩子，或在受到惊吓或骚扰时进行攻击。",
	"Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.": "恐龙有许多大小和形状。较大的品种通常有单调的颜色，而较小的恐龙则有类似鸟类的彩色斑纹。恐龙游荡在人类很少去的崎岖和孤立的地区，包括偏远的山沟、难以到达的高原、热带岛屿和深海沼泽。",
	"An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults or negative observations.

Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast.": "雄鼻兽考验祈求者的勇气和胆量，不仅强迫他们完成任务，而且还发出可怕的吼声，使附近的生物感到恐惧和震耳欲聋，回响数英里。那些通过测试的人可能会得到一个英雄盛宴的奖励。",

Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.": " 凡人遇到狮身人面像最常见的是在古墓和废墟中，但有些狮身人面像可以进入星外的领域。与狮身人面像的对话开始于翻滚的石墙之间，可能会突然转移到一个陌生的地方，比如一个真人大小的游戏盘或一个必须在呼啸的风暴中攀登的令人生畏的悬崖。有时，狮身人面像必须从这样一个超维空间被召唤出来，祈求者从它的空巢中召唤它。只有那些斯芬克斯认为有价值的人才能进入它的领域。",

This crafting process limits the growth of the azer population and is the primary reason that these creatures remain rare.": " 阿兹尔人不会繁殖。他们每个人都是由另一个阿泽尔用青铜制作的，并被灌注了制作者的一部分内在火焰。每个阿兹尔都被雕刻出独特的特征。这种制作过程限制了阿兹尔人口的增长，也是这些生物保持稀有的主要原因。",
	"Azers dwell in a kingdom on the border between the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Elemental Plane of Fire-a range of mountains and volcanoes whose spires rise as a series of fortresses. Beneath mountain peaks, under volcanic calderas, and amid rivers of magma, azers extract gleaming metals and glittering gems from the earth. Squads of azer patrol the passes and tunnels of their realm, fending off the salamander raiders whose efreet masters order strikes against the azer kingdom.": "阿泽尔人居住在土元素界和火元素界交界处的一个王国--一个由山脉和火山组成的范围，其尖顶像一系列的堡垒一样耸立。在山峰下，在火山口下，在岩浆河中，阿兹尔人从地球上提取闪亮的金属和闪亮的宝石。一队队的阿兹尔人在他们的王国的通道和隧道里巡逻，抵御蝾螈的袭击者，他们的埃弗里特主人命令对阿兹尔王国进行袭击。",
	"Long ago, the efreet and the azers were allies. Azers helped create the City of Brass, forging that home of the efreet into one of the most wondrous places in creation. When the azers had finished their work, the efreet betrayed them, making a failed attempt to enslave the azers so as to protect the secrets of the city. Despite occasional raids and skirmishes, however, the two sides have so far refrained from all-out conflict. The azers believe that only the threat of them revealing the hidden ways into the City of Brass keeps the efreet in check.": "很久以前，伊弗里特人和阿泽尔人是盟友。阿泽尔人帮助创建了黄铜城，将伊夫里特人的家园锻造成了造物中最奇妙的地方之一。当阿兹尔人完成他们的工作后，伊夫里特人背叛了他们，试图奴役阿兹尔人以保护城市的秘密，但没有成功。尽管偶尔会有突袭和小规模的冲突，但双方至今都没有发生全面的冲突。阿兹尔人认为，只有他们透露进入黄铜之城的隐秘途径的威胁才能使伊夫里特人受到控制。",
	"Azers are masterful artisans, and create beautiful works from the gems and precious metals found in their volcanic habitat. They rate the value of such treasures above all other things, sometimes dispatching parties across the planes to seek out rare metals and gemstones.": "阿泽尔人是高超的工匠，他们用在火山栖息地发现的宝石和贵重金属创造出美丽的作品。他们把这种宝物的价值看得高于一切，有时会派人到各星球去寻找稀有金属和宝石。",
	"When azers are called by magic to the Material Plane, it is typically to help forge an elaborate magic item or work of art, for it is said that their skill in such craft knows no equal.": "当阿兹尔被魔法召唤到物质世界时，通常是为了帮助锻造一个精致的魔法物品或艺术品，因为据说他们在这种工艺方面的技能是无人能及的。",
	"An azer doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "Azer不需要食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them.": "Balors是古老而可怕的邪恶人物，他们作为将军统治着恶魔的军队，渴望夺取权力，同时摧毁任何反对他们的生物。",
	"Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of fire that can destroy even the hardiest foes.": "挥舞着火焰鞭子和一把长剑，引导着风暴的力量，巴洛尔的战斗力是由仇恨和愤怒推动的。它在死亡的时候会引导这种恶魔般的愤怒，在火焰的爆炸中倒下，甚至可以摧毁最顽强的敌人。",
	"Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.": "土匪以帮派形式游荡，有时由暴徒、老兵或施法者领导。并非所有土匪都是邪恶的。压迫、干旱、疾病或饥荒往往会驱使其他诚实的人过上强盗的生活。",
	"Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.": "海盗是公海上的匪徒。他们可能是只对财宝和谋杀感兴趣的自由盗贼，也可能是由王室批准的袭击和掠夺敌人国家船只的私掠者。",
	"It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades.": "要让一帮强盗保持一致，需要强大的个性、无情的狡猾和银色的舌头。土匪头子就具备这些素质。",
	"In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.": "除了管理一帮自私自利的恶棍之外，海盗船长也是强盗船长的变种，要保护和指挥一艘船。为了让船员们保持一致，船长必须定期进行奖惩。",
	"More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.": "比起财宝，强盗船长或海盗船长更渴望声名狼藉。一个迎合船长的虚荣心或自尊心的囚犯比一个不知道或声称不知道船长的多彩名声的囚犯更有可能得到公平对待。",
	"When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.": "当夜幕降临时，倒霉的旅行者会听到绝望的死者的微弱哭声。这种悲惨的灵魂是女妖，一种由女性精灵的灵魂形成的可憎的生物。女妖以发光的、飘忽不定的形式出现，依稀可以看出其凡人的特征。女妖的脸被疯狂的头发缠绕着，它的身体披着飘忽不定的破布，在它周围飘动和流动。",
	"Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the living. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes their transformation into undead monsters.": "女妖是精灵的不死残余，她们被赋予了巨大的美貌，却没有利用她们的天赋为世界带来欢乐。相反，他们利用自己的美貌来腐蚀和控制他人。遭受女妖诅咒的精灵们不会体验到快乐，在活人面前只感到痛苦。随着诅咒造成的损失，他们的思想和身体都会腐烂，直到死亡使他们完成了向不死怪物的转变。",
	"A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every moment of its life with perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for its doom.": "女妖将永远被束缚在其死亡的地方，无法冒险离开那里超过五英里。它被迫以完美的回忆重温其生命中的每一刻，但始终拒绝为自己的死亡负责。",
	"The vanity that inspired the banshee's cursed creation persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine jewelery, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to see the horror of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.": "激发女妖受诅咒的创作的虚荣心在未死时依然存在。这些生物觊觎美丽的物品：精美的珠宝、绘画、雕像和其他艺术物品。同时，女妖厌恶任何镜面，因为它不能忍受看到自己存在的恐怖。只要看到自己的一瞥，就足以让女妖陷入愤怒。",
	"A banshee doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "女妖不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.": "带刺魔鬼是一种贪婪和欲望无度的生物，它是九层地狱中更强大的居民及其金库的守卫。带刺魔鬼像一个高大的人形生物，身上长满了锋利的倒钩、刺和钩子，它有一双闪闪发光的眼睛，时刻注意着它可能为自己索取的物品和生物。当胜利带来回报时，这些恶魔欢迎任何战斗的机会。",
	"Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.": "带刺魔鬼以警觉性高而著称，这使得他们难以出其不意，他们不厌其烦地履行自己的职责，也不分心。它们用锋利的爪子作为武器，或者向试图逃离它们的敌人投掷火焰球。",
	"The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.": "巴尔古拉代表着深渊的野蛮和残暴。巴尔古拉成群结队，打倒更强悍的敌人，保留他们胜利后的可怕战利品，并用这些物品装饰他们的领土。",
	"A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.": "巴尔古拉看起来像一只笨重的猩猩，有一个可怕的、下垂的面孔，下颚有獠牙突出。它身高不到8英尺，肩部宽阔，体重达650磅。它沿着地面猿猴般地移动，但它以极快的速度和敏捷性爬行。",
	"Travelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby.": "旅行者有时会发现一些物体，它们看起来就像栩栩如生的野生动物石雕的碎片。缺少的部分似乎是被咬掉的。经验丰富的探险家将这些遗物视为警告，因为他们知道创造它们的玄武岩可能就在附近。",
	"Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.": "Basilisks在干旱、温带或热带气候下生长。它们在山洞或其他有遮挡的地方筑巢。最常见的情况是，巴西利亚人在地下遇到。",
	"A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.": "在人工饲养下出生和长大的巴斯里斯克可以被驯化和训练。这样的训练有素的巴斯里斯克知道如何避免与它的主人希望保护的人对视，但它是一个令人生畏的守护神兽。由于这种用途，巴斯里斯克的蛋被高度珍视。",
	"Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk's gullet.": "玄武岩对于狩猎生物来说是深思熟虑的，但它们不需要追赶猎物。遇到巴斯里斯克超自然的目光，就足以影响它的快速转变，将受害者变成多孔的石头。玄武岩，以其强壮的下颚，能够吞噬石头。石头在巴斯里斯克的口中恢复到有机形态。",
	"Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return {@condition petrified} creatures to flesh and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain absent if the creature revives. Revivification using the oil is impossible if a vital part of the {@condition petrified} creature, such as its head, is detached.": "据说有些炼金术士知道如何处理巴斯里斯克的胃和其中的液体。如果处理得当，胃口会产生一种油，可以让生物恢复肉体和生命（%0%）。不幸的是，对于这样的受害者来说，如果该生物复活，在石头形态下失去的任何部分仍然不存在。如果(1%)的生物的重要部分，例如它的头，脱离了，那么使用这种油就不可能复活了。",
	"Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.": "有胡子的魔鬼为大魔鬼服务，作为突击队，肩并肩地战斗，陶醉于战斗的荣耀。他们用暴力来回应任何轻视，不管是真实的还是想象的，当他们的地狱锯齿状玻璃刀在他们的敌人身上开出一条路时，他们就会大吃大喝起来。",
	"A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skin, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.": "胡子魔鬼是人形的，有尖尖的耳朵，有鳞片的皮肤，有长长的尾巴，还有清楚地显示其恶魔本性的爪子。这些魔鬼的名字来自于他们下巴上长出的像蛇一样的东西，他们用这些东西来鞭打和毒害敌人，用毒液削弱他们的力量。",
	"The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes are constricted in its coils and eaten alive.": "蛇形的贝希尔沿着地板爬行，并爬上墙壁以接近它的猎物。它的闪电气息可以焚烧大多数生物，即使是更强大的敌人也会被它的线圈束缚住并被活活吃掉。",
	"A behir's monstrous form resembles a combination of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on its underside.": "贝希尔的畸形形态类似于蜈蚣和鳄鱼的组合。它的鳞片皮的颜色从群青色到深蓝色不等，在它的底部渐渐变成淡蓝色。",
	"Behirs lair in places inaccessible to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a behir ambush. A behir's dozen legs allow it to scramble through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and slithering like a snake.": "贝希尔在其他生物无法进入的地方筑巢，喜欢那些可能的入侵者必须经过艰苦的攀爬才能到达的地方。深坑、崖壁上的高洞以及只能通过狭窄、曲折的隧道到达的洞穴，都是贝希尔伏击的主要地点。一个behir的十几条腿使它能够轻松地爬过它的巢穴地点。不爬的时候，它通过把腿折叠在身体旁边，像蛇一样滑行，移动得更快。",
	"Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders in its lair might overlook it.": "猎物被整个吞下，之后在消化过程中进入休眠期。在休眠期间，贝希尔会选择一个隐藏的地方，在那里它的巢穴的入侵者可能会忽略它。",
	"In times long forgotten, giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind.": "在被遗忘已久的时代，巨人和巨龙进行着似乎无休止的战争。风暴巨人创造了第一批贝希尔，作为对抗龙的武器，而贝希尔对龙族保持着天然的仇恨。",
	"A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if the dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behir back down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.": "贝里尔从不在它知道有龙居住的地方筑巢。如果有龙试图在贝里尔巢穴的几十英里范围内建立巢穴，贝里尔会被迫杀死龙或将其赶走。只有当龙被证明过于强大而无法战斗时，贝希尔才会退缩，在很远的地方寻找一个新的巢穴地点。",
	"One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.": "只要看一眼，就足以评估其肮脏和异世界的性质。侵略性、憎恨和贪婪，这些反常者将所有其他生物视为低等生物，随意玩弄或摧毁它们。",
	"A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.": "看守者的球状身体随时都会悬浮起来，它巨大的隆起的眼睛坐落在宽大的、有齿的大嘴之上，而它身体上的小眼柄则扭曲和转动，以保持它的敌人在视线内。当看守者睡觉时，它会闭上它的中心眼，但让它的小眼睛睁开并保持警惕。",
	"Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.": "敌人比比皆是，或者说每个看客都这么认为。看守者确信其他生物因为他们的光辉和魔力而憎恨他们，即使他们把那些较小的生物视为粗鲁和恶心。看待者总是怀疑其他人在密谋对付他们，即使周围没有其他生物。",
	"The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.": "一个看守者对其他生物的蔑视也延伸到其他看守者。每个人都认为自己的形态是一种理想，任何偏离这种形态的行为都是对其种族纯洁性的一种缺陷。看守者的身体形态差异很大，因此他们之间的冲突不可避免。有些变形金刚被重叠的几丁质板所保护。有些则有光滑的皮毛。有些人的眼柄像触角一样蠕动，而另一些人的眼柄则有甲壳类动物的关节。即使是皮肤颜色上的细微差别，也能使两个人变成终生的敌人。",
	"Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.": "一些眼球持有者设法将他们的排外倾向转化为可怕的专制主义。这些被恰当地命名为眼球暴君的人并没有与世隔绝，而是奴役那些其他生物，建立并控制庞大的帝国。一个眼球暴君有时会在一个主要城市内或地下开辟出一个领域，指挥着代表其主人的代理人网络。",
	"Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.": "因为他们拒绝与他人分享领地，所以大多数beholder都撤回到寒冷的山丘、废弃的废墟和深邃的洞穴中进行谋划。一个Beholder的巢穴是由它的分解眼射线雕刻出来的，强调垂直通道，连接堆叠在一起的房间。这样的环境允许看守者自由移动，即使它阻止了入侵者轻易地爬行。当入侵者真的闯入时，其开放的天花板的高度允许看守者漂浮起来，在地板上骚扰敌人。",
	"As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including {@condition petrified} adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.": "就像它们的创造者一样，持灵者的巢穴中的房间反映了这种生物的傲慢。它用它赢得的战利品来装饰它的房间，包括{@condition petrified}站在他们惊恐的最后时刻的冒险者，其他持灵者的碎片，以及从强大的敌人手中夺取的魔法物品。一个持有者以其获得的东西来判断自己的价值，它从不愿意与它的宝物分开。",
	"A beholder's central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).": "看守者的中心巢穴通常是一个宽敞的大洞穴，天花板很高，在那里它可以毫无顾忌地进行攻击，而不用担心接近近战范围。在巢穴中遇到的Beholder的挑战等级为14（11,500XP）。",
	"Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable berserkers come together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.": "来自未开化的土地，不可预知的狂暴者聚集在一起组成战队，在他们能找到的地方寻求冲突。",
	"The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.": "黑龙是色龙中脾气最坏、最卑鄙的，它收集堕落民族的残骸和财物。这些龙厌恶看到弱者的繁荣，并为人形王国的崩溃而感到高兴。它们把自己的家安在潮湿的沼泽地和王国曾经存在的摇摇欲坠的废墟上。",
	"With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.": "黑龙有深陷的眼睛和宽大的鼻孔，它的脸就像一个头骨。它弯曲的、分段式的角在靠近底部时是骨色的，在角的顶端会变暗，变成死黑色。随着黑龙的衰老，它的角和颧骨周围的肉会像被酸吃掉一样变质，留下薄薄的皮层，增强其骨骼的外观。黑龙的头部有尖刺和角的标志。它的舌头是平的，顶端分叉，流着粘液，其酸性气味使龙的腐烂植物和臭水的气味更加浓郁。",
	"When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.": "当黑龙孵化时，它有光亮的黑色鳞片。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片变得更厚、更暗淡，帮助它融入沼泽地和被炸毁的废墟中，这是它的家。",
	"All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.": "所有的色龙都是邪恶的，但黑龙因其虐待狂的本性而与众不同。黑龙的生活就是看着它的猎物乞求怜悯，并经常在结束它的敌人之前提供一个喘息或逃跑的假象。",
	"A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.": "黑龙首先攻击它最弱小的敌人，确保快速和残酷的胜利，这使它的自尊心得到加强，因为它使剩下的敌人感到害怕。在失败的边缘，黑龙会尽其所能拯救自己，但在允许任何其他生物对其进行控制之前，它接受了死亡。",
	"Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.": "黑龙讨厌并害怕其他龙。它们从远处窥探龙族的对手，寻找机会杀死较弱的龙，避开较强的龙。如果有更强的龙威胁到它，黑龙就会放弃它的巢穴，寻找新的领地。",
	"Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.": "邪恶的蜥蜴人崇敬并服务于黑龙，他们掠夺人形定居点的财宝和食物作为贡品，并沿着龙族主人的领地边界建造粗陋的龙族雕像。",
	"A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.": "黑龙的恶意影响还可能导致自发地创造出邪恶的晃动土丘，寻找并杀死接近龙巢的善良生物。",
	"Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.": "哥布林像害虫一样在许多黑龙的巢穴中出没。他们变得和他们的黑暗主人一样残忍，经常用蜈蚣咬和蝎子刺来折磨和削弱俘虏，然后再把他们送去满足龙的饥渴。",
	"Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.": "黑龙囤积着崩溃的帝国和被征服的王国的财宝和魔法物品，以提醒自己的伟大。龙的文明越多，它就越觉得有资格为自己索取当前文明的财富。",
	"Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.": "黑龙居住在文明边缘的沼泽地。黑龙的巢穴是一个阴暗的洞穴、石窟或废墟，至少部分被水淹没，提供龙休息的水池，以及它的受害者可以发酵的地方。巢穴里到处都是以前受害者的酸蚀骨头和新杀的苍蝇尸体，由摇摇欲坠的雕像看管。蜈蚣、蝎子和蛇在巢穴里出没，巢穴里充满了死亡和腐烂的臭味。",

	"Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks.": "渗水虫在黑暗中茁壮成长，避开强光和极端温度的区域。它们在潮湿的地下流动，以任何可以溶解的生物或物体为食，沿着地面滑行，从墙壁和天花板上滴下，在地下水池的边缘蔓延，并从裂缝中挤入。",
	"The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.": "冒险者收到的第一个警告，往往是它的酸性触摸带来的灼热疼痛。渗水者被运动和温暖所吸引。有机物能滋养它们，当猎物匮乏时，它们以污垢、真菌和内脏为食。资深的探险家们知道，一个干净的通道很可能是一种迹象，表明附近有渗出物栖息。",
	" An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.": " 渗出物会慢慢杀死它的猎物。有些品种，如黑色布丁和胶状方块，会吞噬生物以防止逃跑。这种折磨人的死亡的唯一好处是，受害者的战友可以在太晚之前赶来救援。",
	"Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.": "由于并不是每只敖包都能消化每一种物质，有些敖包的颤抖的身体里悬浮着硬币、金属装备、骨头和其他碎片。一个被杀的渗水者可以为其杀手提供丰富的财宝。",
	"Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.": "无论这是否属实，无面者之王是少数能控制ozes并给它们注入适度智慧的生命之一。大多数时候，ozes没有战术或自我保护的意识。它们是直接的、可预测的，攻击和吃东西都不狡猾。在Juiblex的控制下，它们表现出一丝有意识和邪恶的意图。",
	" Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.": " 虽然渗水虫缺乏与其他生物结盟的智慧，但其他了解渗水虫需要进食的生物可能会把它引诱到一个对它们有用的地方。聪明的怪物会在周围养一些渗水体来保卫通道或消耗垃圾。同样地，也可以引诱渗水者进入坑道陷阱，让捕捉者经常喂食它，以防止它来追杀他们。狡猾的生物在战略区域放置火把和燃烧的火炉，以劝阻渗水者离开某个特定的通道或房间。",
	" According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.": " 根据Iggwilv的Demonomicon和其他资料，ozes是散落的碎片或恶魔领主Juiblex的后代。",
	" An ooze doesn't require sleep.": " 渗出物不需要睡眠。",
	"A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.": "眨眼狗的名字来自于它的眨眼能力，它用这种能力来帮助其攻击和避免伤害。眨眼狗对流离失所的野兽怀有长期的仇恨，一见到它们就会攻击。",

Blood hawks flock together in large numbers, attacking as a pack to take down prey.": "血鹰的名字来自于它深红色的羽毛和好斗的天性，它无所畏惧地攻击几乎所有的动物，用它匕首般的喙来刺杀它们。血鹰大量聚集在一起，作为一个群体攻击，以拿下猎物。",
	"Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.": "虚荣心和领土意识，蓝龙在沙漠的天空中翱翔，捕食商队，掠夺沙漠以外的青翠土地上的畜群和定居点。这些龙也可以在干燥的大草原、灼热的坏境和岩石海岸找到。它们守护着自己的领地，防止所有潜在的竞争者，尤其是黄铜龙。",

	"A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.": "蓝龙的鳞片颜色各异，从五彩斑斓的天蓝色到深邃的靛蓝色，被沙漠中的沙子打磨成光亮的表面。随着龙的年龄增长，它的鳞片会变得更厚更硬，它的皮会发出嗡嗡声和静电的噼啪声。当龙生气或要攻击时，这些效果就会加强，散发出臭氧和灰尘的气味。",
	"A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.": "蓝龙不会容忍任何关于它软弱或低劣的评论或影射，它非常乐于将自己的力量凌驾于人类和其他较小的生物之上。",

	"Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.": "虽然它们有时会吃仙人掌和其他沙漠植物来满足它们巨大的饥饿感，但蓝龙是食肉动物。它们更喜欢吃群居动物，在大快朵颐之前用它们的闪电气息烹饪这些生物。它们的饮食习惯使蓝龙成为沙漠商队和游牧部落的巨大威胁，在龙的眼里，这些商队和部落都是方便的食物和财宝的集合体。",
	"When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.": "狩猎时，蓝龙把自己埋在沙漠的沙子里，只有鼻子上的角露出水面，看起来就像一块突出的石头。当猎物靠近时，龙就会站起来，在攻击时，沙子会像雪崩一样从它的翅膀上涌出。",

Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.": "蓝龙垂涎有价值和有才华的生物，他们的服务能加强他们的优越感。吟游诗人、法师、艺术家、巫师和刺客都可以成为蓝龙的有价值的代理人，蓝龙会对忠诚的服务给予丰厚的回报。",
	"A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.": "蓝龙将自己的巢穴保密并保护得很好，即使是它最信任的仆人也很少被允许进入。它鼓励阿克塞斯、巨蝎和其他沙漠生物居住在它的巢穴附近，以增加安全感。年长的蓝龙有时会吸引空气元素和其他生物为其服务。",

When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.": "如果蓝龙的巢穴被入侵，它就会把构成其巢穴的洞穴弄塌。然后，龙会钻出洞穴，让攻击者被压死和窒息。当它后来回来时，它会收集它的财产--连同死去的入侵者的财富。",
	"The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them.

	"Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted.

	"A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it.

	"In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.": "为了应对元帝和纳迦人之间长期以来的冲突，元帝创造了一种亡灵仪式，可以通过将活着的纳迦变成一个骷髅般的不死仆从来阻止纳迦的复活。骨质纳迦只保留了它生前知道的一些法术。",

As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.": "黄铜龙的头部是由从其前额扩展出来的宽大的保护板和从其下巴突出的尖刺所界定的。它的脖子上有一条流苏，其渐变的翅膀一直延伸到尾巴的长度。黄铜龙的鳞片是一种暗淡的、斑驳的棕色。随着年龄的增长，龙的鳞片开始发亮，最终呈现出温暖、灼热的光泽。它的翅膀和褶皱的边缘是斑驳的绿色，随着年龄的增长而变暗。随着黄铜龙的年龄增长，它的瞳孔逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像熔化的金属球。",
	"A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it.

When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.": "黄铜龙在其漫长的一生中与数以千计的生物进行对话，积累有用的信息，并乐意分享这些信息以换取财宝。如果一个聪明的生物试图离开铜龙的存在而不进行对话，铜龙就会跟踪它。如果该生物试图用魔法或武力逃跑，龙可能会以愤怒的方式回应，用它的睡眠气体使该生物失去能力。当它醒来时，生物会发现自己被巨大的爪子钉在地上，或者被埋在沙子里，而龙对闲谈的渴求却被满足了。",

	"Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.

	"A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales.

The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.": "一个有棱有角的徽章确定了青铜龙的头部形状。弯曲的角从峰顶延伸出来，与下颌和下巴上的刺相呼应。为了帮助它们游泳，青铜龙有带蹼的脚和光滑的鳞片。青铜龙的鳞片是带有绿色的黄色；只有当龙接近成年时，它的颜色才会加深到更深、更丰富的青铜色调。青铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，直到它们像发光的绿色球体。",
	"Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely.

If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.": "青铜龙喜欢观察在其巢穴附近的海岸线上行驶的船只，有时会化身为海豚或海鸥，更仔细地检查这些船只及其船员。大胆的青铜龙可能会化身为鸟或老鼠溜上一艘船，检查船舱里的财宝。如果青铜龙发现了值得收藏的东西，它就会与船长进行交易，以获得该物品。",
	"Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.

	" Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.": " 青铜龙掠夺沉船，也从其巢穴附近的礁石和海床上收集五颜六色的珊瑚和珍珠。当青铜龙承诺帮助一支军队对暴政发动战争时，它要求得到象征性的报酬。如果这种要求超出了它的盟友的能力，它可能会以收集军事历史方面的旧书或纪念联盟的仪式物品作为补偿。青铜龙也可能对敌人持有的财宝提出要求，它认为在它的保护下会更安全。",

	"Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.": "虫熊经常与它们的表亲霍布林和地精在一起。虫熊通常会奴役他们遇到的地精，他们欺负地精给他们黄金和食物，作为侦察兵和冲击部队的回报。即使有了钱，虫熊充其量也是不可靠的盟友，然而地精和妖精明白，无论虫熊如何消耗部落的资源，这些生物都是一种强大的力量。",
	"Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.": "虫族崇拜Hruggek，他是居住在Acheron平面上的一个较小的神。在没有地精亲属的情况下，虫族组成了松散的战队，每个战队由其最凶猛的成员领导。虫人相信，当他们死后，他们的灵魂有机会在赫鲁格克身边战斗。他们试图通过击败尽可能多的敌人来证明自己的价值。",
	"Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line.

Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.": "尽管它们的身材令人生畏，但虫熊的行动却令人惊讶地隐蔽。他们喜欢设下埋伏，在不敌的情况下逃跑。只要有食物、饮料和财宝供应，它们就是可靠的雇佣兵，但当生命危在旦夕的时候，虫熊就会忘记任何纽带。一个受伤的虫族成员可能会被留下来帮助其他成员逃跑。之后，这只虫熊可能会帮助追捕者追踪它以前的同伴，如果这样做能救它的命的话。",

	"Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.": "Bulettes在捕猎时用它们强大的爪子在土里挖隧道。它们不顾阻碍，将树木连根拔起，在松散的斜坡上造成山体滑坡，并在身后留下天坑。当土壤和岩石的振动提醒布列特的运动时，它就会射向地面，在攻击时张开它的下巴。",
	"A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across.

A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.": "布莱特在温带土地上活动，以它遇到的任何动物和人形生物为食。这些生物不喜欢矮人和精灵的肉，尽管它们经常在意识到它们是什么之前就杀死它们。布里特最喜欢半身人的肉，当它在空旷的田野上追逐丰满的半身人时，从来没有比这更快乐的了。",
	"A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.": "布列塔尼没有巢穴，而是在一个宽达30英里的狩猎区漫游。它对领地的唯一标准是是否有食物，当它吃完一个地区的所有东西后，布莱特就会继续前进。这些生物经常在人形定居点附近活动，恐吓他们，直到他们惊慌失措的居民逃离，或者直到布莱特被杀死。",

Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and consumption.": "所有的生物都避开Bulettes，它们把任何会动的东西都当作食物，甚至是其他捕食者和Bulettes。猎犬只有在交配时才会聚集在一起，导致爪子和牙齿的血腥行为，通常以雄性猎犬的死亡和消耗而结束。",
	"Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, within fusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.": "一些圣人认为，布列特是一个疯狂的巫师在融合了恶魔胆汁的情况下，对鳄龟和犰狳进行杂交实验的结果。布列特在不同时期被认为已经灭绝，但在多年未见的情况下，这种生物不可避免地重新出现。由于它们的幼崽几乎从未被人看见，一些圣人怀疑Bulettes保持着秘密的巢穴，而成年的Bulettes则从那里向世界出击。",
	"Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves.

	"Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck.

	"A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.": "恶霸虫有两种方法在同类中取得进步。它可以谋杀对手，尽管它必须努力保持其犯罪行为的秘密，或者它可以找到一个宝藏或魔法物品，并将其作为贡品或向其主子表示敬意的象征。恶霸虫如果不狡猾地谋杀对手，很可能会被处死，所以恶霸虫更常见的是对商队和定居点进行突袭，目的是获得珍贵的宝物，以打动其领主，赢得他们的好感。无可避免的是，这些精美的物品会因为虐待和忽视而变成肮脏的破烂。一旦礼物失去光泽，恶霸领主总是要求其臣民带来更多的财宝作为贡品。",
	"Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.": "霸王龙最喜欢的就是霸占那些闯入他们领土的人。他们的战士试图捕获入侵者，而不是简单地杀了他们。",
	"Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its \"guests\" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.": "俘虏被拖到国王或王后面前--体型异常庞大的恶霸虫，被迫求饶。贿赂、财宝和奉承可以诱使恶霸虫统治者放走俘虏，但在它试图用它的财宝和王国的威严来打动它的 \"客人 \"之前。霸王虫统治者被深深的自卑感所打动，他们自诩为国王和王后，却极度渴望得到外人的恐惧和尊重。",
	"Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.": "霸王龙说一种语言，使它们能够像青蛙一样通过呱呱叫在大范围内交流。沼泽地里的入侵者或其他事件的消息在几分钟内就会通过这种粗糙的通信系统传播。",
	"Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.": "语言中的简单概念对青蛙和蟾蜍来说是可以理解的。霸王蛙利用这种能力与巨蛙形成牢固的联系，他们把巨蛙训练成守护者和猎手。较大的标本有时也被用来作为坐骑。青蛙整只吞下生物的能力为恶霸蛙的狩猎队提供了一种将猎物带回村庄的简单手段。",
	"A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage.": "cambion是恶魔（通常是魅魔或妖怪）和类人（通常是人类）的后代。坎比恩继承了父母双方的某些方面，但他们的角、皮质的翅膀和蜿蜒的尾巴是他们异世界的父母的标志。",
	"Cambions grow into ruthless adults whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it.": "坎比人成长为无情的成年人，他们的邪恶和变态甚至让最忠实的凡人父母感到恐惧。即使在青年时期，坎比恩也会认定自己作为凡人的霸主的合法地位。它可能会在城镇中策划起义，聚集人类和小恶魔的团伙为其服务。",
	"A cambion forced to serve its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.": "被迫为其恶魔父母服务的坎比恩是出于钦佩和恐惧，但也期望有一天它能升到一个显赫的位置。在九层地狱中长大的坎贝尔作为士兵、特使和更大的恶魔的私人随从。在深渊中，一个坎贝尔只能通过纯粹的力量和意志力来获得尽可能多的权力。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six-fingered hands, and unearthly beauty.": "恶魔领主格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）喜欢与那些与恶魔签订了契约的人类繁衍后代，他孕育了许多帮助他在多元宇宙中播种混乱的cambions。这些cambions的特点是炭黑的皮肤、蹄子、六指的手和超凡脱俗的美貌。",
	"Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.": "腐尸爬虫从尸体上搜出腐烂的肉，并吞食残留的粘稠的骨头。它们积极地攻击任何闯入它们领地或打扰它们进食的生物。",
	"A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.": "腐肉爬虫循着死亡的气味找到它的食物，但它更喜欢不与其他食腐动物竞争。因此，这些肮脏的生物蜷缩在死亡多的地方，而其他食腐动物的流动性有限。洞穴、下水道、地牢和森林沼泽是它们最喜欢的巢穴，但腐尸爬行者也会被吸引到战场和墓地。腐尸爬行者在狩猎中漫游，它的触角在空气中探寻血腥或腐烂的气味。在隧道或废墟中，腐尸爬虫在走向食物时，会在天花板上乱窜。通过这种方式，它们可以避免接触到渗出物、Otyughs和其他黑暗中的危险居民，甚至让那些没有想到要抬头看的潜在食物感到惊讶。",
	"Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.": "无论是在地下的黑暗中，还是在夜间狩猎时，光线都是潜在的食物的信号。腐肉爬虫可能会从远处跟踪一个光源几个小时，希望能闻到血的气味。尽管腐肉爬虫的体型很大，但它们也可以很容易地设下埋伏，在盲目的角落里等待猎物来找它们。当面对潜在的猎物或入侵者时，腐尸爬虫会让它的毒药发挥作用。一旦受害者因麻痹而变得僵硬，腐尸爬虫就会用它的触手将其包裹起来，并将其拖到高处的壁架或孤立的通道，在那里可以安全地将其杀死。然后，这只怪物继续在其领地上巡逻，同时等待它的食物成熟。",
	"I hear centaurs make excellent mounts!": "我听说半人马是很好的坐骑!",

	"Centaur migrations span continents and take decades to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread the same path for generations. These long-ranging patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter settlements of other creatures built along their traditional routes.": "半人马的迁徙跨越大陆，需要几十年的时间来重复，所以一个半人马部落可能几代人都不会重走同样的道路。当半人马遇到其他生物在其传统路线上建造的定居点时，这些长距离的模式会导致冲突。",
	"A centaur that can't keep pace with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe might take up residence among other races. Frontier settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur residents. Many such communities owe their survival to the insight and acumen of a centaur.": "一个半人马如果不能跟上其他部落的步伐，就会被甩在后面。一些这样的半人马消失在荒野中，再也见不到了。那些能够忍受失去部落的人可能会在其他种族中居住。边疆定居点重视半人马居民的自然知识。许多这样的社区的生存归功于半人马的洞察力和敏锐度。",
	"Despite their reclusive nature, centaurs trade with elves and with the caravans of other benevolent humanoids they meet during their wanderings. A trader might save the life of a wounded or an elderly centaur unfit for long travel, escorting it to a settlement where it can peacefully live out the rest of its days.": "尽管半人马生性孤僻，但他们与精灵和其他仁慈的人类商队进行贸易，他们在漫游中遇到了这些商队。商人可能会救一个受伤的或不适合长途旅行的半人马，护送它到一个定居点，让它安然度过余生。",
	"This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.": "这个不祥的恶魔像裹尸布一样戴着链子。链魔用它可怕的目光驱赶着面前的低等生物，使覆盖在它身上的链子以及附近的无生命的链子都有了活力，这些链子长出了钩子、刀片和尖刺，可以将敌人斩杀。",
	"Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.": "链魔在地狱界充当虐待狂的狱卒和折磨者，以痛苦为乐，以折磨他人为生。他们被要求折磨被困在九层地狱的凡人灵魂，将他们的虐待狂怒气施加在这些灵魂所表现出来的可怕的雷姆身上。",
	"This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable crossing of humanoid and fly. A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the approach of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack.": "这种令人厌恶的恶魔类似于一种难以言喻的人形和苍蝇的混合体。查斯梅用四条骨瘦如柴的腿来回走动，可以在墙壁和天花板上找到支撑。在chasme接近之前，会有一阵阵沉闷的声音，给敌人带来可怕的昏睡感，让他们有机会受到攻击。",
	"The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to dole out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of reprisal.": "卑微的查斯米为更强大的主人服务，作为审讯者或任务负责人。查斯姆以施展酷刑为生，并善于发现那些抛弃主人的恶魔。捕获并归还这些叛徒可以让查斯梅在不担心报复的情况下对受害者进行折磨。",
	"Chimeras were created after mortals summoned Demogorgon to the world. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded it, transformed them into horrific, multi-headed monstrosities. This act gave rise to the first chimeras.": "嵌合体是在凡人将德摩根召唤到这个世界后产生的。恶魔王子对周围的生物不以为然，将它们变成了可怕的多头怪物。这一行为催生了第一批嵌合体。",
	"Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera serves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to the Material Plane. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large goat, the forequarters of a lion, and the leathery wings of a dragon, along with the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise its victims, swooping down from the sky and engulfing prey with its fiery breath before landing.": "奇美拉被赋予了恶魔的残忍，它是恶魔王子找到物质世界的途径时的一个严峻的提醒。典型的奇美拉有大山羊的后躯，狮子的前躯，龙的皮翼，以及这三种生物的头。这种怪物喜欢给受害者一个惊喜，从空中俯冲而下，在落地前用火热的气息吞噬猎物。",
	"A chimera combines the worst aspects of its three parts. Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death. These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns. When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.": "奇美拉结合了其三个部分的最坏方面。它的龙首驱使它突袭、掠夺和积累大量的囤积物。它的龙性迫使它猎杀威胁其领土的强大生物。它的山羊头赋予它恶毒、顽固的性格，迫使它战斗到死。这三个方面促使奇美拉划定一个宽达10英里的领土。它以野生动物为食，将更多强大的生物视为需要羞辱和击败的对手。它最大的对手是龙、狮鹫、曼蒂克龙、Perytons和翼龙。当它狩猎时，奇美拉会寻找简单的方法来消遣自己。它喜欢弱小生物的恐惧和痛苦。这种怪物经常玩弄它的猎物，过早地中断攻击，让一个生物受伤和惊恐，然后再回来把它干掉。",
	"Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts. If offered food and treasure, a chimera might spare a traveler. A villain can lure a chimera into service by keeping it well fed and its treasure hoard well stocked.": "虽然奇美拉远非狡猾，但他们的龙族自我意识使他们容易受到奉承和礼物的影响。如果提供食物和财宝，奇美拉可能会放过一个旅行者。恶棍可以引诱奇美拉为其服务，让它吃饱喝足，让它的财宝囤积起来。",
	"The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.": "黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙代表了龙族的邪恶面。侵略性强、贪吃、虚荣，色龙是黑暗的圣人和强大的暴君，为所有生物所惧怕--包括彼此之间。",
	" Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.": " 色素龙贪恋财宝，这种贪婪使他们的每一个计划和阴谋都充满色彩。他们认为，世界上的财富理所当然地属于他们，而色龙夺取这些财富时，并不考虑那些 \"偷走 \"财富的人类和其他生物。凭借成堆的硬币、闪闪发光的宝石和魔法物品，龙的囤积物是传说中的东西。然而，色龙对商业没有兴趣，它们积累财富的原因无非是为了拥有它。",
	"Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.": "色素龙因其优越感而团结在一起，认为自己是所有凡人生物中最强大和最有价值的。当他们与其他生物互动时，只是为了促进自己的利益。他们相信自己有与生俱来的统治权，这种信念是每条色龙的个性和世界观的基石。试图羞辱一条色龙就像试图说服风停止吹动。对这些生物来说，人类是动物，适合作为猎物或负担的野兽，完全不值得尊重。",
	"A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.": "龙的巢穴是其权力的所在地，也是其财宝的保险库。凭借其天生的坚韧和对严重环境影响的耐受力，龙选择或建造巢穴的目的不是为了避难，而是为了防御，倾向于多个入口和出口，并为其囤积物提供安全保障。",
	"Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.": "大多数色龙的巢穴都隐藏在危险和偏远的地方，除了最大胆的凡人之外，其他的人都无法接近它们。黑龙的巢穴可能在一个巨大的沼泽中心，而红龙则可能在一座活火山的破火山口上。除了巢穴的自然防御外，强大的色龙还使用魔法守护者、陷阱和顺从的生物来保护它们的宝藏。",
	"Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.": "龙后提亚马特（Tiamat）是邪恶龙族的主要神灵。她居住在九层地狱的第一层--阿弗努斯。作为一个小神，提亚马特有能力向她的崇拜者授予法术，尽管她不愿意分享她的力量。她是恶龙贪婪的缩影，认为多元宇宙及其所有的宝藏有一天会属于她，而且只属于她。",
	"Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.": "提亚马特是一条巨大的龙，她的五个头反映了崇拜她的色龙的形态--黑色、蓝色、绿色、红色和白色。她是战场上的恐怖，能够用她的五种呼吸武器、可怕的法术和可怕的爪子消灭整个军队。",
	"Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind.

	"In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.": "在原始时代，阿波利斯统治着一个横跨世界各大洋的庞大帝国。在那些日子里，阿波勒斯使用强大的魔法，并屈服于凡人界新生生物的思想。然而，他们被束缚在水中，没有仆人就无法在水面上执行他们的意志。因此，他们创造了丘尔。",
	"Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.": "Chuuls完全服从命令，在aboleths的指挥下收集有生命的生物和魔法。Chuuls被设计成能够经受住世界的岁月考验，随着时间的推移，它们的体型和力量都在不断增长。当boleths的帝国随着众神的崛起而瓦解时，chuuls被抛在了海上。然而，这些生物继续做着他们为aboleths所做的事情，慢慢地收集人类，收集宝藏，积累魔法，并巩固权力。",

Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.": "楚尔人仍然守卫着古老的阿波利斯帝国的废墟。他们默默地遵守着古老的命令而徘徊。谣言和古老的地图有时会引诱寻宝者来到这些废墟，但对他们的大胆行为的回报是死亡。",
	"Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.": "无论探险者带来什么财富，都会增加楚乌尔人所守护的囤积物。丘尔人可以在远处感知魔法。这种感觉与一种与生俱来的驱动力相结合，导致他们杀死探险家，拿走他们的装备，并将其埋藏在远古时代所指定的秘密地点。",
	"Although the aboleths' ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles.

	"Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However, they can seldom do so quickly.": "云巨人散布在风中，涵盖了世界的广大地区。在需要的时候，分散的云巨人家族会团结起来，成为一个统一的部族。然而，他们很少能迅速做到这一点。",
	"Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs.": "适应了他们空中领域的魔法，云雾巨人能够变成雾，并创造出波涛汹涌的云雾。他们居住在高高的山峰上的城堡里，或者居住在曾经拥有他们领地的坚实的云层上。",
	"Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants' lost empires. Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.": "这些神奇的云彩偶尔还会出现在天空中，它们是巨人失落的帝国的一个持久的遗留物。比大多数其他巨人更好的施法者，一些云巨人可以控制天气，带来风暴，并引导风向，几乎和他们的表亲，风暴巨人一样好。",
	"Although cloud giants are lower in the ordning than storm giants, the reclusive storm giants rarely engage with the rest of giantkind. As a result, many cloud giants see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant races.": "虽然云巨人的地位比风暴巨人低，但隐居的风暴巨人很少与其他巨人族接触。因此，许多云巨人认为自己在巨人种族中拥有最高的地位和权力。",
	"They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants' amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence. On their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there, along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons. From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottage sized produce and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.": "他们命令较小的巨人代表他们寻找财富和艺术，雇用火巨人作为铁匠和工匠，利用冰霜巨人作为掠夺者、袭击者和掠夺者。愚蠢的山地巨人为他们服务，充当野蛮人和战斗的炮灰--有时为云巨人的娱乐而战斗。云雾巨人可能会命令山丘巨人或冰霜巨人从附近的人形土地上偷东西，它认为这是对它的持续恩惠的公平税收。在他们的山顶和坚实的云层上，云巨人保持着非凡的花园。那里生长着像苹果一样大的葡萄，还有像南瓜一样大的苹果，以及像马车一样大的南瓜。从这些花园的错误种子中，山寨产品和魔豆的故事在凡人的世界里传播。",
	"As humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.": "就像人形贵族为狩猎鹰保留了一个小房间一样，云巨人也保留了狮鹫、perytons和狼獾作为他们自己的飞行猎物。这些生物也会在夜间巡逻云巨人的花园，同时还有训练有素的捕食者，如猫头鹰和狮子。",
	"The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silver-tongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.": "云雾巨人的守护神和父亲是诡计多端的梅姆诺，他是最聪明、最狡猾的巨人神。云巨人根据他们最崇拜的梅姆诺的方面和功绩来结盟，邪恶的云巨人模仿他的欺骗和自我利益，善良的云巨人模仿他的智慧和银舌。家庭成员通常向同一方向看齐。",
	"A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants.": "一个云端巨人通过其积累的宝藏、佩戴的财富和给予其他云端巨人的礼物来赢得其在条例中的地位。",
	"However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.": "然而，价值只是评估的一个部分。云雾巨人所穿戴的或摆放在家中的奢侈物品也必须是美丽或奇妙的。对云巨人来说，一袋金子或宝石的价值不如用这些材料制作的珠宝，创造的宝物能给云巨人的家庭带来尊贵。",
	"Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.": "与其互相偷窃或争夺宝物，云巨人是不折不扣的赌徒，渴望高风险和高回报。他们经常在名义上不受他们控制的事件的结果上下注，例如较小的生物的生命。在对人形国家的军事胜利的赌注中，可以赢得或输掉军衔和国王的赎金。通过干涉冲突来固定赌注会导致赌注的损失，但这种欺骗只有在被发现时才被认为是作弊。否则，它就是尊重Memnor的聪明才智。",
	"The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs-things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury.": "鸡冠花看起来像蜥蜴、鸟和蝙蝠的可怕混合体，它因能把肉体变成石头而臭名昭著。这些杂食动物的食物包括浆果、坚果、花和小动物，如昆虫、老鼠和青蛙--它们可以整个吞下。如果不是因为它们对哪怕是一丝危险的激烈和狂热的反应，它们不会对其他东西构成威胁。凤头鹦鹉面对任何威胁都会飞过来，一边叫一边疯狂地拍打着翅膀，脑袋飞快地往外啄。鸡冠花的喙最小的抓痕也会带来厄运，因为它的受害者会因为受伤而慢慢变成石头。",
	"Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.": "平民包括农民、农奴、奴隶、仆人、朝圣者、商人、工匠和隐士。",

Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.": "铜龙是无可救药的恶作剧者、讲笑话者和谜语者，生活在山丘和岩石高地。尽管他们生性好客，脾气平和，但他们拥有贪婪、吝啬的特质，当他们的囤积物受到威胁时，会变得很危险。",
	"A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.": "铜龙的眉板突出在眼睛上，向后延伸到长长的角，长成一系列重叠的部分。它的背脊和下巴的褶皱使它看起来很沉思。出生时，铜龙的鳞片是红褐色的，带有金属色泽。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片会变得更加铜色，后来随着年龄的增长会呈现出绿色的色调。铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，最古老的铜龙的眼睛就像发光的绿松石球体。",
	"A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.": "铜龙欣赏智慧、好的笑话、幽默的故事或谜语。铜龙对任何不笑它的笑话或不幽默地接受它的把戏的生物感到厌烦。",
	"Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.": "铜龙特别喜欢吟游诗人。一条龙可能会在它的巢穴中划出一部分，作为一个愿意用故事、谜语和音乐向它倾诉的吟游诗人的临时住所。对铜龙来说，这样的陪伴是一种令人垂涎的财富。",

	"A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.": "铜龙在炫耀自己的财产时很谨慎。如果它知道其他生物在寻找它囤积的特定物品，铜龙不会承认自己拥有该物品。相反，它可能会派好奇的寻宝者去寻找该物品，而它则在远处观望，以获得自己的乐趣。",
	"Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.": "铜龙居住在干燥的高地和山顶上，它们在狭窄的洞穴中筑巢。巢穴中的假墙隐藏着秘密的候车室，龙在那里储存有价值的矿石、艺术品和它一生中收集的其他奇珍异宝。不值钱的东西被放在开放的洞穴中展示，以诱惑寻宝者，并分散他们对真正藏宝之处的注意力。",
	"Couatls are benevolent serpentine beings of great intellect and insight. Their brilliantly colored wings and gentle manner speak to their celestial origins.": "库拉特斯是仁慈的蛇形生物，具有伟大的智慧和洞察力。他们色彩艳丽的翅膀和温和的态度说明了他们的天体起源。",
	"Couatls were created as guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of the divine mandates given to these beings are long since fulfilled or failed.

Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.": "库拉特斯是由一个自古以来就不被崇拜的仁慈的神创造出来的，现在除了库拉特斯自己，所有人都忘记了这个神。大多数赋予这些生命的神圣任务早已完成或失败。然而，一些库拉图仍在守护着古老的力量，等待预言的实现，或者保护他们曾经引导和保护的生物的继承人。无论库拉特斯的任务是什么，它都喜欢保持隐蔽，只有在最后关头才会暴露自己。",
	"A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.": "库阿特尔不会撒谎，但它可以隐瞒信息，含糊其辞地回答问题，或允许他人得出错误的结论，如果这样做是为了保护某些东西，履行承诺，或隐藏其存在的秘密。",
	"A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise. If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.": "库阿特尔可以在没有营养的情况下活很久，甚至可以在没有空气的情况下生存，但这些生物可以死于疾病或时间的流逝。库拉图可以提前一个世纪感觉到自己的死亡，但它对自己的死亡方式没有任何洞察力。如果库阿特尔已经完成了它要做的事情，它就会接受自己的命运。然而，如果它的死亡即将威胁到它的目标的完成，它就会积极寻找另一个库阿特尔，并与之产生后代。",
	"The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.": "库拉特斯的交配仪式是一种美丽而精致的魔法和光的舞蹈，其结果是产生一个宝石般的蛋，从中孵化出一个新的库拉特斯。寻找配偶的父母将新生的库阿特尔养大，并指导它的职责，以便它能完成父母未完成的任何任务。",
	"Crawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.": "爬行爪是被黑暗魔法激活的杀人犯的断手，以便他们能够继续杀人。具有黑暗倾向的巫师和术士使用爬行爪作为他们工作中的额外双手。",
	"Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it.

	"Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.": "给予爬行爪的命令必须是简单的。爪子不能被赋予寻找和杀死一个特定的人的任务，因为它有限的感官和智力使它无法追踪和挑选出特定的人。然而，一个杀死某个特定地点的所有生物的命令是可行的。爬行的爪子可以轻易地摸出钥匙和门把手的轮廓，从一个房间爬到另一个房间，进行盲目的杀戮。",
	"A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.": "爬行的爪子几乎没有智力和记忆，而它曾经是这个人的一个活的部分。然而，驱使那个人杀人的仇恨、嫉妒或贪婪仍然存在，并被爪子的折磨人的分裂状态所放大。如果任其发展，爬行的爪子会模仿并重现其生前的谋杀行为。",
	"If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.": "如果一只爬行的爪子从一个仍然活着的杀人犯的断手中活过来，这个仪式会将爪子与杀人犯的灵魂结合起来。然后，这只没有实体的手可以回到它以前的肢体上，它的不死之肉与它被切断的活体手臂交织在一起。",
	"Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma.

However, killing the murderer has no effect on the crawling claw.": "凶手重新变得完整，就像手从未被切断，仪式从未发生过一样。当爬行的爪子再次分离时，活着的身体就会陷入昏迷。当爬行的爪子离开身体时，摧毁它可以杀死凶手。然而，杀死凶手对爬行的爪子没有影响。",
	"A crawling claw doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "爬行的爪子不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.": "崇拜者发誓效忠于黑暗力量，如元素王子、恶魔领主或大恶魔。大多数人隐瞒自己的忠诚，以避免因其信仰而被排斥、监禁或处决。与邪恶的信徒不同，邪教分子在他们的信仰和实践中经常表现出精神错乱的迹象。",

	"Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to any deities.

	"Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.": "虽然它们相当聪明，但独眼巨人的生活简单而隐蔽，饲养动物作为食物。它们喜欢单独居住或以小家庭为单位，居住在洞穴、废墟或自己建造的干石结构的粗糙建筑中。剑水蚤在夜间将其畜群带在身边，用巨石封住其住所的入口，让它兼做谷仓。",
	"A cyclops lairs within a day's journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other. Cyclopes don't use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.": "剑水蚤的巢穴离其他剑水蚤有一天的路程，这样它们就可以见面交易货物或寻找配偶。他们用木头和石头制作武器和工具，但当他们能找到金属时也会使用。虽然独眼巨人能听懂巨人的语言，但他们不会写字，也很少说话，而是用咕哝声和手势进行交流。独眼巨人不使用货币进行交易，但他们重视黄金、贝壳和其他闪闪发光、色彩斑斓的物体作为珠宝。独眼巨人可能会佩戴一条串有羽毛和银币的项链，也可能佩戴锡制高脚杯、餐具和其他废旧金属的碎片。",
	"Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes. Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a \"god\" is a mere mortal.": "独眼巨人并不是伟大的思想家或战略家。他们学习缓慢，受传统方式的束缚，发现创新很困难。尽管由于他们的体型和力量，他们在战斗中是一个可怕的威胁，但他们经常被聪明的敌人所欺骗。独眼巨人可以被明显的魔法展示所吓倒和震慑。由于很少接触到魔法，他们会被欺骗，误以为术士、牧师或其他施法者是强大的神灵人物。然而，一旦他们知道他们认为的 \"神 \"只是一个凡人，他们的自豪感就会使他们做出报复性的、嗜血的暴力反应。",
	"Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.": "道教以金钱买到的最好的奴隶为交易对象，强迫他们在危险的地下世界工作，这些地方地震不断。尽管他们喜欢奴役他人，但道人却讨厌被奴役。强大的巫师们已经知道将道引诱到物质世界，并将他们困在魔法宝石或铁瓶的范围内。对道来说，不幸的是，他们的贪婪使法师们更容易让他们为之服务。",

	"Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.": "精灵们既聪明又强大，既骄傲又雄伟。他们傲慢而颓废，有一种深刻的权利感，这源于他们知道除了众神和其他精灵外，很少有生物能挑战他们的权力。",
	" A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.": " 当有生命的生物的灵魂与元素界的原始物质融为一体时，就会诞生一个精灵。只有在罕见的情况下，这样一个被元素注入的灵魂才会凝聚成一个明显的形式，并创造出一个精灵。",
	"A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.": "精灵通常与赋予其形态的灵魂没有任何联系。这种生命力是决定精灵形态和明显性别以及一两个关键人格特征的基石。虽然它们与人形生物相似，但精灵是被赋予物理形态的元素精神。他们不与其他精灵交配，也不产生精灵的后代，因为所有新的精灵都是从同样神秘的精神能量和元素力量的融合中诞生。一个与凡人灵魂有更强联系的精灵可能会选择与凡人生下孩子，尽管这样的后代很罕见。",
	"When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.": "当一个精灵灭亡时，除了它所穿戴或携带的东西，以及它的原生元素的一点痕迹外，它什么也没留下：一堆灰尘、一阵风、火和烟的闪光，或水和泡沫的爆发。",
	"In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.": "与他们对奴隶的喜爱相反，大多数精灵厌恶被束缚为自己服务。精灵只有在被贿赂或被魔法强迫的情况下才会服从他人的意愿。所有的精灵都掌握着他们本族元素的力量，但也有极少数精灵拥有实现愿望的力量。出于这两个原因，凡人法师经常寻求约束精灵为其服务。",
	"Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim.

	"Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before them.": "他们神奇的力量、宏伟的住所以及奴隶的数量让一些精灵自欺欺人地认为他们和神一样强大。有些人甚至要求其他领域的凡人--甚至整个大陆或世界--在他们面前俯首称臣。",
	" Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.": " 凡人奴隶的作用是验证精灵的力量和高尚的自我评价。一百个奉承的声音对精灵来说是一种音乐，而两百个匍匐在它脚下的凡人奴隶则证明它是主宰和主人。精灵将奴隶视为活的财产，而没有财产的精灵在其同类中一无是处。因此，许多精灵珍视他们的奴隶，把他们当作家庭的尊贵成员。邪恶的精灵会自由地威胁和虐待他们的奴隶，但绝不会达到奴隶不再有用的程度。",

If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.": "那些愿意冒险召唤恶魔的人可能是为了从它身上获取信息，迫使它为自己服务，或者派它去完成只有绝对邪恶的生物才能完成的任务。准备工作是关键，有经验的召唤师知道特定的咒语和魔法物品可以迫使恶魔屈服于他人的意志。如果犯了一个错误，挣脱束缚的恶魔就会毫不留情地让其召唤者成为其愤怒的第一个受害者。",
	"The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Iggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters.

These demon lords rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss.": "深渊的混乱力量用黑暗的祝福来奖励那些特别无情和聪明的恶魔，将他们转化为独特的恶魔，其力量可以与诸神相媲美。这些恶魔领主通过狡猾或蛮力进行统治，希望有一天能够获得对整个深渊的绝对控制权。",
	"Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.": "尽管大多数恶魔领主都是从横行于深渊的庞大而难以计数的恶魔群中崛起的，但这个平面也会奖励那些征服了其无限层的外来者。精灵女神洛尔思因背叛精灵族而被科里隆-拉雷西安扔进深渊，之后她成为了恶魔领主。圣人声称黑暗王子格拉兹兹特在从另一个早已被遗忘的恶魔领主那里偷取他的深渊头衔之前，起源于某个其他平面。",
	"The greatest sign of a demon lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.": "恶魔领主力量的最大标志是其重塑深渊领域的能力。被恶魔领主控制的深渊层成为该恶魔卑劣个性的扭曲反映，恶魔领主很少离开他们的领域，因为害怕让其他生物重塑并夺取它。",
	"As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such a fate.": "与其他恶魔一样，在另一个位面死亡的恶魔领主，其本质会回到深渊，在那里它将被改造成一个新的身体。同样地，死在深渊的恶魔领主也会被永久地摧毁。大多数恶魔领主将他们的一部分精华安全地储存起来，以防止这种命运。",
	"The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization would crumble and all races would embrace their base animal savagery.": "恶魔领主巴弗灭，也被称为有角之王和野兽王子，统治着牛头人和其他野蛮的生物。如果他能如愿以偿，文明就会崩溃，所有种族都会拥抱他们的基本动物野性。",
	"The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.": "野兽王子出现时是一个巨大的、长着黑毛的牛头人，长着铁角、红色的眼睛和一张浸满鲜血的嘴。他的铁冠上顶着敌人腐烂的头颅，而他的黑暗盔甲上镶嵌着尖刺和骷髅般的锯齿。他带着一把名为Heartcleaver的巨大玻璃刀，但经常把它扔到战场上，以便用角和蹄子面对他的敌人。",
	"The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.": "咝咝声的野兽和自称的恶魔王子，德摩根渴望的是破坏多元宇宙的秩序，而不是别的。作为一种疯狂的特征和驱动力的集合体，恶魔王子激发了其他恶魔和恶魔领主的恐惧和仇恨。",
	"Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake's and as powerful as a great ape's. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord's ambitions in check.": "德摩根的身高是人类的三倍，他的身体像蛇一样蜿蜒，像巨猿一样有力。被吸住的触手代替了他的手臂。他的萨乌尔式的下半身末端是有蹼和爪子的脚，还有一条分叉的尾巴，其鞭子般的尖端装有残忍的刀片。恶魔王子有两个可恶的狒狒头，它们都很疯狂。只有他的双重性质的两半之间的冲突才能使恶魔领主的野心得到控制。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his scheming heart.": "恶魔领主Graz'zt出现时是一个黑暗的英俊形象，身高近九英尺。那些把黑暗王子称为恶魔领主中最像人类的人，大大低估了他阴险的内心的邪恶能力。",
	"Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his favorites.": "格拉兹兹特是一个引人注目的身体标本，他的恶魔本性表现在他的乌黑皮肤、尖耳朵、黄色獠牙、角冠和六指的手。他喜欢华丽的服饰、盛装打扮，并与臣民和妃子们一起满足他的颓废欲望，其中的女妖和魅魔往往是他的最爱。",
	"The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.": "作为粘液和渗出物的恶魔领主，朱布莱克斯是潜伏在深渊中的有毒液体的混合物。这个可恶的无面之王对崇拜者或凡人的仆人毫不在意，它唯一的愿望是把所有的生物都变成它可怕的自我的无形拷贝。",
	"In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.": "在静止状态下，Juiblex以一种有害的方式扩散开来，冒着气泡，在空气中弥漫着深刻的臭味。在极少数情况下，当生物与恶魔领主对抗时，Juiblex会把自己拉成一个颤抖的锥形粘液，上面有黑色和绿色的纹路。可怕的红色眼睛在它的胶状身体里游动，而滴落的假肢则饥渴地扑向任何它们能触及的生物。",
	"The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.": "蜘蛛魔后是鸦人的邪恶女皇。她的每一个想法都被恶意所触动，她的恶毒程度甚至能让她最忠实的女祭司们感到惊讶。她一边指挥着她的信徒，一边在物质界的各个世界编织阴谋，期待着她的乌鸦信徒将这些世界置于她的控制之下。",
	"Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out-or if she has a reason to remind her followers to fear her—Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike—tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.": "当Lolth在凡间向她的追随者显现时，她会以一个轻盈的、傲慢的乌鸦族族长的形象出现，她这样做的频率不一般。当战斗爆发时，或者如果她有理由提醒她的追随者害怕她的话，洛尔思的下半身就会变成一只巨大的恶魔蜘蛛，其带刺的腿和下颚会将敌人撕碎。",
	"Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever unchanging except by his will.": "恶魔领主奥卡斯（Orcus）被称为 \"不死的恶魔王子 \"和 \"血之领主\"，受到不死人和引导不死之力的生物的崇拜。奥库斯是一个忧郁和虚无主义的实体，他渴望让多元宇宙成为一个死亡和黑暗的地方，除了他的意志之外永远不会改变。",
	"The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.": "不死的恶魔王子是一个肮脏而腐烂的生物，有一个人形的躯干，有力的山羊腿，和一个干瘪的公羊头。他疮痍满目的身体散发着疾病的恶臭，但他腐烂的头颅和发红的眼睛就像一个已经死去的生物。巨大的黑色蝙蝠翅膀从他的背上长出，随着他的移动搅动着发臭的空气。",
	"Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the Wand of Orcus, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are anathema to him.": "半兽人挥舞着被称为 \"半兽人魔杖 \"的邪恶神器，这是一根黑曜石制成的魔杖，上面有一个人形的头骨。他的周围都是亡灵，不受他控制的生物对他来说是致命的。",
	"Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name.

	"Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher, which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart with teeth and claws.": "耶诺古是一个巨大的、有疤痕的地精，他有一个由黑色刺组成的尖顶，眼睛里燃烧着翡翠般的火焰。他的盔甲是由倒下的敌人的盾牌和胸甲拼凑而成，并以这些敌人的剥皮作为装饰。耶诺古可以召唤出一把他称之为屠夫的三连枷，他挥舞着这把三连枷以达到致命的效果，或者当他用牙齿和爪子把敌人撕碎时，他的意志会独立飞向战场。",
	"No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the demon lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi.": "没有人知道在深渊中肆虐的恶魔领主的全部数量。鉴于深渊的无限深度，强大的恶魔不断崛起，成为恶魔领主，然后几乎同样迅速地堕落。在恶魔领主中，其力量已经持续了足够长的时间，以至于恶魔学家都能说出他们的名字，其中包括欺骗王子Fraz-Urb'luu；愤怒王子Kostchtchie；下层空中王国的王子Pazuzu；以及真菌夫人Zuggtmoy。",
	"Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad categories of power known as types.

Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor demons and demon lords.": "恶魔学家将恶魔的混乱分布组织成被称为类型的广泛力量类别。大多数恶魔都属于六种主要类型之一，最弱的被归类为第一类型，最强的为第六类型。六种主要类型之外的恶魔被归类为小恶魔和恶魔领主。",

	"An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.": "天使杀戮邪恶的生物而无怨无悔。作为法律和善的化身，天使的判断几乎从不出错。这种品质会在天使身上产生一种优越感，当天使的任务与其他生物的目标发生冲突时，这种感觉就会凸显出来。天使从不默许或让步。当一个天使被派来帮助凡人时，它不是被派来服务，而是被派来指挥。因此，善神只在最可怕的情况下才派他们的天使到凡人中间。",
	"An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits.

Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its shoulder blades.": "传说中，天使常年以凡人的形态出现，向心地善良的人们提供帮助、希望和勇气。魔法师可以变成任何形状，尽管它更喜欢以无害的人形或动物形出现在凡人面前。当情况需要它卸下伪装时，魔王是一个美丽的人形生物，拥有银色的皮肤。它的头发和眼睛闪烁着不食人间烟火的光泽，巨大的羽毛状翅膀从肩胛骨上展开。",
	"Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power.

They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment.

	"Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.": "魔鬼了解困扰聪明的凡人的缺点，他们利用这些知识把凡人引向诱惑和黑暗，把生物变成他们自己腐败的奴隶。物质世界的魔鬼利用他们的影响力来操纵人形统治者，低声说着邪恶的想法，煽动偏执，并最终促使他们采取暴虐的行动。",
	"In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.": "根据他们合法的结盟，魔鬼们即使在嫉妒或不喜欢他们的上司时也会服从，因为他们知道他们的服从会得到回报。九层地狱的等级制度依赖于这种坚定不移的忠诚，如果没有这种忠诚，这个恶魔的世界将变得像深渊一样无政府。",
	"At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.": "同时，魔鬼的天性是谋划，在一些人身上产生了统治的欲望，使他们对被统治的满足感黯然失色。这种独特的野心在阿斯莫德任命的统治九层地狱的大魔鬼中最为强烈。这些高级恶魔是唯一能品尝到真正权力的恶魔，他们对权力的渴望就像最甜美的安眠药。",
	"Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.": "魔鬼被限制在下层世界，但他们可以通过传送门或强大的召唤魔法来超越这些世界。他们喜欢与凡人讨价还价，以获得一些利益或奖品，但凡人在进行这种讨价还价时必须保持警惕。魔鬼是狡猾的谈判者，在执行协议的条款方面非常无情。此外，即使是与最低级的魔鬼签订的合同，也会被阿斯莫德的意志所强制执行。任何破坏这种契约的凡人生物都会立即丧失其灵魂，并被送入九层地狱。",
	"To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.": "拥有一个生物的灵魂就是对该生物的绝对控制，大多数魔鬼不接受其他货币来换取他们所能提供的恶魔般的力量和恩惠。灵魂通常在凡人自然死亡时被没收，因为魔鬼是不死之身，可以等待多年后合同的履行。如果契约允许魔鬼在死前索要凡人的灵魂，它可以立即带着灵魂返回九层地狱。只有神的干预才能在恶魔索取灵魂后释放它。",
	"The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.": "九层地狱有一个严格的等级制度，规定了其社会的各个方面。阿斯莫德是所有魔鬼的最高统治者，也是九幽地狱中唯一拥有低等神力的生物。在物质世界中，阿斯莫德被作为崇拜对象，他激励着以他的名字命名的邪恶人形邪教。在九层地狱中，他指挥着几十个坑道恶魔将军，而这些将军又指挥着下属的军团。",
	"A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer.

	"The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.": "恶魔的最低形式，是邪恶和堕落的凡人的扭曲和折磨的灵魂。在九层地狱中被杀死的妖怪只有在用受祝福的武器杀死时才会被永久消灭，或者在其无形状的尸体被泼上圣水后才会恢复生命。",
	"When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.": "当一个邪恶的凡人的灵魂沉入九层地狱时，它就会变成一个可恶的雷姆的物理形态。大魔王和大魔王有能力将雷姆晋升为小魔王。大恶魔可以将小恶魔提升为大恶魔，而阿斯莫德单独可以将大恶魔提升为大恶魔。这种邪恶的晋升会带来短暂而痛苦的转变，魔鬼的记忆会从一种形态完整地传递到另一种形态。",
	"Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.": "低级别的晋升通常是基于需要，例如，当一个坑道魔王将雷姆雷特转化为小恶魔以获得其麾下的隐形间谍。高级别的晋升几乎总是基于功绩，例如当一个在战斗中表现突出的骨魔被它所服务的大魔王转化为角魔时。在地狱形态的等级制度中，一个魔鬼的晋升很少超过一个级别。",
	"Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.": "降级是魔鬼们对失败或不服从的习惯性惩罚。大魔王或大魔王可以将小魔王降为雷姆，而小魔王则失去了对其先前存在的所有记忆。大魔王可以将一个大魔王降为小魔王，但被降级的魔王会保留其记忆--如果降级的严重程度过高，可能会寻求报复。",
	"No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.": "没有一个魔鬼可以提升或降级另一个没有向其宣誓效忠的魔鬼，这就防止了敌对的大魔鬼互相降级对方最强大的仆人。由于所有的魔鬼都向阿斯莫德宣誓效忠，他可以自由地将任何其他魔鬼降级，将其转化为他想要的任何地狱形态。",

	"Displacer beasts roamed the twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.": "驱逐兽在仙界的黄昏之地游荡了很久，直到它们被Unseelie Court捕获并训练。宫廷的勇士们有选择地培育这些野兽，以加强它们的凶猛和掠夺性，用它们来猎杀独角兽、小马和其他奇妙的猎物。然而，没过多久，流离失所的野兽就利用它们恶意的智慧逃离了它们的主人。",

Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.": "驱逐兽单独狩猎，或以小群为单位，表现出设置伏击的技能。单一的野兽会出击并撤退，把猎物引到密林中，让它的伙伴们等待。在贸易道路附近狩猎的流离兽群会回忆起定期商队的频率和时间表，并埋下伏笔，挑起这些商队。",

	"Djinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.": "精灵以其恶作剧的意识和对凡人的友好态度而闻名。在精灵中，精灵与伊夫里特和马利德打交道很冷静，他们认为他们是傲慢的。他们公开鄙视道，并在没有任何挑衅的情况下对他们进行打击。",
	"Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.": "空气的主人，精灵驾驭着强大的旋风，他们随心所欲地创造和指挥，甚至可以携带乘客。与精灵对抗的生物会受到风和雷的攻击，即使在战斗中不敌，精灵也会在风中旋转而去。当一个精灵飞起来的时候，它的下半身会变成一个旋转的空气柱。",
	"The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the genies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they never enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with them reluctantly.": "精灵相信，奴役是命运的问题，没有人可以与命运之手抗衡。因此，在所有的精灵中，精灵是最容易接受奴役的，尽管他们从不享受这种奴役。精灵对待他们的奴隶更像是值得善待和保护的仆人，他们不情愿地与他们分开。",
	"A mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly vengeance can amend.": "一个凡人如果想得到精灵的短暂服务，可以用精美的礼物来恳求它，或者用奉承来贿赂它，让它服从。然而，强大的巫师能够放弃这些礼节，如果他们能够用魔法召唤、捆绑或囚禁一个精灵。长期的服务会让精灵不高兴，而监禁是不可原谅的。精灵憎恨那些残酷的巫师，他们把他们的同类囚禁在瓶子、铁瓶和历代的管乐器中。背叛，尤其是被精灵信任的凡人背叛，是一种卑劣的行为，只有致命的复仇才能修正。",

	"A doppelganger's adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn't impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim's mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.": "二重身采用的形式使它能够融入几乎所有的团体或社区，但它的转变并没有传授语言、举止、记忆或个性。二重身经常跟踪或捕捉他们打算冒充的生物，研究他们并探测他们的思想，寻找秘密。二重身可以读取一个生物的表面思想，让它能够收集到这个生物的名字、欲望和恐惧，以及一些零散的记忆。作为长期阴谋的一部分，冒充特定生物的二重身可能会让它的替身活着，并在附近停留数周，每天探查受害者的思想，学习如何表现和真实地说话。",
	"Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con.

	"A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.": "龙龟很聪明，可以被收买，在这些生物巡逻的海域航行的海盗们很快就学会了用财宝来换取安全通行。聪明的萨瓦金人有时会与龙龟结盟，用财宝引诱它们在萨瓦金人对船只和沿海定居点的突袭中使用它们喷发的呼吸武器。",

They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.": "鸦人崇拜洛尔思，一个居住在深渊的神灵。她被称为蜘蛛女王或蜘蛛妖后，是黑暗精灵围绕其建立地下文明的人物。她要求什么，乌鸦就做什么。作为最邪恶的精灵，乌鸦很少被地面世界看到。虽然他们阴谋摧毁放逐他们的精灵，但他们不再把自己看作是流亡者。他们是注定的黑暗统治者，当洛尔兹命令他们起来摧毁他们在地面上居住的亲属时，他们会这样做。",
	"The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.": "乌鸦在地下生活了这么久，他们已经适应了周围的环境，可以在黑暗中看到东西。然而，他们再也无法忍受阳光了。当地下世界的奴隶供应不足时，乌鸦会派出突击队到地表，在黑暗的掩护下抓捕人类，把他们带回他们的城市，让他们受尽折磨。除了这些偶尔的远行，乌鸦满足于呆在他们的地下世界，在那里他们感到安全和控制。",
	"The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.": "黑暗精灵在食物和水充足的巨大洞穴中建造梦幻般的城市。他们雕刻石头的能力可与最伟大的矮人工匠相媲美，但他们的结构却保留了明显的精灵美学。虽然看起来很精致，但鸦人的定居点结构健全，而且具有非凡的弹性。乌鸦喜欢挖空巨大的石笋和钟乳石，创造出人口众多的尖顶，从地板和天花板升起。乌鸦的城市是一个由高墙围起来的广阔的大都市。非乌鸦的游客必须在墙外的监视下进行他们的业务。鸦人饲养巨型蜘蛛，以帮助保护他们的城市免受入侵者的侵扰，即使他们用美丽的网状物覆盖这些城市，创造出一个格桑花的陷阱来捕捉飞翔的敌人，否则他们就会飞越墙壁。",
	"Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.": "正如乌鸦已经适应了地下生活，他们的魔法也是如此。除了用这种魔法从石头上雕刻出他们的城市外，他们还赋予武器力量，创造出危险的新魔法物品，并从深渊中召唤出恶魔。乌鸦的施法者是极其傲慢的，他们毫不犹豫地以最令人厌恶的方式使用他们的魔法。",
	"Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.": "鸦人用金刚砂制作武器，这是一种黑暗和超自然的硬金属。乌鸦工匠们用网状的花纹和蜘蛛图案来装饰他们的武器和盔甲，法师们有时会给物品注入魔法以增强它们的效力。然而，这种魔力在暴露于阳光下时就会消失，所以魔法鸦人的武器和盔甲在被带到地面时很少能保留它们的强化效果和魔法属性。",
	"Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.": "鸦人的政治是残酷的，充满了阴谋。当鸦人合作时，通常是为了消灭一个共同的敌人并确保他们自己的生存，这样的联盟是短暂的，充满危险的。",
	"Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.": "鸦人社会分为多个贵族家族，每个家族都由一位女主人统治，她试图提高自己家族的声望和权力，使其凌驾于所有其他家族之上。家族中的其他高级成员都有血缘关系，而中层则是来自弱小家族、发誓效忠于大家族的鸦人。在一个家族的社会阶梯的最底层岌岌可危的是家族奴隶，由出身低微的乌鸦和偶尔的非乌鸦俘虏组成。",
	"Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.": "洛尔思，通过她忠实的女祭司，支配着乌鸦社会的规则，确保她的命令和阴谋得到执行。由于洛尔思很容易在物质世界显现，并直接惩罚那些不服从她的人，所以乌鸦已经学会听从她的话，并按照她的女祭司的命令行事。",
	"In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.": "在乌鸦社会中，男性对女性是顺从的。一个男性乌鸦可能会带领地下城的巡逻队或突击队到地面，但他要向女性乌鸦报告--要么是他家族的女主人，要么是她亲自挑选的女性下属之一。尽管男性乌鸦可以担任乌鸦社会中的几乎任何职务，但他们不能成为祭司，也不能统治一个家族。",
	"Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies {@condition unconscious}. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.": "从蜘蛛毒液和地下城的植物中提炼出来的毒药，在鸦人中可以找到很多，而且在他们的文化和政治中起着重要作用。鸦人法师炼制出一种粘稠的毒素，让敌人（%0%）。乌鸦战士用这种毒液涂抹他们的刀片和弩箭，期待着战斗之后的审讯和折磨。",
	"Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.": "鸦人经常穿戴魔法盔甲和携带魔法武器，如果暴露在阳光下1小时或更长时间，就会永久性地失去增强的奖励。",
	"A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.": "一个身穿+1链子衬衫并携带+1短剑的乌鸦有16级攻击力，在短剑的攻击和伤害卷上有+1的加成。",

	"Such priestesses execute the will of the Spider Queen, and as a result, they wield tremendous power and influence in drow society. The matron mothers who rule the drow houses are the most powerful of Lolth's priestesses, but they must constantly balance their devotion to the Spider Queen with their devotion to their families.": "这些女祭司执行蜘蛛女王的意志，因此，她们在乌鸦社会中拥有巨大的权力和影响力。统治乌鸦家族的母亲是洛尔思最强大的女祭司，但她们必须不断平衡对蜘蛛女王的奉献和对家庭的奉献。",
	"Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.": "德鲁伊居住在森林和其他僻静的荒野中，他们在那里保护自然界不受怪物和文明的侵袭。有些是部落的巫师，他们为病人治病，向动物的灵魂祈祷，并提供精神指导。",
	"Travelers entering a forest might catch a glimpse of a feminine form flitting through the trees. Warm laughter hangs on the air, drawing those who hear it deeper into the emerald shadows.": "进入森林的旅行者可能会瞥见一个女性的身影在树丛中闪过。空气中弥漫着温暖的笑声，吸引着那些听到笑声的人深入到翡翠的阴影中。",
	"Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love is forbidden.": "强大的费伊人有时会把较小的费伊人的灵魂绑在树上，把他们变成干尸。这有时是作为一种惩罚，当精灵爱上一个凡人而这种爱是被禁止的。",
	"A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world. As long as the tree remains healthy and unharmed, the dryad stays forever youthful and alluring. If the tree is harmed, she suffers. If the tree is ever destroyed, the dryad descends into madness.": "干尸可以从树中出来，并在它周围的土地上旅行，但树仍然是她的家，并使她扎根于世界。只要树保持健康和不受伤害，干尸就会永远保持年轻和诱人的状态。如果树受到伤害，她就会受苦。如果这棵树被毁，干尸就会陷入疯狂。",
	"Dryads act as guardians of their woodland demesnes. Shy and reclusive, they watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty of a stranger might investigate more closely, perhaps even try to lure the individual away to be {@condition charmed}.": "乾坤大挪移是其林地领地的守护者。他们害羞而隐蔽，在树上观察入侵者。被陌生人的美貌所打动的干尸可能会更仔细地调查，也许甚至试图引诱这个人离开。",
	"Dryads work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to druids that share the dryads' devotion to the woods they call home.": "干尸与其他森林生物一起工作，以保卫他们的森林。独角兽、树人和萨提尔与他们一起生活，此外还有德鲁伊，他们与干尸一样对他们称之为家的森林有奉献精神。",
	"Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile humanoids with her enchantments, turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.": "Dryads可以与植物和动物对话。他们可以从一棵树传送到另一棵树，把入侵者从他们的丛林中引开。如果被逼急了，干尸可以用她的魔法诱导人类，化敌为友。他们还知道一些有用的法术。",
	"The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.": "暴虐的duergar，也被称为灰矮人，居住在地下世界深处的奇妙城市。他们利用古老的矮人知识和无数的奴隶，孜孜不倦地扩展他们的地下王国。",

	"The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.": "杜尔加人曾经是矮人，在他们的贪婪和在地底无休止的探索使他们接触到了心灵传播者。矮人被illithids囚禁了数代，最终在邪神Laduguer的帮助下赢得了独立。然而，奴役永远地改变了他们，使他们的精神变得黑暗，使duergar和他们所逃离的暴君一样邪恶。尽管赢得了自由，但duergar是沉闷、悲观、不信任的生物，总是在劳作和抱怨，对快乐或自豪意味着什么没有记忆。他们的手艺和成就经久不衰，但他们却缺乏温暖或艺术性。",
	"Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.": "杜尔加人对他们的矮人亲属和所有其他地下种族发动战争。他们在方便的时候结成联盟，然后在他们没有更多的利益时打破这些联盟。他们掳掠并扣留奴隶在地下世界劳作，将他们视为免费劳动力和粗劣的货币。",
	"Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.": "与矮人一样，杜尔加人有强健的体魄。除了身体上的耐力之外，他们还具有令人难以置信的精神毅力，这是由于他们曾是伊里希德人的奴隶。杜尔加人的头脑是一座堡垒，能够抵御符咒、幻术和其他法术。",
	"The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become {@condition invisible} to slip away into the darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their {@sense darkvision}, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.": "暗黑世界充满了奇怪的魔力，这些魔力是杜尔加在几代人的监禁中吸收的。一个duergar可以在短时间内增加它的大小和力量，成为一个强大的食人魔大小的战士。如果它面对的是它无法对抗的敌人，或者在监视接近其领地的生物时，它也可以很容易地变成（%0%），溜进黑暗中。在暗黑中度过的岁月也磨砺了它们的（%1%），使它们的视力比其他矮人高出一倍。然而，这种敏锐的视力是有代价的，因为杜尔加人的视力会受到阳光的影响。",
	"Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves.

	" Under the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no \"I,\" but only \"we\" or \"us.\"": " 在他们的领袖Primus的指导下，modrons按照凡人的思维所不能理解的法则来增加多元宇宙的秩序。他们自己的思想在一个层次分明的金字塔中联网，其中每个模子接受上级的命令，并将命令委托给下级。莫德隆以完全的服从、最高的效率和没有道德或自我的方式执行命令。除了履行职责所必需的东西，莫德隆人没有自我意识。他们作为一个统一的集体存在，按等级划分，但他们总是集体地指称自己。对摩登人来说，没有 \"我\"，只有 \"我们 \"或 \"我们\"。",

	" If a modron is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted modron is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new modron is created by Primus, with a steady stream of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.": " 如果一个模子被摧毁，它的残骸就会瓦解。来自下一个最低等级的替代者会在一束光中变身，获得其新等级的物理形态。晋升的模子以同样的方式被它的一个下属取代，一直到等级制度的最低层。在那里，一个新的莫德隆被普利姆斯创造出来，源源不断的莫德隆人因此离开了麦肯纳斯的大莫德隆大教堂。",

It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.": "细密的丝线从Etercap腹部的腺体中流出，让它射出粘稠的网线来捆绑、诱捕或勒死其受害者。它还可以用它的网线来制作精致的陷阱和网，这些陷阱和网通常会在它的巢穴中出现。",
	"When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.": "当旅行者和探险者冒险进入ETTERCAP的领地时，ETTERCAP会跟踪他们。有些人盲目地走入陷阱或被网围住的森林区域，最终遭遇了死亡。还有一些人，ettercap会用网绳套住他们，或用它的毒牙咬死他们。",
	"Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps' victims.": "虽然他们居住在荒野中，但ettercaps并不希望与自然和谐相处。一个被ettercaps侵扰的森林会变成一个阴暗的地方，被网窒息，并有巨大的蜘蛛、巨型昆虫和其他险恶的掠食者出没。徘徊在这样的森林里太远的生物很快就会迷失在迷宫般的网络中，这些网络上挂着蚀心帽受害者的骨头和丢失的财宝。",
	"Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad's tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.": "Ettercaps是精灵生物的天敌。这些肮脏的生物设置了网络陷阱来捕捉精灵和小精灵，它们饥肠辘辘地吞噬这些精灵和小精灵，并将干尸的树包裹在网络中，妄图困住干尸。否则，胆小的费伊人有时会向外人寻求帮助，以处理ettercap的侵扰，因为他们自己没有能力处理这种邪恶的生物。",
	"An ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude characteristics of an orc. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.": "艾丁是一种肮脏的双头巨人，具有兽人的粗劣特征。如果可以的话，它从不洗澡，而且它厚厚的皮肤通常在它所穿的臭皮囊下面包裹着一层厚厚的灰尘和污垢。它的长发杂乱无章地挂在脸上，它的呼吸从长满弯曲的牙齿和獠牙的嘴里发出恶臭。",
	"The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other's slights.": "艾丁的双头是被困在同一个粗暴身体里的两个人。每个脑袋都有自己的思想、个性和名字，并拥有独特的喜好和怪癖。从出生开始就被束缚，两个脑袋都很少经历隐私或孤独。这种熟悉感滋生了蔑视，一个艾丁人不断地欺负自己，与自己争吵，它的两个脑袋对另一个人的轻视不断冒犯。",
	"When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.": "当其他生物提到ETTEN时，他们会将它的双重名字结合起来，形成一个适用于该生物整体的复合名字。如果一个ETT有一个头叫Hargle，另一个叫Vargle，其他生物就称这个ETT为Harglevargle。",
	"As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce.": "就像ETTIN与自己争论一样，它对其他ETTIN的容忍度更低，因为两个ETTIN之间的对话几乎总是相当于四个好战的头颅之间的喊话。因此，大多数ETTIN是独居动物，相互容忍只是为了繁衍后代。",
	"An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match.": "一个人的双头总是相同的性别，有一个与之匹配的身体。",
	"Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six-month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.": "雌性是ETTINS中的主导性别，它们发起ETTINS的交配仪式。在找到一个合适的巢穴后，雌性ETTIN猎取并征服雄性，雄性在她六个月的孕期中照顾并喂养她。一旦孩子出生，雄性ETT就会被释放，不再受人奴役。当孩子长大到可以自己狩猎时，母亲就会把它送走，并放弃这个巢穴。",
	"When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.": "当专注于一个互利的目的或因共同的威胁而团结起来时，ETTEN可以解决其个性差异，并全身心地投入到一项任务中。ettin在战斗时，两只手都拿着武器，由其各自的头颅指挥进行双重攻击。当Etin睡觉时，它的一个头会一直保持警觉，获得仅有的隐私时刻，并睁大双眼寻找任何扰乱其宝贵孤独的生物。",
	"In ancient dialects of Common, the word \"ettin\" translates as \"ugly giant.\" Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.": "在古代方言中，\"ETTIN \"这个词被翻译成 \"丑陋的巨人\"。传说中，兽人曾经偶然发现了德摩戈恩的神庙，神庙的魔法将他们变成了双头恶魔王子的巨大嘲讽。这些生物被逼得近乎疯狂，散落在荒野中，成为第一批埃廷人。",
	"Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant cousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers, but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.": "无论伊特丁的起源是什么，兽人都把它们当作远房表亲，兽人部落经常引诱伊特丁充当卫兵、侦察兵和掠夺者。兽人并不特别忠诚于其驯服者，但兽人可以用食物和战利品的承诺来赢得它。",

	"The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its \"prey.\"": "小精灵龙出现的唯一警告是一声被扼杀的笑声。这条龙呆在看不见的地方，无形地看着它的受害者与它的恶作剧抗争。当它的乐趣结束时，龙可能会暴露自己，这取决于它的 \"猎物 \"的态度。",
	"A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it \"treasure\" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.": "法力龙有一个敏锐的头脑，喜欢财宝和好伙伴，还有一种狡猾的幽默感。旅行者可以通过提供糖果、烘烤食品和小玩意等形式的 \"宝物\"，以换取信息或安全通过它的领地，来发挥法力龙的龙性。",
	"A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.": "法力龙的鳞片会随着它的年龄增长而改变颜色，在彩虹的所有颜色中游走。所有的精灵龙都有与生俱来的法术能力，随着它们的成熟，会获得新的法术。",

	"Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.": "火巨人的堡垒建在火山周围和内部，或者靠近充满岩浆的洞穴。他们的家园所散发的热浪为火巨人的锻造提供了燃料，并使他们的堡垒墙体发出令人欣慰的橙色光芒。在远离火山热的地方，火巨人开采煤炭来燃烧。传统的铁匠铺在他们的领地里占据着荣誉的位置，而巨人的石质堡垒则不断地喷出烟尘的烟雾。在更偏远的前哨站，火巨人燃烧木材以保持他们的锻造火种，在各个方向上砍伐森林的土地。",

	"From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.": "火巨人从出生起就被教导要接受战争的遗产。在摇篮里，它的父母高唱战斗之歌。在儿童时期，火巨人在战争中玩耍，在岩浆河两岸互相投掷火岩。到了晚年，正式的武术训练成为巨人的堡垒和地下烟尘领域生活的一个组成部分。",

	"Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.": "就像火巨人代代相传的工艺知识一样，他们著名的战斗力不是来自于狂暴的愤怒，而是来自于无尽的纪律和训练。敌人会因为火巨人的野蛮行为而错误地低估他们，但他们很晚才知道，这些巨人是为战斗而生的，可以成为精明的战术家。",

	"Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists.

	" The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.": " 缠绕在火焰头颅上的火焰不断燃烧，散发出该生物所控制的亮光。它用这些火焰作为武器，将它们集中起来，从它的眼眶中释放出火热的光线。",

They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.": "冰霜巨人居住在高高的山峰和冰川裂缝中，冬天时太阳会把它的金色脑袋藏起来。在他们冰冻的家园里不生长农作物，除了在袭击文明土地时捕获的牲畜外，他们很少饲养牲畜。他们狩猎苔原和山区的野生动物，但不做饭，因为新鲜的肉对他们的味觉来说是足够热的。",
	"The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.": "冰霜巨人的战争号角在呼啸的暴风雪中从他们的冰雪堡垒和冰川裂缝中行进时发出嚎叫。当暴风雪消散时，村庄和建筑都成了废墟，乌鸦降临，以任何愚蠢或不幸运地站在巨人道路上的生物的尸体为食。",
	"Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.": "客栈和酒馆首当其冲受到破坏，他们的酒窖被挖空，一桶桶啤酒和蜂蜜酒不见了。铁匠铺也同样被推倒，他们的铁和钢被夺走。奇怪的是，放债人和富人的房子没有受到干扰，因为掠夺者对钱币或饰品没有什么用。霜巨人喜欢宝石和珠宝，大到可以佩戴和注意。然而，即使是这些宝物也常常被保存起来，以备与其他更擅长制作金属武器和盔甲的巨人进行交易。",
	"Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.": "冰霜巨人对蛮力的尊重高于一切，一个冰霜巨人在军团中的地位取决于身体力量的证明，比如卓越的肌肉组织、著名的战斗留下的伤疤，或者用被杀的敌人的尸体制成的战利品。狩猎、育儿和手工制作等任务是根据巨人的体力和耐力给予的。",
	"When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.": "当不同部族的冰霜巨人相遇，而他们的地位又不明确时，他们就会为争夺统治权而搏斗。这种会议可能类似于节日，巨人们为他们的冠军欢呼，进行大胆的吹嘘和挑战。在其他时候，非正式的仪式可能会变成一场混乱的自由竞赛，两族都冲进混战中，砍伐树木，击碎冰湖上的冰块，并在雪山上引起雪崩。",
	"Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.": "虽然冰霜巨人认为琐碎的商品制作是他们的劣势，但雕刻和皮革加工是有价值的技能。他们用野兽的皮和骨头制作衣服，将骨头或象牙雕刻成珠宝和武器及工具的把手。他们重复使用较小的敌人的武器和盔甲，把盾牌串成鳞甲，把剑刃绑在木筏上做成巨大的矛。最伟大的战利品来自于被征服的龙，最伟大的冰霜巨人贾尔斯穿着龙鳞的盔甲，或者挥舞着用龙的牙齿或爪子做成的镐和锤子。",

	"Powerful magic allows a spellcaster to summon a galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The galeb duhr is imbued with greater intelligence than most elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to communicate with creatures entering its guarded area.": "强大的魔法可以让施法者从地球位面召唤出加勒布杜尔。一些加勒布杜尔也会在被该平面触及的地方自然形成。galeb duhr被赋予了比大多数元素更高的智慧，使其能够更好地评估威胁，并与进入其守护区域的生物进行交流。",
	"A galeb duhr doesn't age or require sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr might be created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly still for years at a time.": "加勒布杜尔不会衰老，也不需要营养，因此它是一个优秀的哨兵。一个强大的德鲁伊可能会让一个加勒布杜尔来保护一个石圈或神圣的山顶。另一只加勒布杜尔可能会被创造出来保护地下墓穴或巫师的塔。当它选择这样做的时候，Galeb duhr可以让自己看起来像一块普通的巨石，一次可以保持完全静止多年。",

It has an excellent memory and is more than happy to share information regarding its environment with creatures it doesn't regard as threats.": "Galeb duhr永久地被束缚在物质世界中，所以当它死亡时，它不会回到地球世界中。它有很好的记忆力，很乐意与它不认为是威胁的生物分享有关其环境的信息。",
	"A galeb duhr can become one with the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. When it needs to move close to those intruders, it presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a furious pace.": "加勒布杜尔能与周围的土地融为一体，使它能给附近的岩石和巨石注入生命的气息。Galeb duhr用它那有生命力的巨石来吓走入侵者，并保护它被授权保护的东西。当它需要靠近这些入侵者时，它将四肢紧贴身体，以狂暴的速度向前滚动。",
	"The inanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.": "栖息在伟大建筑顶部的无生命的石像鬼的灵感来自于这些来自地球元素的邪恶生物，它们类似于怪诞的、恶魔般的雕像。石像鬼潜伏在砖石和废墟中，像任何石雕一样静止不动，当它从悬空的姿势中挣脱出来时，它以创造恐怖为乐，也以给受害者带来痛苦为乐。",
	"Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.": "石像鬼依附在岩石峭壁和山脉上，或在地下洞穴的壁架上栖息。它们在城市的屋顶上出没，像秃鹰一样栖息在城堡和大教堂的高大石拱门和壁垒之间，它们可以保持自己的静止，以至于看起来没有生命。夜行神龙能够保持这种状态多年，是理想的哨兵。",
	"Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.": "石像鬼以残忍著称。在无数文化的建筑中都出现了雕刻成石像的雕像，以吓走闯入者。虽然这种雕塑只是装饰性的，但真正的石像鬼可以藏在其中，伏击毫无戒心的受害者。石像鬼可能会通过捕捉和折磨鸟类或啮齿类动物来缓解其枯燥乏味的观察，但其漫长的等待只会增加其对伤害有生命的生物的渴望。",
	"Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.": "夜行神龙很容易受到聪明主人的狡猾启发。它们喜欢简单的任务，如守卫主人的家，折磨和杀死闯入者，以及其他任何涉及最小努力和最大痛苦与屠杀的事情。",
	"Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls.

	"Ogrémoch doesn't create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises.

	"A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does.

Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.": "气体孢子是一个空壳，里面充满了比空气更轻的气体，使它能够像持币人一样漂浮。即使是最弱的攻击也能刺穿外壳，导致生物爆裂，释放出一团致命的孢子。吸入孢子的生物会成为孢子的宿主，通常在一天之内就会死亡。它的尸体会成为新的气体孢子产生的产卵地。",
	"A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift.

A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended inside the creature.": "凝胶状的立方体几乎是透明的，这使得它在攻击之前很难被发现。一个吃饱了的立方体可能更容易被发现，因为它的受害者的骨头、硬币和其他物体可以被看到悬浮在生物体内。",
	"The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.": "这里介绍的蜂群并不是普通的或良性的小生物的集会。它们的形成是一些邪恶或不健康的影响的结果。吸血鬼可以从夜晚最黑暗的角落里召唤出成群的蝙蝠和老鼠，而木乃伊领主的存在可以使疥疮甲虫从充满沙子的坟墓深处沸腾起来。一个巫婆可能有能力让成群的乌鸦对付她的敌人，而一个元始天尊可能会有成群的毒蛇在它身后滑行。即使是德鲁伊也无法魅惑这些蛇群，它们的攻击性是近乎非自然的。",

	"The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life.

The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.": "摆脱鬼魂的最可靠方法是解决它未完成的事业。通过唤起与其前世有关的弱点，可以更容易地消灭鬼魂。一个被折磨致死的人的鬼魂可能会被折磨的工具再次杀死。一个园丁的鬼魂在接触到强烈的花香时可能会变得更加脆弱。",
	"Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere.

The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.": "深刻的悲伤、孤独和未完成的渴望的感觉从发生鬼魂的地方散发出来。奇怪的声音或不自然的沉默创造了一种令人不安的气氛。在有熊熊大火的房间里会出现冷点。令人窒息的臭味可能会渗入该地区，无生命的物体可能会自行移动，尸体可能会从坟墓中爬出来。鬼魂无法控制这些表现；它们只是发生了。",

	"Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can't feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them.

A ghoul's undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.": "像蛆虫或腐肉甲虫一样，食尸鬼在腐烂和死亡的地方茁壮成长。食尸鬼出没于一个它可以吞食死肉和腐烂器官的地方。当它不能以死人为食时，它就追捕活人，并试图把他们变成尸体。虽然它们没有从吞噬的尸体中获得任何营养，但食尸鬼被一种无止境的饥饿感所驱使，迫使它们进行消耗。食尸鬼的不死之肉永远不会腐烂，这种怪物可以在墓穴或坟墓中持续数年不进食。",
	"Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus.

Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls' paralytic touch.": "食尸鬼的起源可以追溯到深渊。多雷因，他们的第一个同类，是一个崇拜奥库斯的精灵。他背叛了自己的族人，以人类的肉体为食，以纪念不死之身的恶魔王子。作为对他服务的奖励，奥库斯将多雷因变成了第一个食尸鬼。多雷因在深渊中忠实地服务于奥库斯，从恶魔领主的其他仆人中创造食尸鬼，直到恶魔地精领主耶诺古的入侵，抢走了多雷因的深渊领域。当奥库斯不为他的利益进行干预时，多雷塞恩转向精灵诸神寻求拯救，他们怜悯他并帮助他逃脱了必然的毁灭。从那时起，精灵就对食尸鬼的麻痹性触摸免疫了。",

It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.": "无论一个巨人在其自身种族中的等级如何，山地巨人部落的首领都不如最普通的石巨人。任何类型的最低等级的巨人都要优于劣等类型的最高等级的巨人。不尊重甚至背叛另一种类型的巨人并不被认为是邪恶的，只是粗鲁而已。",
	"When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.": "当巨人的古老帝国衰落时，所有巨人的父亲安南抛弃了他的孩子和世界。他发誓再也不看这两样东西了，直到巨人恢复了他们的荣耀，重新获得他们与生俱来的世界统治者的权利。因此，巨人不是向安纳姆祈祷，而是向他神圣的孩子们祈祷，同时还有一大批英雄神灵和神圣的恶棍，构成了巨人的万神殿。",
	"Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.": "这些神灵中最主要的是安南的子孙，他们的儿子代表每一种类型的巨人。斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）代表风暴巨人，梅姆诺（Memnor）代表云雾巨人，斯科雷欧斯（Skoraeus）代表石骨巨人，特林（Thrym）代表冰霜巨人，苏尔图尔（Surtur）代表火巨人，戈兰托（Grolantor）代表山丘巨人。然而，并不是所有的巨人都会自动崇敬他们种族的主要神灵。许多善良的云系巨人拒绝崇拜狡诈的梅姆诺尔，而居住在北方冰山的风暴巨人可能会对特里姆而不是斯特龙马斯表示敬意。其他巨人觉得与安南的女儿们有更强的联系，她们包括女猎手和家庭监护人希提亚（Hiatea）、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯（Iallanis）以及急躁和傲慢的骗子戴安娜（Diancastra）。",
	"Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.": "一些巨人放弃了他们自己的神灵，成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，向巴弗梅特或科斯特奇致敬。崇拜他们或任何其他非巨人的神灵是对条例的巨大罪过，几乎可以肯定会使巨人成为被抛弃的人。",
	"Of all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims. Driven to insanity by the destruction of their bodies and absorption into the mouther, those victims gibber incoherent madness, forced to consume everything in reach.": "在所有由肮脏的巫术创造的恐怖中，胡言乱语的人是最邪恶和堕落的。这种生物是由它以前的受害者的眼睛、嘴巴和液化物质合成的。由于身体被毁并被吸收到口器中，这些受害者被逼得精神错乱，疯狂地胡言乱语，被迫吞噬一切可及的东西。",
	"The gibbering mouther's body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.": "胡言乱语者的身体是一个由嘴巴和眼睛组成的无定形物质，它通过向前渗出来推动自己，将几张嘴巴固定在地上，并将自己的身体拉到后面。虽然它行动缓慢，但它可以轻松地游过水、泥和流沙。",
	"When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand {@condition paralyzed}, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.": "当胡言乱语者感觉到猎物时，它的嘴开始喃喃自语，喋喋不休，每个人都有不同的声音：或低沉或尖锐，或哀嚎或咆哮，或痛苦或狂喜地呼喊。这种嘈杂的胡言乱语超越了任何听到它的生物的感官，导致大多数人惊恐地逃离。其他人则被疯狂的情绪所征服，或者站立起来（%0%），盯着这个可怕的生物，因为它正在向前渗出，准备吞噬他们。",
	" Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.": " 被驱使着吞噬任何它能接触到的生物，一个胡言乱语的人流在受害者身上，被它疯狂的咆哮所迷惑，当它啃食和吞噬活人的肉体时，它无数的声音暂时沉默了。这个怪物会使接触到的石头液化，阻碍那些克服它的胡言乱语并试图逃离的生物。",
	"A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim's body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster's next meal.": "口吐白沫的怪物不会留下任何猎物的痕迹。然而，即使在受害者的最后身体被吞噬时，它的眼睛和嘴巴也会浮出水面，准备加入欢迎怪物的下一顿饭的折磨人的胡言乱语的合唱。",
	"The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons-the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.": "Githyanki从他们的星际飞船的甲板上和红龙的背上掠夺了无数的世界。羽毛、珠子、宝石和贵重金属装饰着他们的盔甲和武器--传说中的银剑，他们用银剑斩断敌人的身体。自从从思想絮乱者手中赢得自由后，吉蒂扬基人在他们可怕的虱子女王弗拉基斯的统治下，成为无情的征服者。",
	"The githyanki despise all other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their strongholds in the Astral Plane to the far flung corners of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and again.": "githyanki蔑视所有其他种族，进行毁灭性的袭击，把他们从星界的据点带到多元宇宙的遥远角落。战争是Githyanki文化的终极表现，他们无情的黑眼睛不懂得怜悯。在一次突袭之后，他们给破碎的幸存者留下足够的食物和资源，让他们虚弱地忍受下去。后来，Githyanki又回到他们被征服的敌人身边，一次又一次地掠夺他们。",
	"In their own language, githyanki means \"followers of Gith.\" Under the guidance of Gith, the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn enemies of their race. When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced by her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade worship of all beings except herself.": "在他们自己的语言中，githyanki意味着 \"吉斯的追随者\"。在吉斯的指导下，吉蒂扬基人分层成为一个军事化的社会，拥有严格的种姓制度，致力于与他们种族的受害者和死敌持续斗争。当他们的领袖吉斯死后，她被她的不死顾问弗拉基斯取代。荔枝女王禁止崇拜除她自己以外的所有生物。",
	"Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.": "在所有的敌人中，Githyanki最痛恨他们以前的主人--心灵驱逐者。他们的近亲--吉斯泽拉（githzerai），是他们的第二大敌人。所有其他的生物都被吉蒂亚克人以简单的蔑视对待，他们的排外自豪感决定了他们对低等种族的看法。",
	"In ancient times, gith knights created special weapons to combat their mind flayer masters.": "在古代，吉斯骑士创造了特殊的武器来对抗他们的噬心者主人。",
	"These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can't become a knight until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade into existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.": "这些银色的剑可以引导持剑者的意志力，造成精神和物理伤害。一个Githyanki只有在掌握了将这样一把剑变成现实所需的单一修炼方法后才能成为一名骑士。银剑相当于一把大剑，在创造者的手中具有+3大剑的属性。",
	"In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for their people.": "在Githyanki眼中，每把银剑都是无价的遗物和艺术品。吉蒂扬基的骑士会追捕并摧毁任何敢于携带或挥舞银剑的非吉蒂扬基人，为他们的人民夺回银剑。",
	"In the uprising against the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Vlaakith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don't consider the githyanki their enemies.": "在反对伊利特人的起义中，吉斯寻求盟友。她的顾问弗拉基斯向邪恶的龙族女神提亚马特求助，吉思冒险进入九层地狱与她会面。现在只有提亚马特知道他们之间发生了什么，但弗拉基斯带着龙后的红龙妃子埃菲罗蒙回到了星界，埃菲罗蒙宣称他的同类将永远作为吉特汉克的盟友。并非所有的红龙都尊重很久以前点燃的联盟，但大多数红龙至少不认为吉特亚基是他们的敌人。",
	" Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young.

	"The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people-two cultures that utterly despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.": "好战的githyanki和沉思的githzerai是一个分裂的民族--两种完全相互鄙视的文化。在出现githyanki或githzerai之前，这些生物是一个被思想剥落者奴役的单一种族。虽然他们多次试图推翻他们的主人，但他们的叛乱一再被粉碎，直到一个名为吉思的伟大领袖出现。",
	"After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle.": "在经历了许多流血事件后，吉斯和她的追随者们甩掉了他们的伊里希德主人的枷锁，但在战斗结束后，出现了另一个名为泽尔西蒙的领袖。",
	"Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day.": "泽尔西蒙对吉斯的动机提出质疑，声称她严格的军事领导和对复仇的渴望不过是对她的人民的另一种形式的奴役而已。两位领袖的追随者之间爆发了裂痕，他们最终成为两个种族，其敌意持续到今天。",
	"Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can say.

	"Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo.": "专注的哲学家和严格的禁欲主义者，吉斯泽拉人追求严格的秩序生活。他们身材瘦削，肌肉发达，穿着没有任何装饰的衣服，保持自己的意见，几乎不信任同类之外的生物。在背弃了他们好战的吉提安基族人后，吉斯泽拉人保持着严格的僧侣生活方式，居住在林波平面这个巨大的混乱之海中的秩序之岛上。",
	"The progenitors of the githzerai adapted to-and were transformed by-the psychic environment imposed on them by their illithid overlords. Under the teachings of Zerthimon, who called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions of Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy on creating physical and psychic barriers to protect them from attack, psychic or otherwise. Fighting is personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze and incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to physical punishment.": "吉斯泽拉人的祖先适应了他们的伊里西德统治者强加给他们的精神环境，并且被这种环境所改变。在Zerthimon的教导下，他号召他的人民放弃吉斯的战争野心，githzerai将他们的精神能量集中在创造物理和精神障碍上，以保护他们免受精神或其他方面的攻击。战斗是吉思塞拉伊的个人行为，它用自己的心智来迷惑对手并使其丧失能力，使其容易受到身体的惩罚。",
	"The githzerai willingly dwell in the heart of utter chaos in Limbo-a twisting, mercurial plane prone to manipulation and subjugation by githzerai minds strong enough to master it.

	"The forces of Limbo react to sentience, however. Using the power of their minds, the githzerai tame the plane's chaotic elements, causing them to settle into fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and sanctuaries within the maelstrom.": "然而，Limbo的力量对有意识的反应。利用他们心灵的力量，吉斯泽拉人驯服了飞机上的混乱元素，使它们变成固定的、可生存的形式，并在大漩涡中创造出绿洲和避难所。",

However, if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a glabrezu has the strength to fight and win.": "虽然格拉布瑞兹在战斗中是毁灭性的，但他们更喜欢用权力或财富作为诱饵来诱惑受害者走向毁灭。通过狡猾、诡计和邪恶的交易，格拉布瑞兹囤积财富，用来兑现对目光短浅的召唤者和意志薄弱的凡人的承诺。然而，如果它引诱或欺骗的尝试失败了，glabrezu有力量去战斗并赢得胜利。",

	"Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the Lord of Depths and Darkness, is the greater god of goblinoids. Envisioned by most goblins as an eleven-foot-tall battle-scarred goblin with black skin and fire erupting from his eyes, he is worshiped not out of adoration but fear. Goblins believe that when they die in battle, their spirits join the ranks of Maglubiyet's army on the plane of Acheron. This is a \"privilege\" that most goblins dread, fearing the Mighty One's eternal tyranny even more than death.": "强大的马格卢比耶特，深渊和黑暗之主，是地精的大神。在大多数地精的印象中，他是一个11英尺高、满身战痕的地精，皮肤呈黑色，眼睛里喷出火焰，人们对他的崇拜不是出于崇拜而是出于恐惧。妖精们相信，当他们在战斗中死亡时，他们的灵魂会加入马格鲁比耶特在阿克伦星球上的军队行列。这是大多数地精害怕的 \"特权\"，他们甚至比死亡更害怕全能者永恒的暴政。",

	"A gold dragon has a sagacious face anointed with flexible spines that resemble whiskers. Its horns sweep back from its nose and brow, echoing twin frills that adorn its long neck. A gold dragon's sail-like wings start at its shoulders and trace down to the tip of its tail, letting it fly with a distinctive rippling motion as if swimming through the air. A gold dragon wyrmling has scales of dark yellow with metallic flecks. Those flecks grow larger as the dragon matures. As a gold dragon ages, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble pools of molten gold.": "金龙有一张狡猾的脸，脸上涂着灵活的刺，就像胡须一样。它的角从鼻子和眉毛向后掠过，与装饰其长颈的双褶皱相呼应。金龙的帆状翅膀从肩部开始，一直延伸到尾巴的尖端，让它以独特的波纹运动飞翔，就像在空中游泳一样。金龙巫师的鳞片是深黄色的，带有金属斑点。这些斑点随着金龙的成熟而变大。随着金龙的衰老，它的瞳孔会逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像一滩熔化的金子。",
	"Gold dragons can eat just about anything, but their preferred diet consists of pearls and gems. Thankfully, a gold dragon doesn't need to gorge itself on such wealth to feel satisfied. Gifts of treasure that it can consume are well received by a gold dragon, as long as they aren't bribes.": "金龙几乎可以吃任何东西，但它们的首选食物包括珍珠和宝石。值得庆幸的是，金龙并不需要大口大口地吃这些财富来感到满足。只要不是贿赂，金龙会很好地接受它可以食用的宝物礼物。",

	"Older gold dragons can assume animal and humanoid forms. Rarely does a gold dragon in disguise reveal its true form. In the guise of a peddler, it might regularly visit a town to catch up on local gossip, patronize honest businesses, and lend a helping hand in unseen ways. In the guise of an animal, the dragon might befriend a lost child, a wandering minstrel, or an innkeeper, serving as a companion for days or weeks on end.": "年长的金龙可以伪装成动物和人形。伪装的金龙很少会暴露出它的真实形态。在小贩的伪装下，它可能会定期访问一个城镇，了解当地的八卦，光顾诚实的企业，并以看不见的方式伸出援助之手。在动物的伪装下，龙可能会与迷路的孩子、流浪的吟游诗人或旅馆老板结为朋友，连续几天或几周充当伙伴。",

	"When a gorgon spots potential prey, it charges with a hideous clamor of metal on metal. When the gorgon hits, it pulverizes the foe and sends its sprawling, then tramples it to death with its cruel hooves. Faced with multiple foes, the gorgon exhales its deadly vapor to overcome the creatures it touches by turning them to stone. When it grows hungry, it smashes its {@condition petrified} prey to rubble and uses its strong teeth to grind the stone into a powder that provides nourishment. The crisscrossing network of trampled trails and splintered trees that surrounds a gorgon lair is strewn with the uneaten fragments of its shattered foes.": "当戈尔贡发现潜在的猎物时，它就会带着金属对金属的狰狞喧闹声冲过去。当戈尔贡撞上时，它将敌人撞得粉碎，然后用它残忍的蹄子将其踩死。面对多个敌人，戈尔贡会呼出致命的蒸汽，通过把它们变成石头来战胜它所接触的生物。当它变得饥饿时，它会把它的{@condition petrified}猎物砸成瓦砾，用它强壮的牙齿把石头磨成粉末，提供营养。围绕着戈尔贡巢穴的纵横交错的小路和分裂的树木，散落着它破碎的敌人的未被吃掉的碎片。",

	"Green dragons are consummate liars and masters of double talk. They favor intimidation of lesser creatures, but employ more subtle manipulations when dealing with other dragons.

To enhance their senses, grimlocks leave trails of blood, piles of dung, or the viscera of slain prey in places far from their lairs. When intruders pass through those areas, they carry the foul scents with them, warning the grimlocks of their approach.": "当最微弱的脚步声或窃窃私语在石头通道上回响时，狰狞者的耳朵就会竖起来。它可以用太低的音调说话，其他大多数人类都听不到。汗水、肉体和血液的气味会唤醒它的饥饿感，它可以像猎狗一样通过这些气味进行追踪。为了增强它们的感官，狰狞兽会在远离它们巢穴的地方留下血迹、粪堆或被杀猎物的内脏。当入侵者经过这些地方时，他们会带着恶臭的气味，警告狰狞兽的接近。",

	"Hags dwell in dark and twisted woods, bleak moors, storm-lashed seacoasts, and gloomy swamps. In time, the landscape around a hag's lair reflects the creature's noxiousness, such that the land itself can attack and kill trespassers.

As a result, an ogre will do nearly anything a giant asks.": "只要有可能，食人魔就会与其他怪物结成团伙，欺负或掠夺比自己弱小的生物。他们与哥布林人、兽人和巨魔自由交往，并且几乎崇拜巨人。在巨人复杂的社会结构中（被称为Ordning），食人魔的地位低于最低的巨人。因此，食人魔几乎会按照巨人的要求做任何事情。",
	" Ogres eat almost anything, but they especially enjoy the taste of dwarves, halflings, and elves. When they can, they combine dinner with pleasure, chasing scurrying victims around before eating them raw.

This macabre crafting is the height of ogre culture.": " 食人魔几乎什么都吃，但它们特别喜欢矮人、半身人和精灵的味道。当它们可以的时候，它们会把晚餐和快乐结合起来，在生吃之前追着到处乱跑的受害者。如果食人魔在大快朵颐之后还剩下足够多的受害者，它可能会用猎物的皮肤制作一件腰布，用剩下的骨头制作一条项链。这种可怕的手工艺是食人魔文化的高峰。",
	" An ogre's eyes glitter with avarice when it sees the possessions of others. Ogres carry rough sacks on their raids, which they fill with fabulous \"treasure\" taken from their victims. This might include a collection of battered helmets, a moldy wheel of cheese, a rough patch of animal fur fastened like a cloak, or a squealing, mud-spattered pig.

Smarter creatures can earn an ogre's trust by offering it gold or a weapon forged for a creature of its size.": " 当食人魔看到别人的财产时，它的眼睛会闪烁着贪婪的光芒。食人魔在突袭时携带粗糙的麻袋，里面装满了从受害者身上夺来的神话般的 \"财宝\"。这可能包括一个破旧的头盔、一个发霉的奶酪轮、一块像斗篷一样的粗糙的动物皮毛，或者一只尖叫的、溅满泥浆的猪。食人魔也喜欢金银的光泽，它们会为了一小撮硬币而相互争斗。聪明的生物可以通过向食人魔提供黄金或为它这种体型的生物锻造的武器来赢得它的信任。",
	" Few ogres can count to ten, even with their fingers in front of them. Most speak only a rudimentary form of Giant and know a smattering of Common words.

The curse worked its magic on the elf's spirit as well as her body, turning her desire for love into a hunger for flesh, even as her beautiful song continued to draw creatures to her deadly embrace.": "当她的歌声没能吸引芬梅尔-梅斯塔林到她身边时，精灵诅咒了诸神，召唤出一种可怕的力量，将她变成了第一只鹰嘴兽。诅咒在精灵的精神和身体上施展了魔法，把她对爱情的渴望变成了对肉体的饥渴，即使她美丽的歌声继续吸引生物到她致命的怀抱。",
	"To hear a harpy's song is to hear music more beautiful than anything else in the world. A traveler that succumbs to the entrancing effect of that singing is compelled to blunder toward its source. A harpy sometimes charms victims before it attacks, but a more effective use of its song is to lure prey over cliffs, into bogs and quicksand, or into deadly pits. Creatures trapped or incapacitated then become easy targets for the harpy's wrath.": "听到女妖的歌声就是听到了比世界上任何东西都要美丽的音乐。一个旅行者如果屈服于这种歌声的诱人效果，就会被迫向它的源头走去。鹰身女妖有时会在攻击前对受害者施展魅力，但它的歌声更有效的用途是把猎物引到悬崖上、沼泽和流沙中，或引到致命的坑里。被困或丧失能力的生物就会成为海妖愤怒的目标。",
	"Harpies haunt bleak coastal cliffs and other places hazardous to non-flying creatures. Harpies have no interest in a fair fight, and they never attack unless they have a clear advantage. If a fight turns against a harpy, it lacks the cunning to adapt and will flee and go hungry rather than risk straight-up combat.": "鹞鹰出没于荒凉的海岸悬崖和其他对非飞行生物有害的地方。鹞子对公平的战斗没有兴趣，除非它们有明显的优势，否则它们从不攻击。如果战斗对哈比不利，它就会缺乏狡猾的适应能力，并会逃跑和挨饿，而不是冒险直接战斗。",
	"When they attack, harpies play with their food, delighting in the \"music\" their victims make as they scream. A harpy takes its time dismembering a helpless foe and can spend days torturing a victim before the merciful end.": "攻击时，鹞鹰会玩弄它们的食物，以受害者尖叫时发出的 \"音乐 \"为乐。鹰身女妖会慢慢地肢解一个无助的敌人，在仁慈的结束之前可以花上几天时间折磨一个受害者。",
	"Harpies take shiny baubles, valuable objects, and other trophies from their victims, sometimes fighting with each other for the right to claim the choicest prizes. When no valuable objects can be found, a harpy takes hair, bones, or body parts to line its nest. A harpy's lair is usually hidden in remote ruins, where adventurers can discover valuable treasure and magic hidden beneath foul piles of offal.": "鹰身女妖从受害者身上取走闪亮的饰品、有价值的物品和其他战利品，有时为了争夺最珍贵的奖品而互相争斗。如果找不到有价值的物品，哈比就会取走头发、骨头或身体的一部分来布置它的巢穴。鹰身女妖的巢穴通常隐藏在偏远的废墟中，冒险者们可以在肮脏的内脏堆下面发现有价值的财宝和魔法。",
	"Monstrous, fire-breathing fiends that take the form of powerful dogs, hell hounds are found on the battlefields of Acheron and throughout the Lower Planes. On the Material Plane, hell hounds are most commonly seen in service to devils, fire giants, and other evil creatures that use them as guard animals and companions.": "地狱猎犬是一种畸形的、会喷火的恶魔，它具有强大的狗的形态，在阿克伦和整个下层世界的战场上都能找到。在物质世界中，地狱猎犬最常见的是为魔鬼、火巨人和其他邪恶生物服务，将它们作为护卫动物和伴侣。",
	"Hell hounds hunt in packs, feeding on any creature that appears edible. They avoid potentially dangerous foes in favor of targeting the weakest prey with their savage bite and fiery breath, demonstrating a relentless determination as they pursue that prey to the bitter end.": "地狱猎犬成群结队地狩猎，以任何看起来可以食用的生物为食。它们避开有潜在危险的敌人，而以最弱的猎物为目标，用它们野蛮的咬合和炽热的呼吸，表现出无情的决心，追逐猎物，直到最后。",
	"When hell hounds feed, the flesh they consume stokes the infernal fires that burn within them. When a hell hound dies, that fire consumes the creature's remains in a billowing eruption of smoke and blazing embers, leaving nothing behind but scorched tufts of black fur.": "当地狱猎犬进食时，它们所吞食的肉体会激起它们体内燃烧的地狱之火。当地狱猎犬死亡时，火焰会在滚滚的浓烟和炽热的余烬中吞噬生物的遗体，只留下焦黑的毛发。",
	"Hell hounds are smarter than mundane beasts, and their lawful nature makes them good at following orders. However, a hell hound's evil disposition means that the creature can't be trained to be anything other than a ruthless killer. If a hell hound isn't allowed to indulge its malevolent hunger, it quickly abandons or turns against its master.": "地狱猎犬比世俗的野兽更聪明，它们的合法性质使它们善于服从命令。然而，地狱猎犬的邪恶性情意味着除了无情的杀手之外，这种生物无法被训练成其他的东西。如果不允许地狱猎犬放纵其邪恶的饥饿感，它很快就会抛弃或反对其主人。",
	"This construct possesses intelligence, the ability to reason and adjust its tactics, and an unswerving devotion to its maker that persists even after its maker's demise. Resembling an animated suit of empty plate armor, a helmed horror serves without ambition or emotion.": "这种构造物拥有智慧、推理和调整战术的能力，以及对其制造者坚定不移的奉献精神，甚至在制造者死后也能坚持下去。恐怖头盔类似于一套生动的空板甲，它的服务没有野心和情感。",
	"Though it takes more magical resources to create a helmed horror than a lesser suit of animated armor, the helmed horror requires less direction and maintenance as it carries out its appointed tasks. A helmed horror follows its orders with complete loyalty, and is intelligent enough to understand the difference between an order's intent and its exact wording. Unlike many constructs, it seeks to fulfill the former rather than slavishly follow the latter.": "虽然创造一个有盔甲的恐怖需要更多的魔法资源，但有盔甲的恐怖在执行其指定的任务时需要更少的指导和维护。盔甲恐怖完全忠诚地遵守它的命令，并且足够聪明，能够理解命令的意图和它的确切措辞之间的区别。与许多构造物不同，它寻求完成前者，而不是一味地遵循后者。",
	"A helmed horror fights with the cunning of a skilled warrior, taking to the air as it attacks weaker characters and spellcasters first. However, a helmed horror lacks the insight to change its environment, fortify it, or otherwise take active measures to improve its defensive position.": "带头盔的恐怖兽以熟练的战士的狡猾进行战斗，当它首先攻击较弱的角色和施法者时，就会飞到空中。然而，头盔恐怖者缺乏改变环境、加固环境或采取其他积极措施来改善其防御状况的洞察力。",
	"A helmed horror doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一个有头盔的恐怖人物不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Hezrous serve as foot soldiers in the demonic hordes of the Abyss. Although physically powerful, they are weak-minded and hezrous can easily be duped into sacrificing themselves by more powerful demons. As they press their attacks into the heart of an enemy's forces, their foul stench can sicken even the toughest foes.": "赫兹鲁斯在深渊的恶魔群中充当步兵。虽然身体强大，但他们意志薄弱，赫兹鲁斯很容易被更强大的恶魔诱骗而牺牲自己。当他们向敌人的中心地带发起攻击时，他们的恶臭甚至能使最强悍的敌人感到恶心。",
	"Hill giants are selfish, dimwitted brutes that hunt, forage, and raid in constant search of food. They blunder through hills and forests devouring what they can, bullying smaller creatures into feeding them. Their laziness and dullness would long ago have spelled their end if not for their formidable size and strength.": "山地巨人是自私的、愚蠢的野蛮人，他们不断地狩猎、觅食和袭击，以寻找食物。他们在山丘和森林中游荡，吞噬他们能够吞噬的东西，欺负较小的生物来喂他们。如果不是因为他们强大的体型和力量，他们的懒惰和迟钝早就注定了他们的结局。",
	"Hill giants dwell in hills and mountain valleys across the world, congregating in steadings built of rough timber or in clusters of well-defended mud-and-wattle huts. Their skins are tan from lives spent lumbering up and down the hilly slopes and dozing beneath the sun. Their weapons are uprooted trees and rocks pulled from the earth. The sweat of their bodies adds to the reek of the crude animal skins they wear, poorly stitched together with hair and leather thongs.": "山地巨人居住在世界各地的山丘和山谷中，聚集在用粗糙的木材建造的棚屋中，或聚集在防御严密的泥瓦屋中。他们的皮肤被晒得黝黑，因为他们一生都在山坡上伐木，在阳光下打瞌睡。他们的武器是连根拔起的树木和从地里挖出的石头。他们身上的汗水使他们身上的粗糙兽皮更加臭气熏天，这些兽皮是用头发和皮筋拙劣地缝合在一起的。",
	"In a hill giant's world, humanoids and animals are easy prey that can be hunted with impunity. Creatures such as dragons and other giants are tough adversaries. Hill giants equate size with power.": "在山地巨人的世界里，人类和动物是容易被猎杀的猎物，可以肆无忌惮地猎杀。像龙和其他巨人这样的生物则是强悍的对手。山地巨人将大小与力量等同起来。",
	"Hill giants don't realize they follow an ordning. They know only that other giants are larger and stronger than they are, which means they are to be obeyed. A hill giant tribe's chief is usually the tallest and fattest giant that can still move about. Only on rare occasion does a hill giant with more brains than bulk use its cunning to gain the favor of giants of higher status, cleverly subverting the social order.": "山地巨人们并没有意识到他们遵循的是一条法令。他们只知道其他巨人比他们大，比他们强，这意味着他们要服从命令。一个山地巨人部落的首领通常是最高、最胖、还能走动的巨人。只有在极少数情况下，一个头脑比体积大的山地巨人才会利用自己的狡猾来获得地位更高的巨人的青睐，巧妙地颠覆社会秩序。",
	"With nothing else to occupy them, hill giants eat as often as possible. A hill giant hunts and forages alone or with a dire wolf companion, so as to not have to share with other tribe members. The giant eats anything that isn't obviously deadly, such as creatures known to be poisonous. Rotten meat is fair game, though, as are decaying plants and even mud.": "由于没有其他东西可以占据他们，山地巨人尽可能多地进食。山地巨人独自狩猎和觅食，或与地狼同伴一起，这样就不必与其他部落成员分享。巨人吃任何不明显致命的东西，如已知有毒的生物。不过，腐烂的肉是公平的，腐烂的植物甚至是泥土也是如此。",
	"Farmers fear and loathe hill giants. Where a predator such as an ankheg might burrow through fields and consume a cow or two before being driven off, a hill giant will consume a whole herd of cattle before moving on to sheep, goats, and chickens, then tearing into fruits, vegetables, and grain. If a farm family is at hand, the giant might snack on them too.": "农民们害怕和厌恶山地巨人。像安克希格这样的食肉动物可能会钻过田地，吃掉一两头牛就被赶走，而山地巨人会吃掉一整群牛，然后再吃掉绵羊、山羊和鸡，然后再撕咬水果、蔬菜和谷物。如果有一个农场家庭在附近，巨人可能也会把他们吃掉。",
	"The hill giants' ability to digest nearly anything has allowed them to survive for eons as savages, eating and breeding in the hills like animals. They have never needed to adapt and change, so their minds and emotions remain simple and undeveloped.": "山地巨人几乎可以消化任何东西的能力使他们能够作为野蛮人生存了好几个世纪，像动物一样在山里吃东西和繁殖。他们从不需要适应和改变，所以他们的思想和情感仍然简单而不发达。",
	"With no culture of their own, hill giants ape the traditions of creatures they manage to observe for a time before eating them. They don't think about their own size and strength, however. Tribes of hill giants attempting to imitate elves have been known to topple entire forests by trying to live in trees. Others attempting to take over humanoid towns or villages get only as far as the doors and windows of a building, taking out its walls and roof as they attempt to enter.": "由于没有自己的文化，山地巨人模仿他们设法观察了一段时间的生物的传统，然后再吃掉它们。然而，他们并不考虑自己的体型和力量。试图模仿精灵的山地巨人部落已经知道，他们试图住在树上而推翻了整个森林。还有一些试图占领人形城镇或村庄的巨人，在试图进入建筑物时，只走到建筑物的门和窗前，就把墙壁和屋顶拆了。",
	"In conversation, hill giants are blunt and direct, and they have little concept of deception. A hill giant might be fooled into running from another giant if a number of villagers cover themselves in blankets and stand on one another's shoulders holding a giant-painted pumpkin head. Reasoning with a hill giant is futile, although clever creatures can sometimes encourage a giant to take actions that benefit them.": "在交谈中，山地巨人直率而直接，而且他们对欺骗没有什么概念。如果一些村民用毯子盖住自己，站在对方的肩膀上，拿着一个巨人画的南瓜头，山地巨人可能会被骗得从另一个巨人手中跑掉。与山丘巨人讲道理是徒劳的，尽管聪明的生物有时可以鼓励巨人采取有利于他们的行动。",
	"A hill giant that feels as though it has been deceived, insulted, or made into a fool vents its terrible wrath on anything it encounters. Even after smashing those who offended it into pulp, the giant rampages until its rage abates, it notices something more interesting, or it grows hungry.": "一个山丘巨人觉得自己被欺骗了，被侮辱了，或者被愚弄了，就对它遇到的任何东西发泄它可怕的怒火。即使在把冒犯它的人打成肉酱之后，巨人也会横冲直撞，直到它的怒火消退，注意到更有趣的东西，或者它变得饥饿。",
	"If a hill giant proclaims itself king over a territory where other humanoids live, it rules strictly by terror and tyranny. Its decisions shift with its mood, and if it forgets the title it bestowed upon itself, it might eat its subjects on a whim.": "如果一个山丘巨人宣称自己是一个有其他人类居住的领地的国王，它就会严格按照恐怖和暴政进行统治。它的决定会随着它的情绪而改变，如果它忘记了它赋予自己的称号，它可能会一时兴起吃掉它的臣民。",
	"A beast whose magical origins are lost to history, a hippogriff possesses the wings and forelimbs of an eagle, the hindquarters of a horse, and a head that combines the features of both animals.": "河马是一种神奇的野兽，其起源已被历史遗忘，它拥有鹰的翅膀和前肢，马的后躯，以及结合两种动物特征的头部。",

Hippogriffs don't lay eggs but give birth to live young.": "隐蔽和杂食的河马，终生交配，很少冒险离开它们的巢穴超过几英里。当保护其配偶或幼崽时，河马会拼命战斗。河马不产卵，但会生下活的小河马。",
	"Dragons, griffons, and wyverns have a taste for hippogriff meat and frequently prey on these creatures.": "龙、狮鹫和翼龙都喜欢吃河马的肉，并经常捕食这些生物。",

	"War horns sound, stones fly from catapults, and the thunder of a thousand booted feet echoes across the land as hobgoblins march to battle. Across the borderlands of civilization, settlements and settlers must contend with these aggressive humanoids, whose thirst for conquest is never satisfied.": "战争的号角响起，石块从弹射器中飞出，一千只脚踏的雷声在这片土地上回荡，妖精们正在向战场进军。在文明的边界地区，定居点和定居者必须与这些好斗的人形生物抗衡，他们对征服的渴望永远不会满足。",
	"Hobgoblins have dark orange or red-orange skin, and hair ranging from dark red-brown to dark gray. Yellow or dark brown eyes peer out beneath their beetling brows, and their wide mouths sport sharp and yellowed teeth. A male hobgoblin might have a large blue or red nose, which symbolizes virility and power among goblinkin. Hobgoblins can live as long as humans, though their love of warfare and battle means that few do.": "霍布金人有深橙色或橘红色的皮肤，头发从深红褐色到深灰色不等。黄色或深棕色的眼睛在他们的眉毛下探出头来，他们宽大的嘴里有锋利而发黄的牙齿。男性霍布林斯人可能有一个蓝色或红色的大鼻子，这在霍布林斯人中象征着阳刚之气和力量。霍布林人可以像人类一样长寿，尽管他们对战争和战斗的热爱意味着很少有人能做到。",
	"Hobgoblins belong to a family of creatures called goblinoids. They are often found lording over their cousins, the smaller goblins and the ferocious bugbears.": "霍布林属于一个叫做地精的生物家族。他们经常被发现霸占他们的表亲，较小的哥布林和凶猛的虫熊。",
	"A hobgoblin measures virtue by physical strength and martial prowess, caring about nothing except the opportunity to demonstrate skill and cunning in battle. Hobgoblins of high military rank attain their positions by force, then hold those positions by imposing their authority through draconian measures.": "妖精以体力和武功来衡量美德，除了有机会在战斗中展示技巧和狡猾外，他们什么都不在乎。军衔高的霍格布林通过武力获得他们的地位，然后通过严酷的措施将他们的权威强加于人，从而保持这些地位。",
	"Hobgoblins train to fight with a variety of weapons, and have great skill at crafting arms, armor, siege engines, and other military devices. Organized and disciplined, they take exceptional care of their weapons, armor, and personal possessions. They favor the bold colors associated with their tribes, and trim their often-elaborate uniforms with blood-red piping and leather dyed black.": "霍布金人训练使用各种武器作战，并且在制作武器、盔甲、攻城器械和其他军事装置方面有很高的技能。他们有组织、有纪律，对他们的武器、盔甲和个人财产都非常小心。他们喜欢与他们部落相关的大胆色彩，用血红色的镶边和染成黑色的皮革修饰他们经常精心制作的制服。",
	"Hobgoblins organize themselves into tribal bands known as legions. In their martial society, every hobgoblin has a rank, from the powerful leaders and champions, to the rank-and-file foot soldiers, to the goblins that find themselves driven into the front lines at spear point. A legion is headed by a warlord with several captains serving under its command. A hobgoblin warlord is a ruthless tyrant more interested in strategy, victory, glory, reputation, and dominion than leading troops into battle.": "霍布林把自己组织成被称为军团的部落队伍。在他们的军事社会中，每个妖精都有一个等级，从强大的领导者和冠军，到普通的步兵，再到发现自己被驱赶到前线的矛头的妖精。一个军团由一个军阀领导，有几个队长在其指挥下工作。妖精军阀是一个无情的暴君，对战略、胜利、荣耀、声誉和统治权更感兴趣，而不是带领部队作战。",
	"As loyal and disciplined as hobgoblins are in their own legion, rival legions compete constantly for reputation and status. Meetings between legions erupt in violence if troops aren't restrained, and only exceptionally powerful leaders can force legions to cooperate on the battlefield.": "就像地精在他们自己的军团中一样忠诚和有纪律，敌对的军团为了声誉和地位不断竞争。如果部队不受约束，军团之间的会议就会爆发暴力，只有特别强大的领导人才能迫使军团在战场上合作。",

However, they hate elves and attack them first in battle over any other opponents, even if doing so would be a tactical error.": "霍布林对战术和纪律有很强的把握，在一个有战略头脑的领导者的指挥下，可以执行复杂的战斗计划。然而，他们憎恨精灵，在战斗中首先攻击精灵而不是其他对手，即使这样做是一个战术错误。",

	"Hobgoblins have a long history of training animals to service. Like the more civilized races, they use oxen and horses to transport goods and weaponry over long distances. They communicate with each other using trained ravens, and keep vicious wolves to guard prisoners and protect hobgoblin camps. Hobgoblin cavalry use trained worgs as steeds, in the same way that goblins ride wolves. Some tribes even keep carnivorous apes as fighting beasts.": "霍布林人在训练动物服务方面有着悠久的历史。像更多的文明种族一样，他们使用牛和马来长途运输货物和武器装备。他们用训练有素的乌鸦相互沟通，并饲养恶狼来看守囚犯和保护霍布林人的营地。哥布林骑兵使用训练有素的虫子作为骏马，就像哥布林骑狼一样。有些部落甚至饲养食肉猿作为战斗兽。",
	"Hobgoblins claim lands with abundant resources, and they can be found in forests and mountains, near mines and humanoid settlements, and anywhere else that wood, metal, and potential slaves can be found. They build and conquer strongholds in strategically advantageous locations, which they then use as staging areas to expand their territory.": "游民要求拥有丰富资源的土地，他们可以在森林和山区、矿区和人形定居点附近，以及任何可以找到木材、金属和潜在奴隶的地方找到。他们在具有战略优势的地方建立和征服据点，然后将其作为扩张领土的集结地。",

When assaulting a stronghold, they surround it first to cut off escape routes and supply lines, then slowly starve their enemies out.": "妖精军阀从不厌倦战斗，但他们不会轻易拿起武器。在进攻之前，地精会进行彻底的侦察，以衡量敌人的实力和弱点。当攻击一个据点时，他们首先包围它以切断逃跑路线和供应线，然后慢慢地把敌人饿死。",
	"Hobgoblins fortify their own holdings, bolstering existing defenses with innovations of their own. Whether they lair in cavern complexes, dungeons, ruins, or forests, they protect their strongholds with ditches, fences, gates, guard towers, pit traps, and crude catapults or ballistas.": "霍布林强化自己的财产，用自己的创新来加强现有的防御。无论他们的巢穴是在洞穴群、地牢、废墟还是森林中，他们都会用沟渠、栅栏、大门、守卫塔、坑道陷阱和粗糙的弹射器或弹道来保护他们的据点。",
	"Hobgoblins worship Maglubiyet the Mighty One, the greater god of goblinoids.

	"A homunculus knows everything its creator knows, including all the languages the creator can speak and read. Likewise, everything the construct senses is known to its master, even over great distances, provided both are on the same plane. Functioning as a spy, a scout, an emissary, or a messenger, a homunculus is an invaluable servant for a spellcaster engaged in secret experimentation or adventuring.": "一个同体人知道它的创造者所知道的一切，包括创造者所能说和读的所有语言。同样，它的主人也知道它所感知的一切，即使是在很远的地方，只要双方都在同一个平面上。作为一个间谍、侦察员、使者或信使，同形体是从事秘密实验或冒险的施法者的一个无价的仆人。",
	"A fierce predator of the Underdark, the hook horror aggressively defends its hunting grounds. The subterranean caverns where these creatures dwell echo with the constant clacking and scraping of their hooks as they wend their way up cliffs and along cavern walls.

	"The omnivorous hook horrors eat lichens, fungi, plants, and any creature they can catch. A hook horror's hooked limbs give it excellent purchase on rock surfaces, and these creatures use their climbing skills to ambush prey from above. They hunt in packs, working together against the largest and most dangerous opponents. If a battle goes poorly, a hook horror quickly climbs a cavern wall to flee.": "杂食性的钩子恐怖吃地衣、真菌、植物和任何它们能抓到的生物。钩状恐怖的钩状肢体使其在岩石表面有很好的附着力，这些生物利用其攀爬技能从上面伏击猎物。它们成群结队地狩猎，共同对付最大和最危险的对手。如果战斗进行得不顺利，钩状恐怖兽会迅速爬上洞壁逃走。",

	"Hydras are natural swimmers, dwelling in rivers, along lakeshores, in ocean shallows, and in wetland bogs. A hydra rarely requires shelter from the elements, so it doesn't normally have a lair.

When a hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads remains awake and alert, making the creature difficult to catch by surprise.": "水螅是天然的游泳者，居住在河流、湖岸、海洋浅滩和湿地沼泽中。水螅很少需要避风的地方，所以它通常没有巢穴。只有在较冷的气候下，水螅才会被吸引到有保护的洞穴和废墟中。当水螅睡觉时，它至少有一个头保持清醒和警惕，这使得它很难被突然抓住。",
	"Found most commonly on the cold layers of Stygia and Cania, ice devils serve as commanders of the infernal armies of the Nine Hells, tormenting lesser devils as an outlet for their anger and resentment.

Soft as the wind they move, so as not to draw attention to their shameful forms.": "肯库穿着不合身的斗篷、长袍和破布。这些衣服覆盖了他们身体上柔软光滑的羽毛，遮住了他们赤裸的胳膊和腿。他们走路时脚步轻盈，用爪子抓着树枝，从高空中抓取猎物。它们的动作像风一样柔和，以免引起人们对它们可耻的形式的注意。",
	"Once, the kenku held the wind in their wings, embracing the gusty sky and singing the sweet language of birdsong. Serving a master whose identity is now lost to their memory, the kenku coveted the glittering baubles of his household, and longed to speak so that they could cajole and swindle others out of such treasures. Stealing the secret of speech from a volume in their master's library, they disguised themselves in rags to beg for pretty things. When their master learned of their greed, he stripped away their wings as punishment, forcing them to beg forever.": "曾经，Kenku用他们的翅膀抓住了风，拥抱着狂风大作的天空，唱着鸟鸣的甜美语言。他们为一个主人服务，而这个主人的身份现在已经不为他们所记得了，Kenku觊觎他家闪闪发光的饰品，并渴望说话，以便他们能够劝说和诈骗他人的这些宝物。他们从主人的图书馆里偷出了说话的秘密，伪装成衣衫褴褛的人去乞讨漂亮的东西。当他们的主人知道他们的贪婪时，他剥夺了他们的翅膀作为惩罚，迫使他们永远乞讨。",
	" Kenku can mimic the sound of anything they hear. A kenku asking for money might make the sound of coins clinking together, and a kenku referring to a busy marketplace can reproduce the cacophony of hawking vendors, barking dogs, bleating sheep, and the cries of street urchins. When mimicking voices, they can only repeat words and phrases they have heard, not create new sentences. To converse with a kenku is to witness a performance of imitated sounds and almost nonsensical verse.": " Kenku可以模仿他们听到的任何声音。一个肯库要钱的人可能会发出硬币碰撞的声音，一个肯库指的是繁忙的市场，可以重现小贩、狗叫、羊叫和街头流浪汉的哭声。在模仿声音时，他们只能重复他们听到的单词和短语，不能创造新的句子。与肯库人交谈，就是目睹一场模仿声音和几乎无意义的诗句的表演。",
	"Kenku speak to one another in much the same way. Because they are adept at interpreting one another's glances and gestures, the sounds they make to communicate complex ideas or emotions can be succinct. Groups of kenku also develop secret codes. For example, a cat's meow might be the secret code for \"Prepare to attack!\" or \"Flee for your lives!\" Their talent for mimicry extends to handwriting, and criminal organizations often employ kenku to forge documents. When a kenku commits a crime, it might forge evidence to implicate another creature.": "KENKU以大致相同的方式彼此交谈。由于他们善于解读彼此的眼神和手势，他们发出的声音可以简洁地传达复杂的想法或情绪。kenku群体还发展出秘密代码。例如，猫的叫声可能是 \"准备进攻！\"或 \"逃命！\"的秘密代码。他们的模仿才能延伸到了笔迹，犯罪组织经常雇用肯库来伪造文件。当肯库犯罪时，它可能会伪造证据来牵连其他生物。",
	"All kenku pine for the ability to fly, and thus the punishments they mete out to one another often involve false wings, such as heavy wings of wood borne as a mark of shame. As a final, tragic reminder of the wings they once had, kenku carry out executions by hurling their condemned from tall buildings or cliffs.": "所有肯库人都渴望有飞翔的能力，因此他们对彼此的惩罚往往涉及到假的翅膀，如作为耻辱标志的沉重木翼。作为对他们曾经拥有的翅膀的最后一次悲剧性提醒，肯库人通过将他们的死刑犯从高楼或悬崖上扔下来执行死刑。",

	" Kobolds are egg-laying creatures. They mature quickly and can live to be \"great wyrms\" more than a century old. However, many kobolds perish before they reach the end of their first decade. Physically weak, they are easy prey for predators. This vulnerability forces them to band together. Their superior numbers can win battles against powerful adversaries, but often with massive casualties on the kobold side.": " 哥布林是一种产蛋的生物。它们成熟得很快，可以活到一百多岁，成为 \"大巫\"。然而，许多哥布林在到达第一个十年结束之前就已经死亡。他们身体虚弱，很容易成为掠食者的猎物。这种弱点迫使他们联合起来。他们的数量优势可以赢得与强大对手的战斗，但哥布林一方往往会有大量的伤亡。",
	"Kobolds make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making and tunneling. Their lairs consist of low tunnels through which they move easily but which hinder larger humanoids.

A trip wire might connect to a spring-loaded trap that hurls clay pots of flesh-eating green slime or flings crates of venomous giant centipedes at intruders.": "哥布林以其制造陷阱和挖掘隧道的聪明才智来弥补其身体的无能。他们的巢穴由低矮的隧道组成，他们可以很容易地通过这些隧道，但却阻碍了大型人类的行动。哥布林还在其巢穴中布满了陷阱。最阴险的哥布林陷阱利用了自然界的危险和其他生物。一根绊马索可能会连接到一个装有弹簧的陷阱上，这个陷阱会向入侵者投掷食肉的绿色粘液粘土罐，或者将一箱箱有毒的巨型蜈蚣抛向入侵者。",
	"In addition to the dragons they revere, kobolds worship a lesser god named Kurtulmak. Legends speak of how Kurtulmak served as Tiamat's vassal in the Nine Hells until Garl Glittergold, the god of gnomes, stole a trinket from the Dragon Queen's hoard. Tiamat sent Kurtulmak to retrieve the trinket, but Garl Glittergold played a trick on him, collapsing the earth and trapping the kobold god in an underground maze for eternity. For this reason, kobolds hate gnomes and pranks of any kind. Kurtulmak's most devoted worshipers dedicate themselves to finding and releasing their lost god from his prison-maze.": "除了他们所崇敬的龙之外，哥布林还崇拜一个名叫库图尔马克的较小的神。传说中，库图尔马克在九层地狱担任提亚马特的附庸，直到地精之神加尔-闪金从龙后的囤积物中偷走了一个饰品。提亚玛特派库图尔马克去取回饰品，但加尔-闪金耍了个花招，使大地塌陷，将哥布林神困在地下迷宫中，直到永远。由于这个原因，哥布林讨厌地精和任何形式的恶作剧。库图尔马克最忠实的崇拜者致力于寻找并将他们失去的神从迷宫中释放出来。",

Its devastating attacks can destroy ocean trade and halt communication between coastal cities.": "在时间之初，克拉肯人充当了诸神的凶猛战士。当诸神的战争结束时，克拉肯摆脱了他们的奴役，再也不受其他生物的约束。当克拉肯从它的黑暗世界中出现时，整个国家都会因恐惧而颤抖，即使在最深的海洋中，风暴也会根据它的意志而上升或减弱。海怪是一种原始的力量，它使最伟大的文明成就湮灭，仿佛它们是沙中的城堡。它毁灭性的攻击可以破坏海洋贸易，并使沿海城市之间的通信中断。",
	"An ominous darkness presages a kraken's attack, and a cloud of inky poison colors the water around it. Galleons and warships vanish when its tentacles uncoil from the deep, the kraken breaking their masts like kindling before drawing down ships and crew. Not even landlocked surface dwellers are safe from a kraken's wrath. Krakens can breathe air as easily as water, and some crawl up rivers to nest in freshwater lakes, destroying cities and towns along the way.

	"Some krakens are virtual gods, with cults and minions spread across sea and land. Others are allied with Olhydra, the evil Princess of Elemental Water, and use her cultists to enforce their will on land and sea.

	"One of the most revered gods of the kuo-toa is Blibdoolpoolp the Sea Mother, who takes the form of a female human with a crayfish head, a crayfish's claws, and an articulated shell covering her shoulders.

	"Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power to transform manes into undead monsters, most often ghouls and shadows. Other demon lords feed on manes, destroying them utterly. Otherwise, killing a manes causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that reforms into another manes after one day.": "不死王子奥库斯（Orcus）有能力将鬃毛变成不死怪物，最常见的是食尸鬼和阴影。其他恶魔领主以鬃毛为食，将其彻底摧毁。否则，杀死一只鬃毛会使其消散成一团散发着恶臭的水汽，一天后又会变成另一只鬃毛。",
	"A monster in every sense of the word, a manticore has a vaguely humanoid head, the body of a lion, and the wings of a dragon. A bristling mane stretches down the creature's back, and its long tail ends in a cluster of deadly spikes that can impale prey at impressive range.": "从各种意义上讲，尾兽是一种怪物，它有一个模糊的人形头部，狮子的身体和龙的翅膀。鬃毛沿着生物的背部延伸，长长的尾巴末端是一簇致命的尖刺，可以在令人印象深刻的范围内刺伤猎物。",
	"Manticores are fierce killers that hunt far and wide for prey. They work together to take down particularly large or dangerous creatures, sharing the meal once a kill is made. A manticore begins its attack with a volley of tail spikes, then lands and uses its claws and bite. When outdoors and outnumbered, it uses its wings to stay aloft, attacking from a distance until its spikes are depleted.": "刺尾狮是凶猛的杀手，在很远的地方猎取猎物。它们共同捕杀特别大的或危险的生物，一旦捕杀成功就会分享食物。刺尾狮以一连串的尾刺开始攻击，然后落地并使用爪子和咬合。当在户外且人数较多时，它用翅膀保持高空飞行，从远处进行攻击，直到它的尖刺耗尽。",
	"A manticore isn't particularly bright, but it possesses a malevolent nature and the ability to converse. In the course of attacking, it denigrates its foes and offers to kill them swiftly if they beg for their lives. If a manticore sees an advantage to be gained by sparing a creature's life, it does so, asking for a tribute or sacrifice equal to its loss of food.": "刺尾狮并不特别聪明，但它拥有恶毒的天性和交谈的能力。在攻击过程中，它诋毁它的敌人，并提出如果他们求饶，就迅速杀死他们。如果刺尾狮认为饶恕一个生物的生命可以获得好处，它就会这样做，要求提供相当于其食物损失的贡品或祭品。",
	"Manticores serve wicked masters that treat them well and provide regular prey. A manticore might provide aerial support for an orc horde or a hobgoblin army. Another could serve as a hunting companion for a hill giant chief, or guard the entrance to a lamia's lair.": "刺尾狮为那些善待它们并提供定期猎物的邪恶主人服务。一只刺尾狮可能为兽人部落或妖精军队提供空中支援。另一只可以作为山丘巨人首领的狩猎伙伴，或者守卫拉米亚巢穴的入口。",

In addition to these creatures, manticores fear dragons and avoid them.": "刺尾狮最大的领土对手包括奇美拉、格里芬、佩里顿和维文。作为群体狩猎的刺尾狮通常具有数量更多的优势。除了这些生物之外，刺尾狮还害怕龙，并避开它们。",
	"Hailing from the Elemental Plane of Water, the marids are the most wondrous of genie-kind. Although all genies wield great power, even the lowliest marid sees itself as clearly superior to the flighty djinn, the ground-hugging dao, and the fuming efreet. Large and piscine, marids are a strange sight to behold, particularly when clad in the finely stitched vests and colorful pantaloons they favor. They speak in voices as soft as the sea breeze or as sonorous as storm waves breaking against a rocky cliff. In flight, their lower bodies transform into columns of foamy water.": "来自水元素界的马利德是最神奇的精灵种族。虽然所有的精灵都拥有强大的力量，但即使是最低级的马利德也认为自己明显优于飞翔的精灵、拥抱地面的道，以及发怒的伊夫雷特。身材高大、体型娇小的马里人是一道奇特的风景线，尤其是当他们穿着缝制精细的马甲和五颜六色的长裤时。他们说话的声音像海风一样轻柔，也像暴风雨中的浪花拍打岩石悬崖一样铿锵有力。在飞行中，他们的下半身变成了泡沫状的水柱。",
	"Water is a marid's native element, and the genie can manipulate water in virtually any way it desires. A marid can walk on water and breathe naturally beneath its surface. It can create water or shape clouds of fog and mist from the vapor in the air. It can even transform itself into mist, or use water as a weapon to bludgeon its foes.": "水是马里人的原生元素，精灵几乎可以以任何方式操纵水。海盗可以在水上行走，在水面下自然呼吸。它可以从空气中的水蒸气中创造水或塑造雾霭。它甚至可以把自己变成雾，或者把水当作武器来打击它的敌人。",

	"A marid doesn't expect much from its slaves, simply wanting to have them for the status of ownership. Marids go out of their way to obtain skilled slaves, and aren't above kidnapping mortal artists, entertainers, or storytellers for use in their courts.": "马利德人对其奴隶的要求并不高，只是想拥有他们的地位。马利德人不遗余力地获取熟练的奴隶，并且不惜绑架凡人艺术家、艺人或讲故事的人，供他们在法庭上使用。",
	"All marids claim a title of nobility, and the race is awash in shahs, sultans, muftis, and khedives. Most of these titles are mere pretense on the part of the self-important marids.": "所有马里人都声称自己有贵族头衔，而且这个种族充斥着沙赫、苏丹、穆夫提和赫德夫。这些头衔大多只是自视甚高的侯爵们的伪装。",
	"Marids treat all others-including other genies-as inferiors of various grades, ranging from poor cousins to petty annoyances. They tolerate djinn, dislike dao, and despise efreet.": "马利德人将所有其他人--包括其他精灵--视为不同等级的下等人，从可怜的表兄弟到琐碎的烦人物。他们容忍精灵，不喜欢道，并鄙视伊夫里特。",
	"Humanoids are among the lowest of the creatures that marids must tolerate, although they sometimes deal with powerful wizards and exceptional leaders on an almost-equal footing. Doing so has sometimes proven to be a mistake, since wizards have managed to imprison marids in conch shells, flasks, and decanters over the ages. Bribery and flattery are the best means of dealing with marids, to which an obsequious mortal is a creature that knows its place.": "人形生物是马利德人必须容忍的最低级的生物之一，尽管他们有时会在几乎平等的基础上与强大的巫师和杰出的领袖打交道。这样做有时被证明是一个错误，因为在过去的岁月里，巫师们已经成功地将海螺壳、酒瓶和酒壶囚禁在海里。贿赂和奉承是与马利德打交道的最好手段，对他们来说，谄媚的凡人是一种知道自己位置的生物。",
	"Marids are champion tale-tellers, whose favorite legends emphasize the prowess of marids in general and of the speaker in particular. Fanciful genies, they lie often and creatively. They aren't always malicious in their deception, but embellishments suit their fancy. Marids consider it a crime for a lesser being to interrupt one of their tales, and offending a marid is a sure way to invoke its wrath.": "马利德人是讲故事的冠军，他们最喜欢的传说强调了马利德人的一般能力，特别是讲故事的人的能力。充满幻想的精灵，他们经常创造性地撒谎。他们在欺骗中并不总是恶意的，但对他们的幻想进行美化。马利德认为小人物打断他们的故事是一种犯罪，冒犯马利德肯定会引起它的愤怒。",
	"Terrible to behold, a marilith has the lower body of a great serpent and the upper torso of a humanoid female with six arms. Wielding a wicked blade in each of its six hands, a marilith is a devastating foe that few can match in battle.": "可怕的是，Marilith的下半身是一条大蛇，上半身是一个拥有六只手臂的女性人形物体。玛利利斯的六只手都挥舞着一把邪恶的刀，是一个毁灭性的敌人，很少有人能在战斗中与之匹敌。",
	"These demons possess keen minds and a finely honed sense of tactics, and they are able to lead and unite other demons in common cause. Mariliths are often encountered as captains at the head of a demonic horde, where they embrace any opportunity to rush headlong into battle.": "这些恶魔拥有敏锐的头脑和精良的战术意识，他们能够领导和团结其他恶魔共同完成任务。玛丽莉斯经常作为队长出现在恶魔部落的首领面前，他们抓住任何机会一头扎进战斗。",

	"As deadly as they are ravishing, the serpent-haired medusas suffer an immortal curse brought on by their vanity. They lurk in quiet exile among the tumbled ruins of their former lives, surrounded by the petrified remains of past admirers and would-be heroes.": "蛇发美杜莎人既致命又迷人，他们因虚荣心而受到不朽的诅咒。他们潜伏在他们以前生活的废墟中，周围是过去的崇拜者和未来的英雄们的石化遗体，安静地流亡。",
	"Men and women who desire eternal youth, beauty, and adoration might pray to malicious gods, beg dragons for ancient magic, or seek out powerful archmages to fulfill their wishes. Others make sacrifices to demon lords or archdevils, offering all in exchange for this gift, oblivious to the curse that accompanies it. Those who strike such bargains gain physical beauty, restored youth, immortality, and the adoration of all who behold them, granting them the influence and power they so desire. However, after years of the living like a demigod among mortals, the price for their vanity and hubris is exacted, and they are forever transformed into medusas. A medusa's hair turns into a nest of venomous serpents, and all who gaze upon the medusa are {@condition petrified}, becoming stone monuments to its corruption.": "渴望永恒的青春、美丽和崇拜的男人和女人可能会向恶意的神灵祈祷，向龙乞求古老的魔法，或者寻找强大的大法师来实现他们的愿望。其他人则向恶魔领主或大恶魔献上祭品，用一切来换取这份礼物，对伴随而来的诅咒视而不见。那些达成这种交易的人获得了身体的美丽、恢复的青春、不朽，以及所有看到他们的人的崇拜，赋予他们他们所渴望的影响力和权力。然而，在像半神一样在凡人中生活多年后，他们的虚荣和狂妄的代价被索取了，他们永远变成了梅杜莎。美杜莎的头发会变成一窝毒蛇，所有注视着美杜莎的人都会{@condition petrified}，成为其腐败的石碑。",
	"Medusas live forever in seclusion, alienated from the world around them by their monstrous form and caprice.

	"A medusa is subject to its own curse. By looking vainly on its reflection, it turns to stone as surely as any living mortal. As a result, a medusa destroys or removes any mirrors or reflective surfaces in its lair.": "梅杜莎受制于它自己的诅咒。徒劳地看着自己的倒影，它就会像任何活着的凡人一样变成石头。因此，冥王星会毁掉或移走其巢穴中的任何镜子或反射面。",
	"Mephits are capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes. They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements.": "梅菲特是一种反复无常、类似小恶魔的生物，原产于元素界。它们有六个品种，每个品种代表两种元素的混合。",
	"Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For example, a magma mephit is composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales.": "不老的骗子，梅菲特大量聚集在元素界和元素混沌中。它们也会找到自己在物质世界的途径，它们更喜欢居住在它们的基本元素丰富的地方。例如，岩浆梅菲特是由土和火组成的，它喜欢火山巢穴，而冰梅菲特是由空气和水组成的，喜欢寒冷的地方。",

	"Merfolk lack the materials and practical means to forge weapons beneath the waves, to write books and keep lore, or to shape stone to raise buildings and cities. As a result, most live in small hunter-gatherer tribes, each of which holds unique values and creeds. Only occasionally do merfolk unite under the rule of a single leader. They do so to face a common threat or to complete a conquest. Such unifications can be the beginning of undersea kingdoms with dynasties lasting hundreds of years.": "人鱼族缺乏材料和实际手段，无法在海面下锻造武器，无法写书和保存传说，也无法塑造石头来建造建筑和城市。因此，大多数人生活在小型狩猎-采集部落中，每个部落都有独特的价值观和信条。只有偶尔，人鱼族才会在一个领导者的统治下团结起来。他们这样做是为了面对一个共同的威胁或完成一次征服。这样的统一可能是海底王国的开始，其王朝持续数百年之久。",
	"Merfolk build their settlements in vast undersea caverns, mazes of coral, the ruins of sunken cities, or structures they carve from the rocky seabed. They live in water shallow enough that the passage of time can be marked by the gleam and fade of sunlight through the water. In the reefs and trenches near their settlements, merfolk harvest coral and farm the seabed, shepherding schools of fish as land-based farmers tend sheep. Only rarely do merfolk venture into the darkest depths of the ocean. In such depths and in their undersea caverns, merfolk rely on the light of bioluminescent flora and fauna, such as jellyfish, whose slow pulsing movements lend merfolk settlements an otherworldly aesthetic.": "人鱼族在巨大的海底洞穴、珊瑚迷宫、沉没的城市废墟或他们从岩石海床上凿出的结构中建造他们的定居点。他们生活在足够浅的水中，时间的流逝可以通过阳光在水中的闪耀和褪色来标记。在他们定居点附近的珊瑚礁和海沟里，人鱼族收获珊瑚并在海床上耕作，像陆地上的农民放羊一样牧养鱼群。人鱼族只有在很少的情况下才会冒险进入海洋的最黑暗深处。在这样的深处和他们的海底洞穴中，人鱼族依靠生物发光的动植物，如水母的光，其缓慢的脉动使人鱼族的定居点具有另一种美感。",

	"Not knowing what it was, they brought the artifact to their king. Everyone who touched the idol became afflicted with madness, including the king, who decreed that a sacrificial ritual be performed to open a gateway to the Abyss. The ocean turned red with the blood of slaughtered merfolk, but the ritual worked, and the king led the survivors through the underwater gate to Demogorgon's layer of the Abyss. The merfolk remained there for generations, fighting for their lives as the Abyss warped them completely, transforming them into hulking, evil monstrosities. Thus, the first merrow were born.": "他们不知道那是什么，就把神器带给了他们的国王。每一个接触过神像的人都变得疯狂，包括国王，他下令举行祭祀仪式以打开通往深渊的大门。海洋被被屠杀的人鱼的血染红了，但仪式成功了，国王带领幸存者穿过水下的大门，来到了德摩根的深渊层中。人鱼们在那里呆了好几代，在深渊完全扭曲他们的时候为自己的生命而战，把他们变成了巨大的、邪恶的怪物。因此，第一批人鱼诞生了。",
	"Whenever an opportunity presents itself, the Prince of Demons sends merrow back to the Material Plane to wreak havoc in the oceans. The merrow are bullies, attacking all creatures smaller and weaker than themselves.": "只要有机会，恶魔王子就会把人鱼送回物质界，在海洋中肆意破坏。美人鱼是恶霸，攻击所有比自己小和弱的生物。",

	"Metallic dragons covet treasure as do their evil chromatic kin, but they aren't driven as much by greed in their pursuit of wealth. Rather, metallic dragons are driven to investigate and collect, taking unclaimed relics and storing them in their lairs. A metallic dragon's treasure hoard is filled with items that reflect its persona, tell its history, and preserve its memories. Metallic dragons also seek to protect other creatures from dangerous magic. As such, powerful magic items and even evil artifacts are sometimes secreted away in a metallic dragon's hoard.": "金属龙和它们邪恶的铬族亲属一样觊觎宝藏，但它们在追求财富的过程中并没有那么多的贪婪驱动。相反，金属龙被驱使着去调查和收集，拿走无人认领的遗物并将它们储存在自己的巢穴中。金属龙的宝藏中充满了反映其个性的物品，讲述其历史，并保存其记忆。金属龙还寻求保护其他生物免受危险的魔法伤害。因此，强大的魔法物品甚至是邪恶的神器有时也会被藏在金属龙的宝库里。",
	"A metallic dragon can be persuaded to part with an item in its hoard for the greater good. However, another creature's need for or right to the item is often unclear from the dragon's point of view.

	"At some point in their long lives, metallic dragons gain the magical ability to assume the forms of humanoids and beasts. When a dragon learns how to disguise itself, it might immerse itself in other cultures for a time. Some dragons are too shy or paranoid to stray far from their lairs and their treasure hoards, but bolder dragons love to wander city streets in humanoid form, taking in the local culture and cuisine, and amusing themselves by observing how the smaller races live.": "在它们漫长的生命中的某个时刻，金属龙获得了神奇的能力，可以伪装成人类和野兽的形态。当龙学会了如何伪装自己时，它可能会有一段时间沉浸在其他文化中。有些龙过于害羞或偏执，不敢远离它们的巢穴和它们的宝藏，但更大胆的龙喜欢以人形的形式在城市街道上闲逛，了解当地的文化和美食，并通过观察小种族的生活方式来娱乐自己。",
	"Some metallic dragons prefer to stay as far away from civilization as possible so as to not attract enemies. However, this means that they are often far out of touch with current events.": "一些金属龙喜欢尽可能远离文明，以避免吸引敌人。然而，这意味着他们往往与时事远远脱节。",
	"Metallic dragons have long memories, and they form opinions of humanoids based on previous contact with related humanoids. Good dragons can recognize humanoid bloodlines by smell, sniffing out each person they meet and remembering any relatives they have come into contact with over the years. A gold dragon might never suspect duplicity from a cunning villain, assuming that the villain is of the same mind and heart as a good and virtuous grandmother. On the other hand, the dragon might resent a noble paladin whose ancestor stole a silver statue from the dragon's hoard three centuries before.": "金属龙有很长的记忆，它们根据以前与相关人种的接触形成对人种的看法。好的龙可以通过嗅觉识别人形血统，嗅出它们遇到的每个人，并记住它们多年来接触过的任何亲属。一条金龙可能永远不会怀疑一个狡猾的恶棍的两面性，假设这个恶棍与一个善良的、有德行的祖母有着同样的思想和心态。另一方面，龙可能会憎恨一个高贵的圣骑士，他的祖先在三个世纪前从龙的囤积物中偷走了一个银质雕像。",

	"Bahamut seldom interferes in the affairs of mortal creatures, though he makes exceptions to help thwart the machinations of Tiamat the Dragon Queen and her evil brood.

	"Violence and reward are the fundamental drives of a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise one or the other can easily attract them into service.

	"When it changes shape, a mimic excretes an adhesive that helps it seize prey and weapons that touch it. The adhesive is absorbed when the mimic assumes its amorphous form and on parts the mimic uses to move itself.": "当它改变形状时，模仿者会排出一种粘合剂，帮助它抓住接触它的猎物和武器。黏合剂在模仿者变成无定形时被吸收，在模仿者用来移动自己的部位也被吸收。",
	"Mimics live and hunt alone, though they occasionally share their feeding grounds with other creatures.

	"Mind flayers, also called illithids, are the scourge of sentient creatures across countless worlds.

	"Solitary mind flayers are likely rogues and outcasts.

Each place that Gruumsh wanted had already been claimed. The other gods laughed at Gruumsh, but he responded with a furious bellow. Grasping his mighty spear, he laid waste to the mountains, set the forests aflame, and carved great furrows in the fields.

To this day, the orcs wage an endless war on humans, elves, dwarves, and other folk.": " 兽人崇拜格鲁姆什，他是兽人中最强大的神灵，也是他们的创造者。兽人相信，在远古时代，诸神聚集在一起，在他们的追随者之间划分世界。当格鲁姆什要求得到山脉时，他得知这些山脉已被矮人占领。他对森林提出了要求，但那些森林已经被精灵定居。格鲁姆什想要的每一个地方都已经被人占领了。其他神灵嘲笑格鲁姆什，但他用愤怒的吼声回应。他抓着他强大的长矛，毁掉了山脉，点燃了森林，并在田野上开出了大沟。他宣称，这就是兽人的作用，他们要夺取并摧毁其他种族所拒绝的一切。时至今日，兽人对人类、精灵、矮人和其他民族发动了一场无休止的战争。",

The scent of graveyards, city sewers, village middens, and manure-filled animal pens attracts them to civilized areas.": " Otyughs只有在有大量腐肉或垃圾的情况下才能忍受强光。在荒野中，它们居住在停滞的沼泽、充满浮渣的池塘和潮湿的森林三角洲。墓地、城市下水道、村庄垃圾场和充满粪便的动物围栏的气味吸引它们到文明地区。",
	"Since otyughs lack concern for anything but food, their nests sometimes accumulate a variety of treasures shed from their victims and mixed among the junk.": "由于Otyughs除了食物之外对任何东西都不关心，它们的巢穴有时会积累从受害者身上脱落的各种宝物，并混在垃圾中。",
	"Sentient subterranean beings can coexist with otyughs, employing them as garbage disposals. With such plentiful sustenance, otyughs grow fat in their wallows, unmoved by any other drive or desire. This sedentary gluttony makes them reliable guardians. As long as it is fed, an otyugh refrains from attacking other creatures. However, would-be otyugh masters can easily underestimate the quantity of waste, carrion, and meat necessary to keep an otyugh from wandering off in search of food. More than one \"trained\" otyugh has eaten its keeper after devouring all the waste in its wallow.": "有知觉的地下生物可以与tyughs共存，把它们当作垃圾处理剂。有了这样充足的食物，奥特亚格在它们的洞穴中变得肥胖，不受任何其他动力或欲望的影响。这种静止的贪食使它们成为可靠的守护者。只要有食物，奥特亚格就不会攻击其他生物。然而，未来的oteugh主人很容易低估废物、腐肉和肉类的数量，这对防止oteugh四处寻找食物是必要的。不止一只 \"训练有素 \"的tyugh在吞噬了它窝里的所有废物后吃掉了饲养员。",
	"An owlbear's screech echoes through dark valleys and benighted forests, piercing the quiet night to announce the death of its prey. Feathers cover the thick, shaggy coat of its bearlike body, and the limpid pupils of its great round eyes stare furiously from its owlish head.": "一只猫头鹰熊的尖叫声在黑暗的山谷和贫瘠的森林中回荡，刺破宁静的夜晚，宣布猎物的死亡。羽毛覆盖在它熊一样的身体上厚厚的、蓬松的外衣上，它巨大的圆眼睛的清澈的瞳孔从它猫头鹰一样的脑袋上愤怒地盯着。",
	"The owlbear's reputation for ferocity, aggression, stubbornness, and sheer ill temper makes it one of the most feared predators of the wild. There is little, if anything, that a hungry owlbear fears. Even monsters that outmatch an owlbear in size and strength avoid tangling with it, for this creature cares nothing about a foe's superior strength as it attacks without provocation.": "猫头鹰熊以凶猛、好斗、固执和纯粹的坏脾气而闻名，这使它成为野生动物中最令人恐惧的掠食者之一。饥饿的猫头鹰熊几乎不害怕什么，如果有的话。即使是在体型和力量上超过猫头鹰的怪物也会避免与它纠缠，因为这种生物根本不在乎敌人的优势力量，因为它的攻击没有任何挑衅。",
	"An owlbear emerges from its den around sunset and hunts into the darkest hours of the night, hooting or screeching to declare its territory, to search for a mate, or to flush prey into its hunting grounds. These are typically forests familiar to the owlbear, and dense enough to limit its quarry's escape routes.": "猫头鹰熊在日落时分从巢穴中出来，一直到夜里最黑暗的时候才开始捕猎，鸣叫或尖叫来宣布它的领地，寻找配偶，或把猎物赶到它的狩猎场。这些地方通常是猫头鹰熟悉的森林，其密集程度足以限制其猎物的逃跑路线。",
	"An owlbear makes its den in a cave or ruin littered with the bones of its prey. It drags partially devoured kills back to its den, storing portions of the carcass among the surrounding rocks, bushes, and trees. The scent of blood and rotting flesh hangs heavy near an owlbear's lair, attracting scavengers and thus luring more prey.": "猫头鹰熊把它的巢穴建在堆满猎物骨头的山洞或废墟中。它将部分被吞噬的猎物拖回巢穴，将部分尸体存放在周围的岩石、灌木和树木中。血和腐肉的气味在猫头鹰的巢穴附近弥漫，吸引着食腐动物，从而引来更多的猎物。",
	"Owlbears hunt alone or in mated pairs. If quarry is plentiful, a family of owlbears might remain together for longer than is required to rear offspring. Otherwise, they part ways as soon as the young are ready to hunt.": "猫头鹰熊会单独或成对捕猎。如果猎物丰富，一个猫头鹰家族在一起的时间可能会超过养育后代的需要。否则，一旦小熊准备好狩猎，它们就会分道扬镳。",
	"Although they are more intelligent than most animals, owlbears are difficult to tame. However, with enough time, food, and luck, an intelligent creature can train an owlbear to recognize it as a master, making it an unflinching guard or a fast and hardy mount. People of remote frontier settlements have even succeeded at racing owlbears, but spectators bet as often on which owlbear will attack its handler as they do on which will reach the finish line first.": "虽然它们比大多数动物更聪明，但猫头鹰熊很难驯服。然而，只要有足够的时间、食物和运气，聪明的生物就可以训练猫头鹰熊，让它承认自己是主人，让它成为坚定的卫士或快速而坚韧的坐骑。边疆定居点的人们甚至成功地与猫头鹰熊比赛，但观众们经常打赌哪只猫头鹰熊会攻击它的主人，就像他们打赌哪只猫头鹰熊会先到达终点一样。",
	"Elven communities encourage owlbears to den beneath their treetop villages, using the beasts as a natural defense during the night.

A starved owlbear might show up in a gladiatorial arena, ruthlessly eviscerating and devouring its foes before a bloodthirsty audience.": "精灵社区鼓励猫头鹰熊在他们的树顶村庄下筑巢，利用这些野兽作为夜间的自然防御。霍布林人喜欢把猫头鹰熊作为战兽，而山丘巨人和冰霜巨人有时会把猫头鹰熊作为宠物。一只饥饿的猫头鹰可能会出现在角斗场上，在嗜血的观众面前无情地屠杀和吞噬其敌人。",
	"Scholars have long debated the origins of the owlbear. The most common theory is that a demented wizard created the first specimen by crossing a giant owl with a bear. However, venerable elves claim to have known these creatures for thousands of years, and some fey insist that owlbears have always existed in the Feywild.": "学者们长期以来一直在争论猫头鹰熊的起源。最常见的理论是，一个痴呆的巫师将一只巨大的猫头鹰和一只熊杂交，创造了第一个标本。然而，可敬的精灵们声称认识这些生物已有数千年之久，一些费伊人坚持认为猫头鹰熊一直都存在于费伊人的世界中。",
	"The white winged horses known as pegasi soar through the skies, a vision of grace and majesty.

	"Pegasi are highly prized as swift and reliable steeds, being faster and less temperamental than griffons, hippogriffs, and wyverns.

	"Pegasi trace their origins to the Olympian Glades of Arborea, where they soar through the skies of that plane and serve as faithful mounts to the Seldarine, the pantheon of elven gods.

	"The peryton is a bizarre creature that blends the body and wings of a bird of prey with the head of a stag. Its strangest feature is its shadow, which appears humanoid rather than reflecting the creature's physical form. Sages postulate that the first perytons were humans transformed by a hideous curse or magical experiment, but bards tell a different tale of a man whose infidelity caused his scorned wife to cut out the heart of her younger, more beautiful rival and consume it in a ritual intended to forever win her husband's heart. The ritual succeeded until the woman's villainy was exposed. She was hanged for her crime, but the lingering magic of her foul ritual caused the carrion birds that feasted on her corpse to transform into the first perytons.": "Peryton是一种奇怪的生物，它融合了鸷鸟的身体和翅膀与雄鹿的头。它最奇怪的特征是它的影子，看起来像人，而不是反映生物的身体形态。圣人推断，第一个perytons是被可怕的诅咒或魔法实验改变的人类，但吟游诗人讲述了一个不同的故事：一个男人的不忠导致他被蔑视的妻子挖出了她更年轻、更漂亮的竞争对手的心脏，并在一个仪式中吃掉了它，目的是永远赢得她丈夫的心。仪式成功了，直到这个女人的恶行被揭露。她因其罪行而被绞死，但她那肮脏的仪式所带来的挥之不去的魔力使以她的尸体为食的腐肉鸟变成了第一批perytons。",
	"A peryton's reproductive cycle depends on the heart of a freshly killed humanoid. The organ must be consumed by a female peryton before she can reproduce. When a peryton consumes a heart, its shadow changes for a brief time to reflect its true monstrous form. When attacking a humanoid, a peryton is single-minded and relentless, fighting until it or its prey dies.": "一个peryton的繁殖周期取决于一个刚被杀死的人形动物的心脏。雌性peryton在繁衍后代之前，必须吞噬这个器官。当peryton吞噬心脏时，它的影子会在短时间内发生变化，以反映其真正的怪物形态。在攻击人形生物时，peryton会一心一意、毫不留情地战斗，直到它或它的猎物死亡。",

	"Perytons roost atop mountain ridges and lair in high caves. They prey on creatures living or wandering in the vales below, and travelers on lonely mountain roads learn to keep a wary eye on the sky. Because normal weapons are less effective against perytons, the folk of the mountains know to avoid confrontations with these monsters at all costs.": "Perytons在山脊上栖息，在高高的山洞里筑巢。它们捕食生活或游荡在下面山谷中的生物，在孤独的山路上的旅行者要学会警惕地注视着天空。由于普通武器对perytons不太有效，山区的居民知道要不惜一切代价避免与这些怪物发生冲突。",

	"A piercer is the larval form of a roper, and the two creatures often attack in tandem. A rock-like shell encases a piercer's body, giving it the look and texture of a stalactite. That shell protects a soft, slug-like upper body that lets the piercer move across cavern walls and ceilings to position itself for prey. With its eye and mouth closed, the piercer is difficult to distinguish from ordinary rock formations.": "穿刺者是罗珀的幼虫形式，这两种生物经常串联攻击。一个岩石般的外壳包裹着穿孔者的身体，使其具有钟乳石的外观和纹理。这个壳保护着柔软的、像蛞蝓一样的上半身，使穿孔者可以在洞穴的墙壁和天花板上移动，以确定自己对猎物的位置。当它的眼睛和嘴闭上时，穿孔者很难从普通的岩层中分辨出来。",

	"Curious as cats and shy as deer, pixies go where they please. They like to spy on other creatures and can barely contain their excitement around them. The urge to introduce themselves and strike up a friendship is almost overwhelming; only a pixie's fear of being captured or attacked stays its hand. Those who wander through a pixie's glade might never see the creatures, yet hear the occasional giggle, gasp, or sigh.": "小精灵像猫一样好奇，像鹿一样害羞，喜欢去哪里就去哪里。它们喜欢窥视其他生物，在它们身边几乎无法抑制自己的兴奋。介绍自己和建立友谊的冲动几乎是压倒性的；只有小精灵对被抓或被攻击的恐惧才会阻止它的行动。那些在小精灵的树丛中徘徊的人可能永远不会看到这些生物，但却能听到偶尔的咯咯笑声、喘息声或叹息。",

	"While the arrival of visitors piques their curiosity, pixies are too shy to reveal themselves at first. They study the visitors from afar to gauge their temperament or play harmless tricks on them to measure their reactions. For example, pixies might tie a dwarf's boots together, create illusions of strange creatures or treasures, or use dancing lights to lead interlopers astray. If the visitors respond with hostility, the pixies give them a wide berth. If the visitors are good natured, the pixies are likely to be emboldened and more friendly.

When elves appeared in the mortal realm, they clashed with the quaggoths, eventually driving them to near extinction. Only by fleeing deep into the Underdark did the quaggoths survive.": "夸父从来都不是一个开明的物种，但他们并不总是今天这样残酷的地下城居民。在一个遥远的时代，夸父部落作为夜间树栖猎人居住在地表，拥有自己的语言和文化。当精灵出现在凡间时，他们与食人魔发生冲突，最终将它们逼到了濒临灭绝的境地。只有逃到地下世界的深处，夸父才得以生存。",
	"As they passed the ages deep beneath the world, the quaggoths' fur lost its color and their vision adapted to the darkness, even as the constant danger and weird magic of their new realm transformed them. Turning increasingly brutal and savage, they ate whatever food they could find-and when they could not find it, they preyed on each other. As cannibalism became part of their culture, their past was abandoned.": "随着他们在世界地下深处的岁月流逝，树獭的皮毛失去了颜色，他们的视力也适应了黑暗，即使新领域的持续危险和怪异的魔法也改变了他们。他们变得越来越残忍和野蛮，他们吃任何他们能找到的食物--当他们找不到食物时，他们就互相捕食。随着吃人成为他们文化的一部分，他们的过去被抛弃了。",
	"The ancient enmity between quaggoths and surface elves makes them easy converts to the dark elf cause. In recent years, the drow have taken an interest in breeding quaggoths, encouraging their ferocity while strengthening their obedience. Wealthy drow houses have legions of quaggoths at their command. Even worse, the drow cultivate the quaggoths' hatred of the elves by leading them on surface raids against known elven enclaves.": "夸父和地表精灵之间古老的敌意使他们很容易皈依黑暗精灵的怀抱。近年来，鸦人对繁殖夸父的兴趣浓厚，鼓励它们的凶猛，同时加强它们的服从性。富裕的乌鸦家族拥有听从他们指挥的夸父军团。更糟糕的是，鸦人通过带领它们对已知的精灵飞地进行地面袭击，来培养奎格特人对精灵的仇恨。",
	"Some quaggoths absorb psionic energy that suffuses certain parts of the Underdark. When a tribe discovers that one of its own has inherited such powers, they press it into the role of tribal shaman, or thonot.": "一些夸父吸收了弥漫在暗黑世界某些地方的幻觉能量。当一个部落发现自己的一个人继承了这种力量，他们就会把它按在部落萨满的位置上，或者叫thonot。",
	"A thonots keep a tribe's lore and ensures its superiority against enemies. A thonot that fails the tribe is slain and devoured in a cannibalistic ritual, in the hope that its power passes to another more worthy quaggoth.": "Thonots保存着一个部落的传说，并确保其在对抗敌人时具有优势。一个失败的索诺特会被杀死，并在食人仪式中被吞噬，希望它的力量能传递给另一个更有价值的夸父。",
	"Generations of hunting venomous subterranean creatures and perpetual exposure to the molds and fungi that grow in the depths have forced quaggoths to adapt immunities to poisons of all kinds.": "一代代地猎杀有毒的地下生物，并长期暴露在生长在深处的霉菌和真菌中，迫使夸父适应对各种毒药的免疫力。",
	"A spore servant is any Large or smaller creature brought back to life by the animating spores of a myconid sovereign. A creature that was never flesh and blood to begin with (such as a construct, elemental, ooze, plant, or undead) can't be turned into a spore servant.": "孢子仆人是任何大型或小型生物，通过菌类君主的灵动孢子而复活。一个从一开始就没有血肉之躯的生物（如构筑物、元素、渗出物、植物或亡灵）不能被变成孢子仆人。",

	"If the servant has no other means of dealing damage, it can use its fists or limbs to make unarmed strikes. On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to {@dice 1d4} + the servant's Strength modifier, or, if the servant is Large, {@dice 2d4} + its Strength modifier.": "如果仆人没有其他的伤害手段，它可以用它的拳头或四肢来进行徒手打击。一旦命中，徒手攻击会造成相当于{@dice 1d4}+ 仆人力量修正值的打击伤害，如果仆人是大块头，则为{@dice 2d4}+ 其力量修正值。",

More powerful demons use quasits as spies and messengers when they aren't devouring them or pulling them apart to pass the time.": "类人猿在下层世界出没。他们身体虚弱，一直躲在阴影中策划恶作剧和邪恶的行为。更强大的恶魔在不吞噬他们或把他们拉开来打发时间的时候，会利用类人作为间谍和信使。",

	"The rakshasa employs delicacy and misdirection in its pursuit of dominion over others. Few creatures ever see the fiend in its true form, for it can take on any guise it wants, although it prefers to masquerade as someone powerful or influential: a noble, cardinal, or rich merchant, for example. A rakshasa's true form combines the features of a human and a tiger, with one noteworthy deformity: its palms are where the backs of the hands would be on a human.": "罗刹在追求对他人的统治时采用了微妙和误导的方法。很少有生物看到罗刹的真面目，因为它可以伪装成任何它想要的样子，尽管它更喜欢伪装成有权势或有影响力的人：比如说贵族、红衣主教或富商。罗刹的真实形态结合了人类和老虎的特征，有一个值得注意的畸形：它的手掌在人类的手背上。",
	" Rakshasas originated long ago in the Nine Hells, when powerful devils created a dark ritual to free their essence from their fiendish bodies in order to escape the Lower Planes. A rakshasa enters the Material Plane to feed its appetite for humanoid flesh and evil schemes. It selects its prey with care, taking pains to keep its presence in the world a secret.": " 罗刹起源于很久以前的九层地狱，当时强大的魔鬼创造了一种黑暗的仪式，将他们的精气神从恶魔般的身体中释放出来，以便逃离下层世界。罗刹进入物质界以满足它对人形肉体和邪恶计划的胃口。它小心翼翼地选择它的猎物，不遗余力地保持它在这个世界上的存在是一个秘密。",

	"The most covetous of the true dragons, red dragons tirelessly seek to increase their treasure hoards. They are exceptionally vain, even for dragons, and their conceit is reflected in their proud bearing and their disdain for other creatures. The odor of sulfur and pumice surrounds a red dragon, whose swept-back horns and spinal frill define its silhouette. Its beaked snout vents smoke at all times, and its eyes dance with flame when it is angry. Its wings are the longest of any chromatic dragon, and have a blue-black tint along the trailing edge that resembles metal burned blue by fire.": "红龙是最贪婪的真龙，他们不知疲倦地寻求增加他们的宝藏。即使对于龙来说，它们也是非常虚荣的，它们的自负反映在它们骄傲的姿态和对其他生物的蔑视上。硫磺和浮石的气味围绕着红龙，它的后掠角和脊柱的褶皱决定了它的轮廓。它有喙的鼻子随时都会喷出烟雾，愤怒时眼睛会跳出火焰。它的翅膀是所有色龙中最长的，沿着尾部边缘有一种蓝黑色的色调，就像被火烧成蓝色的金属。",

Its pupils also fade as it ages, and the oldest red dragons have eyes that resemble molten lava orbs.": "红龙wyrmling的鳞片是明亮有光泽的猩红色，随着龙的年龄增长，会变成暗淡的深红色，并变得像金属一样厚实和坚固。它的瞳孔也会随着年龄的增长而变淡，最古老的红龙的眼睛就像熔岩球。",
	"Red dragons prefer mountainous terrain, badlands, and any other locale where they can perch high and survey their domain. Their preference for mountains brings them into conflict with the hill-dwelling copper dragons from time to time.": "红龙喜欢山地、坏境，以及其他任何它们可以栖息在高处并考察其领域的地方。它们对山地的偏爱使它们不时地与居住在山上的铜龙发生冲突。",
	"Red dragons fly into destructive rages and act on impulse when angered. They are so ferocious and vengeful that they are regarded as the archetypical evil dragon by many cultures.": "红龙在被激怒时，会飞向破坏性的愤怒，并冲动行事。它们是如此的凶猛和复仇，以至于它们被许多文化认为是典型的恶龙。",
	"No other dragon comes close to the arrogance of the red dragon. These creatures see themselves as kings and emperors, and view the rest of dragonkind as inferior. Believing that they are chosen by Tiamat to rule in her name, red dragons consider the world and every creature in it as theirs to command.": "没有其他龙能接近红龙的傲慢。这些生物视自己为国王和帝王，并视其他龙族为低等生物。红龙相信他们是被提亚马特选中，以她的名义进行统治，认为世界和其中的每一个生物都是他们可以指挥的。",

They are most interested in news about other red dragons, with which they compete constantly for status.": "红龙是激烈的领地主义和孤立主义。然而，它们渴望了解更广阔世界的事件，并利用较小的生物作为线人、信使和间谍。它们对其他红龙的消息最感兴趣，它们不断地与其他红龙争夺地位。",
	"When it requires servants, a red dragon demands fealty from chaotic evil humanoids. If allegiance isn't forthcoming, it slaughters a tribe's leaders and claims lordship over the survivors. Creatures serving a red dragon live in constant terror of being roasted and eaten for displeasing it. They spend most of their time fawning over the creature in an attempt to stay alive.": "当它需要仆人时，红龙要求混乱的邪恶人类效忠。如果不效忠，它就会屠杀一个部落的首领，并要求对幸存者拥有领主地位。为红龙服务的生物一直生活在恐惧之中，害怕因为不高兴而被烤焦和吃掉。他们大部分时间都在向红龙献媚，试图保住性命。",
	"Red dragons value wealth above all else, and their treasure hoards are legendary. They covet anything of monetary value, and can often judge the worth of a bauble to within a copper piece at a glance.

	"A red dragon knows the value and provenance of every item in its hoard, along with each item's exact location.

	"Red dragons lair in high mountains or hills, dwelling in caverns under snow-capped peaks, or within the deep halls of abandoned mines and dwarven strongholds. Caves with volcanic or geothermal activity are the most highly prized red dragon lairs, creating hazards that hinder intruders and letting searing heat and volcanic gases wash over a dragon as it sleeps. With its hoard well protected deep within the lair, a red dragon spends as much of its time outside the mountain as in it. For a red dragon, the great heights of the world are the throne from which it can look out to survey all it controls-and the wider world it seeks to control.": "红龙的巢穴在高山或丘陵上，居住在白雪皑皑的山峰下的洞穴里，或者在废弃的矿场和矮人据点的深山大厅里。有火山或地热活动的洞穴是最珍贵的红龙巢穴，它创造了阻碍入侵者的危险，让灼热和火山气体在龙睡觉时冲刷它。由于它的囤积物在巢穴深处得到很好的保护，红龙在山外的时间和在山里的时间一样多。对红龙来说，世界的巨大高度是它的宝座，它可以从那里眺望它所控制的一切，以及它试图控制的更广阔的世界。",
	"Throughout the lair complex, servants erect monuments to the dragon's power, telling the grim story of its life, the enemies it has slain, and the nations it has conquered.": "在整个巢穴建筑群中，仆人们为龙的力量竖起了纪念碑，讲述它的生活、它所杀死的敌人和它所征服的国家的残酷故事。",
	"When a red slaad claws a humanoid creature, it can inject an egg from a gland under one of its claws. The egg works its way into its host and gestates, eventually forming a slaad tadpole. Such a tadpole then eats its way out of the host's body, feeds on the host's remains, and then seeks any other fresh meat it can find. The tadpole transforms into a fully grown blue slaad-or green slaad if the host had the ability to cast 3rd level spells or higher-within {@dice 2d12} hours.": "当红腹锦鲤抓住一个人形生物时，它可以从它的一个爪子下面的腺体注入一个卵。卵进入其宿主体内并进行孕育，最终形成一个蝌蚪。这样的蝌蚪会从宿主的身体里吃出来，以宿主的遗体为食，然后寻找它能找到的任何其他新鲜肉类。蝌蚪在{@dice 2d12}小时内变成一只完全长大的蓝色蝌蚪--或者绿色蝌蚪，如果宿主有能力施展三级以上的法术的话。",

	"Remorhazes live in arctic climes, preying on elk, polar bears, and other creatures sharing their territory. They can't tolerate warm weather, having adapted to the cold by generating a furnace-like heat within their bodies. When hunting, a remorhaz burrows deep below the snow and ice and lies in wait for the faint vibrations created by a creature moving above it. While hidden under the ice and snow, it can lower its body temperature so that it doesn't melt its cover.": "雷莫哈兹生活在北极地区，捕食麋鹿、北极熊和其他分享其领土的生物。它们不能忍受温暖的天气，通过在体内产生火炉般的热量来适应寒冷。狩猎时，雷莫哈兹深埋在冰雪之下，等待上方生物移动时产生的微弱振动。当隐藏在冰雪之下时，它可以降低自己的体温，以便不至于融化其覆盖物。",
	"Frost giant hunters scour the icy wastes for remorhaz nests and eggs. The giants prize young remorhazes, which can be trained from hatching to obey commands and guard the giants' icy citadels. Unlike fully grown specimens, young remorhazes gnaw on their victims instead of swallowing them whole.": "冰霜巨人猎人在冰冷的荒原上寻找雷莫哈兹的巢穴和蛋。巨人珍视幼小的雷莫哈兹，它们从孵化开始就可以接受训练，服从命令，守护巨人的冰雪堡垒。与完全成熟的标本不同，年轻的雷莫哈兹会啃食它们的受害者，而不是把它们整个吞下。",
	"A revenant forms from the soul of a mortal who met a cruel and undeserving fate. It claws its way back into the world to seek revenge against the one who wronged it. The revenant reclaims its mortal body and superficially resembles a zombie. However, instead of lifeless eyes, a revenant's eyes burn with resolve and flare in the presence of its adversary. If the revenant's original body was destroyed or is otherwise unavailable, the spirit of the revenant enters another humanoid corpse. Regardless of the body the revenant uses as a vessel, its adversary always recognizes the revenant for what it truly is.": "一个复仇者从一个遭遇残酷和不值得的命运的凡人的灵魂中形成。它张牙舞爪地回到这个世界上，寻找对它不利的人进行报复。复仇者重新获得其凡人的身体，表面上看与僵尸相似。然而，复仇者的眼睛不是毫无生气的，而是燃烧着决心，在其对手面前耀武扬威。如果复仇者原来的身体被摧毁或无法使用，复仇者的灵魂会进入另一具人形尸体。无论复仇者用什么身体作为容器，它的对手总是能认出复仇者的真面目。",
	"A revenant has only one year to exact revenge. When its adversary dies, or if the revenant fails to kill its adversary before its time runs out, it crumbles to dust and its soul fades into the afterlife. If its foe is too powerful for the revenant to destroy on its own, it seeks worthy allies to help it fulfill its quest.": "复仇者只有一年的时间来进行报复。当它的对手死亡时，或者如果复仇者未能在它的时间结束前杀死它的对手，它就会化为尘土，其灵魂消逝在来世。如果它的敌人过于强大，复仇者无法独自消灭，它就会寻找有价值的盟友来帮助它完成任务。",
	"No magic can hide a creature pursued by a revenant, which always knows the direction and distance between it and the target of its vengeance. In cases where the revenant seeks revenge against more than one adversary, it pursues them one at a time, starting with the creature that dealt it the killing blow. If the revenant's body is destroyed, its soul flies forth to seek out a new corpse in which to resume its hunt.": "任何魔法都无法掩盖被复仇者追捕的生物，复仇者总是知道它和它的复仇目标之间的方向和距离。如果复仇者要向一个以上的对手复仇，它会一次追击一个，从给它致命一击的生物开始。如果复仇者的身体被摧毁，它的灵魂就会飞去寻找一具新的尸体来继续它的狩猎。",

	"At first sight, a roc's silhouette looks much like any other bird of prey. As it descends, however, its unearthly size becomes terrifyingly clear. In flight, a roc's wingspan spreads two hundred feet or more. At rest, perched upon the mountain peaks that are its home, this monstrous bird rivals the oldest dragons in size.": "乍一看，大鹏鸟的轮廓看起来很像其他猎物的鸟。然而，随着它的下降，它那超凡脱俗的体型就变得非常可怕了。在飞行时，大鹏鸟的翼展可达两百英尺或更远。在休息时，栖息在作为其家园的山峰上，这种怪异的鸟在尺寸上可以与最古老的龙相媲美。",

	"Though cloud giants and storm giants sometimes tame these great birds, rocs treat even giants as potential prey. They fly great distances in search of food, soaring high above the clouds to reach their favored hunting grounds. A roc seldom hunts swift or small creatures, and it ignores towns and forests where prey can easily take cover. When it locates a large and slow-moving target such as a giant, a whale, or an elephant, a roc dives down to snatch its prey in its massive talons.": "虽然云中巨人和风暴巨人有时会驯服这些伟大的鸟类，但大鹏鸟甚至将巨人视为潜在的猎物。它们会飞到很远的地方去寻找食物，在云层上高高飞起，到达它们喜欢的狩猎场。鹏鸟很少猎杀敏捷或小型的生物，也不理会城镇和森林，因为那里的猎物很容易躲避。当它找到一个大的和缓慢移动的目标，如巨人、鲸鱼或大象时，大鹏鸟会俯冲下来，用它巨大的爪子抓取猎物。",
	"Rocs are solitary creatures that can live for centuries. They lair in nests made from trees, tents, broken ships, and the remains of caravans they carry off, placing these massive tangles in mountain clefts out of the reach of lesser creatures.": "大鹏鸟是孤独的生物，可以活上几个世纪。它们的巢穴由树木、帐篷、破船和它们运走的商队残骸组成，将这些巨大的缠结物放在山间的裂缝中，不让小生物触及。",

More rarely, a nest holds eggs that are taller than a human, produced by the rocs' infrequent mating.": "有时，大鹏鸟的巢穴里有它们袭击的商队或船只上的宝物，但这些生物对这些小玩意毫不在意。更少见的是，窝里有比人还高的蛋，这是大鹏鸟不经常交配而产生的。",

	"The roper is an evolved, mature form of piercer, with which it shares its rock-like appearance and hunting tactics. A roper can hold still for long hours, shutting its single eye to look like nothing more than a mundane formation of rock. Creatures that come too close are surprised when that eye snaps open and sticky tendrils shoot out to seize them. The roper then makes horrible guttural sounds as it reels in its struggling victims, drawing them close for the fatal bite of its stony teeth.": "罗珀是一种进化的、成熟的穿山甲形式，它与穿山甲有着岩石般的外表和狩猎策略。罗珀可以长时间保持不动，闭上它的单眼，看起来就像一个平凡的岩石阵而已。靠近的生物会感到惊讶，因为它的眼睛会突然睁开，粘稠的卷须会射出，抓住它们。然后，罗珀发出可怕的咕咕声，它卷住挣扎的受害者，拉近他们的距离，让他们被它的石质牙齿咬死。",
	"A roper can digest anything it eats with the exception of platinum, gemstones, and magic items, which can sometimes be retrieved from the creature's gizzard after death. A roper's digestive juices are also valuable, fetching a high price from alchemists who use them as a solvent.": "除了铂金、宝石和魔法物品外，罗珀可以消化它所吃的任何东西，这些东西有时可以在死后从生物的胃里取出来。松鼠的消化液也很有价值，可以从将其作为溶剂的炼金术士那里获得高价。",
	"A roper has six nubs set along its body, through which it extrudes sticky tendrils that bond to whatever they touch. Each tendril sends out hair-like growths that penetrate a creature's flesh and sap its strength, so the victim can struggle only weakly as the roper reels it in. If a tendril is cut through or broken, the roper produces a new one to replace it.": "罗布泊沿着它的身体有六个小圆点，它通过这些小圆点挤出粘性卷须，与它们所接触到的东西结合在一起。每根卷须都会发出像头发一样的生长物，穿透生物的肉体并消耗其力量，因此受害者只能在绳索的缠绕下无力地挣扎。如果一根卷须被切开或折断，绳索者会产生一个新的卷须来代替它。",

A rust monster can smell its food at a distance, immediately dashing toward the scent's source to corrode and consume the object.": "它们无视没有携带这种金属的生物，但对携带钢制武器和盔甲的生物会变得很有攻击性。锈怪可以在远处闻到它的食物，立即冲向气味的源头，腐蚀并吞噬物体。",
	"A rust monster doesn't care if the rust it consumes comes from a spike or a sword. Adventurers can distract the creature by dropping ferrous objects behind them.": "锈怪并不关心它所消耗的铁锈是来自钉子还是剑。冒险者可以通过在他们身后投掷铁质物品来分散怪物的注意力。",
	"Rust monsters are rarely found in large numbers, preferring to hunt alone or in small groups. They meander along tunnels, moving from cave to cave in their tireless search for ferrous metals to consume. Their wanderings often bring them into contact with other Underdark denizens that find them harmless or unappetizing. Thus, rust monsters may be found in close proximity to other subterranean monsters. If they are well treated and well fed, they can also become friendly companions or pets.": "锈迹斑斑的怪物很少被大量发现，它们更喜欢单独或以小团体的形式进行狩猎。它们沿着隧道蜿蜒前行，从一个洞穴到另一个洞穴，不知疲倦地寻找可供食用的黑色金属。它们的游荡经常使它们与其他地下城居民接触，这些居民认为它们无害或不讨人喜欢。因此，铁锈怪可能会在靠近其他地下怪物的地方被发现。如果它们受到良好的对待和喂养，它们也可以成为友好的伙伴或宠物。",
	"Across fog-shrouded coasts or endless ocean swells, an ominous drone sounded on a conch shell chills the blood of all who hear it. This is the sound of the sahuagin hunting horn-a call to raid and battle. Coastal settlers refer to sahuagin as \"sea devils,\" for sahuagin have no compassion in them, slaughtering the crews of ships and decimating coastal villages.": "在雾气笼罩的海岸或无尽的海浪中，海螺壳上响起的不祥之音让所有听到它的人感到心寒。这就是萨瓦金人的狩猎号角声--突袭和战斗的号角。沿海定居者将萨瓦金人称为 \"海魔\"，因为萨瓦金人没有任何怜悯之心，他们屠杀船只的船员，毁灭沿海村庄。",
	"Sahuagin are a predatory, piscine race that ventures from the ocean's black depths to hunt the creatures of the shallows and shore.

	"The sahuagin might control the oceans if not for the presence of their mortal enemies, the aquatic elves. Wars between the two races have raged for centuries across the coasts and seas of the world, disrupting maritime trade and drawing other races into the bloody conflict.": "如果不是因为他们致命的敌人--水生精灵的存在，萨瓦金人可能会控制海洋。这两个种族之间的战争已经在世界的海岸和海洋上肆虐了几个世纪，扰乱了海上贸易，并将其他种族卷入血腥的冲突。",
	"So intense is sahuagin hatred for the aquatic elves that the sea devils have adapted to combat their ancient foes. A sahuagin born near enough to an aquatic elf community can enter the world as a malenti-a sahuagin that physically resembles an aquatic elf in every way.

	"The sahuagin put the malenti to good use as spies and assassins in aquatic elf cities and the societies of other creatures that pose a threat to sahuagin.

Even approaching a salamander is dangerous, since flesh blisters and burns in its proximity.": "蝾螈会产生强烈的热量，当它们战斗时，它们的武器会发出红色的光芒，一接触就会烧毁敌人的身体。即使接近蝾螈也是危险的，因为肉体在其附近会起水泡和烧伤。",
	"This inherent heat is an asset to salamanders' skill as smiths, allowing them to soften and shape iron and steel with their bare hands.

	"Satyrs crave the strongest drink, the most fragrant spices, and the most dizzying dances. A satyr feels starved when it can't indulge itself, and it goes to great lengths to sate its desires. It might kidnap a fine minstrel to hear lovely songs, sneak through a well-defended garden to gaze upon a beautiful lad or lass, or infiltrate a palace to taste the finest food in the land. Satyrs allow no festivity to pass them by. They partake in any holiday they've heard of. Civilizations of the world have enough festivals and holy days among them to justify nonstop celebration.": "萨提尔渴望喝最烈的酒，吃最香的香料，跳最令人眼花缭乱的舞蹈。当萨提尔不能放纵自己时，它就会感到饥饿，并不惜一切代价来满足自己的欲望。它可能会绑架一个优秀的吟游诗人来聆听动听的歌曲，偷偷穿过一个防御严密的花园来凝视一个美丽的小伙子或小姑娘，或者潜入一个宫殿来品尝这个国家最好的食物。萨提尔不允许任何节日与他们擦肩而过。他们参加任何他们听说过的节日。世界上的文明有足够的节日和圣日来证明不停地庆祝。",

	" A scarecrow is animated by the bound spirit of a slain evil creature, granting it purpose and mobility. It is this uncanny presence from beyond death that allows a scarecrow to inspire fear in those it gazes upon. Hags and witches often bind scarecrows with the spirits of demons, but any evil spirit will do. Although aspects of the spirit's personality might surface, a scarecrow's spirit doesn't recall the memories it had as a creature, and its will is focused solely on serving its creator. If its creator dies, the spirit inhabiting a scarecrow either continues to follow its last commands, seeks revenge for its creator's death, or destroys itself.": " 稻草人是由一个被杀的邪恶生物的束缚的精神所激活的，赋予它目的和流动性。正是这种来自死亡之外的不可思议的存在，使稻草人能够在它所凝视的人身上激发出恐惧。巫婆和女巫经常用恶魔的灵魂捆绑稻草人，但任何恶灵都可以。虽然精神的某些方面可能会浮出水面，但稻草人的精神不会回忆起它作为生物时的记忆，它的意志只专注于为其创造者服务。如果它的创造者死了，居住在稻草人身上的精神要么继续遵循其最后的命令，要么为其创造者的死亡寻求报复，要么自我毁灭。",

As a shadow drains its victim's strength and physical form, the victim's shadow darkens and begins to move of its own volition. In death, the creature's shadow breaks free, becoming a new undead shadow hungry for more life to consume.": "从黑暗中，影子伸出手来，吸食生物的生命力。它们可以吞噬任何生物，但它们尤其被未被邪恶污染的生物所吸引。一个过着善良和虔诚生活的生物，会把它最卑微的冲动和最强烈的诱惑丢到黑暗中，在那里影子会感到饥饿。当影子耗尽其受害者的力量和身体形态时，受害者的影子会变暗，并开始自行移动。在死亡中，生物的影子挣脱出来，成为一个新的不死影子，渴望更多的生命被吞噬。",
	"If a creature from which a shadow has been created somehow returns to life, its undead shadow senses the return. The shadow might seek its \"parent\" to vex or slay.

	"Shadow demons all but disappear in the darkness, and they can creep about without making a sound. A shadow demon uses its insubstantial claws to feast on its victim's fears, to taste its memories, and drink in its doubts. Bright light harries this fiend and shows its distinct shape, resolving it from a blur of darkness to a winged humanoid creature whose lower body trails off into nothing, and whose claws rend a victim's mind.": "影子恶魔几乎消失在黑暗中，它们可以悄悄地走动而不发出任何声音。影魔用它那没有实体的爪子来吞食它的受害者的恐惧，品尝它的记忆，喝下它的疑虑。明亮的光线会骚扰这种恶魔，并显示出它独特的形状，将它从模糊的黑暗中分辨出来，变成一个有翅膀的人形生物，它的下半身会拖到无影无踪，它的爪子会撕裂受害者的心灵。",

	"The transformation to a shadow dragon happens over a period of years, during which time a dragon's scales lose their luster and fade to a charcoal hue. Its leathery wings become translucent, its eyes paling to pools of opalescent gray. Shadow dragons find sunlight abhorrent, and they are weaker in bright light than they are in darkness. Darkness makes the dragon fade to a spectral shadow of its former self. The magical nature of dragons holds an attraction for the Shadowfell, which seems somehow to crave the might and majesty of these great reptiles. The Shadowfell also has a dispiriting effect on its denizens, such that the longer a creature remains on the plane, the more it accepts the plane's malaise. As months and years pass for a dragon on the Shadowfell, it becomes aware of the transformation being wrought upon it, and yet can do nothing to prevent it.": "转变为影子龙需要几年的时间，在此期间，龙的鳞片会失去光泽并褪去木炭的颜色。它的皮革翅膀变得半透明，它的眼睛苍白成乳白色的灰色。影龙觉得阳光很可怕，它们在强光下比在黑暗中更弱。黑暗使龙褪去了它以前的影子。龙的神奇性质对影子城有一种吸引力，它似乎在某种程度上渴望这些伟大的爬行动物的力量和威严。阴影城对它的居民也有一种消沉的影响，一个生物在这个平面上停留的时间越长，它就越能接受这个平面的萎靡不振。随着时间的推移，龙在暗影之城的时间越来越长，它开始意识到自己正在发生的变化，但却无法阻止它。",
	"A shadow dragon is so suffused with the power of the Shadowfell that even a return to the Material Plane can't undo its transformation. Some shadow dragons attempt to lure other creatures from the mortal realm back to the Shadowfell to keep them company, at least until they tire of their guests and devour them. Others are happy to leave the Shadowfell behind forever, understanding that treasure and power are easier to come by in the Material Plane.": "影龙是如此的充斥着影域的力量，即使回到物质世界也无法解除它的转变。一些影龙试图将其他生物从凡间引回影子城，与它们为伴，至少在它们厌倦了它们的客人并吞噬它们之前。其他人则乐于永远离开暗影城，因为他们知道在物质世界更容易得到财宝和力量。",
	"Only a true dragon can transform into a shadow dragon, and only if it is born in the Shadowfell or remains there for several years.

	"Composed of decaying leaves, vines, roots, and other natural swamp and forest compost, shamblers can blend into their environs. Because they move slowly, they rarely attempt to pursue and catch creatures.

	" A shambling mound results from a phenomenon in which lightning or fey magic invigorates an otherwise ordinary swamp plant.

Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.": "每个盾牌守护者都有一个与之神奇相连的护身符。一个盾牌守护者只能有一个相应的护身符，如果该护身符被毁，盾牌守护者会被（%0%），直到创建一个替代的护身符。盾牌守护者的护身符如果没有被佩戴或携带，就会受到直接攻击。它有AC10，10点命中率，并对毒药和精神伤害免疫。制作一个护身符需要1周的时间，需要花费1,000金币的组件。",
	"A shield guardian's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the guardian to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.": "盾牌守护者的唯一重点是保护护身符的佩戴者。护身符的佩戴者可以命令守护者攻击它的敌人或保护佩戴者免受攻击。如果攻击威胁到佩戴者的身体，护盾可以用魔法将攻击吸收到自己的身体里，即使是在远处。",
	"A spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.": "施法者可以在护盾中储存一个单一的法术，然后在命令下或特定条件下施展法术。许多巫师被敌人弄得束手无策，但当它的护盾释放出强大的魔法力量时，却让这些敌人大吃一惊。",
	"Because a shield guardian's ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create shield guardians for them. At the same time, a shield guardian makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.": "由于盾牌守护者的所有权可以通过将其匹配的护身符给另一个生物而转移，一些巫师从王子、贵族和犯罪集团的领主那里收取高昂的费用来为他们创造盾牌守护者。同时，盾牌守护者对任何杀死它的主人并取得其护身符的人来说都是一个强大的奖励。",
	"A shield guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "盾牌守护者不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"A shrieker is a human-sized mushroom that emits a piercing screech to drive off creatures that disturb it. Other creatures use the fungi as an alarm to signal the approach of prey, and various intelligent races of the Underdark cultivate shriekers on the outskirts of their communities to discourage trespassers.": "尖叫者是一种人类大小的蘑菇，会发出刺耳的尖叫声来驱赶打扰它的生物。其他生物利用这种真菌作为猎物接近的信号，暗黑世界的各种智慧种族在其社区的外围种植尖叫者，以阻止入侵者。",

	"A silver dragon shimmers as if sculpted from pure metal, its face given a noble cast by its high eyes and sweeping beard-like chin spikes. A spiny frill rises high over its head, tracing down its neck to the tip of its tail. A silver wyrmling's scales are blue-gray with silver highlights. As the dragon approaches adulthood, its color gradually brightens until its individual scales are barely visible. As a silver dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble orbs of mercury.": "一条银龙闪闪发光，仿佛是由纯金属雕刻而成的，它的脸因其高大的眼睛和横扫的胡须状下巴而显得格外高贵。一条带刺的流苏在它的头上高高扬起，沿着它的脖子一直延伸到尾巴的顶端。银龙的鳞片是蓝灰色的，有银色的亮点。当银龙接近成年时，它的颜色逐渐变亮，直到它的个别鳞片几乎不可见。随着银龙年龄的增长，它的瞳孔逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像水银的球体。",
	"Silver dragons believe that living a moral life involves doing good deeds and ensuring that one's actions cause no undeserved harm to other sentient beings. They don't take it upon themselves to root out evil, as gold and bronze dragons do, but they will gladly oppose creatures that dare to commit evil acts or harm the innocent.": "银龙认为，过上有道德的生活需要做善事，并确保自己的行为不会对其他有生命的人造成不应有的伤害。他们并不像金龙和铜龙那样以铲除邪恶为己任，但他们会很乐意反对那些敢于实施邪恶行为或伤害无辜的生物。",
	"Silver dragons enjoy the company of other silver dragons. Their only true friendships outside their own kin arise in the company of humanoids, and many silver dragons spend as much time in humanoid form as they do in draconic form. A silver dragon adopts a benign humanoid persona such as a kindly old sage or a young wanderer, and it often has mortal companions with whom it develops strong friendships.": "银龙喜欢与其他银龙为伴。他们在自己的亲属之外唯一真正的友谊来自于人形生物的陪伴，许多银龙花在人形生物上的时间和花在龙形生物上的时间一样多。银龙会采用一个良性的人形角色，如一个善良的老圣人或一个年轻的流浪者，而且它经常有凡人的伙伴，并与他们建立了深厚的友谊。",
	"Silver dragons must step away from their humanoid lives on a regular basis, returning to their true forms to mate and rear offspring, or to tend to their hoards and personal affairs. Because many lose track of time while away, they sometimes return to find that their companions have grown old or died. Silver dragons often end up befriending several generations of humanoids within a single family as a result.": "银龙必须定期离开它们的人形生活，回到它们的真身去交配和养育后代，或者去照顾它们的囤积物和个人事务。由于许多人在离开时忘记了时间，他们有时回来时发现他们的同伴已经变老或死亡。银龙常常因此而与一个家庭中的几代人结成朋友。",
	" Silver dragons befriend humanoids of all races, but shorter-lived races such as humans spark their curiosity in a way the longer-lived elves and dwarves don't. Humans have a drive and zest for life that silver dragons find fascinating.": " 银龙与所有种族的人类交好，但人类等寿命较短的种族激发了它们的好奇心，而寿命较长的精灵和矮人则没有。人类有一种驱动力和对生活的热情，银龙觉得很迷人。",
	"Silver dragons love to possess relics of humanoid history. This includes the great piles of coins they covet, minted by current and fallen humanoid empires, as well as art objects and fine jewelery crafted by numerous races. Other treasures that make up their hoards can include intact ships, the remains of kings and queens, thrones, the crown jewels of ancient empires, inventions and contraptions, and monoliths carried from the ruins of fallen cities.": "银龙喜欢拥有类人族历史的遗物。这包括他们所觊觎的大量硬币，这些硬币是由当前的和已灭亡的类人帝国铸造的，以及由众多种族制作的艺术品和精美的珠宝。构成他们囤积的其他宝物还包括完整的船只、国王和王后的遗体、王座、古代帝国的皇冠珠宝、发明和装置，以及从堕落城市的废墟中搬运出来的石碑。",
	"Silver dragons dwell among the clouds, making their lairs on secluded cold mountain peaks. Though many are comfortable in natural cavern complexes or abandoned mines, silver dragons covet the lost outposts of humanoid civilization. An abandoned mountaintop citadel or a remote tower raised by a long-dead wizard is the sort of lair that every silver dragon dreams of.": "银龙居住在云层中，在隐蔽的寒冷山峰上做他们的巢穴。虽然许多人在天然的洞穴群或废弃的矿井中很舒服，但银龙却觊觎着人类文明的失落前哨。废弃的山顶堡垒或由死去已久的巫师建造的偏远塔楼是每个银龙梦想的巢穴。",
	"Skeletons arise when animated by dark magic. They heed the summons of spellcasters who call them from their stony tombs and ancient battlefields, or rise of their own accord in places saturated with death and loss, awakened by stirrings of necromantic energy or the presence of corrupting evil.": "骷髅在黑暗魔法的作用下出现。它们听从法术师的召唤，将它们从石墓和古战场中召唤出来，或者在充满死亡和损失的地方主动崛起，被死灵能量的搅动或腐化的邪恶所唤醒。",
	"Whatever sinister force awakens a skeleton infuses its bones with a dark vitality, adhering joint to joint and reassembling dismantled limbs. This energy motivates a skeleton to move and think in a rudimentary fashion, though only as a pale imitation of the way it behaved in life. An animated skeleton retains no connection to its past, although resurrecting a skeleton restores it body and soul, banishing the hateful undead spirit that empowers it.": "不管是什么邪恶的力量唤醒了骷髅，都会给它的骨骼注入一种黑暗的活力，使关节与关节之间紧密相连，并重新组合被拆散的肢体。这种能量促使骨架以最基本的方式移动和思考，尽管只是对其生前行为方式的苍白模仿。一个有生命的骷髅与它的过去没有任何联系，尽管复活一个骷髅可以恢复它的身体和灵魂，驱逐赋予它力量的可憎的亡灵。",
	"While most skeletons are the animated remains of dead humans and other humanoids, skeletal undead can be created from the bones of other creatures besides humanoids, giving rise to a host of terrifying and unique forms.": "虽然大多数骷髅是死去的人类和其他类人动物的灵体，但骷髅亡灵可以由类人动物以外的其他生物的骨头创造出来，从而产生了一系列可怕而独特的形式。",
	"Skeletons raised by spell are bound to the will of their creator. They follow orders to the letter, never questioning the tasks their masters give them, regardless of the consequences. Because of their literal interpretation of commands and unwavering obedience, skeletons adapt poorly to changing circumstances. They can't read, speak, emote, or communicate in any way except to nod, shake their heads, or point. Still, skeletons are able to accomplish a variety of relatively complex tasks.": "由法术养成的骷髅被束缚在他们创造者的意志之下。他们严格遵守命令，从不质疑主人交给他们的任务，不计后果。由于他们对命令的字面解释和坚定不移的服从，骷髅对变化的环境适应性很差。除了点头、摇头或指点之外，它们不能阅读、说话、表达或以任何方式交流。尽管如此，骷髅还是能够完成各种相对复杂的任务。",
	"A skeleton can fight with weapons and wear armor, can load and fire a catapult or trebuchet, scale a siege ladder, form a shield wall, or dump boiling oil. However, it must receive careful instructions explaining how such tasks are accomplished.": "骷髅可以使用武器和穿戴盔甲作战，可以装载和发射弹射器或投石机，攀登攻城梯，形成盾墙，或倾倒沸油。然而，它必须接受仔细的指示，解释如何完成这些任务。",
	"Although they lack the intellect they possessed in life, skeletons aren't mindless. Rather than break its limbs attempting to batter its way through an iron door, a skeleton tries the handle first. If that doesn't work, it searches for another way through or around the obstacle.": "虽然他们缺乏生前拥有的智力，但骷髅并不是无意识的。骷髅不会因为试图撞开一扇铁门而打断自己的四肢，而是先试一下门把手。如果这不起作用，它就会寻找另一种方式穿过或绕过障碍物。",
	"Independent skeletons temporarily or permanently free of a master's control sometimes pantomime actions from their past lives, their bones echoing the rote behaviors of their former living selves. The skeleton of a miner might lift a pick and start chipping away at stone walls. The skeleton of a guard might strike up a post at a random doorway. The skeleton of a dragon might lie down on a pile of treasure, while the skeleton of a horse crops grass it can't eat. Left alone in a ballroom, the skeletons of nobles might continue an eternally unfinished dance.": "暂时或永久摆脱主人控制的独立骷髅有时会表演他们过去生活中的动作，他们的骨骼呼应着他们以前活着的自我的烂熟行为。矿工的骨架可能会举起镐，开始凿开石墙。警卫的骨架可能会在一个随机的门口敲起一个柱子。龙的骨架可能会躺在一堆财宝上，而马的骨架则会种上它吃不到的草。独自留在舞厅里，贵族的骨架可能会继续一个永远未完成的舞蹈。",
	"When skeletons encounter living creatures, the necromantic energy that drives them compels them to kill unless they are commanded by their masters to refrain from doing so. They attack without mercy and fight until destroyed, for skeletons possess little sense of self and even less sense of self-preservation.": "当骷髅遇到生物时，驱使它们的死灵能量迫使它们去杀人，除非它们的主人命令它们不要这样做。它们毫不留情地攻击，一直战斗到被消灭，因为骷髅几乎没有自我意识，更没有自我保护意识。",
	"A skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "骨架不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"In the Ever-Changing Chaos of Limbo, bits of forest and meadow, ruined castles, and isolated islands drift through a tumult of fire, water, earth, and wind.

	" Long ago, Primus, overlord of the modrons, created a gigantic, geometrically complex stone imbued with the power of law. He then cast it adrift in Limbo, believing that the stone would bring order to the chaos of that plane and halt the spread of chaos to other planes. As the stone's power grew, it became possible for creatures with ordered minds, such as modrons and githzerai, to create enclaves in Limbo. However, Primus's creation had an unforeseen side effect: the chaotic energy absorbed by the stone spawned the horrors that came to be known as slaadi. Sages refer to Primus's massive creation as the Spawning Stone for this reason.": " 很久以前，普利姆斯，摩德隆的霸主，创造了一块巨大的、几何形状复杂的石头，被赋予了法律的力量。然后他把它扔到了林波星，相信这块石头会给这个位面的混乱带来秩序，并阻止混乱向其他位面蔓延。随着石头力量的增长，具有有序思维的生物，如莫德隆和吉斯泽拉，也有可能在林波星创建飞地。然而，普利姆斯的创造有一个未曾预料到的副作用：石头吸收的混乱能量催生了后来被称为斯拉迪的恐怖。因此，圣人将普利姆斯的巨大创造称为 \"产卵石\"。",
	"The slaadi wiped out every last modron enclave in Limbo. As creatures of utter chaos, slaadi loathe modrons and attack them on sight. Nonetheless, Primus stands by his creation and either doesn't perceive the slaadi as threats or chooses to ignore them.": "斯拉迪人消灭了林堡的每一个莫德隆飞地。作为完全混乱的生物，斯拉迪厌恶莫德隆人，一见到他们就攻击。尽管如此，普利姆斯仍然支持他的创造物，他要么不认为斯拉迪是一种威胁，要么选择忽视他们。",
	"As a slaad emerges from the Spawning Stone, the stone magically implants a fragment of itself in the slaad's brain. This fragment takes the form of a magic gem roughly the size and shape of a human child's fist. The gem is the same color as the slaad. Another creature can use magic to draw forth a slaad's gem and use it to subjugate the slaad. The slaad must obey whoever possesses its gem. If a slaad's gem is destroyed, the slaad can no longer be controlled in this way.": "当Slaad从再生石中出来时，再生石会神奇地在Slaad的大脑中植入一个自身的碎片。这个碎片以魔法宝石的形式出现，其大小和形状与人类小孩的拳头差不多。这颗宝石的颜色与Slaad相同。另一个生物可以使用魔法引出slaad的宝石，并使用它来征服slaad。拥有宝石的人必须服从他的命令。如果石像的宝石被毁，石像就不能再以这种方式被控制。",
	"A slaad born from something other than the Spawning Stone has no gem in its brain, but it gains one if it ever comes into contact with the Spawning Stone. Slaadi on Limbo are attracted to the Spawning Stone, so most end up with a gem. A slaad with a control gem in its brain has the following additional trait.": "由再生石以外的东西所生的斯拉迪，其大脑中没有宝石，但如果它接触到再生石，就会获得一颗。Limbo上的Slaadi被再生石所吸引，所以大多数最终都有一颗宝石。脑子里有控制宝石的斯拉迪有以下的额外特征。",

	"Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against imprisonment, the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A {@spell wish} spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.": "某些法术可以用来获取宝石。如果Slaad对禁锢的救赎失败，该法术可以将宝石转移到施法者的手中，而不是禁锢Slaad。一个{@spell wish}的法术，如果在slaad在场的情况下施展，可以用文字来获得宝石。",

Each green slaad undergoes a lifelong cycle of transformation into the more powerful gray and death slaadi. With each transformation, the slaad retains its memories.": " 斯拉迪有可怕的繁殖周期。斯拉迪的繁殖方式是将卵子植入人形宿主体内，或者用一种叫做混沌噬菌体的转化疾病感染他们。每种颜色的斯拉迪都以不同的方式繁殖或转化，红色斯拉迪产生蓝色和绿色斯拉迪，而蓝色斯拉迪则产生红色和绿色。每个绿色的Slaad都要经历一个终身的转变周期，变成更强大的灰色和死亡Slaadi。每一次转变，斯拉迪都会保留其记忆。",

	"Sprites can sense whether a creature is good or evil by the sound and feeling of its beating heart.

	"Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals use spies to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather die than divulge information that could compromise them or their employers.": "统治者、贵族、商人、行会会长和其他富有的人利用间谍在这个残酷的政治世界中取得优势。间谍接受的训练是为了秘密收集信息。忠诚的间谍宁死也不会泄露可能危及他们或其雇主的信息。",
	"Composed of fire and water, steam mephits leave trails of hot water wherever they go, and they hiss with tendrils of steam. Bossy and hypersensitive, they are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits.": "由火和水组成的蒸汽梅菲特，无论走到哪里都会留下热水的痕迹，并发出蒸汽卷的嘶嘶声。霸道而敏感，他们是所有Mephits的自我任命的霸主。",
	"This horrid flying creature looks like a cross between a large bat and an oversized mosquito. Its legs end in sharp pincers, and its long, needle-like proboscis slashes the air as it seeks its next meal.": "这种可怕的飞行生物看起来像一只大蝙蝠和一只超大的蚊子之间的交叉。它的腿末端是锋利的钳子，长长的、像针一样的探针在空气中划动，寻找下一顿饭。",
	"Stirges feed on the blood of living creatures, attaching and draining them slowly. Although they pose little danger in small numbers, packs of stirges can be a formidable threat, reattaching as quickly as their weakening prey can pluck them off.": "蛭子以生物的血液为食，慢慢地附着并吸干它们的血。虽然它们在数量少的情况下不会构成什么危险，但成群的海蛇可以成为一种可怕的威胁，它们重新附着的速度就像它们衰弱的猎物能把它们摘下来一样快。",
	"A stirge attacks by landing on a victim, finding a vulnerable spot, and plunging its proboscis into the flesh while using its pincer legs to latch on to the victim. Once the stirge has sated itself, it detaches and flies off to digest its meal.": "蛭子的攻击方式是降落在受害者身上，找到一个脆弱的地方，把它的长鼻插进肉里，同时用它的钳子腿抓紧受害者。一旦吸血虫吃饱了，它就会脱离并飞走，以消化它的食物。",
	"Stone giants are reclusive, quiet, and peaceful as long as they are left alone. Their granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes endow stone giants with a stern countenance. They are private creatures, hiding their lives and art away from the world.": "石巨人是隐居的，安静的，只要他们不被打扰，就很平静。他们的花岗岩灰色的皮肤，憔悴的特征，以及黑色的、凹陷的眼睛赋予了石巨人严厉的面孔。他们是私密的生物，将自己的生活和艺术隐藏起来，远离世界。",
	"Secluded caves are the homes of the stone giants. Cavern networks are their towns, rocky tunnels their roads, and underground streams their waterways. Isolated mountain ranges are their continents, with the vast spans of land between seen as oceans that the stone giants only rarely cross.": "隐蔽的洞穴是石巨人的家园。洞穴网络是他们的城镇，岩石隧道是他们的道路，地下溪流是他们的水路。孤立的山脉是他们的大陆，中间的大片土地被视为海洋，石巨人只是很少穿越。",
	"In their dark, quiet caves, stone giants wordlessly chip away at elaborate carvings, measuring time in the echoing drip of water into cavern pools. In the deepest chambers of a stone giant settlement, far from the chittering of bats or the patrols paced out by the giants' cave bear companions, are holy places where silence and darkness are complete. Stone takes on its most sacred quality in these cavern cathedrals, their buttresses and columns carved with a beauty that shames the legendary stone craft of the dwarves.": "在他们黑暗、安静的洞穴中，石巨人无声无息地凿开精心制作的雕刻，在水滴进入洞穴池塘的回声中测量时间。在石巨人居住地的最深处，远离蝙蝠的鸣叫或巨人的洞穴熊伙伴的巡逻，是完全沉默和黑暗的圣地。石头在这些洞穴大教堂中具有最神圣的品质，它们的壁垒和柱子的雕刻之美，令矮人的传奇石头工艺汗颜。",
	"Among stone giants, artistry ranks as the greatest virtue. They create intricate murals, paint sprawling murals across cavern walls, and indulge in a wide variety of other artistic disciplines. They esteem stone carving as the greatest of skills.": "在石头巨人中，艺术性是最大的美德。他们创造了复杂的壁画，在洞壁上绘制了大量的壁画，并沉迷于各种其他的艺术学科。他们将石雕视为最伟大的技能。",
	"Stone giants strive to draw shapes out of raw stone, which they believe reveal meaning inspired by their god, Skoraeus Stonebones. The giants appoint the tribe's best carvers as their leaders, shamans, and prophets. The holy hands of such giants become the hands of the god as they work.": "石头巨人努力在原石上画出各种形状，他们认为这些形状揭示了他们的神--斯科雷欧斯-石骨的启示。巨人任命部落中最好的雕刻师为他们的领袖、萨满和先知。这些巨人的圣手在工作时成为神的手。",
	"Despite their great size and musculature, stone giants are lithe and graceful. Skilled rock throwers are granted positions of high rank in the giants' ordning, testing and demonstrating their ability to hurl and catch enormous boulders. Such giants take the front ranks when a tribe has cause to defend its home or attack its enemies. However, even in combat, artistry is key. A stone giant hurling a rock performs not just a feat of brute strength but also one of stunning athleticism and poise.": "尽管石巨人体型巨大，肌肉发达，但他们的身体却很轻盈，很优雅。熟练的投石者在巨人的军团中被授予高级职位，测试和展示他们投掷和捕捉巨大石块的能力。当一个部落有理由保卫自己的家园或攻击敌人时，这样的巨人会站在最前面。然而，即使在战斗中，艺术性也是关键。石头巨人投掷石块时，不仅要表现出蛮力，还要表现出惊人的运动能力和风度。",
	"Stone giants view the world outside their underground homes as a realm of dreams where nothing is entirely true or real. They behave in the surface world the way humanoids might behave in their own dreams, making little account for their actions and never fully trusting what they see or hear. A promise made above ground need not be kept. Insults can be made without apology. Killing prey or sentient beings is no cause for guilt in the dreaming world beneath the sky.": "石巨人将他们地下家园以外的世界视为一个梦境，在那里没有什么是完全真实的。他们在地面世界的行为就像人类在自己的梦境中的行为一样，对自己的行为没有什么交代，也从不完全相信自己看到或听到的东西。在地面上作出的承诺不一定会被遵守。侮辱是可以不道歉的。在天空下的梦境中，杀死猎物或有生命的人是没有理由感到内疚的。",
	"Stone giants lacking in athletic grace or artistic skill dwell at the fringes of their society, serving as the tribe's outlying guardians and far-wandering hunters. When trespassers stray too far into the mountain territory of a stone giant clan, those guardians greet them with hurled rocks and showers of splintered stone. Survivors of such encounters spread tales of stone giant violence, never realizing how little those brutes dwelling in the unreal dreaming world resemble their quiet and artistic kin.": "缺乏运动天赋或艺术技巧的石巨人居住在社会的边缘，充当部落的外围守护者和远行的猎人。当闯入者离石巨人部落的山地太远时，这些守护者就会用投掷的石块和飞溅的碎石来迎接他们。这种遭遇的幸存者传播着石巨人的暴力故事，他们从未意识到那些居住在虚幻的梦境中的野蛮人与他们安静而艺术的亲属有多大的相似之处。",
	"Stone golems display great variety in shape and form, cut and chiseled from stone to appear as tall, impressive statues. Though most bear humanoid features, stone golems can be carved in any form the sculptor can imagine. Ancient stone golems found in sealed tombs or flanking the gates of lost cities sometimes take the forms of giant beasts.": "石雕在形状和形式上表现出极大的多样性，从石头上切割和凿出的石雕看起来像高大的、令人印象深刻的雕像。虽然大多数石雕具有人的特征，但石雕可以被雕刻成雕塑家可以想象的任何形式。在密封的墓穴中或失落的城市大门两侧发现的古代石雕有时会呈现出巨兽的形态。",

Creatures that fight a stone golem can feel the ebb and flow of time slow down around them, almost as though they were made of stone themselves.": "和其他石像一样，石像几乎不受法术和普通武器的影响。与石像鬼战斗的生物可以感觉到时间的起伏在他们周围变慢，几乎就像他们自己是石头做的一样。",
	"When its creator or possessor is on hand to command it, a golem performs flawlessly. If the golem is left without instructions or is {@condition incapacitated}, it continues to follow its last orders to the best of its ability. When it can't fulfill its orders, a golem might react violently-or stand and do nothing. A golem that has been given conflicting orders sometimes alternates between them.": "当它的创造者或拥有者在现场指挥它的时候，巨魔的表现是完美无缺的。如果魔像没有得到指示或被{@condition incapacitated}，它就会继续尽其所能地遵循其最后的命令。当它不能履行命令时，巨魔可能会做出剧烈的反应，或者站着什么都不做。一个被赋予相互冲突的命令的巨魔有时会在它们之间交替进行。",
	"Storm giants are contemplative seers that live in places far removed from mortal civilization. Most have pale purple-gray skin and hair, and glittering emerald eyes.": "风暴巨人是沉思的预言家，生活在远离凡间文明的地方。大多数人都有苍白的紫灰色皮肤和头发，以及闪闪发光的翡翠色眼睛。",

They are benevolent and wise unless angered, in response to which the fury of a storm giant can affect the fate of thousands.": "一些罕见的风暴巨人是紫色皮肤，拥有深紫色或蓝黑色的头发和银灰色或紫色的眼睛。除非被激怒，否则他们是仁慈和明智的，对此，风暴巨人的愤怒可以影响成千上万人的命运。",
	"Storm giants live in isolated refuges so far above the surface of the world or below the sea that they are beyond the reach of most other creatures. Some make their abodes in cloud-top castles so high that flying dragons appear as specks below. Others live atop mountain peaks that pierce the clouds. Some occupy palaces covered with algae and coral at the bottom of the ocean, or grim fortresses in undersea rifts.": "风暴巨兽生活在与世隔绝的避难所中，远远高于世界表面或低于海洋，以至于其他大多数生物都无法到达。有些人住在云顶城堡中，其高度之高，使飞龙在下面看起来像斑点。还有的住在刺破云层的山峰之上。有些则居住在海底被海藻和珊瑚覆盖的宫殿里，或者是海底裂缝中的狰狞堡垒。",
	"Storm giants recall the glory of ancient giant empires forged by the god Annam. They seek to restore what was lost when those empires fell. They don't compete for status in the ordning but live out the centuries of their existence in contemplative seclusion, watching the starry heavens and the ocean's depths for signs, symbols, and omens of Annam's favor.": "风暴巨人们回忆起由安南神铸造的古代巨人帝国的荣耀。他们试图恢复那些帝国灭亡时失去的东西。他们不在秩序中争夺地位，而是在沉思的隐居中度过他们存在的几个世纪，观察星空和海洋深处的迹象、符号和安纳姆青睐的预兆。",
	"Storm giants see the events of the world in a wide perspective. They can foretell the rise and fall of kings and empires, see the beginnings and ends of fortune and disaster, and find the patterns within seemingly unrelated events. By reading omens and prophesying, storm giants learn of vast secrets previously unknown and troves of lore utterly forgotten.": "风暴巨头以广阔的视角看待世界上的事件。他们可以预言国王和帝国的兴衰，看到财富和灾难的开始和结束，并在看似不相关的事件中找到规律。通过解读预兆和预言，风暴巨人了解到以前不为人知的巨大秘密和被彻底遗忘的传说宝库。",
	"Kings will rise and fall, wars will be won and lost, and good and evil will wrestle in conflict. Storm giants have watched these events in the manner of mortal gods over many lifetimes, and they know it is pointless to intervene. Even so, a storm giant might willingly disclose certain secrets to benevolent beings that visit its remote domain with specific purpose. Such creatures must speak and act respectfully, however, for a storm giant roused to anger is a force of utter destruction.": "国王将兴起和衰落，战争将赢得和失去，善与恶将在冲突中搏斗。风暴巨人以凡人之神的方式观察了这些事件多时，他们知道干预是毫无意义的。即便如此，风暴巨人也可能愿意向带着特定目的访问其偏远领域的仁慈的生物透露某些秘密。然而，这样的生物必须恭敬地说话和行事，因为被激怒的风暴巨人是一种彻底的毁灭力量。",
	"Storm giants communicate infrequently with others of their kind. They do so usually to compare signs and omens or engage in a rare courtship. Storm giant parents stay together to raise a child to maturity, then return to the solitary isolation they cherish.": "风暴巨兽不经常与其他同类交流。他们这样做通常是为了比较征兆和预兆，或者进行罕见的求爱。风暴巨兽的父母呆在一起，将孩子养育成人，然后回到他们所珍视的孤独的环境中。",
	"Some humanoid cultures worship storm giants as they would worship lesser gods, creating myths and stories around the giants' exploits and vast knowledge. A storm giant is governed by the dictates of its conscience, however, and not by any culture's laws or codes of honor. As such, a storm giant that bends its mind toward greed or gains a taste for petty power can easily become a terrible threat.": "一些人形文化对风暴巨人的崇拜就像他们对小神的崇拜一样，围绕着巨人的功绩和丰富的知识创造神话和故事。然而，风暴巨人受其良知的支配，而不是受任何文化的法律或荣誉准则的支配。因此，风暴巨人如果贪婪成性，或者对小权力有兴趣，很容易成为一个可怕的威胁。",
	"Succubi and incubi inhabit all of the Lower Planes, and the lascivious dark-winged fiends can be found in service to devils, demons, night hags, rakshasas, and yugoloths. Asmodeus, ruler of the Nine Hells, uses these fiends to tempt mortals to perform evil acts. The demon lord Graz'zt keeps succubi and incubi as advisers and consorts.": "淫妖和魔女居住在所有的下层世界，这些淫荡的黑翼恶魔可以被发现为魔鬼、恶魔、夜魔、罗刹和尤格罗特服务。九层地狱的统治者阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）利用这些恶魔来引诱凡人进行邪恶的行为。恶魔领主格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）保留琥珀和妖精作为顾问和妃子。",
	"Though legend speaks of them separately, any succubus can become an incubus, and vice versa. Most of these fiends do have a preference for one form or the other. Mortals only rarely see a succubus or incubus in its true form, however, for the fiend typically begins its corruption in veiled, insidious ways.": "虽然传说中它们是分开的，但任何魅魔都可以变成妖魔，反之亦然。这些恶魔中的大多数人都偏爱一种形式或另一种形式。然而，凡人很少看到魅魔或妖魔的真实形态，因为这种恶魔通常以隐蔽、阴险的方式开始腐败。",
	"A succubus or incubus first appears in ethereal form, passing through walls like a ghost to lurk next to a mortal's bedside and whisper forbidden pleasures. Sleeping victims are tempted to give in to their darkest desires, indulge in taboos, and feed forbidden appetites. As the fiend fills the victim's dreams with debauched images, the victim becomes more susceptible to temptation in everyday life.": "魅魔或妖怪首先以空灵的形式出现，像幽灵一样穿墙而过，潜伏在凡人的床边，低声诉说禁忌的快乐。沉睡的受害者被引诱向他们最黑暗的欲望屈服，沉溺于禁忌，满足禁忌的胃口。当恶魔用放荡的形象填满受害者的梦境时，受害者在日常生活中变得更容易受到诱惑。",
	"Inevitably, the fiend enters the mortal realm in tempting form to directly influence a creature's actions. Appearing in the guise of a humanoid who has previously appeared only in the victim's dreams, the succubus or incubus seduces or befriends its victim, indulging all its desires so that it performs evil acts of its own free will.": "不可避免的是，恶魔以诱惑的形式进入凡间，直接影响一个生物的行为。魅魔以之前只在受害者梦中出现过的人形伪装出现，引诱或结交受害者，放纵其所有的欲望，使其按照自己的意愿实施邪恶行为。",
	"A mortal bequeaths its soul to the fiend not by formal pledge or contract. Instead, when a succubus or incubus has corrupted a creature completely-some say by causing the victim to commit the three betrayals of thought, word, and deed-the victim's soul belongs to the fiend. The more virtuous the fiend's prey, the longer the corruption takes, but the more rewarding the downfall. After successfully corrupting a victim, the succubus or incubus kills it, and the tainted soul descends into the Lower Planes.": "凡人将其灵魂遗赠给恶魔，并不是通过正式的誓言或合同。相反，当魅魔完全腐蚀了一个生物--有人说是通过使受害者犯下思想、语言和行为这三种背叛行为--受害者的灵魂属于恶魔。魔鬼的猎物越贤惠，腐蚀的时间就越长，但堕落的回报也越大。在成功地腐蚀了一个受害者之后，魅魔会杀死他，而被污染的灵魂则会下降到下层世界。",
	"The succubus or incubus resorts to charming a victim magically only when necessary, usually as a form of self-defense. A {@condition charmed} creature isn't responsible for its actions, so forcing it to behave against its will won't bring the fiend closer to the ultimate prize: the victim's soul.": "魅魔或妖怪只有在必要时才会用魔法迷惑受害者，通常是作为一种自卫的形式。一个{@condition charmed}的生物并不对自己的行为负责，所以强迫它违背自己的意愿并不会使恶魔更接近最终的奖赏：受害者的灵魂。",
	"The kiss of a succubus or incubus is an echo of the emptiness that is the fiend's longing for a corrupted soul. Likewise, the recipient of the fiend's kiss gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and the profound emptiness that the fiend imparts. The kiss is nothing short of an attack, usually delivered as a final farewell before the fiend escapes.": "魅魔的吻是空虚的回声，这是恶魔对堕落灵魂的渴望。同样地，接受恶魔之吻的人也无法从中获得满足，只能体验到痛苦和恶魔所带来的深刻的空虚。这个吻无异于一次攻击，通常是作为恶魔逃跑前的最后告别。",
	"Succubi and incubi can reproduce with one another to spawn more of their kind. Less commonly, a succubus or incubus reproduces with a humanoid. From this unholy union, a cambion child is conceived. Invariably, the fiendish offspring is as wicked as its fiendish parent.": "魅魔和伊卡比可以互相繁殖，以产生更多的同类。不太常见的情况是，一个魅魔或妖精与一个人形生物进行繁殖。从这种不洁的结合中，会孕育出一个cambion孩子。无一例外的是，这个恶魔般的后代和它恶魔般的父母一样邪恶。",
	"The legendary tarrasque is possibly the most dreaded monster of the Material Plane. It is widely believed that only one of these creatures exists, though no one can predict where and when it will strike.": "传说中的塔拉斯克可能是物质世界中最令人恐惧的怪物。人们普遍认为，这种生物只存在一种，尽管没有人能够预测它将在什么地方和什么时候发作。",
	"A scaly biped, the tarrasque is fifty feet tall and seventy feet long, weighing hundreds of tons. It carries itself like a bird of prey, leaning forward and using its powerful lashing tail for balance. Its cavernous maw yawns wide enough to swallow all but the largest creatures, and so great is its hunger that it can devour the populations of whole towns.": "塔拉斯克是一种有鳞的双足动物，身高50英尺，长70英尺，体重达数百吨。它像一只猎物鸟一样带着自己，身体向前倾斜，用它那强大的尾巴来保持平衡。它那张洞开的大嘴足以吞下除最大的生物外的所有生物，它的饥饿感如此之强，以至于它可以吞噬整个城镇的人口。",
	"The destructive potential of the tarrasque is so vast that some cultures incorporate the monster into religious doctrine, weaving its sporadic appearance into stories of divine judgment and wrath.": "塔拉斯克的破坏力是如此之大，以至于一些文化将这种怪物纳入宗教教义，将其零星的出现编入神圣的审判和愤怒的故事。",
	"Legends tell how the tarrasque slumbers in its secret lair beneath the earth, remaining in a dormant state for decades or centuries. When it awakens in answer to some inscrutable cosmic call, it rises from the depths to obliterate everything in its path.": "传说中，龙卷风如何在地底下的秘密巢穴中沉睡，保持几十年或几个世纪的休眠状态。当它响应某种不可捉摸的宇宙召唤而苏醒时，它就会从深渊中升起，抹去沿途的一切。",
	"Thri-kreen wander the deserts and savannas of the world, avoiding all other races.": "Thri-kreen在世界的沙漠和草原上游荡，避开所有其他种族。",
	" Thri-kreen employ a language without words. To show emotion and reaction, a thri-kreen clacks its mandibles and waves its antennae, giving other thri-kreen a sense of what it is thinking and feeling. Other creatures find this manner of communication difficult to interpret and impossible to duplicate.": " Thri-kreen使用一种没有语言的语言。为了表示情绪和反应，Thri-Kreen会敲打下颚，挥动触角，让其他Thri-Kreen感觉到它在想什么和感觉到什么。其他生物发现这种交流方式很难解释，也无法复制。",
	"When forced to interact with creatures of other intelligent species, thri-kreen employ alternative methods of communication, such as drawing pictures in sand or making pictures out of twigs or blades of grass.": "当被迫与其他智能物种的生物互动时，Thri-kreen会采用其他交流方法，如在沙子上画画或用树枝或草叶作画。",
	"Thri-kreen experience the full range of emotions but aren't as prone to emotional outbursts as humans. Thri-kreen with psionic ability often demonstrate a wider range of emotions, particularly if they live near or interact with humans or other highly emotional creatures.": "Thri-kreen能体验到全部的情绪，但不像人类那样容易情绪失控。具有幻觉能力的Thri-kreen常常表现出更广泛的情绪，特别是当他们生活在人类或其他高度情绪化的生物附近或与之互动时。",
	"Thri-kreen consider all other living creatures as potential nourishment, and they love the taste of elf flesh in particular. If a creature might be useful for something other than food, the thri-kreen aren't likely to attack it on sight. Thri-kreen kill to survive, never for sport.": "Thri-kreen认为所有其他生物都是潜在的营养品，他们尤其喜欢精灵肉的味道。如果一种生物可能对食物以外的东西有用，那么特里格林人不可能一见到它就攻击它。Thri-kreen杀人是为了生存，而不是为了运动。",
	"Thri-kreen don't require sleep and can rest while remaining alert and performing light tasks. Their inability to sleep is thought to be the reason why thri-kreen have such short lifespans, the average thri-kreen life expectancy being only thirty years.": "Thri-kreen不需要睡眠，可以在休息的同时保持警觉并执行轻度任务。他们不能睡觉被认为是Thri-Green寿命如此之短的原因，Thri-Green的平均寿命只有30年。",
	"Thugs are ruthless enforcers skilled at intimidation and violence. They work for money and have few scruples.": "暴徒是无情的执行者，擅长恐吓和暴力。他们为钱而工作，没有什么顾忌。",
	"Treants are awakened trees that dwell in ancient forests. Although treants prefer to while away the days, months, and years in quiet contemplation, they fiercely protect their woodland demesnes from outside threats.": "树人是居住在古老森林中的觉醒的树木。虽然树人更喜欢在安静的沉思中度过白天、月份和年月，但他们激烈地保护他们的林地领地免受外部威胁。",
	"A tree destined to become a treant meditates through a long cycle of seasons, living normally for decades or centuries before realizing its potential. Trees that awaken do so only under special circumstances and in places steeped with nature's magic. Treants and powerful druids can sense when a tree has the spark of potential, and they protect such trees in secret groves as they draw near the moment of their awakening. During the long process of awakening, a tree acquires face-like features in its bark, a division of the lower trunk into legs, and long branches bending downward to serve as its arms. When it is ready, the tree pulls its legs free from the clutching earth and joins its fellows in protecting its woodland home.": "一棵注定要成为树人的树在漫长的季节循环中进行冥想，在实现其潜力之前正常生活了几十年或几个世纪。只有在特殊情况下，在充满自然魔力的地方，树才会觉醒。树人和强大的德鲁伊能感觉到一棵树有潜力的火花，当它们接近觉醒的时刻时，他们会在秘密的丛林中保护这些树。在漫长的觉醒过程中，树木的树皮上会出现类似人脸的特征，树干下部会分成腿，长长的树枝会向下弯曲作为手臂。当它准备好的时候，树把它的腿从紧握的土地上拉开，和它的伙伴们一起保护它的林地家园。",
	"After a treant awakens, it continues to grow exactly as it did when it was a tree. Treants created from the mightiest trees can reach great sizes while developing an innate magical power over plants and animals. Such treants can animate plants, using them to ensnare and trap intruders. They can call wild creatures to aid them or carry messages across great distances.": "树人觉醒后，会继续成长，就像它还是一棵树时一样。从最强大的树木中创造出来的树人可以达到很大的体型，同时对植物和动物发展出一种天生的神奇力量。这样的树人可以使植物有生命，用它们来诱捕和困住入侵者。他们可以召唤野生动物来帮助他们，或者跨越遥远的距离传递信息。",
	"Even after awakening, a treant spends much of its time living as a tree. While rooted in place, a treant remains aware of its surroundings, and can perceive the effects of events taking place miles away based on subtle changes nearby.": "即使在觉醒后，树人也会花很多时间作为一棵树生活。虽然扎根在原地，但树人仍能意识到周围的环境，并能根据附近的细微变化感知到数英里外发生的事件的影响。",
	"Woodcutters who avoid culling healthy living trees and hunters who take only what they need of the forest's bounty are unlikely to arouse a treant's ire. Creatures careless with fire, those who poison the forest, and those who destroy great trees, especially a tree close to awakening, face the treant's wrath.": "避免砍伐健康的活树的伐木者和只拿他们需要的森林赏赐的猎人，不太可能引起树人的愤怒。不小心用火的生物，那些毒害森林的人，以及那些破坏大树的人，特别是接近觉醒的树，都会面临树人的愤怒。",

	"Troglodytes have a simple, communal culture devoted almost entirely to procuring food. Too simple to plan more than a few days into the future, troglodytes rely on constant raids and hunting to survive.

The trolls, enraged, will attack individuals making acid and fire attacks against them above all other prey.": "砸碎巨魔的骨头和砍破它的橡胶皮只会让它生气。巨魔的伤口很快就会愈合。如果怪物失去了一条胳膊、一条腿，甚至是它的头，那些被肢解的部分有时会有自己的生命。巨魔甚至可以重新接上被切断的身体部分，而不为其一时的残疾所困扰。只有酸和火才能阻止巨魔肉体的再生特性。被激怒的巨魔会攻击个人，对他们进行酸和火的攻击，超过所有其他猎物。",
	"Their regenerative capabilities make trolls especially susceptible to mutation. Although uncommon, such transformations can result from what the troll has done or what has been done to it. A decapitated troll might grow two heads from the stump of its neck, while a troll that eats a fey creature might gain one or more of that creature's traits.": "他们的再生能力使巨魔特别容易发生变异。虽然不常见，但巨魔所做的事或对它所做的事都可能导致这种转变。一个被斩首的巨魔可能会从它的脖子上长出两个头，而一个吃了精灵生物的巨魔可能会获得该生物的一个或多个特征。",

When it pulls its roots free of the ground to move, a twig blight's branches twist together to form a humanoid-looking body with a head and limbs.": "树枝枯萎病可以在土壤中生根，当活的猎物稀少时，它们就会这样做。在扎根时，它们类似于木质的灌木。当它把根系从地面上拔出来移动时，树枝枯萎病的树枝会扭曲在一起，形成一个有头和四肢的人形身体。",

Huddled together in groups, twig blights blend in with an area's natural vegetation or with piles of debris or firewood.": "树枝枯萎病寻找营地和水坑，在那里扎根，为前来喝水或休息的潜在受害者设下埋伏。枝枯病患者成群结队地挤在一起，与一个地区的自然植被或成堆的杂物或木柴混在一起。",

	"This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner.

	"Ultroloths command the yugoloth armies of the Blood War. An ultroloth looks like a slender gray-skinned humanoid with an elongated head. Its face bears no features except for two ovoid eyes. These eyes can become sparkling pools of light that can transfix other creatures and leave them reeling and helpless.": "Ultroloths指挥血战中的yugoloth军队。一个Ultroloth看起来像一个细长的灰色皮肤的人形物体，有一个拉长的头。它的脸上没有任何特征，只有两只卵形的眼睛。这些眼睛可以变成闪亮的光池，可以迷惑其他生物，使它们陷入无助的困境。",
	"Frequently at one another's throats, ultroloths continually scheme to enhance their own power. When not employed to fight in the Blood War, ultroloths lead yugoloth forces throughout the planes, acting as crime bosses or commanders of evil mercenary companies.": "ultroloths经常互相掐架，不断地谋划以增强他们自己的力量。当不受雇于血战时，最后通灵兽在整个星球上领导尤戈洛人的部队，充当犯罪头目或邪恶雇佣兵公司的指挥官。",

Lesser yugoloths know their place when facing an ultroloth and respond to its summons without demand for payment.": "由于残忍的名声，最后通灵兽指挥它们的爪牙作战，而最后通灵兽自己则不参与战斗。较小的尤格罗思知道自己在面对最后通灵兽时的位置，并对它的召唤作出回应，而不要求付款。",
	"An abominable horror from deep beneath the earth, an umber hulk burrows into cave complexes, dungeons, or Underdark settlements in search of food. Those lucky enough to survive an umber hulk attack often remember precious little of the incident, thanks to the umber hulk's mind-scrambling gaze.": "作为一种来自地底深处的可憎的恐怖，黄褐色绿巨人会钻进洞穴群、地牢或地下城的定居点寻找食物。那些幸运地从黄褐色绿巨人的攻击中幸存下来的人，往往对事件的印象非常模糊，这要归功于黄褐色绿巨人那令人心烦意乱的目光。",

	"Many survivors of an umber hulk encounter recollect little about the attack, because the monster's confusing gaze scrambles their memory of the event. Those who have fought and killed umber hulks recognize the signs. For other denizens of the Underdark, grisly tales of vanished explorers and wanton destruction speak of an unknown foe. Umber hulks take on supernatural status in these harrowing stories, many of which convey the same warning: once an umber hulk has been spotted, it is already too late to escape it.": "许多遭遇黄褐色绿巨人的幸存者几乎不记得这次袭击，因为怪物混乱的目光扰乱了他们对事件的记忆。那些曾经与黄褐色绿巨人战斗并将其杀死的人可以认出这些迹象。对于暗黑世界的其他居民来说，关于消失的探险家和肆意破坏的可怕故事说明了一个未知的敌人。在这些令人痛心的故事中，琥珀绿巨人具有超自然的地位，其中许多故事都传达了同样的警告：一旦发现了琥珀绿巨人，要想逃脱已经太晚了。",

	"A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk.

Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive.": "独角兽的眉毛上有一个象牙的螺旋形角，其神奇的触觉可以治愈病人和伤者。它的耳朵能听到分享它的领域的生物的言语和低语，它知道精灵和森林居民的语言。独角兽允许心地善良的生物进入它们的森林打猎或采集食物，但它们对邪恶的东西永远保持警惕。坏心眼的生物很少能活着离开独角兽的领地。",
	"Good deities placed unicorns on the Material Plane to ward away evil and preserve and protect sacred places. Most unicorns protect a bounded realm such as an enchanted forest. However, the gods sometimes send a unicorn to guard sacred artifacts or protect specific creatures. When the forces of darkness strike against an individual the gods wish to protect, they might send that individual to a unicorn's forest, where evil creatures pursue at their peril.": "善良的神灵将独角兽安置在物质界，以驱除邪恶，保存和保护圣地。大多数独角兽保护一个有界限的领域，如魔法森林。然而，众神有时也会派独角兽去保护神圣的神器或保护特定的生物。当黑暗势力袭击了众神想要保护的人时，他们可能会把这个人送到独角兽的森林里，在那里，邪恶的生物会不顾一切地追赶。",

	"When darkness and evil threaten to overwhelm the mortal world, the gods sometimes see fit to pair a unicorn mount with a champion.

	"Whether or not a vampire retains any memories from its former life, its emotional attachments wither as once-pure feelings become twisted by undeath. Love turns into hungry obsession, while friendship becomes bitter jealousy. In place of emotion, vampires pursue physical symbols of what they crave, so that a vampire seeking love might fixate on a young beauty. A child might become an object of fascination for a vampire obsessed with youth and potential. Others surround themselves with art, books, or sinister items such as torture devices or trophies from creatures they have killed.": "无论吸血鬼是否保留了前世的任何记忆，它的情感依恋都会随着曾经纯洁的感情被不死之身扭曲而枯萎。爱情变成了饥饿的迷恋，而友谊变成了痛苦的嫉妒。作为情感的替代，吸血鬼追求他们所渴望的物质象征，因此，寻求爱情的吸血鬼可能会固定在一个年轻的美女身上。一个孩子可能会成为痴迷于青春和潜力的吸血鬼的迷恋对象。其他人则用艺术、书籍或邪恶的物品围绕着自己，如酷刑装置或他们杀死的生物的战利品。",
	"Most of a vampire's victims become vampire spawn-ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood, but under the control of the vampire that created them.

Few vampires are willing to relinquish their control in this manner. Vampire spawn become free-willed when their creator dies.": "大多数吸血鬼的受害者都会变成吸血鬼的卵--具有吸血鬼对血液的渴望的贪婪的生物，但受创造它们的吸血鬼的控制。如果一个真正的吸血鬼允许产卵者从自己的身体里吸血，那么产卵者就会转变为一个真正的吸血鬼，不再受其主人的控制。很少有吸血鬼愿意以这种方式放弃他们的控制。吸血鬼卵子在其创造者死后会变得自由意志。",
	"Every vampire remains bound to its coffin, crypt, or grave site, where it must rest by day. If a vampire didn't receive a formal burial, it must lie beneath a foot of earth at the place of its transition to undeath. A vampire can move its place of burial by transporting its coffin or a significant amount of grave dirt to another location. Some vampires set up multiple resting places this way.": "每个吸血鬼都被束缚在它的棺材、墓穴或墓地中，它必须在那里休息一天。如果吸血鬼没有得到正式的埋葬，它必须躺在它向不死之身过渡的地方的一英尺的土下。吸血鬼可以通过将其棺材或大量的墓土运到另一个地方来移动其埋葬的地方。有些吸血鬼通过这种方式设置了多个安息地。",

	"In a desperate attempt to win Tatyana's heart, Strahd forged a pact with dark powers that made him immortal. At the wedding of Sergei and Tatyana, he confronted his brother and killed him. Tatyana fled and flung herself from Ravenloft's walls. Strahd's guards, seeing him for a monster, shot him with arrows. But he did not die. He became a vampire-the first vampire, according to many sages.": "为了赢得塔季扬娜的心，斯特拉赫特不顾一切地与黑暗势力订立了一个契约，使他成为不死之身。在谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼上，他与哥哥对峙并杀死了他。塔蒂亚娜逃跑了，从雷文洛夫特的城墙上跳了下去。斯特拉特的卫兵看到他是个怪物，就用箭射他。但他并没有死。他成了吸血鬼--据许多圣人说，他是第一个吸血鬼。",

By animating the plants around them, vine blights entangle and hinder their foes before attacking. Vine blights are the only blights capable of speech.

	"They don't like to pass on their curse, because every new weretiger means competition for territory and prey.": "它们不喜欢把诅咒传下去，因为每只新的狼虎都意味着对领土和猎物的竞争。",
	"Weretigers live in jungles on the fringes of humanoid civilization, traveling to isolated settlements to trade or revel. They live and hunt alone or in small family groups.": "狼人生活在类人文明边缘的丛林中，到孤立的定居点进行交易或狂欢。他们独自生活和狩猎，或在小型的家庭团体中。",
	"A werewolf is a savage predator. In its humanoid form, a werewolf has heightened senses, a fiery temper, and a tendency to eat rare meat. Its wolf form is a fearsome predator, but its hybrid form is more terrifying by far-a furred and well-muscled humanoid body topped by a ravening wolf's head. A werewolf can wield weapons in hybrid form, though it prefers to tear foes apart with its powerful claws and bite.": "狼人是一种野蛮的捕食者。在人形形态下，狼人具有高度的感官，火爆的脾气，并倾向于吃稀有的肉类。狼的形态是一种可怕的捕食者，但它的混合形态则更为可怕--毛茸茸的、肌肉发达的人形身体上顶着一个乌黑的狼头。狼人可以在混合形态下挥舞武器，不过它更喜欢用它强大的爪子和咬力将敌人撕碎。",
	"Most werewolves flee civilized lands not long after becoming afflicted. Those that reject the curse fear what will happen if they remain among their friends and family. Those that embrace the curse fear discovery and the consequences of their murderous acts. In the wild, werewolves form packs that also include wolves and dire wolves.": "大多数狼人在受到折磨后不久就逃离了文明的土地。那些拒绝诅咒的人担心如果他们留在朋友和家人中间会发生什么。那些接受诅咒的人害怕被发现，害怕他们的谋杀行为带来的后果。在野外，狼人组成的狼群也包括狼和地狼。",
	"The smallest, least intelligent, and most animalistic of the chromatic dragons, white dragons dwell in frigid climes, favoring arctic areas or icy mountains. They are vicious, cruel reptiles driven by hunger and greed.": "白龙是最小的、最不聪明的、最兽性的色龙，居住在寒冷的气候中，喜欢北极地区或冰山。它们是被饥饿和贪婪驱使的凶恶、残忍的爬行动物。",
	"A white dragon has feral eyes, a sleek profile, and a spined crest. The scales of a wyrmling white dragon glisten pure white. As the dragon ages, its sheen disappears and some of its scales begin to darken, so that by the time it is old, it is mottled by patches of pale blue and light gray. This patterning helps the dragon blend into the realms of ice and stone in which it hunts, and to fade from view when it soars across a cloud-filled sky.": "白龙有一双野性的眼睛，圆滑的轮廓，以及一个带刺的徽章。白龙的鳞片闪烁着纯白色的光芒。随着年龄的增长，它的光泽消失了，一些鳞片开始变黑，所以当它年老的时候，它的鳞片上会有淡蓝色和浅灰色的斑点。这种图案有助于白龙融入它所狩猎的冰石领域，当它在充满云彩的天空中翱翔时，也会从视野中消失。",
	"White dragons lack the cunning and tactics of most other dragons. However, their bestial nature makes them the best hunters among all dragonkind, singularly focused on surviving and slaughtering their enemies. A white dragon consumes only food that has been frozen, devouring creatures killed by its breath weapon while they are still stiff and frigid. It encases other kills in ice or buries them in snow near its lair, and finding such a larder is a good indication that a white dragon dwells nearby.": "白龙缺乏大多数其他龙的狡猾和战术。然而，它们的兽性使它们成为所有龙族中最好的猎手，只专注于生存和屠杀它们的敌人。白龙只吃被冰冻过的食物，吞噬被其呼吸武器杀死的生物，而它们仍然是僵硬和冰冷的。它将其他被杀的动物包裹在冰中，或将它们埋在巢穴附近的雪中，发现这样一个储藏室是一个很好的迹象，表明附近住着一只白龙。",
	"A white dragon also keeps the bodies of its greatest enemies as trophies, freezing corpses where it can look upon them and gloat. The remains of giants, remorhazes, and other dragons are often positioned prominently within a white dragon's lair as warnings to intruders.": "白龙还将其最大的敌人的尸体作为战利品，将尸体冷冻在它可以看到的地方并幸灾乐祸。巨人、雷莫哈兹和其他龙的遗体通常被放置在白龙巢穴的显眼位置，作为对入侵者的警告。",
	"Though only moderately intelligent, white dragons have extraordinary memories. They recall every slight and defeat, and have been known to conduct malicious vendettas against creatures that have offended them. This often includes silver dragons, which lair in the same territories as whites. White dragons can speak as all dragons can, but they rarely talk unless moved to do so.": "虽然只有中等的智力，但白龙有非凡的记忆。它们记得每一次的轻视和失败，并且已知会对冒犯过它们的生物进行恶意报复。这通常包括银龙，它们与白龙在同一地区筑巢。白龙可以像所有龙一样说话，但它们很少说话，除非被感动。",
	"White dragons avoid all other dragons except whites of the opposite sex. Even then, when white dragons seek each other out as mates, they stay together only long enough to conceive offspring before fleeing into isolation again.": "白龙避开所有其他龙，除非是异性的白龙。即使如此，当白龙互相寻找配偶时，它们在一起的时间也只够孕育后代，然后再次逃到隔离的地方。",
	"White dragons can't abide rivals near their lairs. As a result, a white dragon attacks other creatures without provocation, viewing such creatures as either too weak or too powerful to live. The only creatures that typically serve a white dragon are intelligent humanoids that demonstrate enough strength to assuage the dragon's wrath, and can put up with sustaining regular losses as a result of its hunger. This includes dragon-worshiping kobolds, which are commonly found in their lairs.": "白龙不能容忍对手靠近它们的巢穴。因此，白龙会在没有挑衅的情况下攻击其他生物，认为这些生物要么太弱，要么太强大，无法生存。唯一通常为白龙服务的生物是聪明的人形生物，它们表现出足够的力量来平息龙的愤怒，并且能够忍受由于龙的饥饿而造成的定期损失。这包括崇拜龙的哥布林，这在他们的巢穴中很常见。",
	"Powerful creatures can sometimes gain a white dragon's obedience through a demonstration of physical or magical might. Frost giants challenge white dragons to prove their own strength and improve their status in their clans, and their cracked bones litter many a white dragon's lair. However, a white dragon defeated by a frost giant often becomes its servant, accepting the mastery of a superior creature in exchange for asserting its own domination over the other creatures that serve or oppose the giant.": "强大的生物有时可以通过展示身体或魔法的力量来获得白龙的服从。冰霜巨人向白龙发起挑战，以证明自己的实力并提高自己在族中的地位，他们的碎骨在许多白龙的巢穴中到处可见。然而，被冰霜巨人打败的白龙往往会成为它的仆人，接受一个高级生物的控制权，以换取自己对其他服务于或反对巨人的生物的统治权。",
	"White dragons love the cold sparkle of ice and favor treasure with similar qualities, particularly diamonds. However, in their remote arctic climes, the treasure hoards of white dragons more often contain walrus and mammoth tusk ivory, whale-bone sculptures, figureheads from ships, furs, and magic items seized from overly bold adventurers.": "白龙喜欢冰的冷光，喜欢具有类似品质的宝物，特别是钻石。然而，在他们偏远的北极地区，白龙的宝藏中更多的是海象和猛犸象牙、鲸骨雕塑、船只的头像、毛皮以及从过于大胆的冒险家手中缴获的魔法物品。",
	"Loose coins and gems are spread across a white dragon's lair, glittering like stars when the light strikes them. Larger treasures and chests are encased in layers of rime created by the white dragon's breath, and held safe beneath layers of transparent ice. The dragon's great strength allows it to easily access its wealth, while lesser creatures must spend hours chipping away or melting the ice to reach the dragon's main hoard.": "松散的硬币和宝石散布在白龙的巢穴中，当光线照射到它们时，像星星一样闪闪发光。较大的宝物和箱子被包裹在白龙的呼吸所产生的石灰层中，并在透明的冰层下保持安全。白龙的巨大力量使它能够轻易地获取财富，而较小的生物必须花几个小时的时间来削除或融化冰层，才能到达白龙的主要囤积物。",
	"A white dragon's flawless memory means that it knows how it came to possess every coin, gem, and magic item in its hoard, and it associates each item with a specific victory. White dragons are notoriously difficult to bribe, since any offers of treasure are seen as an insult to their ability to simply slay the creature making the offer and seize the treasure on their own.": "白龙的记忆无懈可击，这意味着它知道自己是如何拥有其囤积的每一枚硬币、宝石和魔法物品的，并且它将每一件物品与一场特定的胜利联系起来。白龙是出了名的难以贿赂，因为任何提供的财宝都被视为对它们能力的侮辱，它们可以简单地杀死提供财宝的生物，自己夺取财宝。",
	"White dragons lair in icy caves and deep subterranean chambers far from the sun. They favor high mountain vales accessible only by flying, caverns in cliff faces, and labyrinthine ice caves in glaciers. White dragons love vertical heights in their caverns, flying up to the ceiling to latch on like bats or slithering down icy crevasses.": "白龙的巢穴在远离阳光的冰洞和地下深室中。它们喜欢只有通过飞行才能到达的高山峡谷、悬崖峭壁上的洞穴，以及冰川中迷宫般的冰洞。白龙喜欢洞穴中的垂直高度，像蝙蝠一样飞到天花板上抓取，或者从冰冷的裂缝中滑下。",
	"A legendary white dragon's innate magic deepens the cold in the area around its lair. Mountain caverns are fast frozen by the white dragon's presence. A white dragon can often detect intruders by the way the keening wind in its lair changes tone.": "一条传奇的白龙的先天魔法加深了其巢穴周围地区的寒冷。山洞会因为白龙的存在而迅速冻结。白龙通常可以通过其巢穴中的龙吟风的音调变化来发现入侵者。",
	"A white dragon rests on high ice shelves and cliffs in its lair, the floor around it a treacherous morass of broken ice and stone, hidden pits, and slippery slopes. As foes struggle to move toward it, the dragon flies from perch to perch and destroys them with its freezing breath.": "一条白龙停在它的巢穴中的高高的冰架和悬崖上，它周围的地面是由破碎的冰和石头、隐藏的坑和滑溜溜的斜坡组成的险恶的泥沼。当敌人挣扎着走向它时，白龙从一个栖息地飞到另一个栖息地，用它冰冷的气息摧毁他们。",
	"The word \"wight\" meant \"person\" in days of yore, but the name now refers to evil undead who were once mortals driven by dark desire and great vanity. When death stills such a creature's heart and snuffs its living breath, its spirit cries out to the demon lord Orcus or some vile god of the underworld for a reprieve: undeath in return for eternal war on the living. If a dark power answers the call, the spirit is granted undeath so that it can pursue its own malevolent agenda.": "在过去的日子里，\"wight \"这个词的意思是 \"人\"，但现在这个名字指的是邪恶的亡灵，他们曾经是被黑暗欲望和巨大虚荣心驱使的凡人。当死亡扼杀了这种生物的心脏，扼杀了它的生命气息，它的灵魂就会向恶魔领主奥库斯或一些卑鄙的冥界之神呼喊，以获得缓刑：以不死换取对活人的永恒战争。如果黑暗势力回应了这一呼唤，它的灵魂就会获得不死之身，这样它就可以追求自己的邪恶议程。",
	"Wights possess the memories and drives of their formerly living selves. They will heed the call of whatever dark entity transformed them into undead, swearing oaths to appease their new lord while retaining their autonomy. Never tiring, a wight can pursue its goals relentlessly and without distraction.": "巫师拥有他们以前活着的自己的记忆和驱动力。他们会听从将他们转化为不死之身的任何黑暗实体的召唤，在保持自主性的同时，发誓要安抚他们的新主宰。巫师永不疲倦，可以无休止地追求自己的目标，而不会分心。",
	"Neither dead nor alive, a wight exists in a transitional state between one world and the next. The bright spark it possessed in life is gone, and in its place is a yearning to consume that spark in all living things.": "巫师既不死也不活，存在于一个世界和另一个世界之间的过渡状态。它生前拥有的明亮的火花已经消失，取而代之的是对吞噬所有生物的火花的渴望。",
	"When a wight attacks, this life essence glows like white-hot embers to its dark eyes, and the wight's cold touch can drain the spark through flesh, clothing, and armor.": "当巫师攻击时，这种生命精华会像白热的余烬一样在它的黑眼睛里发光，而巫师的冰冷触觉可以通过肉体、衣服和盔甲耗尽火花。",
	"Wights flee from the world by day, away from the light of the sun, which they hate. They retreat to barrow mounds, crypts, and tombs where they dwell. Their lairs are silent, desolate places, surrounded by dead plants, noticeably blackened, and avoided by bird and beast.": "巫师们白天逃离世界，远离他们讨厌的太阳光。他们退缩到他们居住的荒冢、地窖和坟墓中。他们的巢穴是寂静、荒凉的地方，周围都是枯萎的植物，明显发黑，鸟类和野兽都避之不及。",
	"Humanoids slain by a wight can rise as zombies under its control. Motivated by hunger for living souls and driven by the same desire for power that awakened them in undeath, some wights serve as shock troops for evil leaders, including wraiths. As soldiers, they are able to plan but seldom do so, relying on their hunger for destruction to overwhelm any creature that stands before them.": "被巫师杀死的人类可以在其控制下变成僵尸。在对活人灵魂的饥渴的驱使下，一些巫师在未死时也被唤醒了对力量的渴望，他们为邪恶的领袖充当突击队，包括裹尸人。作为士兵，他们能够进行计划，但很少这样做，而是依靠他们对毁灭的饥渴来压倒站在他们面前的任何生物。",
	"A wight doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "幽灵不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Will-o'-wisps are malevolent, wispy balls of light that haunt lonely places and battlefields, bound by dark fate or dark magic to feed on fear and despair.": "Will-o'-wisps是邪恶的、飘忽不定的光球，它们在孤独的地方和战场上出没，被黑暗的命运或黑暗的魔法束缚，以恐惧和绝望为食。",
	"Will-o'-wisps look like bobbing lantern lights in the distance, although they can choose to alter their colors, or wink out completely. When they activate their lights, will-o'-wisps offer hope, hinting of safety to creatures that follow them.": "Will-o'-wisps看起来像远处晃动的灯笼灯，尽管它们可以选择改变颜色，或者完全眨眼。当它们启动灯光时，Will-o'-wisps提供了希望，向跟随它们的生物暗示了安全。",
	"Will-o'-wisps lure unwary creatures into quicksand pits, monster lairs, and other dangerous places so that they can feed on the suffering of their prey and revel in their death screams. An evil being that falls prey to a will-o'-wisp might become a wisp itself, its woeful spirit coalescing above its lifeless corpse like a flickering flame.": "威尔-o'-wisps把不小心的生物引诱到流沙坑、怪物巢穴和其他危险的地方，这样它们就能以猎物的痛苦为食，并陶醉于它们的死亡尖叫声。沦为鬼魂猎物的邪恶生物可能会自己变成鬼魂，其悲惨的灵魂像闪烁的火焰一样凝聚在其无生命的尸体之上。",
	" Will-o'-wisps are the souls of evil beings that perished in anguish or misery as they wandered forsaken lands permeated with powerful magic. They thrive in swampy bogs and bone-strewn battlefields where the oppressive weight of sorrow stoops even heavier than the low-hanging mist and fog. Trapped in these desolate places of lost hope and memory, will-o'-wisps lure other creatures toward dismal fates and feed on their misery.": " 巫师是邪恶生物的灵魂，他们在被遗弃的土地上游荡时，在痛苦或不幸中丧生，被强大的魔法所渗透。他们在沼泽地和尸骨遍地的战场上茁壮成长，在那里，悲伤的压迫感甚至比低垂的薄雾和雾气更重。困在这些失去希望和记忆的荒凉地方，女巫们引诱其他生物走向悲惨的命运，并以他们的痛苦为食。",
	"Will-o'-wisps rarely speak, but when they do, their voices sound like faint or distant whispers. In the miserable domains they haunt, will-o'-wisps sometimes form symbiotic relationships with their wicked neighbors. Hags, oni, black dragons, and evil cultists work with will-o'-wisps to draw creatures into ambush. As their evil allies surround and slaughter creatures, the wisps hover above them, drinking the agony of a last breath and savoring the sensation as the light of life goes out in a creature's eyes.": "威利斯人很少说话，但当他们说话时，他们的声音听起来像微弱或遥远的耳语。在它们出没的悲惨领域中，鬼怪有时会与它们邪恶的邻居形成共生关系。女巫、鬼神、黑龙和邪恶的崇拜者与女巫合作，将生物引向伏击。当他们的邪恶盟友包围和屠杀生物时，巫师们在他们上方盘旋，喝下最后一口气的痛苦，并品味生物眼中生命之光熄灭时的感觉。",
	"A will-o'-wisp doesn't require air, drink, or sleep.": "巫师不需要空气、饮料或睡眠。",
	"The arctic-dwelling winter wolf is as large as a dire wolf but has snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well enough to follow simple conversations.": "居住在北极的冬狼和地狼一样大，但有雪白的皮毛和淡蓝色的眼睛。冰霜巨人使用这些邪恶的生物作为守卫和狩猎伙伴，用狼的致命呼吸武器来对付他们的敌人。冬狼用咆哮和吠叫互相交流，但它们能说普通话和巨人语，足以听懂简单的对话。",
	"A worg is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.": "虫子是一种邪恶的捕食者，以猎杀和吞噬比自己弱小的生物为乐。狡猾而恶毒的虫子在遥远的荒野中游荡，或者被地精和妖精养大。这些生物把虫子当作坐骑，但如果虫子感到被虐待或营养不良，它就会背叛它的骑手。虫子说他们自己的语言和哥布林语，少数也会学习说普通话。",
	"A wraith is malice incarnate, concentrated into an incorporeal form that seeks to quench all life. The creature is suffused with negative energy, and its mere passage through the world leaves nearby plants blackened and withered. Animals flee from its presence. Even small fires can be extinguished by the sucking oblivion of the wraith's horrifying existence.": "裹尸人是恶意的化身，集中在一个无体的形式中，试图熄灭所有的生命。这种生物充斥着负面的能量，它在这个世界上的存在使附近的植物变黑和枯萎。动物会逃离它的存在。即使是小火也会被裹尸人可怕的存在所吸食遗忘而熄灭。",
	"When a mortal humanoid lives a debased life or enters into a fiendish pact, it consigns its soul to eternal damnation in the Lower Planes. However, sometimes the soul becomes so suffused with negative energy that it collapses in on itself and ceases to exist the instant before it can shuffle off to some horrible afterlife. When this occurs, the spirit becomes a soulless wraith-a malevolent void trapped on the plane where it died. Almost nothing of the wraith's former existence is preserved; in this new form, it exists only to annihilate other life.": "当一个凡人过着堕落的生活或订立了邪恶的契约时，它的灵魂就会在下层世界受到永恒的诅咒。然而，有时灵魂变得如此充斥着负能量，以至于它在自己身上崩溃，并在它可以洗去一些可怕的来世之前就不存在了。当这种情况发生时，灵魂会变成一个没有灵魂的包裹--一个被困在它死去的平面上的恶性虚空。裹尸人以前的存在几乎没有被保留下来；在这种新形式下，它的存在只是为了消灭其他生命。",
	"A wraith can move through solid creatures and objects as easily as a mortal creature moves through fog.": "巫师可以在固体生物和物体中移动，就像凡人生物在雾中移动一样容易。",
	"A wraith might retain a few memories of its mortal life as shadowy echoes. However, even the strongest events and emotions become little more than faint impressions, fleeting as half-remembered dreams. A wraith might pause to stare at something that fascinated it in life, or it might curb its wrath in acknowledgment of a past friendship. Such moments come rarely, however, because most wraiths despise what they were as a reminder of what they have become.": "裹尸人可能会保留其凡人生活的一些记忆，作为朦胧的回声。然而，即使是最强烈的事件和情感也不过是微弱的印象，像半梦半醒之间转瞬即逝。裹尸人可能会停下脚步，凝视它生前着迷的东西，或者它可能会抑制自己的怒火，承认过去的友谊。然而，这样的时刻很少出现，因为大多数裹尸人都鄙视他们的过去，认为这是对他们已经成为的一种提醒。",
	"A wraith can make an undead servant from the spirit of a humanoid creature that has recently suffered a violent death. Such a fragment of woe becomes a specter, spiteful of all that lives.": "巫师可以从最近遭受暴力死亡的人形生物的灵魂中制造一个不死的仆人。这样的悲哀碎片会变成一个幽灵，对所有活着的人充满怨恨。",
	"Wraiths sometimes rule the legions of the dead, plotting the doom of living creatures. When they emerge from their tombs to do battle, life and hope shrivel before them. Even if a wraith's armies are forced to retreat, the lands its forces occupied are so blasted and withered that those who live there often starve and die.": "巫师有时统治着死亡军团，策划着生物的厄运。当他们从坟墓里出来作战时，生命和希望在他们面前萎靡不振。即使巫师的军队被迫撤退，其军队占领的土地也会被炸毁和枯萎，生活在那里的人往往会饿死。",
	"A wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "裹尸人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

These cousins to the great dragons hunt the same tangled forests and caverns as their kin. Their appearance sends ripples of alarm through the borderlands of civilization.": "野外旅行者有时会仰望天空，看到翼龙的黑翼形状携带着它的猎物。这些大龙的表亲与它们的亲戚一样，在纠结的森林和洞穴中捕食。它们的出现会在文明的边界地区激起惊涛骇浪。",
	"A wyvern has two scaly legs, leathery wings, and a sinewy tail topped with its most potent weapon: a poison stinger. The poison in a wyvern's stinger can kill a creature in seconds. Extremely potent, wyvern poison burns through its victim's bloodstream, disintegrating veins and arteries on its way to the heart. As deadly as wyverns can be, however, hunters and adventurers often track them to claim the venom, which is used in alchemical compounds and to coat weapons.": "狼牙棒有两条有鳞的腿，皮质的翅膀，以及一条蜿蜒的尾巴，上面有它最有力的武器：毒刺。狼牙棒中的毒可以在几秒钟内杀死一个生物。狼牙棒的毒性极强，它在受害者的血液中燃烧，在到达心脏的途中瓦解静脉和动脉。然而，尽管狼毒是致命的，猎人和冒险家经常追踪它们以获取毒液，这些毒液可用于炼金术和武器涂层。",
	"A wyvern doesn't fight on the ground unless it can't reach its prey by any other means, or if it has been fooled into a position from which aerial combat isn't an option.

	"A wyvern intent on its prey backs down only if it sustains serious injury, or if its prey eludes it long enough for another easier potential meal to wander along. If it corners a fleeing creature in an enclosure too small to enter, a wyvern guards where the quarry hides, lashing with its stinger whenever opportunity allows.": "只有当它受到严重伤害，或者猎物被它躲避了足够长的时间，让另一个更容易的潜在猎物徘徊时，才会对它的猎物退缩。如果它在一个小得不能再小的围栏里发现了一个逃跑的生物，狼獾就会守在猎物藏身的地方，只要有机会就会用它的毒刺猛击。",
	"Although they possess more cunning than ordinary beasts, wyverns lack the intelligence of their draconic cousins. As such, creatures that maintain their composure as a wyvern hunts them from the air can often elude or trick it. Wyverns follow a direct path to their prey, with no thought given to possible ambushes.": "虽然它们拥有比普通野兽更多的狡猾，但狼獾缺乏它们龙族表亲的智慧。因此，当狼獾从空中追捕它们时，保持镇定的生物往往可以躲避或欺骗它。狼獾会沿着一条直接通往猎物的道路前进，而不会考虑到可能的伏击。",
	"A wyvern can be tamed for use as a mount, but doing so presents a difficult and deadly challenge. Raising one as a hatchling offers the best results. However, a wyvern's violent temperament has cost the life of many a would-be master.": "狼人可以被驯服作为坐骑使用，但这样做是一个困难和致命的挑战。将其作为幼崽来养是最好的结果。然而，狼牙棒的暴躁性情让许多可能成为主人的人付出了生命。",
	"Bizarre creatures native to the Elemental Plane of Earth, xorn sniff out gemstones and precious metals, then tunnel through earth and rock to consume those treasures.

More pragmatic folk attest that the yeti's howl is a reminder that, despite the great accomplishments of civilization, the civilized become the hunted in nature's untamed domain.": "在发生雪崩、暴风雪或致命的霜冻之前，雪人的嚎叫声在冰冷的风中掠过山坡。高山顶峰的一些人相信，在雪崩和暴风雪中丧生的亲人的声音在雪人的哀号中响起，哭着警告不祥之兆。更加务实的人证明，雪人的嚎叫是一种提醒，尽管文明取得了巨大的成就，但在自然界的野蛮领域，文明人变成了猎物。",

	"Devious mountain folk sometimes use the yetis as unwitting weapons. A warlord might lay down slaughtered sheep or goats to draw yetis into an enemy's camp, sowing chaos and thinning the ranks before battle. Mountain clan chiefs, wanting to expand their territory, overhunt local game to diminish the yetis' food supplies, inspiring attacks on humanoid settlements that are swiftly annexed in the aftermath.": "狡猾的山民有时利用雪人作为不知情的武器。军阀可能会放下被宰杀的绵羊或山羊，把雪人吸引到敌人的营地，在战斗前播下混乱的种子，稀释队伍。山区部族首领想扩大自己的领土，过度猎杀当地的野味，以减少雪人的食物供应，激发对人形定居点的攻击，并在事后迅速吞并。",

It typically lives and hunts alone, though a pair of abominable yetis might live together long enough to raise young. These towering yetis are highly territorial and savage, attacking and devouring any warm-blooded creatures they encounter, then scattering the bones across the ice and snow.": "可憎的雪人比普通的雪人要大，站起来的高度是人类的三倍。它通常独自生活和狩猎，不过一对可恶的雪人可能会长期生活在一起，养育幼崽。这些高大的雪人具有高度的领地性和野蛮性，它们攻击并吞噬任何遇到的温血动物，然后将骨头散落在冰雪上。",
	"The yochlols are the Handmaidens of Lolth-extensions of the Spider Queen's will dedicated to acting as her spies, taskmasters, and agents of villainy. They attend their goddess in the Demonweb Pits, but Lolth sometimes dispatches yochlols to the Material Plane to guard her temples and to aid her most devout priestesses. Yochlols don't form outside Lolth's realm of the Demonweb, and they serve no demon lords except their queen.": "yochlols是Lolth的女仆--蜘蛛女王意志的延伸，专门充当她的间谍、任务负责人和恶棍代理人。他们在魔网坑中侍奉他们的女神，但洛尔思有时也会派遣Yochlols到物质世界来守护她的神庙，并帮助她最虔诚的女祭司。Yochlols不会在Lolth的魔网领域之外形成，除了他们的女王，他们不为任何恶魔领主服务。",
	"Outside the Abyss, a yochlol can assume the guise of a female drow or monstrous spider to conceal its demonic form. In its true form, the fiend appears as a pillar of yellow slime with a single malevolent eye. In its drow and true form, a yochlol's touch carries the same venomous touch as its spider form's bite.": "在深渊之外，Yochlol可以伪装成女性乌鸦或畸形蜘蛛来掩盖它的恶魔形态。在它的真实形态下，这个恶魔看起来就像一根黄色的粘液柱，有一只恶毒的眼睛。在它的乌鸦和真实形态中，Yochlol的触摸带有与它的蜘蛛形态的咬合一样的毒液。",

	" The yuan-ti were once humans who thrived in the earliest days of civilization and worshiped serpents as totem animals. They lauded the serpent's sinuous flexibility, its calculated poise, and its deadly strike. Their advanced philosophy taught the virtue of detachment from emotion and of clear, focused thought.": " 元帝曾经是人类，他们在最早的文明时代繁衍生息，将蛇作为图腾动物来崇拜。他们赞美蛇的蜿蜒灵活、精打细算的姿态和致命的攻击。他们先进的哲学教导人们脱离情感的美德和清晰、集中的思想。",
	"Yuan-ti culture was among the richest in the mortal world. Their warriors were legendary, their empires always expanding. Yuan-ti temples stood at the centers of ancient metropolises, reaching ever higher in prayer to the gods they longed to emulate. In time, the serpent gods heard those prayers, their sibilant voices responding from the darkness as they told the yuan-ti what they must do. The yuan-ti religion grew more fanatical in its devotion. Cults bound themselves to the worship of the serpent gods and imitated their ways, indulging in cannibalism and humanoid sacrifice. Through foul sorcery, the yuan-ti bred with snakes, utterly sacrificing their humanity to become like the serpent gods in form, as well as in thought and emotion.": "元帝文化是凡人世界中最富有的文化之一。他们的战士是富有传奇色彩的，他们的帝国一直在扩张。元帝的寺庙矗立在古代大都市的中心，向他们渴望效仿的神灵祈祷，祈求越来越高。久而久之，蛇神听到了这些祈祷，他们从黑暗中发出咝咝的声音，告诉元帝他们必须做什么。元帝的宗教在其奉献中变得更加狂热。邪教将自己捆绑在对蛇神的崇拜上，并模仿他们的方式，沉迷于食人和人形祭祀。通过肮脏的巫术，元老们与蛇交配，完全牺牲了自己的人性，在形式上、思想上和情感上都变得像蛇神。",
	"Yuan-ti know that the world they hope to rule can't be bound for long by brute force, and that many creatures will refuse to serve. As a result, yuan-ti first influence other creatures with the promise of wealth and power. Time and again, humanoid cultures make the fatal mistake of trusting the yuan-ti. They forget that a yuan-ti that acts honorably or lends aid in a time of trouble does so only as part of a grander design.": "元帝知道，他们希望统治的世界不可能长期被蛮力束缚，而且许多生物会拒绝服务。因此，元帝首先以财富和权力的承诺来影响其他生物。一次又一次，类人文化犯了一个致命的错误，即信任元帝。他们忘记了，在困难时期表现得很光荣或提供帮助的元天，只是作为一个更宏大计划的一部分。",

They have no sense of honorable combat and strike first in decisive ambush if they can.": "元老级领导人是狡猾而无情的战术家，如果潜在的胜利能证明这种损失是合理的，他们就会轻易牺牲较小的元老级。他们没有光荣的战斗意识，如果可以的话，他们会在决定性的伏击中先发制人。",
	" The yuan-ti view their physical transformation as a transcendent moment for their race, allowing them to shed their frail humanity like dead skin. Those that did not transform eventually became slaves or food for the blessed of the serpent gods. The yuan-ti empires withered or were defeated by those who fought against their cannibalism and slavery, and the serpent folk were left in the ruins of their great capitals, far removed from other races.": " 元帝认为他们的身体转变是他们种族的一个超越性时刻，使他们能够像死皮一样褪去脆弱的人性。那些没有转变的人最终成为奴隶或蛇神祝福的食物。元帝帝国凋零了，或者被那些反对他们的食人和奴役的人打败了，蛇人被留在他们的大国首都的废墟中，远离其他种族。",
	" Humanoid emotions are foreign to most yuan-ti, which understand sentiment only as unexploitable weakness.

	" Merrshaulk is the long slumbering chief deity of the yuan-ti. As worship of Merrshaulk waned, he went into slumber.

	" Sseth appeared to the yuan-ti of antiquity in the form of a winged yuan-ti claiming to be an avatar of Merrshaulk. Speaking with Merrshaulk's voice, Sseth vowed to pull the yuan-ti out of decline and build a new empire. Many of Merrshaulk's devout turned to the worship of Sseth. Some yuan-ti have long suspected Sseth as an usurper taking advantage of Merrshaulk's slumber to make himself a god. They believe that Sseth might even have devoured Merrshaulk, and now answers the prayers of Merrshaulk's followers, as his priests convert or consume Merrshaulk's more stubborn adherents.": " Sseth以一个长着翅膀的元老的形式出现在古代的元老面前，声称是梅尔绍尔克的化身。Sseth用Merrshaulk的声音说话，发誓要把元朝从衰落中拉出来，建立一个新的帝国。许多默尔绍尔克的信徒转而崇拜赛斯。一些元老长期以来一直怀疑Sseth是一个篡位者，利用默尔绍尔克的沉睡使自己成为神。他们认为，赛斯甚至可能已经吞噬了默尔绍尔克，现在回应默尔绍尔克追随者的祈祷，因为他的牧师改变或吞噬了默尔绍尔克更顽固的信徒。",

	"Purebloods form the lowest caste of yuan-ti society. They closely resemble humans, yet a pureblood can't pass for human under close scrutiny because there's always some hint of its true nature, such as scaly patches of skin, serpentine eyes, pointed teeth, or a forked tongue.

	"The first yugoloths were created by a sisterhood of night hags on Gehenna. It is widely believed that Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, commissioned the work, in the hope of creating an army of fiends that were not bound to the Nine Hells. In the course of making this new army, the hags crafted four magic tomes and recorded the true names of every yugoloth they created, save one, the General of Gehenna. These tomes were called the Books of Keeping. Since knowing a fiend's true name grants power over it, the hags used the books to ensure the yugoloths' loyalty. They also used the books to capture the true names of other fiends that crossed them. It is rumored that the Books of Keeping contain the true names of a few demon lords and archdevils as well.": "第一批尤戈洛特人是由地府的一个夜魔姐妹会创造的。人们普遍认为，九层地狱的主宰阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）委托了这项工作，希望能创造一支不受九层地狱约束的恶魔军队。在制造这支新军队的过程中，女巫们制作了四本魔法书，并记录了他们创造的每一个尤格罗人的真实姓名，只有一个人除外，即地狱将军。这些书被称为 \"保持之书\"。由于知道一个恶魔的真名就能赋予它力量，女巫们用这些书来确保尤格罗人的忠诚度。他们还用这些书来捕捉其他与他们交恶的魔族的真实姓名。据传闻，《守护之书》还包含一些恶魔领主和大恶魔的真实姓名。",
	"Petty jealousies and endless bickering caused the sisterhood to dissolve, and in the ensuing power grab, the Books of Keeping were lost or stolen. No longer indentured to anyone, the yugoloths gained independence, and they now offer their services to the highest bidder.": "琐碎的嫉妒和无休止的争吵导致姐妹会解体，在随后的权力争夺中，守护之书丢失或被盗。不再受制于任何人，尤戈洛特人获得了独立，他们现在向出价最高的人提供服务。",
	"Summoned yugoloths demand much for their time and loyalty. Whatever promises a yugoloth makes are quickly broken when a better opportunity presents itself. Unlike demons, yugoloths can be reasoned with, but unlike devils, they are rarely true to their word.": "被召唤的尤戈洛人对他们的时间和忠诚度要求很高。当更好的机会出现时，无论尤戈洛人做出什么承诺都会很快被打破。与恶魔不同，尤戈洛人可以被说动，但与恶魔不同，他们很少信守诺言。",
	"Yugoloths can be found anywhere, but the high cost of maintaining a yugoloth army's loyalty typically exceeds what any warlord on the Material Plane can pay. Being self-serving creatures, yugoloths quarrel among themselves constantly. A yugoloth army is more organized than a ravening horde of demons, but far less orderly and regimented than a legion of devils. Without a powerful leader to keep them in line, yugoloths fight simply to indulge their violent predilections, and only as long as it benefits them to do so.": "在任何地方都可以找到尤格罗人，但维持尤格罗人军队的忠诚度的高昂成本通常超过物质世界的任何军阀所能支付的。作为一种自我服务的生物，尤格罗人之间的争吵不断。尤格罗人的军队比贪婪的恶魔部落更有组织性，但远不如恶魔军团那么有秩序和有条理。如果没有一个强大的领袖来维持他们的秩序，尤戈洛人战斗只是为了放纵他们的暴力倾向，而且只要这样做对他们有利就可以了。",
	"When a yugoloth dies, it dissolves into a pool of ichor and reforms at full strength on the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna. Only on its native plane can a yugoloth be destroyed permanently.

	"When a yugoloth is permanently destroyed, its name vanishes from every Book of Keeping. If a yugoloth is re-created by way of an unholy ritual requiring the expenditure of souls, its name reappears in the books.": "当yugoloth被永久地摧毁时，它的名字就会从每本守望之书中消失。如果一个尤格罗人通过需要消耗灵魂的非神圣仪式被重新创造出来，它的名字就会重新出现在书中。",
	"When all four copies of the Books of Keeping disappeared, Asmodeus and the night hags lost control of their yugoloth creations. Each Book of Keeping still exists, drifting from plane to plane, where the brave and the foolish occasionally stumble upon them. A yugoloth summoned using its true name, as inscribed in the Books of Keeping, is forced to serve its summoner obediently. The yugoloth hates being controlled in this manner and isn't shy about making its displeasure known. Like a petulant child, it will follow its instructions to the letter while looking for opportunities to misinterpret them.": "当所有四本《守护之书》都消失后，阿斯莫德和夜行者失去了对他们的尤戈洛特创造物的控制。每本守护之书仍然存在，从一个位面漂移到另一个位面，勇敢的人和愚蠢的人偶尔会在那里偶然发现它们。使用刻在《守护之书》上的真名召唤的尤戈洛人，被迫顺从地服务于召唤者。尤戈洛人讨厌以这种方式被控制，并不吝于表达自己的不满。就像一个任性的孩子，它将严格遵守其指令，同时寻找机会曲解它们。",
	"Somewhere in the brimstone wastes of Gehenna, there roams an ultroloth so strong that none contests his power: the General of Gehenna.

	"Whatever the case, no fiend finds the General unless the General desires it. His personal name is unknown, and even the Books of Keeping contain no mention of this powerful, thoroughly evil entity.": "无论怎样，没有恶魔能找到将军，除非将军希望如此。他的个人名字不为人知，甚至在《守护之书》中也没有提到这个强大而彻底的邪恶实体。",

	"Most zombies are made from humanoid remains, though the flesh and bones of any formerly living creature can be imbued with a semblance of life. Necromantic magic, usually from spells, animates a zombie. Some zombies rise spontaneously when dark magic saturates an area. Once turned into a zombie, a creature can't be restored to life except by powerful magic, such as a {@spell resurrection} spell.": "大多数僵尸是由人的遗体制成的，尽管任何以前活着的生物的肉和骨头都可以被赋予生命的模样。亡灵魔法，通常来自于法术，使僵尸具有活力。一些僵尸在黑暗魔法饱和的情况下自发崛起。一旦变成僵尸，生物就无法恢复生命，除非通过强大的魔法，比如（%0%）法术。",
	"A zombie retains no vestiges of its former self, its mind devoid of thought and imagination. A zombie left without orders simply stands in place and rots unless something comes along that it can kill. The magic animating a zombie imbues it with evil, so left without purpose, it attacks any living creature it encounters.": "僵尸没有保留以前的残余，它的头脑没有思想和想象力。没有命令的僵尸只是站在原地腐烂，除非有它能杀死的东西出现。赋予僵尸生命的魔法使它充满邪恶，所以在没有目的的情况下，它会攻击它遇到的任何生物。",
	"Zombies appear as they did in life, showing the wounds that killed them. However, the magic that creates these vile creatures often takes time to run its course. Dead warriors might rise from a battlefield, eviscerated and bloated after days in the sun. The muddy cadaver of a peasant could claw its way from the ground, riddled with maggots and worms. A zombie might wash ashore or rise from a marsh, swollen and reeking after weeks in the water.": "僵尸的出现与他们生前一样，显示出杀死他们的伤口。然而，创造这些卑劣生物的魔法往往需要时间来完成它的过程。死去的战士可能会从战场上站起来，在太阳下晒了几天后，他们的内脏被剥落，身体臃肿。泥泞的农民尸体可能会从地面上爬起来，上面布满了蛆虫和蠕虫。一个僵尸可能被冲上岸，或者从沼泽地里爬出来，在水里泡了几周后肿胀并发出恶臭。",
	"Zombies take the most direct route to any foe, unable to comprehend obstacles, tactics, or dangerous terrain. A zombie might stumble into a fast-flowing river to reach foes on a far shore, clawing at the surface as it is battered against rocks and destroyed. To reach a foe below it, a zombie might step out of an open window. Zombies stumble through roaring infernos, into pools of acid, and across fields littered with caltrops without hesitation.": "僵尸采取最直接的路线接近任何敌人，无法理解障碍、战术或危险的地形。一个僵尸可能会跌入一条湍急的河流，以到达远处海岸上的敌人，当它被岩石撞击和破坏时，它在水面上抓挠着。为了到达下面的敌人，僵尸可能会从一个敞开的窗口走出去。僵尸跌跌撞撞地穿过咆哮的地狱，进入酸液池，并毫不犹豫地穿过堆满石块的场地。",
	"A zombie can follow simple orders and distinguish friends from foes, but its ability to reason is limited to shambling in whatever direction it is pointed, pummeling any enemy in its path. A zombie armed with a weapon uses it, but the zombie won't retrieve a dropped weapon or other tool until told to do so.": "僵尸可以听从简单的命令，区分朋友和敌人，但它的推理能力仅限于向它所指向的任何方向晃动，捣毁它路上的任何敌人。装备有武器的僵尸会使用武器，但僵尸不会捡回掉落的武器或其他工具，除非被告知这样做。",
