	"So little is known of the deep crows that even less is known of their monstrous leviathan cousins, the ancient deep crows. Whether these gargantuan specimens are elder deep crows grown to great size or some higher form that holds lesser deep crows in thrall remains to be determined. Ideally by someone else. Seriously, stay away from these things.": "人们对深海乌鸦知之甚少，而对它们那可怕的利维坦表亲--古代深海乌鸦的了解就更少。这些巨大的标本究竟是长者深海乌鸦长成的巨大体型，还是某种更高的形式，将较小的深海乌鸦控制在手中，还有待确定。最好是由其他人来确定。说真的，离这些东西远一点。",
	"The youngest sister of Omin Dran, the half-elf Auspicia Dran had her life torn apart as a child when she was seized by a mysterious creature called the Wandering Crypt. Having spent long years in a kind of dark dream within the crypt, she was saved in the end by her brother Omin's tireless efforts and the valor of his handpicked \"C\" Team. Now returned safely to the world-and with the false Auspicia of the crypt's creation slain-she focuses on trying to discover her own identity and to work through the ongoing complications arising from her ordeal.": "半精灵奥斯皮西亚-德兰（Auspicia Dran）是奥明-德兰（Omin Dran）最小的妹妹，当她被一个叫做 \"游荡地穴 \"的神秘生物抓住时，她的生活就被撕碎了。她在地窖里的黑暗梦境中度过了漫长的岁月，最后她被她哥哥奥明的不懈努力和他精心挑选的 \"C \"小组的英勇行为所拯救。现在，她安全地回到了这个世界，并且随着地窖创造的假Auspicia被杀，她专注于尝试发现自己的身份，并解决她的苦难所带来的持续复杂问题。",
	"When Auspicia emerged from the Wandering Crypt, she carried within her a growing level of psionic power. She can't help but read others' minds, but finds that wearing a diamond earring helps tamp that unwitting ability down. This magic has also left her connected to the crypt in a way she doesn't understand, even as it grants her occasional memories of others still trapped there and an awareness of faraway places. In combat, she manifests an instinctive knowledge of events before they happen, often making use of this ability to bring a fight to a standstill that encourages parley. But she has only just begun to explore her full precognitive potential.": "当Auspicia从流浪地穴中出来时，她体内的幻觉能力越来越强。她忍不住要读懂别人的思想，但她发现戴上钻石耳环有助于抑制这种不知不觉的能力。这种魔法也让她以一种她不理解的方式与地窖联系在一起，即使它偶尔赋予她对仍然被困在那里的其他人的记忆和对遥远地方的意识。在战斗中，她表现出对事件发生前的本能认知，经常利用这种能力使战斗陷入僵局，从而鼓励双方谈判。但她只是刚刚开始探索她全部的预知潜力。",
	"Formally a former member of the \"B\" Team, Brahma Lutier is a gifted cartographer, spy, and troubadour. Tutored in at least the latter of those vocations by Audra Courtier (wife of Propha Dran and co-owner of the Dran & Courtier inn of Red Larch), Brahma's specialty is a song of domination that is legendarily difficult to resist.": "梵天-卢蒂尔曾是 \"B \"队的成员，他是一位有天赋的制图师、间谍和吟游诗人。奥德拉-库蒂埃（Propha Dran的妻子和红落叶松的Dran & Courtier旅馆的共同拥有者）至少在后一种职业方面给予了指导，布拉马的特长是一首统治之歌，传说中很难抵挡。",
	"Her retirement is said to be connected to a falling out with husband Oak Truestrike, and Brahma has been operating as a solo agent for some time now. Known for a personality that is murderous and cheery in equal part, she utilizes an instrument of dragonborn design in combat. Known as a war lute, this unique item comes replete with hidden storage and powerful weaponry.": "据说她的退休与丈夫奥克-特鲁斯特里克（Oak Truestrike）的失和有关，而梵天作为一个单独的特工已经有一段时间了。她的性格以凶残和快乐并存而闻名，她在战斗中使用一种龙族设计的工具。这把独特的乐器被称为 \"战争琵琶\"，它带有隐藏的存储空间和强大的武器装备。",
	"A cluster of four suckered tentacles with a pulsing mass of ethereal light as its central body, the chaos quadrapod is a creature of the Far Realm, and it channels the anarchic power of that plane as it destroys all in its path. The quadrapod ambulates by flinging its mucus-covered tentacles out and dragging itself along, creating a horrid slurping sound as it advances relentlessly toward its prey.": "混乱四足虫是一个由四条被吸住的触手组成的集群，它的中心体是一团脉动的空灵之光，它是远界的生物，当它摧毁所有在其路径上的东西时，它引导着那个平面的无政府力量。四足动物通过甩出覆盖着粘液的触手，拖着自己前进，当它无情地走向它的猎物时，会发出可怕的啜饮声。",
	"These intricately crafted constructs are typically made to reflect the forms of the metallic dragons. Plated in brass, bronze, copper, or faux gold and silver, they are often taken for fine draconic statues at first glance. A clockwork dragon makes a formidable guardian or defender, with its advanced intellect allowing it to be programmed with a wide range of orders, as well as being capable of wholly independent reactions to potential threats.": "这些精雕细琢的建筑通常是为了反映金属龙的形态。它们被镀上黄铜、青铜、铜或假金银，乍一看往往被认为是精美的龙形雕像。钟表龙是一个强大的守护者或防御者，其先进的智力允许它被编程为各种命令，并能够对潜在的威胁做出完全独立的反应。",
	"Though most clockwork dragons have a breath weapon that deals fire damage, some might be constructed to deal acid, cold, or lightning damage, depending on their makers' whims.": "虽然大多数发条龙的呼吸武器都能造成火的伤害，但有些发条龙可能被构造成能造成酸、冷或闪电的伤害，这取决于其制造者的想法。",
	"The only warning you'll get is that fearsome, far-off caw, echoing from the darkness like a death knell. For by the time those glowing red eyes fix on you, it's far too late to run...": "你得到的唯一警告是那可怕的、遥远的叫声，从黑暗中回响，就像死亡的钟声。因为当那些发亮的红眼睛盯着你的时候，你想跑已经太晚了......",
	"Some adventurers and sages whisper that deep crows were first spawned as the familiars of evil arcane casters, abandoned in the subterranean depths and left to grow to enormous size. Others claim these creatures were once normal crows transmuted by vile essence and viler powers. But one thing all agree on is that ending up a meal for one of these monstrosities is a too-real threat for those who stumble into their deadly lairs.": "一些冒险家和法师低声说，深海乌鸦最初是作为邪恶的奥术施法者的随从，被遗弃在地下深处，任其成长为巨大的个体。还有人声称这些生物曾经是由邪恶的本质和邪恶的力量转化而来的正常乌鸦。但有一点大家都同意，对于那些误入它们致命巢穴的人来说，最终成为这些怪兽的食物是一个非常真实的威胁。",
	"Though the deep crow most immediately resembles a massive version of its namesake bird, this creature is a unique form of avian insect. Seen up close, it can easily be discerned from any other giant bird by its insectoid maw, its four-clawed feet, and the cluster of red eyes that are the most unsettling part of its appearance.": "虽然深海乌鸦最像其同名鸟类的巨大版本，但这种生物是一种独特形式的鸟类昆虫。从近处看，它可以很容易地从任何其他巨鸟中辨别出来，它的昆虫般的大嘴、四爪的脚，以及它外表最令人不安的一簇红色眼睛。",
	"The deep crow's most fearsome attack is the bite of its mandibles, which can seize and hold almost any creature. Their preferred attack is a snatch-and-grab that sees a deep crow flying off with a living victim before its companions have any chance of counterattack. Provided the doomed prey doesn't struggle, the deep crow takes it back to its lair to be devoured at leisure. Creatures that do struggle might be repeatedly dropped from a height to soften them up a bit.": "深海乌鸦最可怕的攻击是它的下颚的咬合，它可以抓住并控制几乎任何生物。它们的首选攻击方式是抢夺，即在同伴有任何反击机会之前，深海乌鸦带着活生生的受害者飞走。只要注定失败的猎物不挣扎，深海乌鸦就会把它带回自己的巢穴，任其吞噬。挣扎的生物可能会被反复地从高处摔下，以使它们软化一些。",
	"Deep crows live alone for an unknown length of years, emerging from the lair only to hunt, to look for potential threats, and to mate. Mating is a once-in-a-lifetime urge that sees each deep crow involved in the pairing produce a cluster of four to eight eggs. Incubation lasts a year, followed by a year during which the fledgling deep crows stay close by their parent's side. The young then set out to establish lairs of their own.": "深海乌鸦独自生活了不知多少年，只有在狩猎、寻找潜在威胁和交配时才会从巢穴中出来。交配是一生一次的冲动，参与配对的每只深海乌鸦都会产生一簇四到八个蛋。孵化期持续一年，随后的一年里，刚出生的深海乌鸦紧跟在它们的父母身边。然后幼鸟开始建立自己的巢穴。",
	"The mindset of these intelligent yet alien creatures is a mystery, but some who have encountered them relate that they are quick to hold a grudge. For years. Of even greater importance, they can teach their chicks to harbor the same resentments, instilling a cross-generational hatred of chosen foes that can last for centuries.": "这些聪明而又陌生的生物的心态是个谜，但一些遇到过它们的人说，它们很快就会记仇。多年来如此。更重要的是，它们可以教它们的小鸡怀有同样的怨恨，灌输给它们对选定的敌人的跨代仇恨，这种仇恨可以持续几个世纪。",
	"Deep crows and ancient deep crows roost in places both deep and warm, favoring sites with access to exposed lava. The spires of volcanic rock the creatures prize as roosts are common in such places, whose ambient warmth provides constant temperature regulation for the creature's eggs.": "深海乌鸦和古老的深海乌鸦在既深又暖的地方栖息，偏爱能接触到裸露熔岩的地方。这些生物作为栖息地的火山岩尖顶在这种地方很常见，其环境的温暖为生物的卵提供了持续的温度调节。",
	"Everybody cooooool out!": "每个人都咕嘟咕嘟地出来了!",
	"The hulking dragonborn decisionist of the \"C\" Team, Donaar Blit'zen is an icon of brash confidence and warrior chill. He is known for his furious skill in battle, and for his propensity to fall asleep as soon as a fight is done (as well as countless other inopportune times). More immediately notable is the unique physical trait that all members of his clan bear-a stylish tail that is rare and often considered a deformity among dragonborn.": "多纳尔-布利特赞是 \"C \"队中身材魁梧的龙裔决策人，他是一个粗暴自信和冷酷战士的代表。他因在战斗中的狂暴技巧而闻名，也因他一打完架就睡着的倾向而闻名（以及无数其他不恰当的时候）。更值得注意的是，他的部族所有成员都有一个独特的身体特征--时尚的尾巴，这在龙族中是很罕见的，通常被认为是一种畸形。",
	"As with his tail, an odd quirk of heritage makes Donaar's acid breath more of a signature vomiting, giving rise to a driving paranoia that this regurgitation might damage his teeth. As testaments to his obsession with dental hygiene, Donaar named his greatsword Toothbrush and calls his whip Floss. He carries an actual toothbrush (named Percival) and actual floss at all times.": "和他的尾巴一样，一个奇怪的遗产怪癖使多纳尔的酸性呼吸更像是一种标志性的呕吐，引起了一种强烈的妄想，即这种反刍可能会损害他的牙齿。为了证明他对牙齿卫生的痴迷，多纳尔将他的大剑命名为牙刷，并称他的鞭子为牙线。他随时都带着一把真正的牙刷（名为帕西瓦尔）和真正的牙线。",
	"Those who know Donaar quickly come to recognize that the braggadocio that defines him involves a certain amount of artifice. When the young dragonborn left his clan and family to adventure in foreign climes, he realized that doing so provided the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself for folk who had no idea what he was once like. As such, Donaar has learned that no amount of bravado and compensation is too much-provided he leaves no openings for strangers to call him on it. By the same token, strangers quickly come to realize that reinforcing Donaar's self-congratulating sense of draconic entitlement makes it remarkably easy to win his favor.": "了解多纳尔的人很快就会认识到，决定他的夸夸其谈包含了一定程度的矫揉造作。当这个年轻的龙裔离开他的部族和家庭到国外冒险时，他意识到这样做为那些不知道他曾经是什么样子的人提供了一个完美的机会来重新塑造自己。因此，多纳尔了解到，只要不给陌生人留下骂他的机会，再多的炫耀和补偿也不过分。同样的道理，陌生人很快就会意识到，加强多纳尔自我安慰的龙族权利感会让他非常容易赢得他的好感。",
	"Despite his easily massaged vanity, the dragonborn sometimes shows the occasional streak of selflessness. Most notably, Donaar serves in his off-hours as parttime godfather to a young dragonborn named Chronaar, who had inadvertently imprinted on Donaar as a parental figure while he watched over her while she was in her egg.": "尽管他的虚荣心很容易得到满足，但这个龙裔有时也会表现出偶尔的无私精神。最值得注意的是，多纳尔在非工作时间担任一个名叫克洛纳的年轻龙裔的兼职教父，当多纳尔还在蛋里的时候，他无意中把她当成了父母的形象。",
	"Not much is known of the mysterious and aloof majordomo of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office, the mage known as Flabbergast. It's said that he hails from Neverwinter, and that his wealthy family helped erect and carve the famous Dolphin Bridge in that city. Although he detests physical labor, Flabbergast is a bit of a bridge builder in his own way, always striving to bring people together and flexing his diplomatic muscles. A pacifist bureaucrat, he abhors violence, and rarely puts his magical prowess on display.": "人们对收购公司总部神秘而冷漠的老板，也就是被称为Flabbergast的法师了解不多。据说他来自永夜城，他富有的家庭帮助建立和雕刻了该城著名的海豚桥。虽然他厌恶体力劳动，但弗拉贝加斯特以他自己的方式有点像桥梁建设者，总是努力把人们聚集在一起，并发挥他的外交力量。作为一个和平主义的官僚，他厌恶暴力，很少将他的魔法能力展示出来。",
	"One thing that is known (though it's seldom spoken of) is that Flabbergast once worked for Dran Enterprises, and specifically for Portentia Dran. He carries a certain amount of guilt around being complicit in certain Dran Enterprises' dealings, and helped Acquisitions Incorporated on the side even before taking up an official role with the company. Though Head Office certainly trusts him, others might wonder where his true loyalties lie.": "有一件事是众所周知的（尽管很少被提及），弗拉贝加斯特曾经为德兰企业工作过，特别是为波特蒂亚-德兰工作。他对自己在德兰企业的某些交易中的同谋行为怀有一定的愧疚感，甚至在担任公司的正式职务之前，他就在侧面帮助收购公司。虽然总部肯定会信任他，但其他人可能会怀疑他的真正忠诚度在哪里。",

	"Have a magical day!": "祝你有一个神奇的一天!",
	"James Winifred Darkmagic III is the scion of a mysterious, multiplanar wizarding family. Jim's arcane pedigree has long preceded him, incorporating equally healthy amounts of magical training and innate eldritch prowess. However, despite a natural talent that could have allowed him to make a name for himself as a court wizard, or perhaps \"that strange old man in the village,\" Jim's original penchant was not for the magic of scroll or spell, but for the stage.": "詹姆斯-维尼弗雷德-黑魔三世是一个神秘的、多星球的魔法家族的后代。吉姆的奥秘血统在他之前就已经存在了，包含了同样健康的魔法训练和天生的长生不老的能力。然而，尽管他的天赋可以让他作为宫廷魔法师，或者 \"村里的怪老头 \"而名声大噪，但吉姆最初的爱好不是卷轴或咒语的魔法，而是舞台。",
	"As an entertainer and purveyor of the \"Jim Darkmagic Experience,\" the legendary mage can often be found in markets and town squares, performing feats of mundane legerdemain. The renown he has earned for these feats is nearly equaled by the reputation that follows him as chief arcanist (and occasional arsonist) for Acquisitions Incorporated. And although his skills as an adventurer and real wizard remain highly sought after, Jim looks forward to a well-earned retirement, at which point he hopes to become a \"real wizard\"-by which he means a fake wizard-full time.": "作为一个艺人和 \"吉姆-达克马奇经验 \"的传播者，这位传奇法师经常出现在市场和城镇广场上，表演世俗的诡计。他因这些壮举而赢得的声誉几乎等同于他作为收购公司的首席奥术师（偶尔也是纵火犯）的声誉。尽管他作为冒险家和真正的巫师的技能仍然备受追捧，但吉姆期待着理所当然的退休，届时他希望能成为一名 \"真正的巫师\"--他指的是全职的假巫师。",

	"The drow warlock K'thriss Drow'b cuts a dashing figure as the worldly representative of the Ur-a ravenous, inscrutable, and largely indifferent elder entity from beyond reality. Tapped into this dark power, the \"C\" Team's hoards person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called \"reality.\" Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can't afford to make more enemies.": "鸦人术士K'thriss Drow'b作为乌尔的世俗代表，有着潇洒的形象--一个来自现实之外的贪婪的、不可捉摸的、基本无动于衷的长者实体。挖掘这种黑暗的力量，\"C \"小组的囤积者将所有的存在看作是一个需要解开的谜题，他被所谓的 \"现实 \"结构中本质上的缺乏意义和目的所困扰。尽管如此，考虑到所有的事情，他往往还是很有礼貌和亲和力。因为经过长期的冒险生涯，他明白他不能再树敌了。",
	"Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow's hair jet-black. His matching \"beard\" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K'thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.": "鉴于他的蓝色肤色，有传言说K'thris是混血儿，但没有人知道。作为一个年轻的、对Lolth充满怀疑的信徒，他偶然发现了一个被称为黑祭坛的遗迹碎片，使他接触到了其无限的真理，并使这个乌鸦的头发变得漆黑。他配套的 \"胡须 \"实际上是一个缓慢生长的惰性孢子群，K'thris认为这让他看起来与众不同。他拥有一双令人震惊的、不对称的晶体眼睛，他经常戴着眼罩，不让别人看到他的面容，而他则通过他熟悉的人的眼睛看。",
	"Tentacles play a big part in K'thriss's spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as thorn whip. And when enemies hear K'thriss whisper the deep truths of the Ur-typically something about how on a geologic time scale, everyone's desires are meaningless-they remember it.": "触手在K'thris的法术中扮演着重要的角色，无论是在他使用魔法飞行时将他拉过天空，还是在他施展荆棘鞭等法术时以黑暗、吸血的形式出现。当敌人听到K'thris低声讲述乌尔的深层真理时--通常是关于在地质时间尺度上，每个人的欲望都是无意义的--他们会记住它。",
	"K'thriss's familiar, Ligotti, is a semisapient remnant of a tentacle attack, spawned by the warlock's intercessor patron god. Though entirely alien to the material plane (and often appearing in the form of a staff), Ligotti uses the stat block of a poisonous snake with these changes:": "K'thris的熟人，Ligotti，是一个触手攻击的半透明残余物，由术士的调解人守护神催生。虽然完全不属于物质世界（而且经常以法杖的形式出现），但Ligotti使用的是带有这些变化的毒蛇的状态块。",

	"A keg robot is a stout wood-and-metal construct, vaguely reminiscent of a dwarf wearing a horned helm and possessing a barrel for a body. These constructs are another achievement of the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development (HARD) department of Acquisitions Incorporated. These devices have a number of practical purposes, including the ability to be filled with a variety of substances of use to an adventuring party. Specific models are nominally named for their primary function, including \"ambulatory fermenter,\" \"mobile alchemical dispensary,\" and so forth. But their prominent use as portable beer dispensers has placed the name \"keg robot\" firmly into public consciousness.": "酒桶机器人是一种坚固的木头和金属结构，依稀让人联想到一个戴着角质头盔的矮人，拥有一个酒桶作为身体。这些构造物是收购公司的启发式奥术研究和发展（HARD）部门的另一项成就。这些装置有很多实用的用途，包括可以装入各种对冒险者有用的物质。具体型号名义上是以其主要功能命名的，包括 \"流动发酵器\"、\"移动炼金术药房 \"等等。但它们作为便携式啤酒分配器的突出使用，使 \"酒桶机器人 \"这一名称牢固地进入了公众的意识。",
	"A keg robot can hold up to three different kinds of liquid in its body cavity, from water and other potables to alchemical substances and lamp oil. Its individual storage compartments can leak, providing drinkable liquids with a unique but mostly safe flavor. These constructs have a rudimentary intellect that allows them to operate independently and discern friend from foe-and which sometimes causes them to operate with a crass sense of humor that has never been fully explained.": "一个小桶机器人可以在其体腔内容纳多达三种不同的液体，从水和其他可饮用水到炼金物质和灯油。它的独立存储隔间可以泄漏，提供具有独特但大多安全的可饮用液体。这些构造物有一个基本的智力，使它们能够独立运作并辨别敌我，而且有时会导致它们以一种粗俗的幽默感运作，而这种幽默感从未被完全解释。",

Famously, she is the only member of Acquisitions Incorporated known to be paid in advance, lest a missed invoice lead to dire repercussions.": "游侠Môrgæn是一个著名的追踪者和猎手，能够在任何范围内准确定位敌人，然后消失在树林里，没有人知道。她使用长弓和定制箭矢的传奇能力使她的许多敌人和她的一些同事感到恐惧。著名的是，她是收购公司中唯一一个提前付款的成员，以免错过发票导致可怕的后果。",
	"A child of the forest, Môrgæn defends the natural world with singular ferocity and an impressive rate of sustained fire. Her core philosophy is that one should shoot first and then ask no questions later. Because what's the point of asking questions when the person you've shot first is already dead? Still, when the situation calls for it, this protector of the woodlands is equally at home on missions of subterfuge and social interaction in the big city, provided her well-known love of ale, wine, and other intoxicants doesn't get the better of her.": "作为森林里的孩子，莫尔金以奇特的凶猛和令人印象深刻的持续射击速度捍卫自然世界。她的核心理念是，人应该先开枪，然后再问问题。因为当你先开枪的人已经死了，再问问题还有什么意义？不过，当情况需要时，这位林地的保护者也同样可以在大城市中执行潜伏和社交任务，只要她对啤酒、葡萄酒和其他麻醉品的喜爱不超过她的能力。",

The person known as Portentia is actually a changeling, who took the place of the real Portentia before her fifth year.": "现在是德兰企业的所有者和驱动力--也许是收购公司在冒险-营利-权力事业中最显著的对手--波特蒂亚-德兰比她表面上看起来更多。从字面上看是这样。被称为Portentia的人实际上是一个变种人，她在第五年之前取代了真正的Portentia的位置。",
	"The changeling Portentia can affect a range of dis guises, and has spent long years engaged in a mission of manipulating the members of the Dran family. Years ago, it was Portentia who tricked her sister Auspicia into exploring the depths of the Wandering Crypt. And she would have been successful in arranging for Omin to be claimed by that creature as well if he hadn't fled immediately in search of a weapon to aid his captured sister.    ": "变种人波坦蒂亚可以影响一系列的变身，并花了很长的时间从事操纵德兰家族成员的任务。几年前，是波坦提亚欺骗了她的妹妹奥斯皮西亚，让她去探索流浪墓穴的深处。而她本来也会成功地安排奥明被那个生物认领，如果他没有立即逃离去寻找武器来帮助他被俘的妹妹的话。",
	"Whether in combat or social encounters, Portentia shifts frequently between different forms and mindsets, only some of which are fully humanoid. She fights to maim, with a cruel combat style that emphasizes surprise and painful instruction. She is willing to affect any appearance or attitude to achieve her goals. But what those goals are-for herself and Dran Enterprises alike-remain a secret known only to her.": "无论是在战斗中还是在社交场合，波坦提亚都会在不同的形式和心态之间频繁转换，其中只有一些是完全的人形。她的战斗是为了致残，其残酷的战斗风格强调惊奇和痛苦的指导。她愿意影响任何外表或态度来实现她的目标。但这些目标是什么，对于她自己和德兰企业来说，都是一个只有她自己知道的秘密。",

	"Weighing in at just under 30 pounds and with a grandmotherly demeanor befitting her advanced age, Rosie Beestinger is easily mistaken for someone on the wrong side of the \"aggressor/victim\" relationship. But this is a mix-up that few people make more than once. Patient and studious, Rosie has schooled more than one malcontent with what the halfling refers to as \"the sauce\"-a whirlwind of kicks and punches to one or the other haunches that can inspire even the toughest half-orc to sprint toward anyplace Rosie isn't. As an increasing number of folk hear the tales of her prowess, the \"C\" Team cartographer's fame among her fellow halflings has become nothing short of legendary. Still, this adoration might be augmented by the sheer number of halflings related to Rosie. She has a daunting number of natural and adopted children, many of whom have followed their mother along the adventuring career track.": "罗西-贝斯汀格体重不到30磅，有着与她的高龄相称的祖母般的举止，她很容易被误认为是处于 \"攻击者/受害者 \"关系中的错误一方。但这是一种很少有人会犯的错误，而且不止一次。罗西耐心好学，用半身人所说的 \"酱汁 \"教训了不止一个不满的人--旋风式的拳打脚踢，甚至能激发最强悍的半兽人向罗西不在的任何地方冲刺。随着越来越多的人听到关于她的能力的故事，\"C \"团队的制图员在她的半兽人同伴中的名声已经变得非常传奇了。不过，这种崇拜可能会因为与罗西有关的半身人数量太多而有所增强。她有数量惊人的亲生和收养的孩子，其中许多人跟随他们的母亲走上了冒险的职业道路。",
	"Rosie's goals have always been more complex than merely seeking after adventure. She has long sought for ultimate meaning in the stars, and to seek justification for her belief that her bonds to her expansive family are reflected in the endless movements and intricate patterns of the sky. However, the Beestinger clan has a less metaphysical reputation in the eyes of many people, as constantly swirling rumors attempt to connect the family to various and nefarious halfling criminal enter prises. Naturally, Rosie knows nothing about any of that. Sure, her nickname is \"Grandmother Night,\" but that probably doesn't mean anything.": "罗西的目标一直比单纯追求冒险要复杂得多。长期以来，她一直在星空中寻求终极意义，并为自己的信念寻找理由，即她与广阔的家庭的联系反映在天空无尽的运动和复杂的图案中。然而，在许多人眼中，Beestinger家族的名声并不那么玄乎，因为不断涌现的谣言试图将该家族与各种邪恶的半身人犯罪活动联系起来。当然，罗西对这些事一无所知。当然，她的绰号是 \"夜祖母\"，但这可能并不意味着什么。",
	"I'm going to give you a piece of advice. Don't trust Acquisitions Incorporated. And never, ever, ever trust Omin Dran. Wait, that's two pieces of advice. You owe me.": "我要给你一个建议。不要相信Acquisition Incorporated。还有，永远不要相信Omin Dran。等等，那是两个建议。你欠我的。",
	"Sometimes a goblin can't catch a break. First, you fall in with a cult that works for the release of a death god. Then you get taken prisoner by a group of sociopathic adventurers who end up letting you die after you save their sorry lives. One minute, you're a dead goblin named Splug. And then you're alive again, and it seems like a really good idea to play up the drama of resurrection with a cool new name-and a master plan for cold, cold revenge against those who betrayed you.": "有时候，一个小妖精是抓不住机会的。首先，你陷入了一个为释放死神而工作的邪教组织。然后你被一群反社会的冒险家俘虏，在你救了他们的命后，他们最终让你死了。前一分钟，你是一个名叫Splug的死地精。然后你又活了过来，用一个很酷的新名字来渲染复活的戏剧性，以及对那些背叛你的人进行冷酷无情的报复的总计划，这似乎是一个非常好的主意。",
	"Every once in a while, the (accidentally) capricious and (totally unintentionally) self-centered nature of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise might incur some collateral damage among followers, hirelings, and staff. When that happens, the collateral damage sometimes inspires some collateral damage of its own. No one is entirely sure how many times Splugoth the Returned has actually returned from the dead. But as the point goblin for the group known as the Six (see \"Factions and Rivals\" in chapter 3), he's made vengeance against Acq Inc and Omin Dran his life's work. And then the work of his next life. And the one after that.": "每隔一段时间，收购公司特许经营的（意外的）任性和（完全无意的）自我中心的性质可能会在追随者、雇佣者和工作人员中引起一些附带损害。当这种情况发生时，这种附带损害有时会激发一些自己的附带损害。没有人完全确定 \"归来者 \"斯普鲁戈斯究竟有多少次从死里复活。但作为被称为 \"六人帮\"（见第三章的 \"派别和对手\"）的团体的主要妖精，他把对阿克公司和奥明德兰的复仇作为他一生的工作。然后是他下辈子的工作。还有下辈子的工作。",
	"I know a story about that...": "我知道一个关于这个的故事...",
	"A product of life on a small-town farm, the rogue known as Viari carries fond memories of those childhood days and his loving family. (Well, except for that thing where his parents insist on thinking of his older brother as the successful one.) But he can be quick to show self-consciousness when talking of where he came from, and he never speaks of the name he bore in that former life After quickly rising in the ranks of Acquisitions Incorporated since joining that august team, Viari has come to head what's known as the organization's Stabbing Department. A potent threat in both dueling and earnest debate, he demonstrates an equal flair for planning and forethought, mad combat moves (involving leaping off high places whenever possible), and dark vengeance.": "作为小镇农场生活的产物，被称为Viari的流氓对那些童年的日子和他可爱的家庭有着美好的回忆。(好吧，除了他的父母坚持认为他的哥哥是成功者的那件事）。但当他谈到自己的来历时，他很快就会表现出自我意识，而且他从不谈论他在以前生活中的名字。自从加入那个庄严的团队后，Viari在收购公司的队伍中迅速崛起，成为该组织的刺杀部的负责人。他在决斗和严肃的辩论中都是一个强大的威胁，他在计划和预想、疯狂的战斗动作（包括尽可能地从高处跳下）和黑暗的复仇方面表现出同等的天赋。",
	"Viari's career as an adventurer was nearly cut short during a battle of which the bards still sing. Unleashing a devastating attack with the aptly named Apocalypse Dagger, the rogue destroyed a giant single-handedly—and lost his arm in the process. Although Viari was made bodily whole again in an equally dramatic magical fashion, some of those closest to him have noticed that those miraculous events weigh on him still, perhaps suggesting consequences that only he foresees.": "维阿利的冒险家生涯在一场吟游诗人仍在歌唱的战斗中几乎被缩短。他用名为 \"天启匕首 \"的武器发动了一次毁灭性的攻击，单枪匹马地消灭了一个巨人--在这个过程中他失去了手臂。虽然维阿利以一种同样戏剧性的魔法方式重新获得了身体上的完整，但一些与他最亲近的人注意到，那些神奇的事件仍然压在他身上，也许暗示着只有他能预见的后果。",
	"The war ever rages.": "战争一直在肆虐。",
	"Growing up in an all-female clan of druids, healers, and rangers, Walnut Dankgrass was drawn to the role of protector from her earliest years. Dedicated to Mielikki, the matriarchal clan known as the Enclave Panax Anima defended the unspoiled wild by word and blade (with the latter option more prevalent by far). But when tragedy struck the enclave, Walnut's clan was destroyed to the last-leaving her with nothing but the all-consuming desire to seek out and destroy those responsible.": "在一个由德鲁伊、治疗师和游侠组成的全女性部族中长大，胡桃-丹克格拉斯在她很小的时候就被吸引到保护者的角色。这个被称为 \"Panax Anima飞地 \"的母系氏族致力于通过言语和武器来捍卫未受破坏的野外环境（到目前为止，后一种方式更为普遍）。但当悲剧降临到飞地时，胡桃的部族被摧毁到最后，留给她的只有寻找并摧毁那些责任人的强烈愿望。",
	"As a guardian of the wild, Walnut has long held an antipathy toward civilization and anything urban. However, understanding that civilization was the source of the evil that destroyed her people, she makes the city her home now. She embraces her role as the \"C\" Team's documancer, knowing that the city's power-and its weaknesses-can be fully gleaned only from within.": "作为野生动物的守护者，胡桃长期以来一直对文明和任何城市事物抱有反感。然而，由于了解到文明是毁灭她的人民的邪恶之源，她现在把城市作为自己的家。她接受了她作为 \"C \"小组记录员的角色，知道这个城市的力量和它的弱点，只有从内部才能完全收集到。",
	"Walnut distrusts most folk she meets, except for those whose bearing reflects the matriarchal structure she was once part of. No matter what shape her struggles take, she knows instinctively that her beliefs are right and true-and that she will follow those beliefs to the bitter end.": "胡桃不信任她遇到的大多数人，除了那些其举止反映她曾经是母系结构的人。无论她的斗争采取什么形式，她都本能地知道她的信仰是正确的，是真实的，而且她将遵循这些信仰，直到痛苦的结束。"
