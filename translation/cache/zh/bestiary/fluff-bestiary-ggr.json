	"The rank-and-file members of the Gruul Clans, called anarchs, despise civilization and have sworn to tear down both its physical structures and its institutions. Anarchs scavenge everything, from the hide armor they wear to the weapons they wield. As they pick through the refuse of the rubblebelts, they sometimes come across magic items and other valuable treasures.": "格鲁尔部族的普通成员被称为无政府主义者，他们鄙视文明，并发誓要拆毁其物质结构和制度。无政府主义者搜刮一切，从他们穿的皮甲到他们挥舞的武器。当他们在瓦砾带的垃圾中捡拾时，有时会遇到魔法物品和其他有价值的宝物。",
	"Archons are enigmatic, supernatural embodiments of the harshest aspects of law and order. They espouse a rigid sense of justice and deal ruthless punishment to those who break the law. This nature often aligns them with the Azorius Senate, and they are commonly seen circling above the Azorius guildhall astride their winged felidar mounts, soaring alongside griffon-mounted hussars.": "大主教是神秘的、超自然的法律和秩序的最严酷方面的化身。他们崇尚严格的正义感，对违法者进行无情的惩罚。这种性质常常使他们与阿索里乌斯元老院保持一致，人们经常看到他们骑着长着翅膀的Felidar坐骑在阿索里乌斯市政厅的上空盘旋，与骑着狮鹫的轻骑兵一起翱翔。",
	"An archon appears as an armored humanoid figure, nearly always mounted. Its face is usually shadowed beneath a large hood; those who have seen beneath the hood describe a face of celestial beauty with a stern expression and blank white eyes.": "弓箭手出现时是一个身穿铠甲的人形，几乎总是骑着马。它的脸通常被罩在一个大罩子下面；那些见过罩子下面的人描述了一张天人合一的脸，表情严厉，眼神空洞。",
	"The bond between an archon and its winged felidar mount is so close that the two are sometimes considered a single being, acting with a single mind. If an archon is ever thrown from its saddle, it can magically return to its place astride its mount in an instant.": "弓箭手和其带翅膀的飞利达坐骑之间的联系是如此紧密，以至于两者有时被认为是一个单一的生命，以一个单一的思想行事。如果大弓箭手被从马鞍上摔下来，它可以在瞬间神奇地回到它的坐骑上的位置。",
	"An archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "弓箭手不需要吃、喝、睡。",
	"An arclight phoenix is variously said to be a byproduct of a lightning strike on an aviary, a mishap in an effort to create a translocation device, or a successful attempt to create an elemental creature in the form of a majestic bird.": "凤凰有多种说法，有的说是鸟舍遭雷击的副产品，有的说是在努力创造移位装置时发生的意外，有的说是以雄伟的鸟的形式创造元素生物的成功尝试。",
	"Whatever its origin, an arclight phoenix looks like a bird of prey formed entirely of electrical energy. Lightning fans out behind it as it bolts from place to place through the sky, making up in speed what it lacks in grace and majesty. It seems happiest during natural thunderstorms, as it darts among the clouds, gliding alongside thunderbolts.": "不管它的起源是什么，光环凤凰看起来就像一只完全由电能形成的猛禽。当它在天空中从一个地方飞到另一个地方时，闪电在它身后展开，在速度上弥补了它在优雅和威严方面的不足。在自然界的雷暴中，它似乎是最快乐的，因为它在云层中飞奔，与雷电一起滑行。",
	"An arclight phoenix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "箭牌凤凰不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

	"True justice, Aurelia argues, isn't merely the enforcement of the letter of existing laws (let the Azorius fret over that), but the establishment of equitable and compassionate relationships among all of Ravnica's people. That means protecting the weak from the depredations of the strong, sheltering the innocents who are threatened by war, and ensuring that enforcement of the law doesn't become oppressive. Aurelia actively supports efforts to establish a lasting peace among the guilds in the absence of the Guildpact.": "奥蕾莉亚认为，真正的正义并不仅仅是执行现有法律的条文（让阿佐里乌斯为之烦恼吧），而是在拉夫尼卡的所有人民中建立起公平和富有同情心的关系。这意味着保护弱者免受强者的掠夺，庇护受到战争威胁的无辜者，并确保法律的执行不会变成压迫。奥瑞利亚积极支持在没有公会契约的情况下，在各公会之间建立持久的和平的努力。",
	"Aurelia prefers to lead the Boros Legion from the front. She brings swift and unrelenting punishment to the wicked, and her temper is legendary.": "奥瑞莉娅更喜欢从正面领导波罗斯军团。她给邪恶的人带来了迅速而无情的惩罚，她的脾气是传奇性的。",
	"Aurelia doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "奥瑞利亚不需要食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Battleforce angels are the radiant hosts that soar into combat, bathed in the light of Boros zeal. They lead companies of mortal soldiers from above or fly ahead of roc-mounted skyknights. They don't shy away from the blood, pain, and confusion of combat; rather, they immerse themselves in the shifting tides of battle. Only by wading into the battle can they fulfill their responsibility to carry out the commands of the warleaders by adapting their tactics to the shifting situation on the ground.": "战斗部队的天使是光芒四射的主人，他们在战斗中沐浴着波罗斯的热情之光。他们从高处带领凡人士兵，或飞在骑着大鹏的天空骑士的前面。他们不回避血腥、痛苦和混乱的战斗；相反，他们沉浸在不断变化的战火中。只有涉足战斗，他们才能履行自己的职责，根据地面上不断变化的局势调整战术，执行战争领袖的命令。",
	"Angels of the Boros Legion view themselves as the embodiments of what their creator intended. They are fierce warriors devoted to justice and dedicated to protecting the weak against evil and oppression. They are commanders, advisors, strategists, and soldiers. Their presence in battle inspires the mortal soldiers of the legion with righteous zeal.": "波罗军团的天使将自己视为创造者意图的化身。他们是致力于正义的凶猛战士，致力于保护弱者免受邪恶和压迫。他们是指挥官、顾问、战略家和士兵。他们在战斗中的存在激发了军团的凡人士兵的正义热情。",
	"Most Boros soldiers assume that angels are paragons of goodness, wisdom, and mercy. The reality is that angels aren't immune to the temptations of corruption, and the necessities of political machination can compromise the best of them.": "大多数博罗士兵认为天使是善良、智慧和仁慈的典范。现实情况是，天使对腐败的诱惑没有免疫力，而政治阴谋的需要可以使他们中最好的人妥协。",
	"The wisest, most visionary angels are responsible for forming and implementing the military strategy of the Boros Legion. Since they are immortal, their plans might span centuries, and they have been known to accept decades of losses as a reasonable cost for a more significant victory many years later. These warleaders have the statistics of planetars or solars (as presented in the Monster Manual), but their appearance is similar to other Boros angels.": "最有智慧、最有远见的天使负责形成和实施波罗斯军团的军事战略。由于他们是不朽的，他们的计划可能会跨越几个世纪，而且他们已经知道接受几十年的损失作为多年后更重大胜利的合理代价。这些战争领袖拥有行星人或索拉人的统计资料（如《怪物手册》所介绍的），但他们的外表与其他波罗斯天使相似。",
	"Nearly all the innovation and advancement in Simic bioengineering comes from the work of biomancers. Specialists in hybridizing and altering creatures through a mixture of science and magic, they have spawned countless hybrids and krasis in search of the perfect union between nature and civilization.": "西米克生物工程的几乎所有创新和进步都来自生物学家的工作。他们是通过科学和魔法的结合来杂交和改变生物的专家，他们已经产生了无数的混血儿和克拉西，以寻求自然和文明的完美结合。",
	"A blistercoil weird is an anthropomorphic brute formed from water and molten rock. It absorbs energy from magical fire, causing its oozelike body to increase in size. During one disastrous experiment, Izzet researchers observed a blistercoil weird expanding to fill a six-story workshop before it released all its excess energy in an enormous explosion and returned to its original size.": "水泡怪是一种由水和熔岩形成的拟人化的野蛮人。它从魔法之火中吸收能量，使其渗水的身体变得越来越大。在一次灾难性的实验中，伊泽特的研究人员观察到一个水泡怪人扩大到填满了一个六层楼的车间，然后它在一次巨大的爆炸中释放了所有多余的能量，恢复到原来的大小。",
	"Weirds are the products of Izzet League experiments intended to combine two opposing elemental types in the hope of creating elementals that were more stable than the norm and easier to control. As commonly happens with Izzet experiments, the outcome was the exact opposite. Weirds are even wilder and more unpredictable than elementals of either of their component elements. Nevertheless, they can make potent guardian creatures and can be urged into fighting on behalf of their creators.": "Weirds是Izzet联盟实验的产物，目的是将两种对立的元素类型结合起来，希望能创造出比普通元素更稳定、更容易控制的元素。正如Izzet实验通常发生的那样，结果恰恰相反。鸟类比其组成元素中的任何一种元素更狂野、更不可预测。然而，它们可以成为强有力的守护生物，并可以被敦促代表它们的创造者进行战斗。",

	"Plenty of blood drinkers haunt Ravnica's alleys and sewers, preying on those who are foolish enough to leave the relative safety of the crowds.": "大量的饮血者在拉夫尼卡的小巷和下水道中出没，捕食那些愚蠢到离开相对安全的人群的人。",
	"Vampires thrive in the Orzhov Syndicate, where they can collect tithes and payments from their debtors in the form of blood. Their undead nature gives them the same immortality enjoyed by the oligarch spirits, but they remain capable of experiencing all the delights of their corporeal forms. In contrast to Orzhov spirits, they also retain their personalities, which are almost uniformly cruel.": "吸血鬼在奥尔佐夫集团中蓬勃发展，他们可以以血液的形式向债务人收取什一税和付款。他们不死的本性使他们享有和寡头精神一样的不朽性，但他们仍然能够体验到肉体形式的所有乐趣。与奥尔佐夫鬼魂相比，他们还保留了自己的个性，这些个性几乎都是残忍的。",
	"Consuming a creature's blood creates a sort of empathic bond that allows the blood drinker vampire to exert some magical influence over its victim.": "饮用一个生物的血会产生一种移情作用，使饮血的吸血鬼能够对其受害者施加一些神奇的影响。",
	"Creatures of the night, vampires are ageless undead beings who subsist on the blood of the living. They are fierce predators who mask their ravenous thirst behind a facade of sophistication and sensuality. Those who sip blood from golden chalices are no less voracious than those who tear out their victims' throats with their fangs; they just hide it better.": "吸血鬼是黑夜中的生物，是以活人的血液为生的不死生物。他们是凶猛的掠夺者，在复杂和感性的外表下掩盖他们贪婪的渴望。那些从金杯中吸血的人与那些用獠牙撕开受害者喉咙的人一样贪婪；他们只是隐藏得更好。",
	"The vampires of Ravnica differ from those in the Monster Manual in important ways. They lack the traits and abilities that those other vampires boast, but also lack the weaknesses that hinder such vampires. What they have in common is an unquenchable thirst for the blood that sustains their undead existence.": "拉夫尼卡的吸血鬼与《怪物手册》中的吸血鬼有很大不同。他们缺乏其他吸血鬼所拥有的特征和能力，但也缺乏阻碍这些吸血鬼的弱点。他们的共同点是对维持其不死之身的血液有着无止境的渴求。",
	"Blood witches imagine themselves to be the intermediaries between Rakdos and his cult-the pinnacle of his priesthood, his trusted advisors, and the messengers who communicate his will to the scattered troupes and ringmasters. The Cult of Rakdos recognizes no authority but Rakdos, and the demon lord requires no advisors. Nonetheless, the blood witches are smart, charismatic, and powerful, so their voices do carry some weight.": "血巫师把自己想象成拉克多和他的崇拜者之间的中间人--他的神职的顶峰，他信任的顾问，以及把他的意志传达给分散的剧团和擂主的信差。拉克多教派不承认除拉克多以外的任何权威，恶魔领主也不需要任何顾问。不过，血巫师们很聪明，有魅力，而且很强大，所以他们的声音确实有一定分量。",
	"Blood witches strive both to protect the cult from external interference and to punish those who bring harm to the guild. They claim grandiose titles, such as Tormentor of the Wojek, as a way of mocking their intended victims.": "血巫师既要努力保护邪教免受外部干扰，又要惩罚那些给公会带来伤害的人。他们宣称自己拥有宏大的头衔，例如 \"沃杰克的折磨者\"，以此来嘲弄他们预定的受害者。",
	"Giants in the Cult of Rakdos act as enforcers, bouncers, and sometimes even pillars, holding the mobile platforms that serve as stages for Rakdos performances. Like other members of the cult, giants thrill to the violence of those shows. Though they can seem entranced by the horror unfolding on the stage, they react quickly and brutally to any interruption of the performance.": "拉克多教派的巨人充当执法者、保镖，有时甚至是支柱，支撑着作为拉克多表演舞台的移动平台。和邪教的其他成员一样，巨人也对这些表演的暴力感到兴奋。尽管他们似乎被舞台上展开的恐怖活动所吸引，但他们对任何表演的中断都会做出迅速而残忍的反应。",
	"Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.": "巨人利用他们巨大的体型和力量来推动不少于四个公会的事业。在波罗斯军团和奥尔佐夫集团，他们是狡猾的士兵。拉克多斯教派和格鲁尔部族的巨人也同样有效，但缺乏纪律性。",
	"For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.": "几十年来，巨大的独眼巨人Borborygmos打败了所有挑战他的人，赢得了格鲁尔族人的尊重和服从。他体现了格鲁尔人认为在他们肚子里燃烧的熊熊烈火，他对拉夫尼卡文明的愤怒是无止境的。",
	"Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.": "Borborygmos领导燃烧之树部族，该部族是格鲁尔部族中最大和最多样化的。他几乎总是由他的部族的其他成员陪同--不是因为他需要他们的保护，而是因为他们可能需要他的保护。他的同伴包括从魁梧的巨人到畏缩的地精等各种生物。",
	"The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.": "格鲁尔人崇尚力量，博博里格莫斯之所以能保持自己的地位，只是因为他已经证明比任何挑战者都强。",
	"Cacklers are small, jabbering jesters that spice up Rakdos performances with their chaotic antics. Their incessant cackling can inspire uncontrollable laughter by making everything—even the most horrifying spectacles—seem hilarious. Some cacklers excel at vocal mimicry and perform as impressionists; others put their sadistic bent to use by lurking in shadows and terrifying passersby. Rakdos performers enjoy dressing cacklers in a variety of masks, hats, and costumes to lampoon public figures.": "呱呱叫者是小型的、叽叽喳喳的小丑，他们用混乱的滑稽动作为拉克多斯的表演增色。他们不间断的笑声可以激发出无法控制的笑声，使一切--即使是最可怕的景象--都显得滑稽可笑。一些咯咯笑的人擅长声乐模仿，并作为印象派演员表演；其他人则通过潜伏在阴影中恐吓路人来发挥他们的虐待狂倾向。Rakdos表演者喜欢给笑匠戴上各种面具、帽子和服装，以嘲弄公众人物。",
	"Just as angels are incarnations of the ideals of justice, demons embody depraved impulses: selfishness, cruelty, hatred, greed, and lust for power. Demons are strongly associated with the Cult of Rakdos; in fact, the demons of Ravnica might have been created by Rakdos in the same way that angels were created by the Boros Legion's founder. As a demon lord who has chosen to live in Ravnica, Rakdos claims authority over all the demons of this world-even if some of them, ambitious and headstrong as demons are, rebel against his authority.": "正如天使是正义理想的化身，恶魔体现了堕落的冲动：自私、残忍、仇恨、贪婪和对权力的渴望。恶魔与拉克多斯教派有着密切的联系；事实上，拉夫尼卡的恶魔可能是由拉克多斯创造的，就像天使是由波洛军团的创始人创造一样。作为一个选择生活在拉夫尼卡的恶魔领主，拉克多斯宣称对这个世界上所有的恶魔都有权威--即使其中有些恶魔野心勃勃，刚愎自用，反叛他的权威。",
	"Demons are agents of destruction that work their acts of terror in plain sight under the auspices of the Cult of Rakdos. They exhibit their cruelty in dramatic performances that leave the audience members blood-soaked but ecstatic. They incite mob riots that raze entire city blocks. The only thing demons fear is Rakdos himself, who doesn't tolerate rivals and hates to be upstaged.": "恶魔是毁灭的代理人，在拉克多斯教的支持下，在众目睽睽之下实施恐怖行为。他们在戏剧性的表演中展示他们的残忍，让观众们血流成河却欣喜若狂。他们煽动暴民骚乱，将整个城市街区夷为平地。恶魔们唯一害怕的是拉克多斯本人，他不容忍对手，也不喜欢被人抢了风头。",
	"The creatures called \"devils\" in Ravnica are minor demons akin to {@creature quasit||quasits}. While the larger demons embody evil qualities such as blood lust and torment, these lesser demons reflect the whimsical and chaotic side of Rakdos and his cult. Their mischievous antics cause disorder and destruction out of proportion to the demons' small size.": "拉夫尼卡中被称为 \"魔鬼 \"的生物是类似于（%0%）的小恶魔。虽然较大的恶魔体现了邪恶的品质，如血腥的欲望和折磨，但这些较小的恶魔反映了拉克多斯和他的邪教的异想天开和混乱的一面。他们的恶作剧造成了混乱和破坏，与恶魔的小体积不成比例。",
	"Many of the demons of Ravnica are monstrous, winged creatures of human-like form. They are best represented by the statistics of the {@creature nalfeshnee}, the {@creature shadow demon}, or the {@creature vrock} in the Monster Manual. Demons associated with the Cult of Rakdos often have fiery attacks that make them similar to barbed devils or horned devils, except that they are demons. (They are chaotic evil, they speak Abyssal and not Infernal, and they lack Devil's Sight.)": "拉夫尼卡的许多恶魔都是畸形的、有翅膀的、类似人类的生物。它们最好的代表是《怪物手册》中的（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）的统计数据。与拉克多斯教派有关的恶魔通常具有火热的攻击力，这使它们与带刺的恶魔或带角的恶魔相似，只不过它们是恶魔。(他们是混乱的邪恶，他们说深渊语而不是地狱语，而且他们缺乏恶魔之眼）。",
	"In the deep sinkholes that serve as laboratories and guildhalls for the Simic Combine, biomancers employ a combination of magic and scientific method to create novel life forms. They coax new morphologies from existing creatures or combine traits from multiple organisms into one, producing the creatures known as krasis. Some krasis are unique creatures that can't reproduce. A few multiply and become part of the guild's standard menagerie.": "在作为西米克联合体的实验室和行宫的深邃天坑中，生物学家运用魔法和科学方法的结合来创造新的生命形式。他们从现有的生物中哄骗新的形态，或者将多种生物的特征结合到一起，产生被称为krasis的生物。有些krasis是独特的生物，不能繁殖。少数会繁殖，并成为公会的标准动物群的一部分。",
	"To create a krasis, choose the appropriate stat block: category 1 (Medium), category 2 (Large), or category 3 (Huge).

True to the spirit of the Orzhov, though, the angel doesn't bestow these gifts out of kindness, but for the sake of gaining fanatical followers who owe it life debts.": "死亡影响天使冒充仁慈的神灵，吸引着那些乞求天使赐福的人：财富、声望、健康、复仇，等等。天使想象自己是慷慨和仁慈的，通常试图通过使用它的能力，从它的财富囤积中提取，或者从公会的其他成员那里勒索好处，来给予请愿者他们所寻求的东西。不过，忠实于奥尔佐夫的精神，天使并不是出于仁慈而赐予这些礼物，而是为了获得狂热的追随者，因为他们欠了它的命。",
	"Those who receive favors from a deathpact angel incur a debt that they carry with fervent devotion. They regularly bring trinkets and offerings to the angel, no longer asking or expecting anything in return, and even willingly offer up their mortal lives for their angelic patron. Even after death, these debtors continue to serve the angel and the Orzhov Syndicate as indentured spirits (described later in this chapter).": "那些从死亡影响天使那里得到恩惠的人产生了一种债务，他们带着狂热的虔诚。他们定期给天使带去饰品和供品，不再要求或期待任何回报，甚至愿意为他们的天使守护者献出自己的凡人生命。即使在死后，这些债务人也会继续作为契约精神为天使和奥尔佐夫集团服务（在本章后面描述）。",
	"Debts Paid": "已支付的债务",
	"Few angels find anything appealing in the corruption and decadence embodied by the Orzhov Syndicate, since such a society is fundamentally antithetical to their natures, but disillusionment can seduce even immortal beings. When cynicism takes root in an angel's heart, when questions undermine devotion to the cause of justice, when strength becomes a tool to lord over the weak, the Orzhov Syndicate is there to welcome the angel with open arms, offering status, respect, and power.": "很少有天使会发现奥尔佐夫集团所体现的腐败和堕落有什么吸引人的地方，因为这样的社会从根本上说是与他们的本性背道而驰的，但幻灭甚至可以引诱不朽的生命。当愤世嫉俗在天使的心中扎根，当问题破坏了对正义事业的奉献，当力量成为凌驾于弱者之上的工具，奥尔佐夫集团就会张开双臂欢迎天使，提供地位、尊重和权力。",
	"Orzhov angels might claim positions as executioners, commanders, or power brokers, but more often they carve out their own place in the guild, standing apart from the otherwise rigid hierarchy of the Orzhov.": "奥热夫天使可能会声称自己是刽子手、指挥官或权力经纪人，但更多时候他们会在公会中开辟自己的位置，从奥热夫其他僵化的等级制度中分离出来。",
	"Powerful spellcasters of the Devkarin elves, steeped in Golgari magic, can transcend death to become liches. For them, life and death don't merely chase each other in an inevitable cycle; the two can intersect, and at that nexus the liches find immense power, which commands the awe, envy, and fear of other Golgari.": "Devkarin精灵中强大的施法者，深受Golgari魔法的熏陶，可以超越死亡，成为地衣。对他们来说，生命和死亡不仅仅是在一个不可避免的循环中相互追逐；两者可以相交，在这个交汇点上，地衣人发现了巨大的力量，这让其他戈尔加里人感到敬畏、羡慕和恐惧。",
	"Unlike the shambling zombies they command, liches retain their memories, their personalities, and especially their ambition. They also retain the grace and stature of living elves, but their bodies are in a constant state of slow decay. Various forms of fungus grow in and over the rotting flesh to hold the body together.": "与他们指挥的摇摇欲坠的僵尸不同，地衣保留了他们的记忆，他们的个性，尤其是他们的野心。他们还保留着活的精灵的优雅和身材，但他们的身体却一直处于缓慢腐烂的状态。各种形式的真菌在腐烂的肉体里和上面生长，将身体固定在一起。",
	"The lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "巫师不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

	"The druids of the Old Ways believe that civilization will never be eradicated by scattered raids and petty skirmishes. They cling to the idea of a coming apocalypse, the End-Raze, when Ilharg's hoofs will trample every brick and stone of Ravnica's soaring skylines to rubble. The world will return to a state of nature in which the lawless code of muscle and savagery will reign once again.": "旧道的德鲁伊们相信，文明永远不会被零星的突袭和小规模的冲突所根除。他们坚信即将到来的天启，即 \"终结者\"（End-Raze），届时伊尔哈格的铁蹄会将拉夫尼卡高耸的天际线上的每一块砖石都踩成废墟。世界将恢复到自然状态，其中无法无天的肌肉和野蛮的代码将再次统治。",
	"A felidar is a celestial creature whose nature reflects an inherent devotion to law and order. It resembles an enormous cat with two pairs of downward-sloping horns and prominent teeth. Its blue-gray hide has a silvery, geometric pattern, and its thick white mane falls in an orderly fashion around its shoulders.": "菲利达是一种天体生物，其本质反映了对法律和秩序的内在奉献。它类似于一只巨大的猫，有两对向下倾斜的角和突出的牙齿。它的蓝灰色皮肤上有银色的几何图案，浓密的白色鬃毛有序地落在肩头。",
	"Nearly every felidar forms a close bond with one other creature. Winged felidars almost always bond with archons, joining in their relentless pursuit of justice. Other felidars ally with members of the Azorius Senate and form bonds with high-ranking justiciars and ministers, aiding them in enforcing the law and tracking down criminals. Some Azorius felidars form bonds with important prisoners in Azorius custody, ensuring that the felidars can track down the felons if they escape custody.": "几乎每一个猫人都会与另一种生物形成密切的联系。有翅膀的猫人几乎总是与大主教结合，加入他们对正义的无情追求。其他猫人与阿索里乌斯元老院的成员结盟，并与高级司法官和部长们建立联系，协助他们执行法律和追踪罪犯。一些Azorius猫人与Azorius羁押的重要囚犯建立了联系，确保猫人能够在重罪犯逃脱羁押时追踪到他们。",
	"Boros firefists combine potent magic with peerless fighting ability, inspiring all who serve alongside them. They often act as the point of contact between the Boros Legion and the angelic leaders.": "Boros火枪手将强大的魔法与无以伦比的战斗力结合起来，激励着所有与他们一起服务的人。他们经常充当波罗斯军团和天使领袖之间的联系点。",
	"Firemane angels are holy champions and paragons of war who specialize in single combat. They are powerful warriors who seek out the mightiest foes in any conflict, trusting lesser soldiers to handle lesser opponents.": "火人天使是圣洁的冠军和战争的典范，专门从事单兵作战。他们是强大的战士，在任何冲突中都会寻找最强大的敌人，信任较少的士兵来处理较少的对手。",
	"Like many other Boros angels, firemanes typically have red hair. In the heat of battle, a firemane's hair can ignite, transforming into a mane of flames cascading over its shoulders and down its back.": "像许多其他博罗天使一样，火人通常有红色的头发。在激烈的战斗中，火人的头发可以被点燃，变成一束火焰的鬃毛，层层叠叠地覆盖在它的肩头和背部。",
	"In an effort to create a weird that could be more easily controlled, Izzet mages tried binding elemental lightning, fire, and smoke into a framework made of the magical alloy mizzium. The experiment was partly successful: the resulting weird, a fluxcharger, doesn't explode like some other weirds do, but it is more intelligent and more headstrong than other weirds.": "为了创造一种更容易控制的怪兽，伊泽特法师尝试将雷电、火焰和烟雾元素结合到由神奇的合金米兹姆制成的框架中。实验取得了部分成功：由此产生的怪兽，即fluxcharger，不会像其他一些怪兽那样爆炸，但它比其他怪兽更聪明、更任性。",
	"A fluxcharger's mizzium frame is suggestive of an angel. A faceplate is meant to give it some personality, but most people find its solemn expression and unblinking stare more unnerving than relatable.": "Fluxcharger的mizzium框架让人联想到一个天使。脸谱是为了赋予它一些个性，但大多数人发现它庄严的表情和不眨眼的目光更令人不安，而不是可亲。",
	"Horrors on Ravnica are terror and madness personified. You can represent this reality by using the madness rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide.": "拉夫尼卡的恐怖是恐怖和疯狂的化身。你可以通过使用《地下城主指南》中的疯狂规则来表现这一现实。",
	"Whenever a character fails a saving throw against the flying horror's Frightening Screech, the shadow horror's claw attack, or the skittering horror's Maddening Presence, note that fact. At the end of the encounter, have each character who failed at least one of those saving throws make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, nothing happens. On a failed save, a character gains a form of madness from the Dungeon Master's Guide, with the severity depending on how many of the saving throws that character failed during the encounter, as shown on the Madness Severity table.": "每当一个角色对飞行恐怖的惊恐尖叫、影子恐怖的爪子攻击、或者抖动恐怖的疯狂存在的蓄力失败时，请注意这个事实。在遭遇战结束时，让每个至少有一次救赎失败的角色做一个DC13智慧救赎。拯救成功时，什么都不会发生。如果救赎失败，角色就会获得《地下城主指南》中的一种疯狂形式，其严重程度取决于该角色在遭遇战中有多少次救赎失败，如疯狂严重程度表所示。",

All are evil creatures with dim reason and preternatural cunning.": "恐怖的恶魔在拉夫尼卡的黑暗角落里潜行、飞翔和游荡，从城市地下的深处到夜空中最黑的地方。这些生物被统称为恐怖--各种潜伏在黑暗中的东西，体现了拉夫尼卡人最深的恐惧。所有这些都是邪恶的生物，它们有着模糊的理性和超自然的狡猾。",
	"At least three guilds have been known to compel horrors into service. For House Dimir, horrors spread fear and despair in the citizenry and carry out assassinations or kidnappings against well-protected targets. For the Cult of Rakdos, horrors are simply one more weapon in an arsenal of terrifying and shock-inspiring creatures that might appear on stage. For the Golgari Swarm, horrors scavenge the sewers and protect the guild's territory.": "据了解，至少有三个行会蛊惑恐怖组织为其服务。对于迪米尔家族来说，恐怖在市民中散布恐惧和绝望，并对受到良好保护的目标进行暗杀或绑架。对于Rakdos教派来说，恐怖只是可能出现在舞台上的恐怖和令人震惊的生物武库中的又一种武器。对于Golgari Swarm来说，恐怖在下水道中搜寻并保护公会的领土。",

	"Horrors share some common body types but vary wildly in other characteristics. A particular horror's form might incorporate elements that resemble fiendish, insectile, or reptilian features.

	"Grasping Tendrils. The horror has four tendrils. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 12, 10 hit points). Destroying one deals no damage to the horror. As a bonus action, the horror can target one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition grappled} by the horror.

	"Galvanice weirds seem to be the epitome of weird technology. Indeed, they serve willingly, with cheerful stupidity, as guardians and laborers in Izzet workshops.

They are fearsome agents of House Dimir, protecting the territory and interests of that guild-particularly the neighborhood of Nightveil, from which the specters get their name. Their work can include driving off people who accidentally wander too close to a secret rooftop meeting, killing those who knowingly infiltrate Dimir property, and tracking those who have stolen guild secrets, then wiping those secrets from their victims' minds to ensure that they are never shared.": "拉夫尼卡的夜幕幽灵是带着头罩的不死守护者，他们骑着被称为 \"灰翼 \"的飞行生物。他们是迪米尔家族可怕的代理人，保护该公会的领土和利益--特别是夜幕附近，幽灵们的名字就来自于此。他们的工作包括驱赶那些不小心走近屋顶秘密会议的人，杀死那些故意潜入迪米尔财产的人，以及追踪那些窃取公会秘密的人，然后将这些秘密从受害者的头脑中抹去，以确保它们永远不会被分享。",
	"A Nightveil specter is created when the mind magic of House Dimir erases a person's identity, leaving a mind so broken it can no longer live. Thus, Nightveil specters have no memory of their previous lives, and they are just clever enough to follow their orders with some amount of creativity. They pursue their assigned tasks with fearless determination.": "当迪米尔家族的心灵魔法抹去一个人的身份，留下一个破碎的心灵，使其无法再活下去时，就会产生夜魔幽灵。因此，夜幕幽灵对他们以前的生活没有任何记忆，他们只是足够聪明，带着一定的创造力听从他们的命令。他们以无畏的决心追求他们被指派的任务。",
	"If a gloamwing is killed, its specter becomes fixated on destroying those responsible. If the specter survives, it can create a new gloamwing over the course of a month, during which time the specter is {@condition incapacitated}.": "如果一只食蚁兽被杀，它的幽灵会专注于消灭那些责任人。如果幽灵存活下来，它可以在一个月内创造一个新的食蚁兽，在此期间，幽灵是（%0%）。",
	"A Nightveil specter and its gloamwing mount don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "一个夜幕幽灵和它的gloamwing坐骑不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Possessed of arrogance and vanity that matches his vast intellect and tremendous power, Niv-Mizzet is the ancient dragon who founded and continues to control the Izzet League. From his private laboratory at the top of the Izzet guildhall, Niv-Mizzet directs the research and experiments of his countless underlings. He coordinates a tremendous number of apparently unrelated projects, working toward some mysterious end.": "尼夫-米泽特拥有与他巨大的智力和巨大的力量相匹配的傲慢和虚荣心，他是建立并继续控制伊泽特联盟的古龙。尼夫-米泽特在他位于伊泽特市政厅顶部的私人实验室里，指导他无数下属的研究和实验。他协调着大量明显不相关的项目，为一些神秘的目的而努力。",
	"There can be little doubt that this ancient dragon is one of the most intelligent beings on Ravnica and one of the world's most powerful spellcasters. He is just as acquisitive as any dragon, but his treasure is scientific and magical knowledge. His ambition is a looming threat in the minds of all the other guildmasters, but confronting him directly is almost unthinkable thanks to the combination of his awesome magical power and the sheer physical threat of a fire-breathing, swordtoothed dragon.": "毫无疑问，这条古龙是拉夫尼卡上最聪明的生物之一，也是世界上最强大的施法者之一。他和其他的龙一样好胜，但他的财富是科学和魔法知识。他的野心在所有其他公会会长的心目中是一个迫在眉睫的威胁，但由于他可怕的魔法力量和喷火的剑齿龙的纯粹物理威胁的结合，直接面对他几乎是不可想象的。",
	"Cyclopes like those described in the Monster Manual are found primarily among the Gruul Clans. They are forces of nature, and even though they have occasionally been recruited into the Boros Legion, they can never truly be tamed.": "像《怪物手册》中描述的独眼巨人主要存在于格鲁尔部族中。它们是自然界的力量，即使它们偶尔被招募到波罗斯军团，但它们永远无法被真正驯服。",
	"Cyclopes serve the Izzet league as workshop guardians, personal protectors, and heavy laborers. They wear mizzium armor plating to minimize injuries from laboratory mishaps, piston gauntlets to increase their strength for lifting and punching, and telescopic helmets to minimize the shortcomings of their monocular vision. They are sometimes called monoclons or Nivix cyclopes, after the name of the Izzet guildhall.": "独眼巨人作为车间守护者、个人保护者和重体力劳动者为Izzet联盟服务。他们穿戴米兹姆装甲以减少实验室事故造成的伤害，穿戴活塞铠甲以增加他们举重和击打的力量，戴着望远镜头盔以减少他们单眼视觉的缺陷。他们有时被称为单眼巨人或尼维克斯独眼巨人，这是以伊泽特公会的名字命名的。",
	"The ghosts who make up the Obzedat are traditionally called patriarchs, though they can be male or female. They are the oldest, wealthiest, and most influential oligarchs of the Orzhov Syndicate. They have been dead for centuries, but they refuse to let go of the fortunes they amassed in life. Addicted to power and prestige, these patriarchs continue to dominate the guild and accumulate even larger fortunes.": "组成奥布扎特的鬼魂传统上被称为族长，尽管他们可以是男性或女性。他们是奥尔佐夫集团中最古老、最富有、最有影响力的寡头。他们已经死了几个世纪，但他们拒绝放下他们生前积累的财富。沉迷于权力和声望，这些元老们继续主宰着行会，积累着更大的财富。",

In times of disagreement, the eldest of the council exerts his seniority to bend the council to his will.": "奥布扎特的鬼魂们作为一个整体运作，受他们为公会积累更多财富的共同愿望所驱使。在出现分歧的时候，理事会中最年长的人发挥他的资历，使理事会屈从于他的意愿。",
	"The head of the council, who gives final approval to its decisions and breaks ties within the group, is Karlov, known as Grandfather. In life, Karlov was the greediest of Orzhov oligarchs, and his many centuries as a spirit have not diminished his hunger for more wealth.": "对理事会的决定给予最终批准并打破集团内部联系的负责人是卡尔洛夫，被称为祖父。在生活中，卡尔洛夫是奥尔佐夫寡头中最贪婪的人，他作为一个精神的许多个世纪并没有减少他对更多财富的渴望。",

	"Flaw: \"Everyone has a price.\"": "缺陷：\"每个人都有一个价格\"。",
	"A few giants join the ranks of the Orzhov Syndicate and serve as guards, executioners, and thugs-the muscle of the guild. The presence of Orzhov giants in markets and streets serves as an effective reminder for business owners to keep their payments up to date.": "一些巨人加入了Orzhov集团的行列，充当守卫、刽子手和打手--公会的肌肉。奥尔佐夫巨人在市场和街道上的存在，有效地提醒了企业主保持他们的付款时间。",

	"Rakdos, the demon for whom his cult is named, embodies hedonism. He is also the consummate entertainer, whose mere appearance is an act of grisly performance art. A monstrous figure standing thirty feet tall, spreading enormous wings, crowned with fire and swinging a flaming scythe, Rakdos demands the spotlight. His every entrance is a showstopper.": "拉克多（Rakdos）是他的崇拜者所命名的恶魔，体现了享乐主义。他也是一个完美的艺人，他的出现就是一种可怕的行为艺术。拉克多是一个身高30英尺的怪物，张开巨大的翅膀，头戴火冠，挥舞着燃烧的镰刀，他需要聚光灯。他的每一次出场都是一场表演。",
	"Sometimes after his grand entrance, Rakdos crouches to witness the performances of those who adore him. To them, his opinion is the only one that matters, but he is a demanding spectator. He has seen thousands of years of circus tricks and has no patience for performers who don't give their all. His flaming scythe has brought more than one tepid show to a sudden and spectacular close. Jaded as he is, Rakdos attends his cult's performances only rarely. He often retreats into his lair below the cult's guildhall for months or years at a time, but his followers know that he might emerge at any time to witness the latest spectacle.": "有时，在他隆重的出场之后，拉克多斯蹲下身子，目睹那些崇拜他的人的表演。对他们来说，他的意见是唯一重要的，但他是一个苛刻的观众。他看过几千年的马戏团戏法，对那些不全力以赴的表演者没有耐心。他的火焰镰刀不只一次让不温不火的表演突然间壮观地结束。厌倦了的拉克多斯很少参加他的教派的表演。他经常躲在邪教大厅下面的巢穴里，一待就是几个月或几年，但他的追随者知道，他可能随时出现，目睹最新的奇观。",
	"One of the most effective weapons in the Rakdos cult's arsenal is satire, and a Rakdos lampooner is a virtuoso of that art. Lampooners generally reserve their mockery for people and guilds that have seized an outsized measure of power, those who need to be taken down a peg, rather than piling further humiliation onto those who are already struggling. They use masks, marionettes, or effigies to caricature public figures, or sometimes play pranks on those individuals directly in the streets.": "讽刺是Rakdos邪教最有效的武器之一，而Rakdos讽刺者是这种艺术的大师。讽刺者通常把他们的嘲笑留给那些夺取了巨大权力的人和行会，那些需要被打倒的人，而不是把更多的羞辱堆在那些已经在挣扎的人身上。他们使用面具、提线木偶或雕像来讽刺公众人物，或者有时直接在街上对这些人进行恶作剧。",
	"By offering a place for those of many different talents, the Cult of Rakdos has seen its numbers swell with performing artists, including blade jugglers, fire eaters, and high wire acrobats. Performers carry the message of Rakdos out into the streets: cut loose, free yourself from the bonds of society's mores and expectations, and indulge your desires.": "通过为那些具有不同才能的人提供一个场所，Rakdos教派的表演者人数不断增加，其中包括刀片杂耍者、食火者和高空钢丝杂技者。表演者们将Rakdos的信息带到了街上：放纵自己，从社会习俗和期望的束缚中解放出来，放纵自己的欲望。",
	"Boros reckoners combine physical power and magical prowess, serving as the shock troops of the legion. They are adept at breaking up mobs and organized lines of defense. Sometimes described as living thunderstorms, reckoners charge their bodies with lightning that bursts forth in their spells and lashes out at enemies who harm them. Many reckoners are minotaurs.": "Boros计算者结合了身体的力量和魔法的能力，作为军团的冲击部队。他们善于瓦解暴民和有组织的防线。有时被描述为活雷锋，算盘手在他们的身体里注入闪电，在他们的法术中迸发出来，对伤害他们的敌人进行鞭挞。许多算盘手是牛头人。",
	"Rubblebelt stalkers are scouts and skirmishers for the Gruul Clans. They excel at moving over challenging terrain, whether they're picking their way through treacherous ruins or clambering across rooftops. They favor ambush tactics and avoid confrontations with stronger forces, relying on their superior mobility to make their escape.": "碎石带跟踪者是格鲁尔部族的侦察兵和小兵。他们擅长在具有挑战性的地形上移动，无论是在险恶的废墟中挑衅，还是在屋顶上攀爬。他们喜欢伏击战术，并避免与更强大的部队对抗，依靠他们优越的机动性来进行逃跑。",
	"The most wretched of thrulls are the servitors, small and slender, that serve as playthings for their Orzhov masters. They run trivial errands, transport small items, caper and dance, and keep their masters' expensive robes from trailing on the dirty street. They are utterly loyal, lacking any concept of thinking for themselves.": "最可恶的鸫鸟是仆人，他们身材瘦小，为他们的Orzhov主人充当玩物。他们做一些琐碎的差事，运送一些小东西，打打闹闹，跳跳舞，让他们主人昂贵的长袍不至于在肮脏的街道上留下痕迹。他们完全忠诚，没有任何独立思考的概念。",
	"When the Orzhov Syndicate rips a soul from its body to create a spirit, the cast-off remains go to the fleshmages, who use their necromantic magic to liquefy the corpse and transform it into something useful. These creations become thrulls, obedient slaves that serve in a variety of menial roles: laborers, messengers, beasts of burden, and even fashion accessories for the elite. Whatever tasks they perform, they wear faceplates forged from devalued coinage to conceal their ghastly features.": "当Orzhov集团把灵魂从身体中剥离出来以创造一个灵魂时，被抛弃的残骸会被送到肉体法师那里，他们用他们的死灵魔法把尸体液化，并把它变成有用的东西。这些被创造出来的东西会成为 \"王牌\"，这些听话的奴隶会担任各种琐碎的角色：劳工、信使、野兽，甚至是精英的时尚配件。无论他们执行什么任务，他们都戴着用贬值的硬币铸造的面罩，以掩盖他们可怕的特征。",
	"A thrull doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "鲛人不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Rakdos nightclubs, where visitors can indulge any dark desire and revel in sadistic spectacle, are the favored haunts of the demons known as sires of insanity. Lurking in an underground vault beneath a Rakdos operation, a sire of insanity feasts on the violence, torment, and depravity unfolding above. Occasionally, cultists bring would-be recruits to the demon's presence, and—true to its name—the sire of insanity breaks the new cultist's mind.": "Rakdos的夜总会，游客可以放纵任何黑暗的欲望，陶醉于虐待狂的场面，是被称为精神错乱之主的恶魔最喜欢的地方。潜伏在拉克多行动之下的地下金库中，精神错乱的主人在上面展开的暴力、折磨和堕落中大快朵颐。偶尔，邪教分子会把可能的新成员带到恶魔面前，而精神错乱之主也如其名，打破了新邪教分子的思想。",
	"A sire of insanity is a bloated demon resembling a bipedal lizard. It stands some thirty feet tall and weighs many thousands of pounds, so it tends to keep hidden away in its subterranean lair, working its evil from the shadows.": "疯人院是一个臃肿的恶魔，类似于一只双足蜥蜴。它高约30英尺，重达数千磅，所以它倾向于隐藏在地下巢穴中，从阴影中作恶。",
	"The aerial forces of the Boros Legion-skyknights who fly alongside the angels-take to the air mounted on Skyjek rocs. These avians are named for the skyknights who are also part of the Wojek League, called Skyjeks. From the backs of their rocs, these mounted soldiers carry out reconnaissance missions, bombard enemies on the ground, and engage flying foes.": "Boros军团的空中力量--与天使并肩飞行的天空骑士--骑着Skyjek大炮飞向空中。这些航空兵是以同属Wojek联盟的skyknights命名的，称为Skyjeks。这些骑兵从他们的大象背上执行侦察任务，轰炸地面上的敌人，并与飞行的敌人作战。",
	"The shape of a Skyjek roc's body makes it relatively easy to saddle and ride, and it is typically equipped with armor plating on its head and chest.": "Skyjek大鹏的身体形状使它相对容易上马和骑行，而且它的头部和胸部通常配备有装甲板。",
	"Skyjek rocs are headstrong and impulsive, but their bravery makes them ideal mounts for the Boros knights.": "Skyjek rocs任性而冲动，但他们的勇敢使他们成为Boros骑士的理想坐骑。",
	"Skyswimmers are enormous, predatory leviathans that feed on drakes, rocs, griffins, and anything else they encounter as they soar through the clouds above Ravnica.": "天游者是巨大的、掠夺性的利维坦，当它们在拉夫尼卡上空的云层中翱翔时，以德拉克、大鹏、狮鹫和其他任何遇到的东西为食。",
	"Soldiers are found in many of Ravnica's guilds. The soldier stat block represents a typical member of the rank and file, though weaponry and armor can vary.": "拉夫尼卡的许多公会中都有士兵。士兵的状态块代表了典型的等级和队伍的成员，尽管武器和盔甲可能有所不同。",

	"These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone giants that also live among the Gruul Clans. They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.": "这些巫师有时会领导山地巨人和石像巨人，他们也生活在格鲁尔部族中。偶尔也会有独眼巨人、埃廷斯、福莫里安和食人魔加入他们。和其他格鲁尔族人一样，他们憎恨侵占他们曾经生活过的荒野的城市发展--至少是因为他们很难适应这些小建筑。他们以破坏这些建筑为乐，在愤怒的时候，他们会穿过建筑物，把人踩在脚下，并尽可能地造成混乱。他们经常用建筑物的碎片武装自己，挥舞着柱子或其他建筑元素作为棍棒。",
	"Thought spies form the backbone of House Dimir's covert operations. They are trained in stealth and infiltration, tactics that they supplement with rigorously developed mental abilities. To ensure that no secrets slip through Dimir's fingers, they infiltrate rival guilds. In addition to traditional means of gathering intelligence, thought spies use their magic to spy on the thoughts of their targets.": "思想间谍是迪米尔家族秘密行动的骨干。他们接受过隐蔽和渗透的训练，并以严格发展的精神能力作为战术补充。为了确保没有秘密从迪米尔的指缝中溜走，他们潜入对手的公会。除了传统的情报收集手段外，思想间谍还利用他们的魔法来窥探目标的思想。",
	"The Selesnya guildmaster is an amalgamation of three dryads in body, will, and soul. Each dryad's body extends from a central trunk, so while they possess independent minds, they share a single name-Trostani and a single life force. Usually Trostani communicates the will of the Worldsoul with one voice, but she retains three distinct personalities that embody the three parts of the Selesnyan ideal: order, life, and harmony. In the midst of increasing tensions on Ravnica, the three personalities have recently been at odds over how best to navigate the conclave through such difficult times.": "塞勒斯尼亚公会的会长是三个干尸的身体、意志和灵魂的混合体。每个干尸的身体都是从一个中央主干延伸出来的，所以虽然他们拥有独立的思想，但他们共享一个名字--Trostani和一个生命力。通常情况下，Trostani用一个声音传达世界的意志，但她保留了三个不同的个性，体现了Selesnyan理想的三个部分：秩序、生命和和谐。在拉夫尼卡日益紧张的局势中，这三个人格最近在如何最好地引导协约国度过这样的困难时期上发生了分歧。",
	"Trostani spends most of her time in the towering tree of Vitu-Ghazi, the Selesnya guildhall. There she communes with Mat'Selesnya and with the dryads who lead individual Selesnya communities across Ravnica.": "Trostani大部分时间都呆在Vitu-Ghazi这棵高大的树上，这是塞勒斯尼亚人的市政厅。在那里，她与马特塞勒斯尼亚以及领导整个拉夫尼卡各个塞勒斯尼亚社区的干尸们交流。",
	"The medusas of Ravnica, often called gorgons, are a monstrous race of creatures that appear superficially similar to human women. In place of hair, a gorgon has a writhing mass of black, serpentine cables, and its hands are scaly claws.": "拉夫尼卡的梅杜莎，通常被称为戈尔贡，是一种畸形的生物种族，表面上看起来与人类女性相似。取而代之的是，戈尔贡有一大堆蠕动的黑色蛇形电缆，而它的手是有鳞的爪子。",
	"The gaze of a medusa's glowing eyes causes living tissue to petrify. The transformation is rapid, leaving the victim as a stone statue, usually frozen in a position of abject fear or agony-a fine trophy for the medusa's macabre collection. The medusa must exert its will to effect this transformation, so the gaze of a surprised or friendly Ravnican medusa is harmless.": "美杜莎发光的眼睛的注视会使活体组织僵化。这种转变是迅速的，使受害者成为一尊石像，通常被冻结在极度恐惧或痛苦的状态中--这也是美杜莎可怕的收藏品的最佳战利品。美杜莎必须施展自己的意志来实现这种转变，所以惊讶或友好的拉弗尼卡美杜莎的目光是无害的。",
	"This deadly gaze attack gives medusas a degree of power among the Golgari that is out of proportion with their small numbers. Medusas command a significant share of the guild's smaller cells around Ravnica, and at least one medusa is thought to be angling for control of the entire guild at the moment.": "这种致命的凝视攻击使美杜莎在戈尔加里人中拥有一定程度的权力，这与他们的小数量不成比例。梅杜莎人在拉夫尼卡周围的公会小单元中占有相当大的份额，而且至少有一个梅杜莎人被认为目前正在为控制整个公会而努力。",

	"Winged thrulls are at once the most intelligent of Orzhov thrulls (which isn't saying much), as well as the smallest, most unobtrusive, and most mobile. They act as messengers and spies for their Orzhov masters and tend to mimic the mannerisms and movements of the oligarchs they serve.": "有翼鸫鸟是奥尔忠夫鸫鸟中最聪明的（这并不说明什么），也是最小、最不显眼和最机动的。他们为他们的Orzhov主人充当信使和间谍，并倾向于模仿他们所服务的寡头的举止和动作。",
	"Wurms are huge creatures that resemble limbless, wingless dragons. They burrow through the earth and eat virtually anything they come across, and their movement accounts for much of the destruction in the rubblebelt regions of Ravnica. A wurm burrows through loose earth by using deep sonic vibrations to liquefy the earth in front of it and swim through the area. The soil resolidifies and closes behind it. Moving through rock is slower and more difficult, and the wurm leaves a tunnel in its wake. The Gruul Clans appreciate the devastation wurms can create, and the clans sometimes lure them into civilized areas where the destruction can be vast.": "沃尔姆是一种巨大的生物，类似于没有四肢、没有翅膀的龙。它们在土里钻来钻去，几乎吃掉任何它们遇到的东西，它们的运动造成了拉夫尼卡瓦砾带地区的大部分破坏。巫妖在松软的土地上钻来钻去，利用深层的声波振动使它面前的土地液化，并在该地区游动。土壤会重新凝固并在它身后闭合。在岩石中移动的速度更慢，难度更大，而且乌尔姆会在身后留下一条隧道。格鲁尔氏族很欣赏巫妖所能造成的破坏，氏族有时会将它们引诱到文明地区，那里的破坏力会很巨大。",
	"The regal and reticent Prime Speaker Zegana is the merfolk guildmaster of the Simic Combine. She upholds the traditional ways of the guild and its utopian philosophy, which espouses a vision of an ideal world in which nature and civilization coexist in perfect balance. Some people in the guild-members of the Adaptationist faction in particular-argue that her ways are outdated and the guild requires more practical leadership. In response, Zegana maintains that she serves as prime speaker only at the sufferance of the Speakers' Chamber, and if the other speakers wish to replace her, they are certainly within their rights to do so.": "庄重而沉默寡言的首席发言人泽加娜是西米克联合体的人鱼族公会会长。她坚持公会的传统方式和它的乌托邦哲学，支持一个自然和文明完美平衡共存的理想世界的愿景。公会中的一些人，特别是适应派的成员，认为她的方式已经过时，公会需要更实际的领导。作为回应，泽加纳坚持认为，她担任首席发言人只是受制于发言人会议，如果其他发言人希望取代她，他们当然有权利这样做。",

The {@condition stunned} creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours.": "催眠展示（%0%）。作为一个动作，克拉西斯在自己周围创造出令人着迷的颜色和形状。在它周围15英尺范围内的每个生物，如果能看到它，必须成功地进行智慧救赎（第一类DC为12，第二类DC为14，第三类DC为18），否则将在1分钟内受到（%1%）。2%）的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力，如果成功则结束对它的影响。对该效果蓄力成功的生物会在24小时内对所有克拉西斯的催眠术免疫。"
