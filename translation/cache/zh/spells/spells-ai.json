	"Do you need to squeeze a few more gold pieces out of a merchant as you try to sell that weird octopus statue you liberated from the chaos temple? Do you need to downplay the worth of some magical assets when the tax collector stops by? Distort value has you covered.": "当你试图出售你从混沌神庙解放出来的奇怪的章鱼雕像时，你是否需要从商人那里多榨取几个金币？当收税员停下来时，你需要淡化一些魔法资产的价值吗？歪曲价值可以满足你。",
	"You cast this spell on an object no more than 1 foot on a side, doubling the object's perceived value by adding illusory flourishes or polish to it, or reducing its perceived value by half with the help of illusory scratches, dents, and other unsightly features. Anyone examining the object can ascertain its true value with a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check against your spell save DC.": "你对一个边长不超过1英尺的物体施展这个法术，通过给它加上虚幻的装饰或抛光，使物体的感知价值翻倍，或者借助虚幻的划痕、凹痕和其他难看的特征，使其感知价值减半。任何检查该物品的人都可以通过对你的法术救赎DC进行成功的智力（（%0%））检查来确定其真实价值。",

	"When you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become {@condition charmed} by you for the duration. While the creature is {@condition charmed} in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.": "当你需要确保某些事情得到完成时，你不能依靠模糊的承诺、宣誓或有约束力的雇佣合同。当你施展这个法术时，在范围内选择一个能看到和听到你，并能理解你的类人。该生物必须在智慧救赎中成功，否则在持续时间内会被你影响到（%0%）。当该生物以这种方式变成（%1%）时，它承诺以友好的方式，尽其所能完成你要求的任何服务或活动。",
	"You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.": "当之前的任务完成后，或者你决定结束它目前的任务时，你可以给该生物设置新的任务。如果该服务或活动可能会对该生物造成伤害，或者与该生物的正常活动和欲望相冲突，该生物可以再做一次智慧救赎来尝试结束该效果。如果你或你的同伴正在与该生物战斗，这种救赎是有优势的。如果该活动会导致该生物的死亡，则咒语结束。",

We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened—by ensuring that no one knows it happened.": "据说Jim Darkmagic发明了这个咒语，最初称之为{@i I said what?!}你有没有和当地的君主交谈过，不小心提到他们的儿子看起来像你在家庭农场长大时最喜欢的猪？我们都有过这样的经历! 但与其因为一次诚实的口误而被砍头，你可以假装它从未发生过--确保没有人知道它发生过。",
	"When you cast this spell, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice within 5 feet of you forgets everything you said within the last 6 seconds.

	"When you cast this spell, you present the gem used as the material component and choose any number of creatures within range that can see you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by you until the spell ends, or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While {@condition charmed} in this way, a creature can do nothing but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected creature is within 5 feet of you, it cannot move, but simply stares greedily at the gem you present.": "当你施展这个法术时，你出示用作材料成分的宝石，并选择范围内任何数量的能看到你的生物。每个目标必须在智慧救赎中成功，否则就会被你（%0%），直到咒语结束，或者直到你或你的同伴对它做任何有害的事情。当{@condition charmed}这种方式时，生物除了用它的动作以安全的方式接近你外，什么都不能做。当受影响的生物在你5英尺范围内时，它不能移动，而只是贪婪地盯着你呈现的宝石。",
	"At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.": "在它的每个回合结束时，受影响的目标可以做一个智慧救赎动作。如果它成功了，这个效果就会对该目标结束。",
	"Of the many tactics employed by master magician and renowned adventurer Jim Darkmagic, the old glowing coin trick is a time-honored classic. When you cast the spell, you hurl the coin that is the spell's material component to any spot within range. The coin lights up as if under the effect of a {@spell light} spell.

	"You create three twisting, whistling, hypoallergenic, gluten-free darts of magical force. Each dart targets a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, a missile deals {@damage 2d4} force damage to its target.": "你创造了三个扭曲的、呼啸的、低过敏性的、不含麸质的魔力飞镖。每个飞镖的目标是你所选择的、在范围内可以看到的生物。对每个飞弹进行一次范围性的法术攻击。一旦命中，飞弹会对目标造成{@damage 2d4}的力量伤害。",
	"If the attack roll scores a critical hit, the target of that missile takes {@damage 5d4} force damage instead of you rolling damage twice for a critical hit. If the attack roll for any missile is a 1, all missiles miss their targets and blow up in your face, dealing 1 force damage per missile to you.": "如果攻击卷的得分是关键命中，该导弹的目标会受到{@damage 5d4}力的伤害，而不是你为关键命中滚动两次伤害。如果任何导弹的攻击卷是1，所有的导弹都没有击中目标，并在你面前炸开，每枚导弹对你造成1力的伤害。",

	"You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.": "你向盟友、工作人员或无辜的旁观者讲话，劝说并激励他们走向伟大，无论他们是否有什么可兴奋的。选择范围内最多五个能听到你的生物。在持续时间内，每个受影响的生物都会获得5个临时的命中率，并在智慧救赎上有优势。如果受影响的生物被攻击击中，它在下一次的攻击卷中具有优势。一旦受影响的生物失去了这个法术所赋予的临时命中率，这个法术就会对该生物结束。",
	"When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.": "当你使用四级或以上的法术槽施展此法术时，每超过三级的法术槽等级，临时命中率就会增加5。"
