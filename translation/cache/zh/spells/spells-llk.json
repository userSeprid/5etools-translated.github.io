	"You temporarily summon three familiars—spirits that take animal forms of your choice. Each familiar uses the same rules and options for a familiar conjured by the {@spell find familiar} spell. All the familiars conjured by this spell must be the same type of creature (celestials, fey, or fiends; your choice). If you already have a familiar conjured by the {@spell find familiar} spell or similar means, then one fewer familiars are conjured by this spell.": "你暂时召唤三个熟悉的人--采取你选择的动物形态的精灵。每个法师使用的规则和选项与（%0%）法术召唤的法师相同。所有由这个法术召唤出来的熟悉者必须是同一类型的生物（天人、精灵或魔人；你选择）。如果你已经有一个由{@spell find familiar}法术或类似方法变出的熟悉者，那么这个法术变出的熟悉者会少一个。",

It carries an open, empty chest whose interior dimensions are 3 feet on each side. While the spell lasts, you can deposit as many items inside the chest as will fit. You can then name a living creature you have met and seen at least once before, or any creature for which you possess a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the creature's body.": "你召唤一个小型空气元素到一个范围内的地方。这个空气元素是无形的，几乎是透明的，对所有伤害免疫，并且不能与其他生物或物体互动。它携带一个开放的空箱子，其内部尺寸为每边3英尺。在咒语持续期间，你可以在箱子里放置尽可能多的物品。然后你可以说出一个你以前至少见过一次的生物的名字，或者任何你拥有其身体部分、一绺头发、指甲的剪子或该生物身体的类似部分的生物。",
	"As soon as the lid of the chest is closed, the elemental and the chest disappear, then reappear adjacent to the target creature.

	"The target creature is made aware of the chest's contents before it chooses whether or not to open it, and knows how much of the spell's duration remains in which it can retrieve them. No other creature can open the chest and retrieve its contents. When the spell expires or when all the contents of the chest have been removed, the elemental and the chest disappear. The elemental also disappears if the target creature orders it to return the items to you. When the elemental disappears, any items not taken from the chest reappear on the ground at your feet.": "目标生物在选择是否打开箱子之前会被告知箱子里的东西，并且知道在咒语的持续时间内还有多少时间可以取回它们。没有其他生物可以打开箱子并取回里面的东西。当咒语过期或箱子里的所有物品都被取出时，元素和箱子都会消失。如果目标生物命令它把物品还给你，元素也会消失。当元素体消失时，任何未从箱子中取出的物品都会重新出现在你脚下的地面上。",
