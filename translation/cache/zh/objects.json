	"A ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Before it can be fired, it must be loaded and aimed. It takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it.": "弩炮是一种巨大的十字弓，可以发射沉重的箭矢。在发射之前，必须先装填和瞄准。装填武器需要一个动作，瞄准它需要一个动作，发射它需要一个动作。",

	"When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.": "当角色需要锯断绳索、打碎窗户或砸碎吸血鬼的棺材时，唯一的硬性规定是：只要有足够的时间和正确的工具，角色就可以破坏任何可破坏的物体。在决定一个角色是否能成功破坏一个物体时，请使用常识。一个战士能用剑切开一段石墙吗？不能，剑很可能会在墙之前就断裂。",
	"For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.": "在这些规则中，物体是指一个离散的、无生命的物品，如窗户、门、剑、书、桌子、椅子或石头，而不是由许多其他物体组成的建筑物或车辆。",
	"When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.": "当时间是一个因素时，你可以给一个可破坏的物体分配一个装甲等级和命中率。你还可以赋予它免疫力、抵抗力和对特定类型伤害的脆弱性。",
	" An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.": " 一个物体的护甲等级是衡量对该物体造成伤害的难度（因为该物体没有机会躲避）。物体护甲等级表提供了各种物质的建议AC值。",

	" An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.": " 一个物体的命中率衡量它在失去其结构完整性之前能承受多少伤害。有弹性的物体比脆弱的物体有更多的击中点。大型物体也往往比小型物体有更多的命中率，除非打破物体的一小部分和打破整个物体一样有效。物体命中率表提供了对大型或小型的脆弱和有弹性物体的建议命中率。",

	"Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.": "普通的武器对许多巨大的物体没有什么用处，例如巨大的雕像、高耸的石柱或巨大的巨石。也就是说，一个火把就可以烧掉一个巨大的挂毯，一个地震法术就可以把一个巨像变成废墟。如果你愿意，你可以追踪一个巨大或巨型物体的命中率，或者你可以简单地决定这个物体能够承受多久的武器或力量。如果你追踪物体的命中率，可以把它分成大型或小型部分，分别追踪每一部分的命中率。摧毁其中一个部分可能会毁掉整个物体。例如，一个巨大的人类雕像，当它的一条大腿被降低到0命中率时，可能会翻倒。",
	"Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others.

A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.": "物体对毒药和精神伤害是免疫的。你可能会决定某些伤害类型对某个特定的物体或物质比其他的更有效。例如，重击伤害对砸碎东西很有效，但对切割绳子或皮革则无效。纸质或布质物体可能容易受到火和雷电的伤害。镐头可以削掉石头，但不能有效地砍掉一棵树。一如既往，使用你的最佳判断。",
	"Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.": "像城堡墙壁这样的大型物体通常有额外的弹性，由伤害阈值表示。一个有伤害阈值的物体对所有的伤害都有免疫力，除非它从一次攻击或效果中受到的伤害量等于或大于它的伤害阈值，在这种情况下，它就会像平常一样受到伤害。任何未能达到或超过物体的伤害阈值的伤害都被认为是表面的，不会减少物体的命中率。",
