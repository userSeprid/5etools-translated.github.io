	"The Candlekeep Mysteries table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level, but you can adjust it for larger or smaller groups as well as for characters of higher or lower level by swapping one monster or trap for another, changing the number of foes in an encounter, and adjusting DCs to make important tasks easier or harder for the characters to accomplish.": "烛台之谜》表格总结了本文集中的冒险。每个冒险都是为四到六个特定级别的角色设计的，但你可以通过用一个怪物或陷阱替换另一个怪物或陷阱，改变遭遇战中的敌人数量，以及调整DC以使角色更容易或更难完成重要任务，来为更大或更小的团体以及更高或更低的角色进行调整。",
	"Each adventure in this anthology embraces one of the following narrative conceits:": "这本文集中的每一次冒险都包含了以下叙事概念之一。",

That said, each adventure contains opportunities for exploration, roleplaying, and combat, to appeal to players of all persuasions.": "这些短小的冒险对喜欢神秘和发现秘密的玩家来说效果最好。也就是说，每个冒险都包含了探索、角色扮演和战斗的机会，以吸引各种倾向的玩家。",
	"To run these adventures, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}).": "要运行这些冒险，你需要第五版核心规则书（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text. ": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in these adventures. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, get this creature's stat block ready. You'll need it.\" If a stat block is new, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含这些冒险中遇到的大多数生物的状态块。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向你的状态块，作为一种说法，\"嘿，管理员，把这个生物的状态块准备好。你会需要它的。\" 如果一个状态块是新的，冒险的文本会告诉你在哪里找到它。",

	"Before running an adventure with a new group of players, have a candid out-of-game conversation with them about hard and soft limits on what topics can be broached in-game. Your players might have phobias and triggers you aren't aware of. Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care. Be ready to move away from such topics and themes quickly if a problem crops up. It's okay for characters to feel stressed and anxious, but your players should be relaxed and having fun.": "在与一组新的玩家进行冒险之前，与他们进行一次坦诚的游戏外对话，讨论在游戏中可以讨论的话题的软硬限制。你的玩家可能有恐惧症和你不知道的触发器。任何让玩家感到不安全的话题或主题都应该被避免。如果一个话题或主题让一个或多个玩家感到紧张，但他们同意在游戏中加入这个话题，请谨慎地加入这个话题。如果出现问题，要准备好迅速离开这些话题和主题。角色感到压力和焦虑是可以的，但你的玩家应该是放松的，并且有乐趣。",
	"You can dissect an adventure and use pieces of it rather than the whole thing. Nothing in these adventures is too sacred to tamper with and repurpose to serve your own needs.": "你可以剖析一个冒险，使用它的碎片而不是整个东西。在这些冒险中，没有什么东西是神圣的，可以篡改和重新利用来满足你自己的需要。",
	"Most of the locations described in this book can be used as stand-alone adventure sites. With a little effort and a few name changes, you can transplant them into other campaign worlds, including your own.": "本书中描述的大多数地点都可以作为独立的冒险地点。只要稍加努力，改变一下名称，你就可以把它们移植到其他活动世界中，包括你自己的世界。",
	"Take the Lykortha Expanse, a cave network that figures prominently in one of this book's adventures. You could situate these caves in any wilderness or Underdark setting where fungi are likely to be found in abundance. You can also modify the villain and its goals to better support an ongoing story or threat in your campaign. Conversely, you could remove the villain, keep the map, and repopulate the Lykortha Expanse with creatures that better suit the characters' level or the particular story you want to tell. Sometimes a good map is all a DM needs!": "就拿莱科萨山脉（Lykortha Expanse）来说，这是一个洞穴网络，在本书的一次冒险中占据了重要地位。你可以把这些洞穴放在任何可能发现大量真菌的荒野或地下城环境中。你也可以修改小人和它的目标，以更好地支持你的活动中正在进行的故事或威胁。反过来说，你也可以去掉小人，保留地图，然后用更适合人物水平或你想讲的特定故事的生物重新填充莱科萨大草原。有时候，一张好的地图就是管理员所需要的一切",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms is one of high fantasy, populated by elves, dwarves, halflings, humans, and other folk. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales that take them to strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can carry inexperienced youths with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Traveling throughout the Realms invites the perils of fell magic and deadly monsters. Farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city might fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "被遗忘的世界是一个高度幻想的世界，居住着精灵、矮人、半身人、人类和其他民族。来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的铁血冒险家们追随故事，将他们带到陌生、光荣、遥远的地方。好的地图和清晰的小路可以带着没有经验的年轻人，带着荣耀的梦想远走他乡，但这些道路从来都不安全。在整个王国中旅行会招致堕落的魔法和致命的怪物的危险。离城市一天路程的农场和土地可能会成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方是安全的，不会受到龙的突然愤怒的攻击。",
	"Details about the history and nature of the Realms fill volumes, and much of that knowledge resides in books and scrolls sealed in Candlekeep's vaults.

	"Standing atop a rocky crag overlooking the Sea of Swords, the massive citadel of Candlekeep has endured the elements for centuries and defied the degradations of time. Visible for miles around, Candlekeep has an eye-catching silhouette: a high wall interspersed with towers. This wall encloses a large space from which more towers rise. Those who behold the edifice say it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with an overabundance of candles.": "矗立在俯瞰剑海的岩石峭壁上，巨大的烛台堡垒经受住了几个世纪的风吹雨打，抵御了时间的退化。烛龙城在方圆几英里内都能看到，它有一个醒目的轮廓：一堵高墙夹杂着塔楼。这堵墙包围着一个大空间，更多的塔楼从这里升起。那些看到这座建筑的人说，它看起来就像一个用过多的蜡烛装饰的蛋糕。",
	"The entrance to Candlekeep is a double gate that stands at the end of the Way of the Lion, the only road that provides access to and from the outside world. The route follows a lonely path across the peninsula where Candlekeep stands.": "烛台镇的入口是一道双门，矗立在狮子之路的尽头，这是唯一一条可以进出外部世界的道路。这条路沿着一条孤独的小路穿过烛龙镇所在的半岛。",
	"Those who gain entry discover a cloistered community of scholars milling around inside Candlekeep's walls, a place of enlightened conversation and friendly debate. No better place in the Realms exists for those who have a love for or a need of knowledge and who want to pursue such interests alongside fellow seekers.": "进入这里的人发现，在烛龙城的城墙内有一个由学者组成的隐秘社区，这是一个充满启迪性对话和友好辩论的地方。对于那些热爱或需要知识的人来说，在王国中没有比这更好的地方了，他们希望与其他追求者一起追求这种兴趣。",
	"Candlekeep has the largest repository of written lore in Faerûn, including the collected prophecies of an ancient sage named Alaundo the Seer. Those compiled divinations make up a tiny fraction of the accumulated knowledge and secrets contained in the library's vast collection.": "烛龙镇拥有法鲁恩最大的书面传说库，包括一位名叫阿伦多预言家的古代圣人所收集的预言。这些汇编的预言只占图书馆庞大藏书中积累的知识和秘密的极小部分。",
	"Not all knowledge preserved in Candlekeep is of historical importance. The library holds thousands upon thousands of lost recipes, old songs, collections of folklore, and journals written by folks whose time has long since passed. The abundance of these ancillary works makes finding notable tomes an exercise in patience and perseverance. Fortunately, a legion of scholars and sages called the Avowed look after the library and remain vigilant in the care and cataloging of all the knowledge it holds.": "并非所有保存在Candlekeep的知识都具有历史意义。图书馆里保存着数以千计的失传食谱、老歌、民间传说集，以及那些时代早已过去的人们写的日记。这些附属作品的数量之多，使得寻找著名的书籍成为一项需要耐心和毅力的工作。幸运的是，一个被称为 \"圣人 \"的学者和圣人军团照看着这个图书馆，并对它所拥有的所有知识保持着警惕和分类。",
	"The required entrance fee for admission into Candlekeep is a work of writing not already collected therein. Those who show up at the gates without such a gift are kindly but firmly turned away.": "进入烛台镇所需的入场费是一件尚未收集到的文字作品。没有这样的礼物出现在大门口的人，会被亲切而坚定地拒之门外。",
	"The enormous double gates of Candlekeep are three times the height of a human and wrought of black metal magically warded to foil attempts to damage them. Both doors are emblazoned with the sigil of Candlekeep. One of the two gates stands open far enough to admit visitors during the day, and the other is kept shut.": "烛龙镇巨大的双门是人类高度的三倍，由黑色金属锻造而成，有魔法防护，以阻止破坏它们的企图。两扇门上都印有烛台镇的标志。两扇门中的一扇在白天开放，足以接纳访客，而另一扇则保持关闭。",
	"Bedecked in purple vestments, five Avowed {@creature Priest||priests} of Deneir (god of writing) oversee the front gates, examining and discussing written works presented by hopefuls trying to gain entrance. If a question arises, the Avowed send a runner to consult with a sage in the library. The runner eventually returns bearing a missive of acceptance or denial. Visiting scholars experienced in this procedure often bring a selection of possible donations to ensure admittance. Despite the stringent entrance requirements, the Avowed do accept rare editions of tomes already in the collection, journals of those who recount unique or insightful experiences, or the odd work that has been annotated by a prominent scholar outside the library. Once granted admission, visitors quickly discover that it's wise to assemble a \"wish list\" of works that members of the senior staff are interested in collecting, potentially reducing the guesswork of readmission on future visits.": "身着紫色法衣的五位Deneir（写作之神）的Avowed（%0%）监督着前门，检查和讨论有希望进入的人提交的书面作品。如果出现问题，\"阿维德 \"会派人去咨询图书馆里的圣人。跑步者最终会带着接受或拒绝的信笺回来。对这一程序有经验的访问学者通常会带来一些可能的捐赠品，以确保被接纳。尽管入口要求严格，但 \"阿凡提 \"确实接受已经收藏的罕见版本的书籍，那些讲述独特或有洞察力的经验的日记，或由图书馆外的著名学者注释的奇怪作品。一旦获准入馆，参观者很快就会发现，收集一份高级工作人员有兴趣收藏的作品的 \"愿望清单 \"是明智的，这可能会减少未来访问时的猜测。",
	"Those admitted to Candlekeep, referred to as seekers, can request the assistance of an Avowed adjutant who acts as a guide and research assistant for the duration of their visit. This guide has access to all the resources of the library, with the exception of the vaults that contain the rarest and most dangerous works. Seekers can appeal to higher-ranking Avowed for permission to peruse these off-limits works.": "那些被允许进入Candlekeep的人，被称为寻求者，可以请求一位Avowed副官的帮助，他在访问期间充当向导和研究助理。这位向导可以接触到图书馆的所有资源，但存放最稀有和最危险作品的地下室除外。探索者可以向更高等级的Avowed提出申请，以获得阅读这些禁区作品的许可。",
	"If the adventurers require a guide, roll a {@dice d8} and consult the Avowed Adjutants table to determine the adjutant who is assigned to them, or choose one that you like.": "如果冒险者需要一个向导，请掷出{@dice d8}，并查阅Avowed Adjutants表以确定分配给他们的副官，或者选择一个你喜欢的。",

	"Vooshadi Moonriver, a stoic 87-year-old moon elf scribe who is difficult to anger and doesn't mince words": "沃沙迪-月河，一个87岁的月精灵文士，性格刚毅，难以激怒，不善言辞。",
	"Irony, a 15-year-old tiefling scribe who follows the rules, never lies or steals, and aspires to be Keeper of Tomes one day": "讽刺，一个15岁的盗贼文士，遵守规则，从不撒谎或偷窃，并渴望有一天成为通书的守护者",
	"Candlekeep is fortified by a fifty-foot-tall, fifteen-foot-thick, iron-reinforced stone wall with a double gate facing east. Although most of the Avowed are humble scholars, a number of potent spellcasters fill critical posts. If trouble occurs, the Gatewarden (an {@creature archmage}) and up to four {@creature Mage||mages} arrive to investigate immediately. If they can't bring the situation under control in short order, up to four additional {@creature Archmage||archmages} arrive to lend assistance.": "烛台城由一道50英尺高、15英尺厚的铁质加固石墙加固，有一道朝东的双门。虽然大多数 \"神赐者 \"都是卑微的学者，但也有一些强大的施法者担任重要职务。如果发生麻烦，门神（一个（%0%））和最多四个（%1%）会立即赶来调查。如果他们不能在短时间内控制局势，最多四个{@creature Archmage||archmages}的人就会赶来提供援助。",
	"Numerous magical defenses protect the library. The most innocuous include wards to protect the library's books from mold, weevils, and other threats. Other protections are more dramatic, as discussed below.": "众多的魔法防御措施保护着图书馆。最无害的包括保护图书馆的书籍不受霉菌、象鼻虫和其他威胁的守护。其他的保护措施则更具有戏剧性，如下文所述。",
	"Wards prevent anyone from entering Candlekeep by any route other than through the front gates. Any attempt to magically bypass these gates fails. These wards do not prevent creatures from using magic to exit Candlekeep.": "警卫阻止任何人通过前门以外的任何途径进入烛台镇。任何试图用魔法绕过这些门的行为都会失败。这些守卫并不能阻止生物使用魔法离开烛台镇。",
	"Anyone who tries to fly over the wall into Candlekeep is stopped short. Magical flight is dispelled, and the subject floats slowly to the ground fifty feet outside the gates. An intangible ward forces creatures that can fly naturally to either land or circumnavigate Candlekeep altogether. Ordinary birds are unaffected by this ward, and a clever wizard or other individual can bypass the ward by assuming the form of a Tiny bird. The Avowed don't discuss this flaw with outsiders, but anyone who can see the gulls flying over Candlekeep can easily reach the conclusion that certain creatures are exempt from this magical restriction. ": "任何试图飞越围墙进入烛龙镇的人都会被阻止。神奇的飞行被驱散了，当事人会缓慢地漂浮到门外50英尺的地面上。一个无形的防护罩迫使能够自然飞行的生物要么降落，要么完全绕过烛台镇。普通的鸟类不受这个防护罩的影响，聪明的巫师或其他个人可以通过化身为小鸟的形式来绕过这个防护罩。阿维德人不与外人讨论这个缺陷，但任何能看到海鸥在烛台镇上空飞翔的人都能轻易得出结论，某些生物可以不受这个魔法限制。",
	"Flames larger than a candle are suppressed within the keep. (The fireplace in the Hearth, Candlekeep's tavern, is an exception.) Thus, any spell that creates fire is wasted if it is cast within the keep.": "大于蜡烛的火焰在堡垒内会受到抑制。(烛台镇酒馆的壁炉是个例外。)因此，任何创造火焰的法术如果在堡垒内施放都会被浪费。",
	"Every book, scroll, and other work considered part of Candlekeep's collection is magically protected against theft. Any such work that is removed from the keep disappears and immediately returns to its proper place in the library.": "每本书籍、卷轴和其他被视为Candlekeep收藏品的作品都受到神奇的保护，不会被盗。任何被移出保管所的作品都会消失，并立即回到其在图书馆的适当位置。",
	"This ward also has a flaw that the Avowed don't discuss with outsiders. If pages from a book or parts of a scroll are torn away, these fragments can be removed from Candlekeep as long as the bulk of the work remains in the library. Similarly, if a work is split into pieces and entirely removed from Candlekeep, only the largest piece disappears and returns to its proper place in the library.": "这个病房也有一个缺陷，\"神赐者 \"不与外人讨论。如果一本书的书页或卷轴的一部分被撕掉了，只要作品的大部分还在图书馆里，这些碎片就可以从Candlekeep中取出。同样地，如果一部作品被分割成碎片并完全从烛台上移走，只有最大的碎片会消失，并回到它在图书馆的适当位置。",
	"From any location in Candlekeep, the Keeper of Tomes (see \"{@area The Avowed|01a|x}\" later in this section) can activate a mythal—an exceptional, unbreakable magical effect—that envelops all of Candlekeep in a protective shield through which nothing but air and sound can pass.": "在烛台镇的任何地方，通书守护者（见本节后面的\"{@area The Avowed|01a|x}\"）都可以激活一个神话--一种特殊的、无法打破的魔法效果--将整个烛台镇笼罩在一个保护罩中，除了空气和声音，没有任何东西可以穿过。",
	"All who enter Candlekeep must agree to the Orders of Accordance, rules set forth by the senior staff to prevent misconduct. Violating one or more of these orders results in banishment from Candlekeep, and the banished are seldom allowed to return.

	"All arguments must follow the rules of cordial debate and discussion. Violent altercations are not tolerated.": "所有的争论必须遵循亲切的辩论和讨论的规则。暴力争吵是不能容忍的。",
	"This rule applies to all objects in the keep, not just the library's works.": "这一规则适用于保存的所有对象，而不仅仅是图书馆的作品。",

The Keeper's word is law, and each Keeper's edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keepers.": "守护者是 \"神赐者 \"中地位最高的成员，也是烛台镇的长官，他挑选学者来填补空缺的领导职位。守护者的话就是法律，每个守护者的命令都会被记录下来，供未来的守护者参考。",
	"A Keeper of Tomes chooses their own replacement. If a Keeper dies or departs before making that choice, the council of Great Readers votes to determine who among them is elevated to the position. Tie votes are broken by the First Reader.": "通书守护者选择自己的替代者。如果守护者在做出选择之前死亡或离开，大阅读者委员会将投票决定他们中谁将被提升到这个位置。票数相同的情况下，由第一朗读者打破。",

	"Some scholars believe that Malar, god of the hunt, is responsible for lycanthropy. Mazfroth disagrees with this theory on the basis that not all lycanthropes are evil as Malar is. Werebears are an example of lycanthropes that are usually good.": "一些学者认为，狩猎之神马拉尔是狼人的罪魁祸首。马兹弗洛特不同意这一理论，理由是并非所有的狼人都像马拉尔一样邪恶。狼人是狼人的一个例子，他们通常是好的。",
	"The Abyss is ruled by demon lords—Baphomet, Demogorgon, Graz'zt, Juiblex, Orcus, Yeenoghu, Zuggtmoy, and many others. Mazfroth ties the origins of several monsters to these demon lords (saying Juiblex created all oozes, for example).": "深渊由恶魔领主统治--巴弗梅特（Baphomet）、德莫戈贡（Demogorgon）、格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）、朱布勒克斯（Juiblex）、奥库斯（Orcus）、耶诺古（Yeenoghu）、祖格莫伊（Zuggtmoy）和其他许多恶魔。马兹弗罗斯将一些怪物的起源与这些恶魔领主联系在一起（例如，他说尤布勒克斯创造了所有的乌兹）。",

	"A {@creature gingwatzim|CM} is a peculiar form of life created by a spell or a ritual. The magic that brings it into being draws on spirit energy from the Ethereal Plane to give the gingwatzim its true form—that of a luminous (but not too bright) sphere of ectoplasm roughly 3 feet in diameter. A newly formed gingwatzim appears as near to its creator as possible and follows its creator's commands without question, using telepathy to communicate.": "{@creature gingwatzim|CM}是一种由法术或仪式创造的奇特的生命形式。使其产生的魔法从虚空界汲取精神能量，使Gingwatzim拥有真正的形态--一个发光的（但不是太亮）外质球体，直径约为3英尺。一个新形成的Gingwatzim会尽可能地靠近它的创造者，并毫不犹豫地听从它的创造者的命令，用心灵感应进行交流。",
	"A gingwatzim can assume two other forms that are determined by its creator at the time the gingwatzim comes into being. One is an exact duplicate of a Tiny nonmagical object that its creator is wearing or carrying. The gingwatzim's other form is that of a specific Tiny beast.": "gingwatzim可以变成另外两种形式，由其创造者在gingwatzim产生时决定。一种是它的创造者所穿戴或携带的微小非魔法物品的精确复制品。gingwatzim的另一个形态是一个特定的小兽的形态。",
	"When the {@creature gingwatzim|CM} that has taken the form of {@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions} attacks the characters, it does so by assuming its true form and then using its Energy Drain action. A gingwatzim must feed on the life energy of other creatures to survive, but it can't feed while in the form of a beast or an object, which is why it must revert to its true form first. Its other form is that of a bat.": "当{@creature gingwatzim|CM}变成{@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}的形态攻击角色时，它的做法是变成它的真实形态，然后使用它的能量耗尽动作。Gingwatzim必须以其他生物的生命能量为食才能生存，但它在变成野兽或物体的形态时无法进食，这就是为什么它必须先恢复到它的真实形态。它的另一种形态是蝙蝠的形态。",
	"This particular gingwatzim was instructed by its creator to remain in book form, but it hasn't fed in days. Consequently, it tries to consume the characters' life energy and fights until destroyed. All the while, it terrorizes its prey with telepathic messages such as \"Feed me!\" and \"Need life!\" No trace of the destroyed gingwatzim remains, depriving Candlekeep of its copy of {@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}.": "这个特殊的Gingwatzim被它的创造者指示保持书的形式，但它已经几天没有进食了。因此，它试图吞噬人物的生命能量，并一直战斗到被消灭。同时，它用心灵感应的信息恐吓它的猎物，如 \"喂我！\"和 \"需要生命！\" 被摧毁的Gingwatzim没有留下任何痕迹，使Candlekeep失去了它的副本（%0%）。",
	"The gingwatzim that attacks the characters was created by a jackalwere named Korvala, using a ritual taught to her by a now-deceased lamia named Nidalia. Korvala is the leader of the Amberdune Pack, a gang of jackalweres that sells books and scrolls in the markets of Baldur's Gate. Korvala commanded the gingwatzim to take the form of {@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}, one of the more valuable books in her collection. This ruse enabled her to sell a copy of the book without giving up the genuine item, which Korvala is loath to part with.": "攻击这些人物的Gingwatzim是由一个名叫Korvala的豺狼人创造的，使用的是一个现已去世的名叫Nidalia的拉米亚教给她的仪式。科瓦拉是安柏杜恩小组的领导人，该小组由豺狼人组成，在博德之门的市场上出售书籍和卷轴。科瓦拉命令金瓦兹姆变成{@i Mazfroth's Mighty Digressions}的样子，这是她收藏中比较有价值的书籍之一。这个诡计使她能够在不放弃真品的情况下出售该书的副本，而科瓦拉不愿意放弃这本书。",
	"The Amberdune Pack remains fiercely loyal to Nidalia, even though she has been dead for months. Rather than corrupting individuals and acquiring slaves, Nidalia preferred to collect books and scrolls. Though she was peaceful and compassionate, she was nonetheless killed by a group of adventurers.

	"With Korvala as their new leader, the pack began working on a way to resurrect Nidalia. It soon became clear that wouldn't be a simple task. After all, the {@spell resurrection} spell requires both a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and the services of a sufficiently powerful spellcaster.": "随着科瓦拉成为他们的新领袖，这个族群开始研究复活尼达利亚的方法。很快就发现这不是一个简单的任务。毕竟，{@spell resurrection}的咒语需要价值至少1000金币的钻石和一个足够强大的施法者的服务。",
	"The pack's plan to sell books and scrolls, as well as gingwatzims disguised as books and scrolls, proved to be more challenging than they expected. Most of their profits are spent to help them survive in a city with more than its fair share of bribery and corruption.

	"The jackalweres live in the northern neighborhood of Blackgate, not far from the Wide. This district is part of the Outer City, a sprawl of settlements that stretch beyond the city's actual walls. The Outer City is home to Baldur's Gate's poorer inhabitants, who live in ramshackle huts and flimsy tents—a stark contrast to the opulence of the Upper City. Merchants with wares too meager—or too illicit—to sell in the Wide make do with unregulated back alley markets here. The stench of stabled horses and other beasts of burden permeates the air.": "豺狼人住在黑门的北部街区，离宽阔的地方不远。这个地区是外城的一部分，外城是一个绵延的定居点，延伸到城市的实际墙外。外城是博德之门贫穷居民的家园，他们住在破旧的小屋和脆弱的帐篷里，与上城的富足形成鲜明的对比。商人们的商品太少了，或者说太不合法了，无法在宽阔的地方销售，只能在这里的小巷子里做不规范的市场。空气中弥漫着停放的马匹和其他牲畜的臭味。",
	"If the characters allowed the {@creature wererat} Mushika to escape earlier in the adventure, he tries to get his revenge as they make their way through Blackgate toward the Amberdune hideout.

	"Mushika has assumed humanoid form and is accompanied by a {@creature swarm of rats} and two human {@creature Thug||thugs} named Alaspar and Sufeni.

	"For a long-term campaign, you have the option of reopening the mine once the party clears out the nest of meenlocks.

	"Since the village's business was conducted on the first floor of the mansion, the mayor and her wife spent their personal time in this room. The shelves hold books of all sorts, from tomes on history and treatises on business to thin volumes of folktales and grand, sweeping novels.

	"Intended as a guest bedroom, this chamber rarely saw much use.": "这间屋子本来是作为客人的卧室，但很少有人使用。",
	"This bedroom has a tall chest of drawers made of dark wood in the corner across from the door. Farther into the room, a small desk sits between two windows, with a large bed to the left of it.

	"This tunnel ends at a small chamber that holds worn picks, rusty shovels, and two hand carts filled with debris and rags.": "这条隧道的尽头是一个小室，里面放着破旧的镐、生锈的铲子和两辆装满杂物和破布的手推车。",
	"The tools were left behind by the workers in the wake of the disaster.": "这些工具是工人们在灾难发生后留下的。",
	"Characters who look up see scores of bats hanging from the 20-foot-high ceiling.

	"The opening of this tunnel is nearly circular. Black moss covers the walls, floor, and ceiling of the tunnel as far as you can see. Within this tunnel are several branches, all of them covered in the same black moss.": "这条隧道的开口几乎是圆形的。在你能看到的范围内，黑色的苔藓覆盖了隧道的墙壁、地板和天花板。这条隧道内有几个分支，都被同样的黑色苔藓所覆盖。",
	"The notable aspect of this tunnel is the uniform layer of black moss over everything. Characters who scrape the moss away from the rock see that the walls are smooth, not rough-carved by pick and shovel like the rest of the mine. Because the meenlock tunnels spontaneously manifested rather than being dug out, there are no scratch marks or signs of excavation on the walls, floor, or ceiling here. The moss muffles all sound, causing a lack of echoes and creating a sense of claustrophobia.": "这条隧道的显著特点是所有东西上都有一层均匀的黑色苔藓。将苔藓从岩石上刮开的角色看到，墙壁是光滑的，而不是像矿井的其他地方那样由镐和铲子粗略地雕刻而成。由于米恩洛克隧道是自发形成的，而不是被挖出来的，所以这里的墙壁、地板或天花板上没有任何划痕或挖掘的痕迹。苔藓掩盖了所有的声音，导致缺乏回声，并创造了一种幽闭恐惧症的感觉。",
	"A successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Nature}) check reveals that the tunnels were not created by hand, claw, or tool, but rather by magic or another strange effect; if the check succeeds by 4 or more, the character pieces together the clues, if they haven't done so already, and realizes that meenlocks created the moss-covered tunnels.": "成功通过DC14智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查，可以发现隧道不是由手、爪或工具创造的，而是由魔法或其他奇怪的效果创造的；如果检查成功4个或更多，角色就会把线索拼凑起来，如果他们还没有这样做的话，并意识到是门锁创造了覆盖着苔藓的隧道。",
	"Thick, velvety black moss covers every surface of this eight-foot-high chamber. Set into the far wall is a deep alcove.": "厚厚的、天鹅绒般的黑色苔藓覆盖了这个八英尺高的房间的每一个表面。镶嵌在远处墙壁上的是一个深深的凹槽。",
	"Whenever a creature that isn't a meenlock enters the alcove or starts its turn there, tentacles of black moss sprout from the alcove's walls, forcing the creature to succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being {@condition grappled} by them (escape DC 14). The tentacles are an otherwise harmless magical effect and can't be harmed, though a {@spell dispel magic} spell causes them to disappear.": "每当一个非锁魂师的生物进入凹室或在那里开始它的回合时，黑色苔藓的触手就会从凹室的墙壁上长出来，迫使该生物在DC14的灵巧救赎中成功，以避免被它们击中（%0%）（逃生DC14）。这些触手是一种无害的魔法效果，不会受到伤害，但一个{@spell dispel magic}的咒语会使它们消失。",
	"A character who wanders into this cave alone and is {@condition grappled} by the mossy tentacles might have to deal with one or more {@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks} that creep into the room, hoping to take advantage of the character's unfortunate predicament.": "独自闯入这个洞穴并被苔藓触手{@condition grappled}的角色可能要对付一个或多个{@creature Meenlock|VGM|meenlocks}爬进房间，希望利用这个角色的不幸困境。",

	"This dead-end cavern opens wide, and the lingering dampness of the tunnels is pronounced in here. Moisture leaches through the moss ceiling above, forming fat droplets that fall into pools of dark water around the chamber. A sharp scent of minerals fills the air and mixes with the earthy smell of the moss. The sound of dripping doesn't echo, but is immediately dulled by the moss-carpeted surfaces.": "这个死胡同的洞穴开口很大，隧道中挥之不去的潮湿感在这里很明显。水分透过上方的苔藓天花板渗出，形成肥厚的水滴，落入密室周围的黑水潭中。空气中弥漫着一股尖锐的矿物质气味，与苔藓的泥土味混合在一起。滴水的声音没有回音，但立即被铺有苔藓的表面压制住了。",
	"The pools here vary in depth: the smaller ones are a few inches deep, and the larger pools measure 2 feet at their deepest. In the subterranean darkness, the pools look black. Light sources reflect off the water as if it were a dark mirror, and the characters are unable to see below the surface.": "这里的水池深度不同：较小的水池有几英寸深，较大的水池最深处有2英尺。在地下的黑暗中，池子看起来是黑色的。光源在水面上反射，就像一面黑暗的镜子，人物无法看到水面以下。",
	"This is another ideal ambush location for the meenlocks or, if you want to shake things up a bit, for a {@creature black pudding} or other ooze to lurk on the surface of one of the pools like an oil slick.": "这是另一个理想的埋伏地点，如果你想让事情变得更有趣，可以让{@creature black pudding}或其他渗出物像浮油一样潜伏在某个水池的表面。",
	"New scents greet you here: the musty funk of decaying fabric and old furs, and the smell of rot lingering in the stagnant air. Thick pillars of moss-covered stone support the twenty-foot-high ceiling, and waist-high stone slabs dot the cavern.": "新的气味在这里迎接你：腐烂的织物和旧毛皮的霉味，以及在停滞的空气中徘徊的腐烂的气味。覆盖着青苔的厚重石柱支撑着二十英尺高的天花板，齐腰高的石板点缀着洞穴。",
	"The meenlocks bring their victims here to be tormented and transformed. The stone slabs are coated with blood and filth—the result of mortals being laid out for days of torture. Any party members taken by the meenlocks are here, {@condition paralyzed} on one of the slabs if they haven't already been transformed (see the \"{@area Telepathic Torment|17d|x}\" sidebar at the end of the adventure).

He was noticed entering the stacks where {@i The Price of Beauty} is kept, but no one saw him leave.": "洛里斯最后一次见到法尔兹拉克斯时，这个矮人心情很悲伤，说他要去花时间看书。法尔萨克斯当晚没有回到他的住处，此后再也没有人看到他。有人注意到他进入了存放{@i The Price of Beauty}的书堆，但没有人看到他离开。",
	"{@i The Price of Beauty} is bound in soft green leather, eight inches wide and fourteen inches tall, and set with golden clasps. The book gives off the unmistakable scent of lilies. Set into its cover is a polished oval mirror with a delicate gold frame styled like locks of hair, which appear to spill down around the face of anyone who looks into the mirror.": "{@i The Price of Beauty}用柔软的绿色皮革装订，宽八英寸，高十四英寸，并镶有金色的扣子。这本书散发着无可置疑的百合花香味。书的封面上镶嵌着一面抛光的椭圆形镜子，其精致的金框造型就像一绺一绺的头发，看起来就像洒落在任何一个看向镜子的人的脸上。",
	"The book is filled with beautiful illustrations of woodland scenes, art, and jewelry. Delicate handwriting accompanies the illustrations, in the form of short prayers and meditations dedicated to seeking self-worth, techniques for massage and healing, and recipes for creating balms and cosmetics.": "这本书充满了美丽的林地场景、艺术和珠宝的插图。精致的笔迹伴随着插图，其形式是专门用于寻求自我价值的简短祈祷和冥想，按摩和治疗的技术，以及制作香膏和化妆品的配方。",
	"On the last page is an inscription by the author, Sylvarie Silversong, which reads: \"A mirror is a gateway to happiness, truth, and to accepting ourselves.\"": "在最后一页是作者西尔瓦利-西尔弗松的题词，内容如下。\"镜子是通往幸福、真理和接受自己的大门\"。",
	"When any creature holds {@i The Price of Beauty} and gazes into the mirror, the image of Sune replaces their own reflection and speaks in a soft voice, saying, \"Well met, dearest one. How do you feel today?\" (If the characters have not experienced this already, Lorris looks into the mirror while recounting what happened to Falthrax, and then drops the book in fright when it speaks to her.)": "当任何生物持有{@i The Price of Beauty}并注视着镜子时，苏妮的影像会取代他们自己的倒影，并以柔和的声音说话，说：\"你好啊，最亲爱的人。你今天感觉如何？\"（如果人物还没有经历过这种情况，洛里斯在叙述发生在法尔兹拉克斯身上的事情时看着镜子，然后在镜子对她说话时吓得把书丢了。）",
	"The mirror's unique illusion magic reacts and responds to the creature looking into it. Though it is not sentient and cannot answer complex questions, the mirror offers encouragement and advice on grooming and self-confidence. As it does so, the illusion shows the creature looking into the mirror, but changing and grooming its skin, hair, makeup, and clothing as desired. If the creature holding the book is happy with how it looks, or shows no interest in such matters, the illusion reverts to a normal mirror until used again.": "这面镜子独特的幻觉魔法会对看着它的生物做出反应和回应。虽然它没有知觉，也不能回答复杂的问题，但这面镜子提供了关于修饰和自信的鼓励和建议。当它这样做的时候，幻象显示生物在看着镜子，但根据需要改变和修饰它的皮肤、头发、化妆和衣服。如果拿着书的生物对自己的样子很满意，或者对这些事情不感兴趣，幻象就会恢复成普通的镜子，直到再次使用。",
	"If the creature holding the book mentions a desire to change something about itself, or that it feels unwell, tired, or unhappy, the illusion responds, \"If rest, relaxation, or transformation is what you need, then follow the lilies, dearest one. I am sure Sylvarie will see to your needs.\" The mirror then glows softly, and a 5-foot-wide, 7-foot-high portal appears in the nearest unoccupied space. The portal leads to an old woodland trail marked by posts that resemble sculpted stone lilies. As the characters will discover, the portal leads to a temple and bathhouse run by three elf sisters, where all is not as it seems.": "如果拿着书的生物提到想要改变自己的某些东西，或者感觉不舒服、疲倦或不快乐，幻象会回应说：\"如果休息、放松或转变是你需要的，那么就跟着百合花走吧，最亲爱的。我相信希尔瓦里会满足你的需要。\" 然后镜子发出柔和的光芒，一个5英尺宽、7英尺高的门户出现在最近的无人空间。这个传送门通向一条古老的林间小道，上面有类似于石雕百合花的柱子作为标记。正如角色们将发现的那样，这个传送门通向一个由三个精灵姐妹经营的寺庙和澡堂，在那里，一切都不像看上去那样。",
	"The portal remains active for 5 minutes, then vanishes. {@i The Price of Beauty} cannot be used to create another portal until the next dawn.": "传送门在5分钟内保持活跃，然后消失。{@i The Price of Beauty}在下一个黎明前不能用于创建另一个传送门。",
	"If the portal manifests while Lorris is present, the acolyte guesses correctly that it was the cause of Falthrax's disappearance. She fears the powerful magic involved and is apprehensive about what might have happened to her friend.": "如果传送门在洛里斯在场时显现，圣徒就会正确地猜测它是法尔赛克斯失踪的原因。她害怕所涉及的强大魔法，对她的朋友可能发生的事情感到忧虑。",
	"If the characters aren't inclined to investigate the portal or go after the missing acolyte, Lorris goes to one of the library's Great Readers to report Falthrax missing, and she mentions having met a group of adventurers in the library. The Great Reader then summons the characters and beseeches them to look into the matter.": "如果角色们不愿意调查传送门或去找失踪的圣徒，Lorris就去找图书馆的一个大阅读者报告Falthrax的失踪，她提到在图书馆里遇到了一群冒险家。然后，大阅读者召集了这些人物，恳请他们调查此事。",
	"This grand temple and bathhouse rests in a serene and ancient grove in the High Forest, southeast of Silverymoon.

	"Ten years ago, a coven of green hags calling themselves the Fetid Gaze tricked Sylvarie into a bargain that allowed them to take over the bathhouse. These cruel and cunning fey now use the temple to lure wealthy, greedy, and vain nobles and adventurers, preying on their insecurities and tricking them into accepting dark bargains that ultimately lead to misery.": "十年前，一个自称是 \"恋恋不舍\"（Fetid Gaze）的绿衣女巫团欺骗了希尔瓦里，使他们得以接管澡堂。这些残忍而狡猾的妖怪现在利用神庙来引诱富有、贪婪、虚荣的贵族和冒险家，利用他们的不安全感，诱使他们接受最终导致痛苦的黑暗交易。",
	"The temple consists of three buildings. What was once Sylvarie's private tower has been taken over by the hags as a lair, and a former shrine to Sune has become a prison for the cursed elf. The main bathhouse looks exactly as Sylvarie built it, and it continues to provide services to visitors. Most of the staff of the bathhouse are the coven's wicked minions in disguise, but also here are an undercover Harper agent, a water spirit, and a cursed kobold—all potential allies who can reveal the coven's malicious machinations.": "这座寺庙由三座建筑组成。曾经是希尔瓦里的私人塔楼已经被女巫们占为巢穴，而以前苏妮的神龛已经成为被诅咒的精灵的监狱。主澡堂看起来和希尔瓦里建造的一模一样，而且它继续为游客提供服务。浴场的大部分工作人员都是女巫会伪装的邪恶爪牙，但这里也有一个卧底的哈珀特工、一个水鬼和一个被诅咒的科波德--他们都是可以揭穿女巫会的恶意阴谋的潜在盟友。",
	"Three {@creature Green Hag||green hags} named Dread Morgan, Vile Sazha, and Auntie Greenbones were once rivals who dwelled in an area of the Feywild coterminous with the High Forest. A decade ago, during a time when the boundaries between the planes thinned, the hags became aware of the magic spring controlled by Sylvarie—and decided to control and corrupt it for their own purposes. The covetous hags each knew part of a ritual for crafting magic paintings that could bind mortal creatures with a terrible curse. After agreeing to share their knowledge and work together, they formed a coven dedicated to claiming Sylvarie's temple and making it a base for their nefarious plans.": "三个{@creature Green Hag||green hags}名叫可怕的摩根、卑鄙的萨莎和绿骨阿姨的人曾经是对手，他们居住在与高等森林相邻的精灵世界的一个地区。十年前，在各个星球之间的边界变薄的时候，女巫们意识到了希尔瓦里控制的魔法泉，并决定为自己的目的控制和腐蚀它。觊觎的女巫们每个人都知道制作魔法画的部分仪式，可以用可怕的诅咒束缚凡人的生物。在同意分享他们的知识并一起工作后，他们组成了一个女巫团，致力于夺取希尔瓦里的神庙，并将其作为他们邪恶计划的基地。",

Alternatively, she might decide that the temple holds too many dark memories for her, and that it should be up to others—perhaps the characters—to take charge of restoring the site. Either way, Sylvarie is grateful to the characters for what they've done and becomes a friend to the party for life.": "在女巫诅咒的影响下，十年的时间让希尔瓦里-西尔弗松变了个人。在你看来，她可能会决心将安息百合神庙恢复到它以前的地位，整修神殿，使这里成为一个更强大的苏妮崇拜场所。或者，她可能会决定，这座寺庙对她来说有太多的黑暗记忆，应该由其他人--也许是人物--来负责修复这个地方。无论怎样，希尔瓦里都会对人物的所作所为表示感谢，并成为党的终身朋友。",

Candlekeep has long been a steady customer, but over the last several tendays the grippli have become less and less active, and the supply of food has been all but cut off.

	"Pelk allows the characters to inspect the book. It is surprisingly light, and brief examination shows it to be a cunningly contrived container. Its covering is made of supple leather reinforced with thicker strips of hide. Opening the cover reveals three intricately carved, hollow wooden cylinders and a linen bag of dry clay artfully decorated with a drop of water.": "佩尔克允许这些人物检查这本书。它出乎意料地轻，简单的检查显示它是一个狡猾的容器。它的封面是由柔软的皮革制成的，并以较厚的皮条加固。打开盖子，可以看到三个精雕细琢的空心木质圆柱体和一个亚麻布袋的干泥，上面巧妙地装饰着一滴水。",

	"The first step is to remove some of the clay from its bag and mix it with water to form a thick paste, then spread the wet clay in a thin layer on a flat surface. Rolling one of the cylinders across this surface presses the writing into the clay and makes it readable. After repeating the process for each of the cylinders, the characters have the full story and can use that knowledge to determine what they do next.": "第一步是将一些粘土从袋子里取出来，与水混合成厚厚的糊状，然后将湿粘土在一个平面上铺成薄薄的一层。将其中一个圆柱体在这个表面上滚动，将文字压入粘土中，使其可读。对每个圆柱体重复这一过程后，人物就有了完整的故事，并可以利用这些知识来决定他们接下来的行动。",

	"The second cylinder's story begins with serpent creatures lurking ominously outside the grippli village. Then the serpentfolk rush forth, capturing or killing any of the frogfolk who try to stand against them. As the village falls into disarray, the giant crabs escape from their cages and head back into the sea.": "第二个圆筒的故事开始时，蛇类生物不祥地潜伏在格里普利村外。然后，蛇妖们冲了出来，捕获或杀死任何试图反对他们的蛙人。随着村庄陷入混乱，巨蟹从笼子里逃出来，回到了海里。",

	"It should be apparent to the characters, from whatever information they have gleaned, that the grippli trading post is the first stop on their mission. The trading post is on the coast, due west of the Cloakwood and roughly 90 miles north-northwest of Candlekeep by sea. They can get there either by accepting Mitor Jans's offer of transportation, or by a longer overland route that takes them east, north, and then westward through the forest.": "从他们收集到的任何信息来看，人物应该很清楚，格里普利贸易站是他们任务的第一站。贸易站位于海岸边，在斗篷森林的正西方向，距离烛台镇西北方向大约90英里的海域。他们可以通过接受米托-詹斯提供的交通工具到达那里，或者通过一条更长的陆路路线，向东、向北，然后向西穿过森林。",
	"If the characters need further persuasion, Mitor Jans tells them that he and his ship, the {@i Dog Ear}, have made the trip from Candlekeep to the trading post and back again more times than he can count. He and his crew know exactly where to sail to avoid undersea hazards and stay on the most efficient route. If the characters are suspicious of Mitor's motives, a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check is all it takes to verify the truth of his claims.": "如果人物需要进一步的说服，Mitor Jans告诉他们，他和他的船（%0%），已经从Candlekeep到贸易站再回来的次数多得数不清。他和他的船员清楚地知道应该在哪里航行，以避免海底的危险，并保持在最有效的路线上。如果人物对Mitor的动机产生怀疑，只要成功通过DC10智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，就可以验证他所说的真实性。",
	"In fact, this is the faster of the two routes. The trip takes a day and a half (36 hours), with no encounters en route.": "事实上，这是两条路线中比较快的一条。行程需要一天半（36小时），途中没有遇到任何问题。",
	"Mitor (use the {@creature bandit captain} stat block, if necessary) joined Candlekeep as a young acolyte but soon found he was more suited to a life on the sea.

About 50 miles north along the Coast Way is a trail that runs west into the forest and eventually leads to the outskirts of the {@area grippli village|262|x}. This route, well over 100 miles in total, takes at least seven days to traverse by foot, and at the end of it the characters will be entering the village before they visit the trading post. Both of those facts might have a marked effect on how the adventure continues (at your discretion). In addition, you might pit the characters against some random encounters along the way, to hint at the error of their ways in turning down the sea voyage.": "如果人物拒绝海上航行，他们可以在烛台镇查阅一张地图，上面显示了最安全和最快速的陆路路线，从狮子之路开始，这条路从烛台镇通往内陆（东部）。这条路与海岸之路相交，海岸之路沿着克洛伍德的东部边缘向北延伸。沿着海岸路向北约50英里，是一条向西进入森林的小路，最终通向（%0%）的郊区。这条路线总长远超过100英里，至少需要七天时间才能步行穿越，而在路线的尽头，人物将在访问贸易站之前进入村庄。这两个事实可能会对冒险的继续产生明显的影响（由你决定）。此外，你还可以让人物在沿途遇到一些随机事件，以暗示他们在拒绝海上航行方面的错误。",
	"The grippli of the Cloakwood are distrustful of strangers but forced by circumstances to consider outside help.

	"Assuming the characters traveled by ship to reach the trading post, the grippli guarding the dock watch them carefully but don't speak right away. Grippli have difficulty voicing the language of humans, so they speak in Primordial. (Mitor Jans has some fluency in Primordial and offers to be an intermediary if needed.) As long as the characters are nonhostile, the grippli will allow them to disembark.": "假设人物乘船到达贸易站，守卫码头的格里普利人仔细观察他们，但不会马上说话。格里普利人很难说出人类的语言，所以他们用原始语说话。(Mitor Jans能说一些流利的原始语，如果需要的话，他愿意做一个中间人。) 只要这些人物没有敌意，格里普利人就会允许他们上岸。",

	"The central structure of the trading post is a fortified stone and mud-brick edifice, decorated with the preserved carapaces and claws of giant crabs, where commerce is normally conducted. The ground around it, usually clear of construction, now houses a host of makeshift dwellings, and business has slowed to a standstill. The place looks and feels more like a refugee encampment than a trading post.": "贸易站的中心结构是一个坚固的石头和泥砖建筑，上面装饰着保存下来的巨蟹的甲壳和爪子，通常在这里进行贸易。它周围的地面通常没有建筑，现在有许多临时住所，商业活动已经放缓到了停滞状态。这个地方看起来和感觉上更像是一个难民营，而不是一个贸易站。",
	"The primitive shelters are the new homes of grippli who escaped when the evil yuan-ti came through the village in their search for the earlier group of serpentfolk. All these individuals are noncombatants, with no particular knowledge to be gained by communicating with them.": "原始的庇护所是格里普利的新家，他们在邪恶的元老们寻找先前那群蛇妖时经过村庄时逃了出来。所有这些人都是非战斗人员，与他们交流不会获得特别的知识。",

She evacuated the village when most of the other residents did and has set up quarters inside the large building. Assuming the characters are cooperative, the grippli guards take the visitors directly to her. If the party seems trustworthy, she speaks to them.

	"She informs the party that a small band of yuan-ti arrived in the area over a month ago, claiming to be followers of a benevolent deity they called the Scaled Mother. They were friendly, the opposite of other yuan-ti that the grippli had encountered and fought with. These yuan-ti expressed interest in excavating and restoring the previous site of the grippli village, a mile from its present location. Pond Mother saw no reason to refuse them, since their motives were seemingly innocent. But then, two tendays afterward, another group of yuan-ti came on the scene. These yuan-ti attacked the village, killed any frogfolk who tried to resist, and captured the grippli who weren't able to escape.": "她告诉大家，一小队元老在一个多月前来到这个地区，声称是一个仁慈的神灵的追随者，他们称之为鳞甲之母。他们很友好，与格里普利人遇到并与之交战的其他元蒂人相反。这些元老们表示有兴趣挖掘和恢复格里普利村的旧址，离现在的位置有一英里。塘主母亲认为没有理由拒绝他们，因为他们的动机似乎是无辜的。但是，两天后，又有一群元老来到了现场。这些元老们袭击了村子，杀死了所有试图反抗的蛙人，并抓走了没能逃脱的蛙人。",
	"She asks the characters for help, telling them that the yuan-ti have been eating their eggs and tormenting the few grippli who remain in the village. Nothing has been heard from the friendly yuan-ti since the larger force of evil ones descended on the village. Pond Mother fears that either they have been disposed of, or they have been imprisoned in the old temple that lies north of the village. In any event, saving the eggs, or as many of them as possible, is the grippli's main concern.": "她向人物求助，告诉他们元老们一直在吃他们的蛋，并折磨着留在村子里的几个格里普利人。自从更大的邪恶力量降临村子后，就再也没有听到友好的元宝们的消息了。塘主母亲担心，要么他们已经被处理掉了，要么他们已经被囚禁在村子北边的老庙里了。在任何情况下，拯救鸡蛋，或尽可能多的鸡蛋，是格里普利的主要关切。",
	"If the characters demand payment, Pond Mother can offer the modest contents of the trading post's coffers (200 gp) for clearing out the village and safeguarding the eggs. She points out that the characters are also entitled to keep any items of value that don't belong to the villagers.": "如果人物要求付款，池塘之母可以提供贸易站库房中的少量物品（200GP），用于清理村庄和保护鸡蛋。她指出，人物也有权保留不属于村民的任何有价值的物品。",
	"The trading post is about 5 miles south of the grippli village, which is most easily reached by sea. (An overland trip along the marshy coastline is a fool's route, fraught with obstacles and perils.) Mitor Jans will transport the characters as far as he can, then drop them off just outside the crab maze that borders the community before turning back south.": "贸易站在格里普利村以南约5英里处，从海上最容易到达。(沿着沼泽地海岸线的陆路旅行是一条愚蠢的路线，充满了障碍和危险）。Mitor Jans会尽可能地把人物送到最远的地方，然后在社区边界的螃蟹迷宫外把他们放下，再折回南方。",
	"Columns of stone with platforms built around them, connected by rickety-looking gangways that touch the sea or disappear beneath the frothing waves, are arrayed before you. In the distance you can see the marshy shore. Dark shapes move under the surface, and flashes of red carapace draw the eye. This is not a safe place.": "石柱周围建有平台，由看起来摇摇欲坠的舷梯连接，这些舷梯接触到海面或消失在汹涌的海浪之下，在你面前排列着。在远处，你可以看到沼泽地的海岸。黑暗的形状在海面下移动，闪烁的红色甲壳吸引着人们的目光。这不是一个安全的地方。",
	"Getting to the village is the characters' first challenge. Between the characters and the village is a network of cages where the grippli have kept, captured, and bred giant crabs for centuries.": "前往村庄是人物的第一个挑战。在人物和村庄之间有一个笼子网络，几个世纪以来，格里普利人在这里饲养、捕捉和繁殖巨蟹。",
	"The crab maze is a collection of low-to-the-water walkways, ranging in height from just above the water to being submerged by up to 2 feet. Each main walkway is wide enough for two Medium creatures to walk side by side, while the smaller branching ones are wide enough for only a single person. Interspersed through this web of rickety wood and netting are processing platforms built around the stone columns, each large enough to hold four creatures. Under the water, in open-topped cages made of netting, lurk a great number of giant crabs that haven't been fed recently. As the characters start to make their way to shore, the water begins to froth as the giant crabs become excited.": "蟹类迷宫是一系列低至水面的走道，高度从刚过水面到被淹没的2英尺不等。每条主走道的宽度足以让两个中型生物并排行走，而较小的分支走道的宽度只够一个人走。在这个由摇晃的木头和网子组成的网络中，穿插着围绕石柱建造的加工平台，每个平台都足以容纳四个生物。在水底，用网兜制成的敞口笼子里，潜伏着大量最近没有被喂养的巨蟹。当人物开始上岸时，由于巨蟹变得兴奋，水面开始泛起泡沫。",
	"No craft larger than a {@vehicle rowboat} can navigate the crab maze because the water is too shallow and already occupied by angry giant crabs. The characters are dropped off outside the maze at a point of your choosing. The water is only 4 or 5 feet deep throughout this area, but wading to shore is impossible since the crabs are everywhere. The characters' goal is to get to the breakwater that separates the maze from the village while avoiding the crabs as much as they can.": "任何大于{@vehicle rowboat}的船只都不能在螃蟹迷宫中航行，因为水太浅，而且已经被愤怒的巨蟹占据。角色们在迷宫外你选择的地点被放下。整个区域的水只有4或5英尺深，但涉水上岸是不可能的，因为螃蟹无处不在。人物的目标是到达分隔迷宫和村庄的防波堤，同时尽可能地避开螃蟹。",
	"As the characters move, they must make a successful DC 20 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) group check every 100 feet to avoid attracting giant crabs. If any group check fails, {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature Giant Crab||giant crabs} claw their way out of their cages and attack the characters.": "当角色移动时，他们必须每隔100英尺成功地进行一次DC20灵巧（（%0%））的群体检查，以避免吸引巨蟹。如果任何团体检查失败，{@dice 1d4 + 2}{@creature Giant Crab||giant crabs}就会用爪子把它们从笼子里抓出来，攻击人物。",
	"The processing platforms, located wherever two walkways join or intersect, are safe havens. The platforms are high enough above the water that the crabs won't attack creatures atop one.": "加工平台，位于两条人行道连接或相交的地方，是安全的避风港。这些平台离水面足够高，螃蟹不会攻击平台上的生物。",
	"After negotiating the maze, the characters come upon a low wall that the grippli have constructed to keep sea creatures away from the village and to protect the lagoon on the other side from rough water when a storm is raging. This breakwater is made of intertwined branches reinforced by tough vines. Hinged on the sides and split in the middle, it can be opened to allow the passage of small boats. In the closed position, as it is now, the breakwater is not designed to prevent entry to the village by anyone who can simply climb up and over it.": "在穿过迷宫后，人物来到一堵低矮的墙前，这是格里普利人建造的，目的是为了防止海洋生物远离村庄，并在风暴肆虐时保护另一侧的泻湖不受波及。这个防波堤是由交织在一起的树枝制成的，用坚韧的藤蔓加固。它两边铰接，中间裂开，可以打开，让小船通过。在关闭的状态下，就像现在这样，防波堤的设计并不是为了阻止任何人进入村子，他们可以简单地爬上去并越过它。",
	"If the characters avoided any contact with the giant crabs, or if they have handled those threats with a minimum of commotion, they can easily move over and beyond the breakwater without alerting the yuan-ti in the village. By taking the shortest path to shore, the characters can make landfall just north of the docks.": "如果人物避免了与巨蟹的任何接触，或者如果他们以最小的骚动处理了这些威胁，他们就可以轻松地越过防波堤，而不会惊动村里的元老。通过采取最短的路径上岸，人物可以在码头的北面登陆。",
	"Several yuan-ti are roaming through the village when the characters arrive, but the serpentfolk are not particularly vigilant. The characters can earn the yuan-ti's attention by making an undue amount of noise during their approach or giving themselves away with a display of flashy magic. If they do so, a squad of five {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} ambushes them soon after they get out of the water.": "当人物到达时，几个元老正在村子里游荡，但蛇人并不特别警惕。角色们可以通过在接近时发出不适当的噪音或用华丽的魔法暴露自己来吸引元老们的注意。如果他们这样做，在他们出水后不久，就会有一个五人小队（%0%）伏击他们。",
	"The yuan-ti, overconfident to a fault, are likely to fight to the death without trying to summon reinforcements. To give the characters a stiffer challenge, you can have a patrol of {@dice 1d4 + 2} {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} arrive on the scene, attracted by the sounds of combat, before the original squad has been vanquished.": "元老们过于自信，很可能在没有召唤援军的情况下就拼死一搏。为了给这些角色一个更激烈的挑战，你可以让一支{@dice 1d4 + 2}{@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods}的巡逻队在原来的小队被消灭之前，被战斗的声音所吸引，到达现场。",
	"The grippli village is set near the sea in a brackish marsh. Rising from the muck are circular, domed mud-brick buildings that the grippli use for homes and storage facilities. The carapaces and claws of giant crabs feature heavily in the architecture.": "格里普利人的村庄靠近大海，位于一个咸水沼泽中。淤泥中耸立着圆形、圆顶的泥砖建筑，格里普利人将其作为住宅和储存设施。巨蟹的甲壳和爪子在建筑中占有很大的比重。",
	"If the characters get to shore without causing a conflict with the yuan-ti, they can move freely (if carefully) around the village. (The evil serpentfolk are here for a particular purpose, and as a rule they have no quarrel with anyone who doesn't directly threaten their plan or try to impede what they're doing.)": "如果人物上岸后没有引起与元老们的冲突，他们就可以在村子里自由行动（如果小心的话）。(邪恶的蛇妖在这里有一个特殊的目的，作为一项规则，他们与任何没有直接威胁到他们的计划或试图阻碍他们工作的人都没有争执）。",
	"The ground throughout this area is damp and soft at best. Staying dry is difficult to impossible.": "这个地区的地面充其量是潮湿和柔软的。保持干燥是困难的，甚至是不可能的。",
	"The dozen or so {@creature Grippli Warrior|CM|grippli warriors} (see {@area the end of the adventure|273|x} for their stat block) remaining in the village are there only to do the yuan-ti's bidding; they all show signs of abuse from their treatment. Some are in a state of mourning, after being forced to watch the yuan-ti consume their eggs.": "留在村子里的十几个{@creature Grippli Warrior|CM|grippli warriors}（见{@area the end of the adventure|273|x}的状态块）只是为了听从元天的命令；他们都有被虐待的迹象。有些人在被迫看着元帝吃掉他们的蛋后，陷入了悲痛之中。",
	"Unlike the materials used for the crab maze, the docks are sturdy planks of wood tightly fastened together and treated to make the structure waterproof.": "与螃蟹迷宫所用的材料不同，这些码头是坚固的木板，紧紧地固定在一起，并经过处理，使结构防水。",
	"Only a couple of small boats remain tied up at these piers, the others having been used by the grippli who retreated to the trading post.": "只有几条小船仍然拴在这些码头上，其他的小船已经被撤退到贸易站的格里普利人使用。",
	"The yuan-ti have no interest in the small boats that are moored here—meaning that if they remain undamaged, the characters could use them for transport when they decide to leave this place behind.": "元老们对停泊在这里的小船没有兴趣--这意味着如果它们没有被损坏，当他们决定离开这个地方时，人物可以用它们来运输。",
	"The religious center of the village, this enormous building made of wood and mud bricks has been turned into a prison where the evil yuan-ti are holding some of the followers of the Scaled Mother. The hemispherical building, 20 feet high and 50 feet in diameter, is by far the largest structure in the community.": "作为村里的宗教中心，这座由木头和泥砖建成的巨大建筑已经变成了一座监狱，邪恶的元老们在这里关押了一些鳞甲母亲的信徒。这个半球形的建筑，高20英尺，直径50英尺，是迄今为止社区中最大的建筑。",
	"The ground level contains a pool of water in the center, directly beneath an opening in the roof of the same size. The marshy ground around the pool serves as an assembly area for group ceremonies. Two staircases on opposite sides of the dome lead up to the second floor, which is divided into four chambers, each about 10 feet square. Three of these rooms currently hold a total of ten wounded {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} with half their hit points remaining. These benevolent, neutral good yuan-ti are being guarded by four evil {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} stationed just outside the cells.": "地面层中央有一个水池，直接位于屋顶上同样大小的开口之下。水池周围的沼泽地被用作团体仪式的集会区。穹顶对面的两个楼梯通向二楼，二楼被分为四个房间，每个房间约10英尺见方。其中三个房间目前共容纳了10名伤员（%0%），他们的命中率还有一半。这些仁慈的、中立的好元神正被驻扎在牢房外的四个邪恶的（1%）人看守着。",
	"The guards remain at their stations until they hear significant sounds of activity coming from the ground level, or until a character ascends one of the staircases and comes into their view, whereupon they all rush to attack. The prisoners, even if they're left unattended, won't leave their cells willingly while combat is going on.": "狱警们一直呆在自己的岗位上，直到他们听到来自地面的重要活动声音，或者直到一个人物登上某个楼梯并进入他们的视野，这时他们都会冲上去攻击。囚犯即使无人看管，也不会在战斗进行时自愿离开他们的牢房。",
	"If the characters dispose of the guards and free the prisoners, the benevolent yuan-ti explain what they know of the situation: they are allies of the grippli who have been victimized by the evil yuan-ti that invaded the village recently. They know from their captors that two of their number have been hauled through the marsh northward to the location of a temple in the old village, where they are to be sacrificed to the evil deity Sseth sometime soon.": "如果角色们解决了守卫并释放了囚犯，仁慈的元老们会解释他们所知道的情况：他们是格里普利人的盟友，最近被入侵村庄的邪恶元老们所害。他们从俘虏那里知道，他们中的两个人被拖着穿过沼泽，向北走到老村子里的一个寺庙的位置，在那里他们很快就会被献给邪恶的神灵Sseth。",
	"Near the outskirts of the village is the grippli nursery. In five places, built up like the sides of a well, stand 3-foot-high mud-brick walls enclosing 20-foot-diameter circular areas. These repositories, filled with clean, fresh water, are where the grippli lay their eggs and nurture offspring as they mature.": "靠近村子的郊区是格里普利苗圃。在五个地方，像井的两侧一样，矗立着3英尺高的泥砖墙，包围着直径20英尺的圆形区域。这些贮藏室充满了干净的淡水，是格里普利人产卵和培育后代的地方。",
	"This location is under the control of four {@creature Yuan-ti Pureblood||yuan-ti purebloods} and two {@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||yuan-ti malisons} (any type). They permit a small number of grippli to tend the eggs, which is why the eggs haven't all died since the arrival of the serpentfolk. This permission could be an act of mercy, or it could just be that the yuan-ti like to eat the eggs: each of the malisons has been consuming at least one egg per day, and always within sight of one or more of the grippli for no reason other than cruelty.": "这个地方是由四个（%0%）和两个（%1%）（任何类型）控制的。他们允许少量的格里普利照看这些蛋，这就是为什么自从蛇妖到来后，这些蛋还没有全部死亡。这种允许可能是一种仁慈的行为，也可能只是因为元老们喜欢吃蛋：每只恶灵每天至少要吃一个蛋，而且总是在一个或多个格里普利的视线范围内，除了残忍之外没有其他原因。",
	"All six yuan-ti are languishing on the ground between the pools and don't react until at least one of them becomes aware of the characters. If one of the malisons remains alive after 3 rounds of combat, it pours a vial of poison into the water of one pool, which kills all the eggs in it. On each succeeding round, if the characters don't prevent it, the same creature moves to poison a different pool until it is vanquished or until all the eggs have perished.": "所有六个元宝都在水池之间的地面上慵懒地躺着，直到至少有一个元宝意识到人物的存在才会有反应。如果其中一个恶鬼在3轮战斗后仍然活着，它就会向一个池子的水里倒入一小瓶毒药，从而杀死池子里的所有卵。在接下来的每一轮中，如果角色们没有阻止它，同一个生物就会移动到另一个池子里投毒，直到它被消灭或者所有的蛋都死掉为止。",
	"The simple domes of the grippli's residences and storage buildings are spread haphazardly around the marsh. Mud-brick with wicker roofs, they're modest affairs, primitively decorated with giant crab claws. Most are empty and show signs of abandonment.": "格里普利人的住宅和仓库的简单穹顶杂乱无章地分布在沼泽周围。泥砖和柳条屋顶，它们是简朴的事务，用巨大的蟹爪进行原始的装饰。大多数是空的，有被遗弃的迹象。",
	"Most of the village is made up of homes and storage facilities. The community is all but vacant at the present time, so there's nothing the characters can learn by examining any of the buildings.": "村庄的大部分是由住宅和仓储设施组成的。目前，这个社区几乎是空置的，所以通过检查任何建筑物，人物都无法了解。",
	"Under normal circumstances, groups of bonded grippli live in each home, which consists of a single medium to large room, lit with simple fish oil lamps. Grippli don't sleep in the water, but in soft hammocks suspended over it. Their personal effects are secured to the walls above the water in netting. Furniture is of simple but well-crafted wood, or adapted driftwood. Some homes have ceramic and glass jars (obtained through barter) and bronze pots and pans (likewise), used on occasions when the grippli want to cook something before eating it.": "在正常情况下，成群结队的格里普利人生活在每个家庭中，这些家庭由一个大中型房间组成，用简单的鱼油灯照明。格里普利人不睡在水中，而是睡在悬挂在水面上的柔软吊床上。他们的个人物品用网兜固定在水面上的墙上。家具是简单但制作精良的木材，或经过改造的浮木。一些家庭有陶瓷和玻璃罐子（通过易货贸易获得）和青铜锅碗瓢盆（同样），当格里普利人想在吃东西之前做饭时使用。",
	"Storage huts sit on stilts that keep their thatch floors from getting wet and thus protect the materials stored there from deterioration. Wood and other marsh vegetation used in construction are left here to dry out.": "储藏室坐落在高跷上，使其茅草地板不被弄湿，从而保护储存在那里的材料不被损坏。建筑中使用的木材和其他沼泽植物被放在这里晾晒。",
	"Following the river leads the characters northeast through the Cloakwood. The characters should realize that this is the route to the grippli's old village, which they have heard about from Pond Mother and perhaps also from the yuan-ti captives.": "沿着河边走，人物向东北方向走，穿过斗篷林。角色们应该意识到这是通往格里普利老村的路线，他们从池塘之母那里听说过这个村子，也许也从元蒂俘虏那里听说过。",
	"The old village was abandoned when the grippli realized they would fare better being closer to the water. They relocated to where the village now stands. The only structure left in the old village is the temple—now the site of activity once again.": "当格里普利人意识到他们在靠近水的地方会有更好的发展时，老村就被抛弃了。他们搬到了现在村子的位置。老村子里唯一留下的建筑是寺庙--现在又成了活动的场所。",
	"Before the evil yuan-ti arrived, the followers of the Scaled Mother had begun to excavate the temple ruins, hoping to find evidence of their benevolent deity. The work is continuing under the rule of the evil serpentfolk, but it's slow going. Several grippli have been forced to continue digging the place out, while their masters stay inside the part that has already been opened up. It's here that preparations are being made for the sacrifice of the yuan-ti's prisoners.": "在邪恶的元帝到来之前，鳞甲之母的追随者已经开始挖掘寺庙遗址，希望能找到他们仁慈的神灵的证据。在邪恶的蛇妖的统治下，这项工作正在继续，但进展缓慢。几个格里普利人被迫继续挖掘这个地方，而他们的主人则留在已经被打开的部分里面。正是在这里，正在为牺牲元帝的囚犯做准备。",
	"When the characters approach the temple, they won't be able to escape the notice of the grippli prisoners. But the frogfolk know enough to remain silent in the face of potential rescue, and they use hand signals to direct the characters toward the courtyard. From there, the characters can approach the upper court ({@area area T2|26c|x}), where the prisoners are.": "当人物接近寺庙时，他们将无法逃脱格里普利囚犯的注意。但蛙人知道，面对潜在的救援，他们足以保持沉默，他们用手势指引人物走向院子。在那里，人物可以接近上院（{@area area T2|26c|x}），即囚犯所在的地方。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the temple.": "以下地点是以寺庙的地图为关键。",
	"At the top of a short set of steps lies an open area enclosed by a ten-foot-high outer wall and paved with tightly fitted stone slabs. To either side are truncated ramps that lead down to a lower area, still blocked with earth and rubble that needs to be cleared away. Ahead of you, some fifty feet away, is another short staircase that leads to a ten-foot-high inner wall with a door-sized opening in it that's covered by a curtain. Coming from beyond the doorway inside the enclosed area, you can hear the groaning and plaintive cries of creatures being mistreated.": "在一个短小的台阶的顶端，是一个由十英尺高的外墙围起来的空地，上面铺着严丝合缝的石板。两边是截断的坡道，通向较低的区域，仍然被需要清理的泥土和瓦砾堵住。在你前面，大约五十英尺远，是另一个短的楼梯，通向一个十英尺高的内墙，墙上有一个门大小的开口，被帘子遮住。从封闭区域内的门洞外传来，你可以听到生物被虐待的呻吟和凄厉的叫声。",
	"The temple's courtyard can serve as a staging area for the characters, whose presence will not be noticed by the yuan-ti as long as they remain here. Any grippli in the courtyard when the characters arrive will make a hasty but silent retreat to places of safety outside the temple.": "寺庙的院子可以作为人物的集结地，只要他们留在这里，元老们就不会注意到他们的存在。当人物到达时，院子里的任何格里普利都会匆忙但无声地撤退到寺庙外的安全地点。",
	"The upper court of the temple has been completely cleared of debris. Six pillars support the ten-foot-high ceiling, and the northern half of the enclosed area is bathed in bright light, making it easy for you to see the horrific scene playing out in the far end of the room.": "寺庙的上院已经被完全清除了碎片。六根柱子支撑着十英尺高的天花板，封闭区域的北半部沐浴在明亮的光线下，使你很容易看到房间远端上演的恐怖场景。",
	"The following events are unfolding as the party enters. Lashed to a makeshift altar are two neutral good yuan-ti, a {@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||type 1 yuan-ti malison} named Maaz and a {@creature yuan-ti pureblood} named Vorsa. They are being tortured by an evil {@creature yuan-ti abomination} that is presiding over a ritual. An enormous sarcophagus rests behind them, its exterior carved with serpents. Two {@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||yuan-ti malisons}, a {@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||type 1} and a {@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 3)||type 3}, are positioned on either side of it. Both are evil. One carries a lantern that is the source of the illumination, and the other one is holding up a chime and preparing to strike it. As the characters take in the scene, the abomination is studying the script on the sarcophagus intently, engrossed in what it sees. At a gesture from the abomination, the chime is struck. As it rings out, the seam around the lid of the sarcophagus glows brightly for an instant. Then the sarcophagus comes open partway, and the bound prisoners howl in agony.": "队伍进入时，以下事件正在发生。在一个临时的祭坛上绑着两个中立的好元老，一个叫马兹（%0%），一个叫沃萨（%1%）。他们正被一个主持仪式的邪恶（%2%）折磨着。一个巨大的石棺就在他们身后，石棺的外表雕刻着蛇。两个{@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||yuan-ti malisons}，一个{@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 1)||type 1}和一个{@creature Yuan-ti Malison (Type 3)||type 3}，被放置在石棺的两侧。两人都是邪恶的。一个提着灯笼，是照明的来源，另一个则举着风铃，准备敲打它。当这些人物看到这一幕时，憎恶正在仔细研究石棺上的文字，全神贯注于它所看到的一切。在憎恶的一个手势下，风铃被敲响了。随着钟声的响起，石棺盖子周围的缝隙瞬间发出了亮光。然后石棺打开了一部分，被捆绑的囚犯发出痛苦的嚎叫。",
	"Even after the evil yuan-ti notice the characters, their first priority is to complete the ritual, which opens the lid of the sarcophagus and kills the prisoners. With fast action and accurate attacks, the characters can interrupt the ritual and prevent further harm to the victims. The abomination must use two of its turns to finish performing the ritual, which climaxes with one more sounding of the chime as the lid is thrown open. If the abomination takes any damage before completing the ritual, it stops what it's doing and turns its attention to the interlopers and attacks them, ordering the malisons to join the fight.": "即使在邪恶的元帝注意到这些人物后，他们的首要任务是完成仪式，打开石棺的盖子，杀死囚犯。通过快速的行动和准确的攻击，人物可以打断仪式，防止受害者受到进一步伤害。憎恶必须用它的两个回合来完成仪式，当石棺的盖子被推开时，钟声再次响起，将仪式推向高潮。如果憎恶在完成仪式之前受到任何伤害，它就会停止它正在做的事情，并把注意力转移到干扰者身上，攻击他们，命令恶灵们加入战斗。",
	"The objects used by the malisons are a {@item chime of opening} and a {@item lantern of revealing} (which they use as a precaution against {@condition invisible} enemies). After the malison strikes the chime for the first time, the item has 5 uses left. The lantern has 2 hours of fuel remaining.": "马利森使用的物品是一个{@item chime of opening}和一个{@item lantern of revealing}(他们用它来预防{@condition invisible}的敌人)。在马利森第一次敲响钟声后，该物品还剩5次使用。灯笼还有2小时的燃料。",
	"Assuming the characters interrupted the ritual, the lid of the sarcophagus is only slightly open, and the chime must be struck once more to open the lid fully. Inside the sarcophagus are two items of great significance to the yuan-ti: a suit of {@item serpent scale armor|CM} and a {@item serpent's fang|CM} (both described below).": "假设这些人物中断了仪式，石棺的盖子只是稍微打开，必须再敲一次钟才能完全打开盖子。石棺内有两件对元帝意义重大的物品：一套{@item serpent scale armor|CM}和一套{@item serpent's fang|CM}的衣服（都在下面介绍）。",
	"This suit of magic armor is made from shimmering scales. While wearing it, you can apply your full Dexterity modifier (instead of a maximum of +2) when determining your Armor Class. In addition, this armor does not impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks.": "这套魔法盔甲是由闪闪发光的鳞片制成。穿着它时，你可以在确定你的护甲等级时应用你全部的灵巧修正值（而不是最大的+2）。此外，这件盔甲不会对你的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查造成不利。",
	"This single-edged magic sword is made from the scrimshawed fang of a giant serpent. Its hilt changes shape to adjust to the grasp of any creature that picks it up. The weapon deals an extra {@dice 1d10} poison damage to any target it hits.": "这把单刃魔剑是由一条巨蛇的皱纹獠牙制成。它的剑柄会改变形状，以适应任何拿起它的生物的抓握。该武器对其击中的任何目标造成额外的（%0%）毒药伤害。",
	"When the abomination and its malison minions fall, the captured yuan-ti are overcome with joy. They tell the characters that they hail from a land to the south called Chult. They were called into service by the deity they know as the Scaled Mother and followed her portents as they traveled north. They began excavating the old temple, with the grippli's consent, in the expectation of finding relics left behind by the yuan-ti that raided through this area in ages past. They were unable to open the lid of the sarcophagus once they unearthed it and were in the process of clearing rubble from the courtyard stairs when the evil yuan-ti descended on the village and captured all the followers of the Scaled Mother.": "当憎恶和它的马利森爪牙倒下时，被俘虏的元老们都高兴得不得了。他们告诉这些人物，他们来自南方一个叫Chult的地方。他们被称为 \"鳞甲之母 \"的神灵召唤，跟随她的预兆向北行进。在格里普利的同意下，他们开始挖掘古老的寺庙，希望能找到过去在这一地区袭击的元老们留下的遗物。他们一出土就无法打开石棺的盖子，正在清理院子里楼梯上的碎石时，邪恶的元帝降临到村子里，抓走了所有鳞甲母亲的信徒。",
	"With the threat to the area neutralized, it doesn't take long for things to return to normal. When the grippli prisoners realize that the characters have persevered, they waste no time getting the news to the village and the trading post. The refugees return home, and within a tenday the frogfolk have repaired any damage to the crab pens and are back in business.": "随着该地区的威胁被解除，事情很快就恢复了正常。当格里普利囚犯意识到这些人物已经坚持了下来，他们毫不犹豫地将消息传给了村子和贸易站。难民们回家了，在一个星期内，蛙人已经修复了对蟹栏的损坏，并重新开始营业。",
	"The benevolent yuan-ti, once they recover from their wounds, might decide to continue digging out the temple or to return to their homeland, as you see fit. If the excavation goes on, you can populate the lower level of the temple with treasures or traps at your discretion.": "仁慈的元老们一旦从伤痛中恢复过来，可能会决定继续挖掘寺庙，或者返回他们的故乡，就看你的意思了。如果继续挖掘，你可以酌情在寺庙的下层填充宝物或陷阱。",
	"If the characters journeyed by land and went directly to the temple after spending little or no time in the village, the now-freed grippli prisoners explain that other evil yuan-ti are stationed in the village, and they too need to be dispensed with before the grippli can reclaim their homes.": "如果人物从陆路出发，在村子里花了很少或没有花时间就直接去了寺庙，那么现在获得自由的格里普利囚犯就会解释说，村子里还有其他邪恶的元老驻扎，在格里普利人收回家园之前，他们也需要被打发掉。",
	"Having done what they came to do, the characters are free to take their leave of the grippli anytime; once regular traffic resumes between the trading post and Candlekeep, the heroes have no trouble finding a ship that will carry them back to the library.": "做完了他们要做的事，人物可以随时离开格里普利；一旦贸易站和烛台镇之间的交通恢复正常，英雄们不难找到一艘能载他们返回图书馆的船。",
	"In the meantime, if the characters prevented one or more eggs in the brood pools from being killed, the returning grippli are so ecstatic that Pond Mother offers to perform a ceremony for the party's benefit, called the ritual of friend marking. If they agree, they are brought to the pool in the center of Pond Mother's home at midnight. The grippli, croaking sonorously, surround the characters while they stand in the warm water and Pond Mother pours the contents of a jar into the pool. The liquid swirls, and motes of light begin rising up around the characters. Any party members who have second thoughts at this point can avoid the effect by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Party members who don't resist, or who fail their saves, fall into a trance until dawn—when they come to their senses, completely rested and healed. All party members who completed the ritual can speak and understand the Grippli language from now on.": "同时，如果人物阻止了育儿池中的一个或多个蛋被杀死，返回的格里普利就会欣喜若狂，池塘之母就会提出为当事人举行一个仪式，称为朋友标记仪式。如果他们同意，他们就会在午夜被带到池塘母亲家中心的水池。当他们站在温暖的水中时，池塘妈妈把罐子里的东西倒进池子里，格里普利呱呱地叫着，围绕着这些人物。液体旋转起来，人物周围开始升起光斑。任何在这个时候有其他想法的党员都可以通过DC15智慧救赎成功来避免这个效果。没有抵抗的党员或拯救失败的党员会陷入恍惚状态，直到黎明--那时他们会清醒过来，完全休息并痊愈。所有完成仪式的成员从现在开始可以说并理解格里普利语。",
	"At first glance or from a distance, a grippli looks like a large frog. Its head and body are indeed those of a frog, but its front extremities end in hands with fingers that enable it to manipulate weapons and other objects, and its rear legs have similar digits that it can use for grasping and climbing. A grippli can move as quickly on all fours as it can on two legs.": "乍一看或从远处看，格里普利看起来像一只大青蛙。它的头和身体确实是青蛙的，但它的前肢末端是带有手指的手，使它能够操纵武器和其他物体，它的后腿也有类似的手指，可以用来抓取和攀爬。格里普利人用四肢移动的速度和用两条腿移动的速度一样快。",
	"Grippli rely on ambushes and guerrilla warfare to defend themselves and their settlements. They can snare foes with their tongues to make them easier targets. Grippli villages are generally built from mud bricks and other natural materials harvested from the immediate vicinity.": "格里普利人依靠伏击和游击战来保卫自己和他们的定居点。他们可以用舌头钩住敌人，使他们更容易成为目标。格里普利人的村庄一般由泥砖和其他从附近收获的天然材料建成。",
	"Young grippli are raised by the community rather than by a single set of parents, and all of a community's eggs are kept in freshwater pools until they mature. Protecting their eggs is a major concern for grippli, since lizardfolk, yuan-ti, and other creatures are known to have a taste for them.": "小灰鼠由社区抚养，而不是由一对父母抚养，一个社区的所有鸡蛋都保存在淡水池中，直到它们成熟。保护它们的蛋是格里普利的主要关注点，因为蜥蜴人、元宝和其他生物都对它们有兴趣。",
	"Most grippli care more about survival than they do about abstract ideals such as good and evil. Grippli religion is based in animism and nature spirits; the frogfolk do not pay reverence to a single deity, but they might beseech a particular nature spirit for aid from time to time.": "大多数格里普利人更关心生存，而不是抽象的理想，如善与恶。格里普利人的宗教是基于万物有灵论和自然之灵；蛙人并不崇尚单一的神灵，但他们可能会不时地祈求某个自然之灵的帮助。",
	"In this adventure, the characters are caught up in an unsolved mass killing in the city of Waterdeep—after the ghost of one of the victims seeks them out.": "在这次冒险中，角色们被卷入了沃特迪普市的一场未解决的大屠杀中--在其中一个受害者的鬼魂找到他们之后。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} came to Candlekeep five years ago, courtesy of a Waterdavian apprentice mage named Sirok, who bought the book at a street sale. It was part of a collection once owned by the renowned Yellowcrest family of Waterdeep. As he presented the book as payment for entry into Candlekeep, Sirok told the Avowed priests a grim story of how the patriarch of the family, Lord Yellowcrest, had returned to Waterdeep from a business trip to find his wife, their three children, and the house's four servants all murdered. In the aftermath of this terrible loss, the grieving lord sold all his possessions, then moved away from the city to live out his life in solitude.": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}五年前来到烛龙镇，由一位名叫西洛克的瓦特达维亚法师学徒提供，他在一次街头拍卖会上买下这本书。这本书是水底世界著名的黄冠家族曾经拥有的收藏品的一部分。当他把这本书作为进入烛台镇的报酬时，西罗克告诉了神甫们一个残酷的故事：家族的族长，黄冠勋爵，从一次商务旅行中回到沃特德，发现他的妻子，他们的三个孩子，以及家里的四个仆人都被谋杀了。在这一可怕的损失之后，这位悲伤的领主卖掉了他所有的财产，然后搬离城市，在孤独中度过他的一生。",
	"Sirok never got around to reading the book, and his story about the Yellowcrests was something he learned from gossiping acquaintances. The dark pedigree of Sirok's donation was soon forgotten, and {@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} was cataloged and placed into the library's archives, where it has gone unnoticed ever since.": "西罗克从未读过这本书，他关于黄冠的故事是他从八卦的熟人那里得知的。西罗克捐赠的黑暗血统很快就被遗忘了，{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}被编入图书馆的档案中，从此无人问津。",
	"The adventure begins when the ghost of a young woman named Sarah appears before the characters as they peruse the stacks of Candlekeep. The reason that Sarah's ghost is able to manifest for the first time to the characters, after five years of silence, is left to your judgment. The spirit of the murdered woman might be drawn to a character who is dedicated to law or good, one whose background features a similar tragedy, or one who struggled to rise from poverty as she did. Alternatively, if one of the characters has a penchant for reading books from Candlekeep's shelves at random, you might have Sarah appear because her story is being read for the first time since her diary came to the library.": "冒险开始时，一个名叫莎拉的年轻女子的鬼魂出现在人物面前，因为他们正在浏览烛台的书堆。莎拉的鬼魂在沉寂了五年之后第一次出现在人物面前，其原因由你来判断。这个被谋杀的女人的灵魂可能会被一个致力于法律或正义的人物所吸引，一个背景具有类似悲剧的人物，或者一个像她一样从贫困中挣扎出来的人。另外，如果其中一个角色有随机阅读烛光之城书架上书籍的癖好，你可以让莎拉出现，因为自从她的日记来到图书馆之后，她的故事第一次被阅读。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} is a nondescript general text, so it fits best in some forgotten corner of the library where tomes of no particular interest are stored.

The mist suddenly coalesces into the vague form of a young woman—a translucent spirit wearing a servant's uniform and bearing the symbol of a tree outlined by a rising sun at her shoulder.": "你周围的空气突然变得寒冷起来。一团水汽开始沿着附近的书架闪烁，在一本不伦不类的皮装书周围越来越浓。雾气突然凝聚成一个年轻女人的模糊形态--一个穿着仆人制服的半透明的灵魂，肩上有一个由旭日勾勒的树的标志。",
	"The figure weeps aloud, tears running down her cheeks. She opens her mouth as if to speak—which reveals that her tongue is gone. Moaning in anguish, she reaches toward you. Then the mist shreds away to nothing, and the spirit fades.": "这个人物大声哭泣，泪水顺着她的脸颊流下。她张开嘴，似乎要说话--这表明她的舌头已经消失。她痛苦地呻吟着，向你伸手。然后，雾气被撕碎，化为乌有，灵魂消逝。",
	"{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} is a leather-bound book with brass corner fittings and an intricately carved brass clasp that holds the book shut.

	"The book's title appears handwritten on the first page, and it is clear that all of its pages were once blank. Only a handful of pages at the end of the book remain so. The rest are filled with handwriting that starts out crude but slowly becomes more elegant, hinting that it was produced by a person learning to write, who then practiced their writing by keeping a diary.": "这本书的标题出现在第一页上，很明显，它的所有页面曾经是空白的。只有书末的少数几页仍是如此。其余的都是笔迹，开始时很粗糙，但慢慢地变得更优雅，暗示它是由一个学习写作的人写的，然后通过写日记来练习写作。",
	"The pages of {@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor} are a mixture of exercises, drawings, and reminiscences. The earliest pages bear nothing but repetitions of the name \"Sarah.\" Lists of household chores, pending activities, shopping lists, and names take up a full third of the book.": "{@i Sarah of Yellowcrest Manor}的书页是练习、绘画和回忆的混合物。最早的几页除了重复 \"Sarah \"这个名字外没有其他内容。家务、待办事项、购物清单和名字的清单占了整本书的三分之一。",
	"Where the diary begins, the book becomes a firsthand account (written in Common) of the life of Sarah, who describes herself as a servant in the Waterdeep manor of Lord Viallis Yellowcrest and Lady Maria Yellowcrest. The diary entries are not on consecutive pages, and most are undated. In addition to writing about her daily obligations and life in the manor, Sarah also wrote about Lady Maria, who came from a poor family and empathized with Sarah's own lack of education. Lady Maria's genuine affection for Sarah led her to teach the young servant to write, and to give her the leather-bound book that became the diary.": "在日记开始的地方，这本书变成了莎拉生活的第一手资料（用普通话书写），她描述自己是维阿里斯-黄冠勋爵和玛丽亚-黄冠夫人的沃特德普庄园的仆人。日记中的条目并不在连续的页面上，而且大多数都没有日期。除了写她的日常义务和庄园里的生活外，莎拉还写了关于玛丽亚夫人的故事，她来自一个贫穷的家庭，对莎拉自己缺乏教育感同身受。玛丽亚夫人对莎拉的真挚感情使她教这个年轻的仆人写作，并送给她那本成为日记的皮装书。",
	"The last entries of the diary, dated just over five years earlier, change in tone as Sarah worries about the strange conduct of Lord Yellowcrest, and his habit of spending too much time with ancient books in his study. The final diary entry reads:": "日记的最后几条，日期是五年多以前，语气发生了变化，莎拉担心黄克雷斯特勋爵的奇怪行为，以及他在书房里花太多时间接触古书的习惯。最后一篇日记是这样写的",
	"I stole close to Lord Viallis today, and saw that he had chalked a circle marked with strange runes across the floor of his study. A puddle spread within the circle and appeared to me as bubbling blood. Lord Viallis stood next to it motionless, one of his vile books in hand, and muttered something I could not hear. I slipped away quickly, though I fear he might have heard me this time. I have never been so scared, but I must tell Lady Maria what I have seen. I must!": "我今天偷溜到维阿里斯大人身边，看到他在书房的地板上用粉笔画了一个标有奇怪符文的圈。一个水坑在圈内蔓延，在我看来是冒泡的血。维阿利斯勋爵一动不动地站在旁边，手里拿着他的一本卑鄙的书，嘴里嘟囔着什么，我听不见。我迅速地溜走了，尽管我担心他这次可能会听到我。我从来没有这么害怕过，但我必须告诉玛丽亚女士我所看到的一切。我一定要!",
	"In her diary, Sarah tried to draw the image of the cover of an old tome Lord Viallis was reading. The sketch shows a monstrous creature with a bulbous head, long arms, tentacles for legs, and multifaceted eyes (see \"{@area Lord Viallis's Tome|283|x}\" later in the adventure for more information).": "在她的日记中，莎拉试图画出维阿里斯勋爵正在阅读的一本旧书的封面形象。草图显示的是一个有着球形脑袋、长长的手臂、触手做腿、多面眼的怪物（更多信息见冒险故事后面的\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"Sarah also attempted to sketch what she remembered of the rune-marked circle. Any character who has proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check recognizes the circle as part of a ritual casting of the {@spell contact other plane} spell, and can intuit that the runes Sarah has hastily copied are tied to an entity from the Outer Planes. Characters who do not recognize the circle can seek assistance from one of the Avowed to determine this information.": "莎拉还试图勾勒出她所记得的那个符文标记的圆圈。任何精通{@skill Arcana}技能并成功通过DC15智力({@skill Arcana})检查的角色都能认出这个圆圈是{@spell contact other plane}法术仪式的一部分，并能凭直觉判断出莎拉匆忙复制的符文与外星的一个实体有关。不认识这个圆圈的角色可以向一位神通者寻求帮助来确定这一信息。",
	"A thorough reading of the diary reveals the broad details of the lives of Sarah and the Yellowcrest family. Alternatively, if the characters call Sarah back (see below) and are able to communicate with her, you can allow the poor servant's spirit to reveal some of this information:": "彻底阅读日记可以发现莎拉和Yellowcrest家族生活的大致细节。另外，如果人物把莎拉叫回来（见下文）并能与她交流，你可以让这个可怜的仆人的灵魂透露一些信息。",

The cultists, overconfident after years of having their operations ignored, have set no guards protecting access to what lies below.": "搜索现场的人物可以看到，在塔内，一个石阶通向黑暗。在多年来他们的行动被忽视后，邪教分子过于自信，没有设置任何警卫来保护进入下面的东西。",

Another door stands along the west wall, and the wall opposite that appears to have collapsed, revealing a rough passageway beyond.": "楼梯下降了30英尺，然后通向一个由加工过的石头组成的房间。入口两侧有两个火炉，燃烧着非自然的海蓝色的光。柱子站成两排，每根柱子上都雕刻着其他世界的生物的面孔。一个喷泉在房间的远端静静地流淌，在一扇双门前。另一扇门沿西墙而立，对面的墙似乎已经倒塌，露出了外面的一条粗糙的通道。",
	"Two {@creature Grell||grells} and four {@creature Cultist||cultists} stand guard in this chamber.

	"The fountain holds crystal-clear water and has a silver cup sitting on its edge. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of divination magic in the water, one sip of which bestows the effect of the {@spell guidance} cantrip.

Water taken from the fountain loses its magic after 10 minutes.": "这座喷泉盛着晶莹剔透的水，边上放着一个银杯。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了水中的占卜魔法光环，喝一口就能获得{@spell guidance}的咒语效果。获得这种好处的生物在下一个黎明前不能再这样做。从喷泉中抽取的水在10分钟后会失去魔力。",

It was later added to Ecamane's personal library, where it collected dust long after Ecamane's death in 712 DR. Eventually, the book made its way into the hands of a young and eager traveling monk, Ulraunt. He thought that the book would be an appropriate offering for his entrance into Candlekeep, and right he was. After being accepted, the book was stored in the library's archives.

	"After the characters open and \"enter\" the book, their literal path through the demiplane is dictated by the story that Ecamane Truesilver penned long ago.

	"The story takes the characters generally northward through several noteworthy locations, each one equivalent to a major section in the book. No map is necessary for the adventurers to get from one place to the next; if they try to deviate from the direction the story takes them, the same barrier of force prevents them from making any progress.": "故事带着人物大致向北穿过几个值得注意的地方，每个地方都相当于书中的一个主要章节。冒险者从一个地方到下一个地方不需要地图；如果他们试图偏离故事带他们的方向，同样的力量屏障会阻止他们取得任何进展。",

	"\"Greetings, big folk. I, Wheeldoli, welcome you to Dewlight and suggest you be on your way.\"": "\"你们好，大伙儿。我，Wheeldoli，欢迎你们来到Dewlight，建议你们上路。\"",
	"Wheeldoli is prepared to turn {@condition invisible} and make himself scarce at the first sign of aggressiveness, but if the characters start by mentioning that they have spoken with Feynor, or if they talk to him about the book they discovered, the sprite becomes friendly and contributes some additional details about their situation.": "Wheeldoli准备转身{@condition invisible}，并在一有攻击性的迹象时就把自己变少，但如果人物一开始就提到他们已经和Feynor谈过，或者他们和他谈起他们发现的书，这个精灵就会变得友好，并提供一些关于他们情况的额外细节。",
	"As a scholar among his kind, Wheeldoli knows about some of the gods revered by the big folk, and he shares his supposition about the nighttime thunderclaps and lightning strikes in the distance. \"Signs of a battle brewing,\" he says. A group of vicious predators have been stalking through the forest of late, and Wheeldoli fears they are disciples of Malar the Beast Lord (see the \"{@area Cult of Malar|2f9|x}\" section later in the adventure). The disturbances to the north, he says, seem to be coming from the vicinity of the Pool of Eternal Spring, a hallowed site associated with a lesser deity known as Lurue the Unicorn. The sprite says he would not be surprised to find that Malar's minions are behind that turn of events as well.": "作为同类中的一个学者，Wheeldoli知道大伙儿崇敬的一些神灵，他也分享了他对夜间雷声和远处闪电的推测。\"他说：\"这是一场战斗酝酿的迹象。一群凶恶的食肉动物最近一直在森林里徘徊，Wheeldoli担心它们是野兽领主Malar的弟子（见冒险后面的\"（%0%）\"部分）。他说，北方的干扰似乎来自永生之泉池附近，那是一个与被称为独角兽Lurue的小神灵有关的神圣场所。精灵说，如果发现马拉尔的爪牙也是这一事件的幕后推手，他将不会感到惊讶。",
	"In conclusion, Wheeldoli injects some urgency into the situation. \"Whatever's happening at the pool is likely to reach its peak on the winter solstice, which is at most a day or two from now.\"": "最后，Wheeldoli为这种情况注入了一些紧迫性。\"无论泳池发生了什么，都可能在冬至日达到顶峰，而冬至日离现在最多也就一两天。\"",
	"When the characters have learned all they can from Wheeldoli, the sprite directs them to a narrow gravel path that skirts the community and then continues northward through the underbrush.": "当人物从Wheeldoli那里了解到所有情况后，精灵将他们引向一条狭窄的砾石路，绕过社区，然后继续向北穿过灌木丛。",
	"\"Hurry along now,\" he says. \"Danger along the way might impede your travel, so there's no time to waste!\"": "\"现在赶紧走，\"他说。\"沿途的危险可能会阻碍你的旅行，所以没有时间可以浪费！\"",
	"The pebbled path leading out of Dewlight soon turns into dirt, and the area on either side of it is sparsely covered with underbrush. After the characters walk for a few more minutes, they discover that the road ahead is covered in large patches of spiderwebs. The webbed path, 20 feet wide and 60 feet long, is {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. A creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or become {@condition restrained} by the webs. A {@condition restrained} creature can use its action to try to escape, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. Each 10-foot square of webbing has AC 10, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.": "通往露光镇外的鹅卵石路很快就变成了泥土，路两边的地方稀稀拉拉地长满了灌木丛。人物又走了几分钟后，发现前面的路被大块的蜘蛛网所覆盖。这条有网的路，宽20英尺，长60英尺，是（%0%）。第一次进入该区域的生物，或在那里开始它的回合，必须在DC12的灵巧救赎上成功，否则就会被网子缠上（%1%）。一个{@condition restrained}的生物可以用它的行动来尝试逃跑，只要成功地进行DC12力量（{@skill Athletics}）或灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查就可以了。每块10英尺的网状物有10点攻击力，15点命中率，易受火灾伤害，对重击、中毒和精神伤害免疫。",
	"Four cowardly {@creature Ettercap||ettercaps} are lurking nearby, waiting for their webs to snag some prey. At the sound of intruders, they scurry into the underbrush and {@action hide}, staying 30 feet away from the webbed path, loosely spread out. The ettercaps are ambush hunters and run from a prolonged fight.": "四个胆小的{@creature Ettercap||ettercaps}潜伏在附近，等待着他们的网来攫取一些猎物。一听到入侵者的声音，它们就窜入灌木丛中，{@action hide}，在离网路30英尺远的地方，松散地散开。埃特卡普是伏击猎手，从长时间的战斗中跑出来。",
	"The characters' path takes them into a densely forested area. By following a break in the trees that sends them north and west, they come upon a sign that this area is inhabited:": "角色们的道路将他们带入一个森林茂密的地区。他们沿着树木的断裂处向北和向西走，发现了一个标志，表明这个地区有人居住。",
	"Gnarled bushes and dead or diseased trees surround a run-down wooden shack. A wisp of smoke rises from a rotted-out hole in the roof that is lined with fungus. South of the shack is a low stone wall that forms the perimeter of a large hole, while east of the building is a larger wooden structure covered with creeping vines.": "虬曲的灌木和死亡或生病的树木围绕着一个破旧的木屋。一缕烟雾从屋顶上一个腐烂的洞里升起，洞里有真菌。棚屋的南面是一堵低矮的石墙，形成了一个大洞的周边，而建筑的东面是一个更大的木制结构，上面覆盖着爬行的藤条。",
	"As you come a bit closer, the sound of voices suddenly emerges from the shack. One occupant cackles wickedly, and two other voices emit muffled whimpers and groans.": "当你走得更近一些时，棚屋里突然传出了声音。一个居住者邪恶地咯咯笑着，另外两个声音发出低沉的呜咽和呻吟声。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the map of the hag's hovel.": "以下地点是以老巫婆的小屋的地图为关键。",
	"The characters might correctly assume that this place is what it looks like: the site of a well (which is now abandoned). If they approach to within 5 feet of the stone wall, they can peer over the 2-foot-high wall into the hole, which is dark, but they don't get an idea of how deep the hole is or what's in it.": "人物可能会正确地认为这个地方就是它的样子：一口井的遗址（现在已经废弃了）。如果他们靠近石墙5英尺以内，他们可以越过2英尺高的墙，看到洞口，里面一片漆黑，但他们不知道这个洞有多深，也不知道里面有什么。",
	"If a character comes up to the stone wall and looks down inside the hole, this activity attracts the attention of a {@creature grick alpha} that uses the place as a lair. The water source at the bottom of the 30-foot-deep hole has long since dried up, making it an ideal place for the grick to lurk when it's not out hunting.": "如果一个角色走到石墙边，往洞里看，这个活动会引起一只（%0%）的注意，它把这里当作巢穴。30英尺深的洞底的水源早已干涸，这使得它在不外出狩猎时成为格力克潜伏的理想场所。",
	"The grick's Stone Camouflage trait prevents the characters from realizing its presence—unless they shine a light source down into the hole or have some other way of seeing the bottom of the pit. If they don't see the grick at the same time it sees them, the monster lurches out of the well to confront its prey. A character who can see into the hole and has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 14 or higher notices the grick before it attacks; any other characters start the encounter surprised.": "格里克的石头伪装特性使角色们无法意识到它的存在--除非他们用光源照到洞里，或者有其他方法看到坑底。如果他们没有在格瑞克看到他们的同时看到它，这个怪物就会冲出井口，与它的猎物对抗。一个能够看到洞口并且被动智慧（（%0%））得分在14分以上的角色会在格力克攻击之前注意到它；其他角色会在遭遇时感到惊讶。",
	"This run-down shack is the occasional home of a {@creature night hag} named Lanedrie Staggersoul. When she spends time on the Material Plane, she enjoys imprisoning and terrorizing denizens of the forest. Her two \"house guests\" at the moment are among the prisoners she has taken most recently.": "这间破旧的小屋是一个名为Lanedrie Staggersoul的（%0%）的人偶尔的家。当她花时间在物质世界的时候，她喜欢监禁和恐吓森林里的居民。目前她的两个 \"客人 \"是她最近抓到的囚犯之一。",
	"The only way into the shack is through the door on the east side. When a character first peers into the room, read:": "进入棚屋的唯一途径是通过东侧的门。当一个角色第一次窥视这个房间时，请阅读。",
	"The inside of the shack is in a terrible state of disrepair. The only contents of note are a ramshackle bed, a scratched-up table, a warped wooden shelf with several containers on it, and a fireplace with wooden spoons and ladles hanging from hooks above it. To your left, two figures are bound and gagged on the floor while a blue-skinned hag looms over them. The captives appear to be dryads.": "棚屋的内部年久失修，非常糟糕。唯一值得注意的东西是一张破烂不堪的床，一张被划伤的桌子，一个扭曲的木头架子，上面放着几个容器，还有一个壁炉，上面的钩子上挂着木勺子和水瓢。在你的左边，有两个人被捆绑着塞在地板上，而一个蓝皮肤的巫婆在他们面前晃悠。这些俘虏似乎是干尸。",
	"The night hag is focused on tormenting her captives and can be taken by surprise if the characters succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) group check. Lanedrie begins by using her claws and spells to teach the interlopers a lesson, but if the characters don't dispose of her promptly, she does not hesitate to cut her losses and uses a {@spell plane shift} spell to leave their company.": "这个夜魔女专注于折磨她的俘虏，如果角色在DC15的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）群体检查中成功，就能出其不意。兰尼德里开始用她的爪子和法术来教训这些闯入者，但如果角色们没有及时处理掉她，她会毫不犹豫地减少损失，用一个{@spell plane shift}法术离开他们的公司。",
	"The two {@creature Dryad||dryads} are named Trekaila and Argentia. If the characters free them from their bonds, the dryads are appropriately grateful. If the characters ask how they got here, they sheepishly explain that the hag caught the two of them and a third dryad named Hanah unawares while they were paying little attention to their surroundings. Trekaila and Argentia are quick to disclose that Hanah was taken away by the hag several hours ago, and they fear that the worst might have happened to her. The dryads tell the characters about seeing the hag return from someplace that lies to the east of the shack and urge them to investigate.": "这两个（%0%）被命名为Trekaila和Argentia。如果人物把他们从束缚中解救出来，干尸们会适当地表示感谢。如果人物问他们是怎么来的，他们会羞涩地解释说，巫婆在他们不注意周围环境的时候抓住了他们两个和第三个叫Hanah的干尸，而他们却没有注意到。Trekaila和Argentia很快透露，Hanah在几个小时前就被巫婆带走了，他们担心她会遭遇最坏的情况。干尸告诉他们看到女巫从棚屋东边的某个地方回来，并敦促他们去调查。",
	"All of Lanedrie's prized possessions are sitting on the shelf. A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check identifies two useful items: a {@item potion of clairvoyance} and a {@item Potion of Greater Healing||potion of healing (greater)}. As figments of the demiplane, these potions vanish when the characters leave if they're not consumed before then.": "兰尼德里的所有珍贵物品都放在架子上。一个角色如果成功地进行了DC12智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查，就会发现两个有用的物品：一个（%2%）和一个（%3%）。作为半位面的产物，这些药水在人物离开时，如果在此之前没有被消耗掉，就会消失。",
	"Tucked in a clearing is a ramshackle structure 15 feet wide and three times as long. If the characters rescued Trekaila and Argentia in area H2 before coming here, the dryads follow closely behind the characters, eager to find their missing dryad companion, Hanah. A door on the west end of the building opens easily, revealing the following:": "在一片空地上有一个宽15英尺、长3倍的破烂建筑。如果角色在来这里之前在H2区救出了Trekaila和Argentia，那么干尸就会紧跟在角色身后，急于寻找他们失踪的干尸同伴Hanah。建筑物西端的一扇门很容易打开，露出下面的东西。",
	"The moment the door is opened, you are met with a cacophony of wild sounds. Clawing and gnashing at the cages that confine them, animals of all sorts screech and holler in every which way, some growling with pent-up aggression, others wincing in pain.": "当门被打开的那一刻，你看到的是一片嘈杂的野性声音。各种各样的动物在笼子里乱抓乱咬，发出尖锐的叫声，有的在咆哮，有的在痛苦地哀嚎。",
	"Eighteen cages, most of them occupied, line the walls of this grotesque menagerie.": "在这个怪诞的动物园里，墙上挂着18个笼子，其中大部分都有人。",
	"The door to each cage is barred on the outside and features a small window through which the characters can see what's inside. Seven of the cages are empty (though their doors are still barred). Ten of them hold single specimens of various animals—a {@creature baboon}, a {@creature hyena}, a {@creature boar}, an {@creature ape}, a {@creature vulture}, a {@creature blood hawk}, an {@creature eagle}, a {@creature giant rat}, a {@creature hawk}, and an {@creature owl}. All of them are weakened from minor wounds and insufficient nourishment, but they are still able to fend for themselves. If the door is opened on an occupied cage, the animal inside immediately bolts (or flies) for freedom, doing what it must to foil any attempts to keep it from escaping.": "每个笼子的门在外面都有栅栏，有一个小窗口，人物可以通过它看到里面的东西。其中七个笼子是空的（尽管它们的门仍有栅栏）。其中10个笼子里放着各种动物的单一标本--一个（%0%）、一个（%1%）、一个（%2%）、一个（%3%）、一个（%4%）、一个（%5%）、一个（%6%）、一个（%7%）、一个（%8%）、一个（%9%）。所有这些人都因为小伤和营养不足而变得虚弱，但他们仍然能够自食其力。如果笼子的门被打开，里面的动物就会立即为自由而奔跑（或飞翔），做它必须做的事来挫败任何阻止它逃跑的企图。",
	"The door of the last cage, in the far southeast corner of the building, has no window. The characters need to open the door to see what's inside:": "最后一个笼子的门，在建筑物的东南角，没有窗户。人物需要打开门才能看到里面的东西。",
	"Curled up on the floor is a dryad. Her arms and legs are bound, and she appears to be unconscious.": "蜷缩在地板上的是一个干尸。她的手脚被捆绑着，似乎已经失去了知觉。",
	"This {@condition unconscious} {@creature dryad} is Hanah. If Trekaila and Argentia are present, they try to rush to Hanah's side and minister to her. Hanah has been reduced to 0 hit points from the hag's rough treatment, but she is stable. If the characters don't administer healing of their own, one of the other dryads casts a {@spell goodberry} spell and force-feeds the berries to Hanah. If she regains even 1 hit point, Hanah becomes conscious.": "这个{@condition unconscious}{@creature dryad}是哈拿。如果特雷凯拉和阿根提亚在场，他们会试着冲到哈娜的身边，为她传道。哈娜在老巫婆的粗暴对待下，命中率降至0，但她很稳定。如果角色们没有自己进行治疗，其他干尸之一会施放一个{@spell goodberry}的法术，将浆果强行喂给哈娜。如果她恢复了哪怕是1点生命值，哈娜就会有意识。",
	"After she gets her bearings, Hanah says she's able to travel. She wants nothing more than to leave this place. Trekaila and Argentia, of course, are in complete agreement. The dryads part company with the characters, heading back toward Polvarth Plateau after wishing the adventurers success in whatever they are trying to do.": "在她确定了方向之后，哈娜说她能够旅行了。她最想做的就是离开这个地方。当然，特雷凯拉和阿根提亚也完全同意。干尸们在祝愿冒险者们成功地完成他们的任务后，就和这些人物分道扬镳，朝波尔瓦特高原走去。",
	"At last, it seems as though you have reached the northern edge of the forest. The trees are fewer and farther between, and a short distance ahead you can see the edge of a body of water. As you come closer, you see it's a wide river running perpendicular to your path. Off to the east, the river runs between two swaths of dense forest. To the west is a well-worn trail that leads through the underbrush and seems to follow the watercourse. On the ground in front of you are the remains of campfires, suggesting that others have used this area as a place to rest.": "最后，你似乎已经到达了森林的北部边缘。树木越来越少，间隔越来越远，在前面不远处，你可以看到一个水体的边缘。当你走近时，你看到它是一条与你的道路垂直的宽阔河流。在东边，河流在两片茂密的森林之间流淌。西边是一条磨得很好的小路，穿过灌木丛，似乎是沿着水道走的。在你前面的地面上有篝火的遗迹，表明其他人曾把这个地区作为休息的地方。",
	"This stop is what it seems: an opportunity for the party to rest before their next confrontation. The characters can finish a long rest (if they choose to do so) without incident. The river water is good to drink, and if the characters have the means, they can fish for their supper.": "这一站就像它看起来的那样：在下一次对抗之前，给党派一个休息的机会。人物可以顺利完成长时间的休息（如果他们选择这样做）。河里的水很好喝，如果人物有办法的话，他们可以钓鱼来吃晚饭。",
	"When the characters are ready to move on, they quickly discover that the story is compelling them to follow the trail heading west. (Turning back is not an option.)": "当人物准备继续前进时，他们很快发现，这个故事正迫使他们沿着小路向西走。(回头是不可能的）。",
	"In the prologue of {@i Lore of Lurue}—not a part of the story that the characters witness or experience—Ecamane Truesilver describes the underlying truth of the situation and identifies the entity responsible for the upheaval of the demiplane.": "在{@i Lore of Lurue}的序言中--不是故事中人物见证或经历的部分--卡曼-特鲁西尔弗描述了情况的基本真相，并指出了对半位面的动荡负责的实体。",
	"The evil creatures waiting to confront the characters at the end of their journey are the bloodthirsty minions of Malar, god of the hunt, also known as the Beast Lord. Malar's goal is to assume dominance over the forest—particularly the area around the Pool of Eternal Spring—and his agents have been hard at work brutally killing animals of all sorts in tribute to their god, then casting the carcasses into the pool.": "等待人物在旅程结束时面对的邪恶生物是猎神马拉尔的嗜血爪牙，他也被称为野兽之王。马拉尔的目标是统治森林--特别是永恒之泉池周围的地区--他的代理人一直在努力工作，残忍地杀害各种动物以向他们的神致敬，然后把尸体扔进池子里。",
	"As the adventurers will discover, this cult of Malar (otherwise nameless) includes several crazed berserkers as well as worgs and werewolves. When the characters arrive on the scene, the cultists' depredations have corrupted the water of the pool, setting the stage for Malar's final act in his campaign of terror.": "冒险家们会发现，这个马拉尔的邪教组织（否则无名）包括几个疯狂的狂暴者以及虫族和狼人。当人物到达现场时，邪教分子的掠夺行为已经腐蚀了池水，为马拉尔在恐怖活动中的最后行动创造了条件。",
	"Malar believes that there is no better way to demonstrate his dominance than by using his cult members to help bring forth a corrupted version of the avatar of Lurue the Unicorn to serve the Beast Lord's ends in his newly claimed domain. It is this effort that the characters must foil if they are to see their role in the story of {@i Lore of Lurue} end happily.": "马拉尔认为，没有比利用他的邪教成员帮助独角兽鲁鲁的堕落化身在他的新领地为兽王服务更好的方式来证明他的统治地位。如果他们想看到自己在{@i Lore of Lurue}故事中的角色愉快地结束，就必须挫败这种努力。",
	"No matter when the characters set out after their rest, the passage of time on the demiplane speeds up or slows down to ensure that night has fallen by the time they reach the next encounter location:": "无论人物在休息后何时出发，半位面的时间流逝都会加快或减慢，以确保在他们到达下一个遭遇地点时夜幕已经降临。",
	"Following the river course enabled you to make good progress for a while by skirting the forest. Now, as the sun dips below the horizon, the river makes a sharp turn to the north away from the trees. From the opposite direction comes a rumble of thunder and a flash of red lightning, vivid against the darkening sky.": "沿着河道，你可以绕过森林，取得一段时间的良好进展。现在，当太阳降到地平线以下时，河流向北急转，远离了树木。从相反的方向传来隆隆的雷声和一道红色的闪电，在渐渐暗淡的天空中显得格外生动。",
	"The thunder and lightning should make it apparent which direction the characters are meant to take. The last leg of their journey takes them south along a wide trail through the forest. After a few minutes of careful travel, they get evidence that they're not alone: from somewhere nearby ahead, they hear gruff voices growling and roaring. It's easy for the characters to sneak toward the sounds for a closer look. The following boxed text corresponds to the campsite shown on the right-hand side of the Pool of Eternal Spring map:": "雷声和闪电应该让人明白人物要走的方向。旅程的最后一段，他们沿着森林中一条宽阔的小路往南走。经过几分钟的小心翼翼的旅行，他们得到了他们并不孤单的证据：从前面的某个地方，他们听到了粗暴的声音在咆哮和怒吼。角色们很容易向声音的方向潜行，以便仔细观察。以下方框内的文字与永生泉池地图右侧的营地相对应。",
	"Six huts circle the perimeter of a clearing. In the center of the open area, a large bonfire burns. Targets made of bones and stuffed animals, as well as dummies made of hides and furs, complete the encampment.": "六座小屋围绕着一片空地的周边。在空地的中央，燃烧着一团大篝火。用骨头和毛绒动物制成的靶子，以及用皮毛制成的假人，使营地更加完整。",
	"A group of vicious-looking warriors are gathered around the fire. They clink together their bone mugs and rip into raw animal flesh with their teeth. Fresh blood drips from their mouths and hands. It seems like a celebration of some sort. Occasionally, between the warriors' cruel laughs, you can hear a cry of \"To the Beast Lord!\"": "一群面目凶恶的战士围着火堆。他们把自己的骨杯碰在一起，用牙齿撕咬生的动物肉。新鲜的血液从他们的嘴里和手上滴落下来。这似乎是某种庆祝活动。偶尔，在战士们残酷的笑声中，你可以听到 \"为兽王干杯！\"的呼喊。",
	"Eight {@creature Berserker||berserkers} of the cult are consuming a pile of animals they have killed as a way of paying tribute to Malar. If they aren't tearing at the meat, they are playing with the dead bodies, kicking them to and fro. Two {@creature Worg||worgs} chained to nearby posts snarl and growl anytime a dead carcass gets close enough.": "八个(%0)的邪教徒正在食用他们杀死的一堆动物，作为向马拉尔致敬的一种方式。如果他们没有撕咬肉，他们就在玩弄尸体，把它们踢来踢去。两个被拴在附近柱子上的{@creature Worg||worgs}，只要有死尸靠近，就会发出咆哮声。",
	"This noisy revelry provides each character with advantage on any Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to get closer to the cult members. If the characters linger too long before acting, one of the worgs picks up their scent and, with a roar, alerts the berserkers to the characters' presence. The berserkers fight to the death until one remains. That warrior tries to retreat to the south, hoping to alert the cult members gathered at the pool (see below).": "这种嘈杂的狂欢为每个角色提供了在任何灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查上的优势，以接近邪教成员。如果角色在行动前逗留太久，其中一只虫子就会闻到他们的气味，并发出一声怒吼，提醒狂暴战士们注意角色的存在。狂暴战士们拼死抵抗，直到剩下一个人。那个战士试图向南撤退，希望能惊动聚集在水池边的邪教成员（见下文）。",
	"After the characters deal with the cultists at the campsite, the way forward is obvious: lightning flashes in the sky every few minutes, seeming to be centered over a place that's within a couple minutes' walk to the south.": "在人物处理完营地里的邪教分子后，前进的道路是显而易见的：天空中每隔几分钟就会有闪电闪过，似乎是以一个地方为中心，向南走几分钟就到了。",
	"In the far distance, the sky is clear, but directly above the pool is a black storm cloud spitting bolts of red lightning. When the characters arrive, standing at the edge of the pool are six wolf-like humanoids, their backs to the characters. With faces raised up in supplication, they chant ominously. Read:": "在远处，天空是晴朗的，但在水池的正上方是一片黑色的风暴云，喷出红色的闪电。当人物到达时，站在池边的是六个狼形人，他们背对着人物。他们抬起脸来祈求，不祥地念叨着。阅读。",
	"You have come upon the Pool of Eternal Spring, or at least what's left of it: its once clear waters are now streaked with red and black impurities. Standing at the edge of the pool is a feral-looking human clad in animal skins. This individual leads five werewolves in chanting \"Water into blood, earth into bones!\"": "你来到了永生之泉池，或者至少是它的遗迹：它曾经清澈的水现在布满了红色和黑色的杂质。站在池边的是一个身着兽皮的野性人类。这个人带领五个狼人高呼 \"水变血，土变骨！\"",
	"In less troubling times, the Pool of Eternal Spring was a little slice of Mount Celestia on earth. Its crystal-clear waters nourished the nearby lands and fostered the most abundant plant and animal life imaginable. The usual pleasant fragrance that wafts from the pool is now replaced by the scent of metal and blood.": "在不那么麻烦的时候，永生泉池是地球上的一小片天山。它晶莹剔透的水滋润着附近的土地，孕育着可以想象到的最丰富的植物和动物生命。从池子里飘出的通常令人愉快的香味现在被金属和血的气味所取代。",
	"The cult of Malar has prepared the pool in anticipation of the winter solstice. By filling the Pool of Eternal Spring with offerings to Malar—creatures of the forest that have been brutally killed and slain, then tossed into the water—the cult has tainted it as a gesture of reverence to their deity. Unbeknownst to them, the arrival of the solstice triggers the final phase of Malar's plan.": "马拉尔邪教为迎接冬至而准备了这个水池。通过在永恒之泉池中填入献给马拉尔的祭品--那些被残忍杀害的森林生物，然后被扔进水里，邪教组织玷污了它，以示对其神灵的敬畏。他们不知道的是，至日的到来触发了马拉尔计划的最后阶段。",
	"The cultists at the edge of the pool are six {@creature Werewolf||werewolves}. Five begin the encounter in hybrid form, and the one leading the chant is in humanoid form. The characters have come on the scene just in time to witness the final stage of the ceremony, which culminates at midnight. Before the characters can do anything to prevent it, a bolt of red lightning splits the sky and strikes the surface of the pool. When the resulting steam cloud dissipates, the {@creature corrupted avatar of Lurue|CM} (see the accompanying stat block) materializes at the edge of the pool—and suddenly, the characters and the cultists have a common enemy (see \"The Corrupted Avatar\" for more information).": "池边的邪教徒有六个（%0%）。五个人以混血儿的形态开始遭遇，而带领吟唱的那个人则是人形的。角色们来到现场时，正好目睹了仪式的最后阶段，该阶段在午夜达到顶峰。在这些人物能够做任何事情来阻止它之前，一道红色的闪电劈开了天空，击中了水池的表面。当产生的蒸汽云消散时，{@creature corrupted avatar of Lurue|CM}（见附带的数据块）出现在池边--突然间，人物和邪教分子有了一个共同的敌人（更多信息见 \"腐败的神通\"）。",
	"If any creature drinks the corrupted water from the pool, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains a randomly determined form of short-term madness (see \"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).": "如果任何生物喝了池子里的腐化水，它必须做一个DC15的魅力拯救动作。拯救失败后，该生物会获得一种随机决定的短期疯狂状态（见\"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness} \"中的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}）。",
	"In normal circumstances, the avatar of Lurue is a breathtaking sight; her silver, stardust-like mane, her shimmering hooves, and her perfectly formed spiral horn elicit awe from even the most hardened souls. As powerful and striking as she is in her true form, she's just as wicked in her alternative state. With necrotic energy twisting and dancing at the tip of her black horn, this corrupted avatar of Lurue is instead a nightmare come to life.": "在正常情况下，鲁鲁的化身是一个令人惊叹的景象；她那银色的、像星尘一样的鬃毛，她那闪闪发光的蹄子，以及她那完美的螺旋角，甚至引起了最顽固的灵魂的敬畏。与她的真实形态一样强大和引人注目，她在另一种状态下也同样邪恶。随着坏死的能量在她黑色的角尖上扭曲和舞动，这个腐朽的卢鲁的化身反而是一个栩栩如生的噩梦。",
	"While tainted by the influence of Malar, the avatar of Lurue carries out the Beast Lord's will: to slaughter anything that dares to cross its path.": "虽然受到马拉尔的影响，但鲁鲁修的化身执行了兽王的意志：屠杀任何敢于越过它的人。",

The avatar prefers a wounded foe over a fresh one, but it also singles out enemies who deal grievous injuries to it and attacks them without mercy.": "当堕落的独角兽出现时，它至少是在一个邪教成员的范围内。如果战斗还没有开始，就掷出主动权。在化身的每个回合，以及使用它的传奇行动时，它都会从它能触及的任何目标中随机攻击一个或多个生物。与新的敌人相比，化身更喜欢受伤的敌人，但它也会挑出那些对它造成严重伤害的敌人，毫不留情地攻击他们。",
	"The cult members, briefly transfixed by the spectacle they have just witnessed, are not immediately hostile, though they defend themselves against characters who threaten or attack them.

	"The lightning bolt from the moon either destroys the corrupted avatar to spare the adventurers from a likely tragic ending, or revives and purifies the slain avatar.

	"A quick search of the room yields four sets of {@item smith's tools|PHB}. Characters who spend 5 minutes exploring the room find a 4-inch-tall mechanical owlbear figurine (750 gp) tucked in the pocket of a leather apron. The key used for winding the figurine sticks out of the owlbear's back. Using an action to wind the figurine causes it to walk in a straight line at a speed of 5 feet for 10 minutes. At the end of every minute of operation, the owlbear changes from walking on all fours to walking on its hind legs. It turns 180 degrees whenever it hits a barrier, reversing its course.": "对房间进行快速搜索，得到四套（%0%）。花5分钟探索房间的人物发现一个4英寸高的机械猫头鹰小雕像（750GP），它被塞在皮围裙的口袋里。用于给小雕像上发条的钥匙从猫头鹰的背部伸出来。使用一个动作给小雕像上发条，可以使它以5英尺的速度直线行走10分钟。在每一分钟的动作结束时，猫头鹰熊会从四肢着地的行走变成用后腿行走。每当它遇到障碍物时，它就会转180度，扭转其路线。",

	"Pulling the lever so that it angles away from the door causes valves to open at the bottom of the well, draining it in 1 minute.

If they fail to do that, you must determine when the launch occurs based on your estimation of how much time has elapsed since the earthquake. If the characters take a short rest or otherwise waste time, the Barn Door launches at the end of the 60-minute countdown. When that happens, the entire tower flies into the sky, soaring along its preset trajectory. It leaves behind a cloud of smoke large enough to engulf the entire Inner Ward of Candlekeep (treat the area as heavily obscured for 1 minute).

If it reaches space, the tower begins to orbit the planet, as magical wards kick in to provide occupants with artificial gravity and a continuous supply of air and heat.": "如果谷仓门的轨迹被改变到足以阻止它到达外太空，它就会在你选择的一个遥远的地方坠毁并爆炸，对船上的每个生物造成88({@dice 16d10})的重击伤害和56({@dice 16d6})的火焰伤害。如果它到达了太空，塔就会开始绕着行星运行，因为魔法防护装置会启动，为居住者提供人工重力和持续的空气和热量供应。",
	"If the characters were inside the Barn Door for the launch and have come along for the ride, you can decide what measures might allow them to return to the world, from reprogramming the tower's controls and the rocket engines, to having a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell teleportation circle} found amid Stonky's books.

	"If the characters use the lever in {@area area B4|327|x} to delay or shut down the launch, they can continue exploring the tower and its underlevel without fear of the Barn Door launching into space. They can also let the Avowed deal with Stonky and his cultists. The Avowed aren't likely to punish Stonky severely for his transgressions, since there are technically no laws against launching rocket ships in Candlekeep.

	"If any of Stonky's skitterwidgets or their kiddywidget offspring were left to their own devices after the characters' excursion into the Barn Door, those constructs might become a problem for Candlekeep.

For some time, the djinni served the wizard. Hoping to earn his freedom, Gazre-Azam shared much of his knowledge, but the wizard would not release him. When Gazre-Azam changed tactics and became less helpful, {@creature Zikran|CM} cast a complicated and near-permanent spell to keep Gazre-Azam from escaping. The djinni reveals that the only way to free him is for {@creature Zikran|CM} to end the enchantment willingly or for {@creature Zikran|CM} to be killed.

When Vargan is on the cusp of adulthood, the cruel Lord Ephraim Rathmore visits Wisteria Vale, demanding drink, food, and a place for him and his retinue to stay. When the hospitality isn't to his liking, he burns down the village.

The wizard invites Vargan to join the secret organization, and he agrees, becoming a member of the Harpers. With the aid of information from the Harpers, Vargan sneaks into Lord Rathmore's manor during a banquet disguised as a performer and dispatches Rathmore once and for all.

The locals reveal that Quill lives in a manor on the edge of the village, but he hasn't left it recently because he has a very important guest: a beholder that suddenly appeared in Wisteria Vale.

	"The secret to entering the demiplane of Wisteria Vale is hidden in the text of the play. Ryllia tells the characters that there is a line in the final scene that gives a clue to the portal's activation phrase, though she doesn't know the details.

	"A character who makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence check realizes that this line might be more than a metaphor—a puzzle that requires literal interpretation of an aphorism would be just the kind of thing a Harper playwright would enjoy.

Everything in Wisteria Vale is bright and colorful, tailored to keep Quill comfortable and entertained. The weather is always mild and temperate, with just enough rainy days to nurture crops. Wisteria blossoms are always in full bloom amid the verdant greenery.

The villagers are also cold to the touch, which can be ascertained only through physical contact.

He urged them to treat the creature as an honored guest while it was in Wisteria Vale.": "在进一步的交谈中，村民们描述了一个可怕的生物的到来，它似乎是一个巨大的漂浮球体，中央有一只眼睛和锋利的牙齿，有许多小眼睛在柄上。虽然村民们被这个生物吓坏了，但奎尔向他们保证，他会控制住它。他敦促他们，当这个生物在紫藤谷的时候，要把它当作一个尊贵的客人。",
	"In an attempt to make the demiplane as comforting and familiar as possible for Quill, the Harpers designed it to resemble his hometown, down to the buildings, the villagers, and the name.

It serves as a grim reminder of his past.": "{@creature Arrant Quill|CM|Quill}是一个有魅力的吟游诗人，他带着一种安静的自信，并没有暗示他的技能或力量的全部范围。他英俊的五官被一道疤痕所破坏，这道疤痕从他的左颧骨顶部一直延伸到他的下巴，尽管他不认为这道疤痕会毁容。如果被问及这道疤痕，他解释说，多年前，烧毁他家乡的人用匕首割破了他的脸，他就有了这道疤痕。这是对他过去的一个严峻的提醒。",
	"Although outwardly friendly, Quill is driven by three selfish desires: to preserve his well-being, to alleviate his boredom, and to escape Wisteria Vale. He holds a grudge against the Harpers and Ryllia for imprisoning him in a place that reminds him of the people he lost in his childhood, though he also takes some comfort in being able to live out the life he could've had. His time spent alone with his thoughts in Wisteria Vale has led him to suspect that the Harpers were never going to find a cure, and that they were simply biding their time until he became complacent enough that they could kill him without his being a threat.

The door can also be unlocked with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or forced open with a successful DC 25 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "在主神庙的后面矗立着一个不起眼的、上了锁的棚子，里面是通往瓦林圣殿的入口。棚子里随时都有忠实的信徒静静地看着，如果除了希尔-恩德利恩或阿莱西亚-巴塞尔（见瓦林墓的1%）之外，任何人打开门，神庙的法师都会定期对门施以（%0%）的咒语。雪儿和阿莱西亚带着钥匙，可以从里面或外面开锁。使用盗贼的工具，通过DC25的灵巧检查，也可以打开这扇门，或者通过DC25的力量（（%2%））检查，可以强行打开。",
	"The shed holds unused gardening equipment and has a hidden trapdoor that can be found with a successful DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check if not revealed by Shir. Below the trapdoor is a 5-foot-diameter stone-walled well with a sturdy wooden ladder. The well descends 20 feet before opening up into a 40-foot-square chamber whose walls and floor are worked stone. The portal that leads to Valin's sanctum is on the wall opposite the well's ladder.": "棚子里放着闲置的园艺设备，有一个隐藏的活板门，如果没有被雪儿发现，可以通过成功的DC18智慧（（%0%））检查发现。活板门下面是一个直径5英尺的石壁井，有一个坚固的木梯。这口井下降了20英尺，然后通向一个40英尺见方的密室，其墙壁和地板都是加工过的石头。通往瓦林圣殿的入口就在井梯对面的墙上。",
	"The plain gray stone of the wall diffuses into a swirling ellipsoid of blue-and-white light, edged by translucent crystals. From across the room, the portal resembles an enormous eye.": "墙壁上普通的灰色石头扩散成一个蓝白相间的椭圆体，边缘是半透明的水晶。从房间的另一边看去，这个入口就像一只巨大的眼睛。",

	"The presence of the characters' names in {@i The Canopic Being} points to the mummy lord oracle, {@creature Valin Sarnaster|CM}, having seen them in visions of the future. The particulars of that future and the oracle's interest in the characters is left to your determination.": "这些人物的名字出现在{@i The Canopic Being}，说明木乃伊领主神谕{@creature Valin Sarnaster|CM}在未来的幻觉中看到了他们。这个未来的具体细节以及神谕对这些人物的兴趣由你来决定。",
	"Valin has long plotted to usurp the role of Savras, acquiring power through her dark rituals that will enable her to become a new demigod of fate. In her visions, she has seen that the characters will thwart her plans—so she has arranged the events that cause them to come to her, so she can end their threat before it begins. In the course of their fight to expose and destroy Valin, the characters might gain glimpses of the future or hear coded threats from her about the fate she sees for them. Especially if your campaign is built around an epic story line, these oracular insights can help you foreshadow what's to come.": "瓦林长期以来一直阴谋篡夺萨夫拉斯的角色，通过她的黑暗仪式获得权力，使她能够成为新的命运半神。在她的幻觉中，她已经看到这些人物将挫败她的计划--所以她安排了导致他们来找她的事件，这样她就可以在他们的威胁开始之前结束。在他们揭发和摧毁瓦林的过程中，角色们可能会瞥见未来，或听到她对他们的命运发出的编码威胁。特别是如果你的活动是围绕着一条史诗般的故事线展开的，这些神谕式的见解可以帮助你预示未来的事情。",
	"Valin's tomb exists on its own demiplane. The site was once a temple and was long abandoned until the oracle's magic rediscovered it. It is filled with the signs and symbols of Savras, but whether it was built as a temple to the god or whether it was constructed by Savras when he was still a mortal, not even Valin has been able to determine.": "瓦林的坟墓存在于它自己的半位面。这个地方曾经是一座神庙，长期被遗弃，直到神谕的魔法重新发现了它。它充满了萨弗拉斯的标志和符号，但它是否是作为神的庙宇建造的，还是萨弗拉斯在还是凡人的时候建造的，连瓦林都无法确定。",
	"The former temple is built entirely of clear, sparkling crystal. Though the complex has its own gravity and is not fully transparent, moving through it can sometimes create the unsettling sense of floating in space.": "以前的寺庙完全由透明、闪亮的水晶建成。虽然这个建筑群有自己的重力，并不完全透明，但在其中移动有时会产生漂浮在太空中的不安感。",
	"Characters who look outside the temple see the demiplane beyond as a shifting space of glowing crystals. The demiplane does not enter into the adventure, and its full details are left to your determination.": "在神庙外的角色看到的是一个由发光的水晶组成的变化空间的半位面。半位面并没有进入冒险，它的全部细节将由你决定。",
	"If a creature dies after one of its vital organs is replaced by Valin's organs, it can be returned to life by a {@spell wish} spell or in one of the ways described below.": "如果一个生物在它的一个重要器官被瓦林的器官取代后死亡，它可以通过{@spell wish}的法术或以下描述的一种方式来恢复生命。",
	"A ritual known as the rite of reclamation involves claiming some of the dust of Valin's body after she has been reduced to 0 hit points. The ritual describes a process for mixing the dust with wax to create a magic candle, then floating the lit candle in a vessel of holy water. If a creature imbued with one of Valin's organs spends an entire long rest within 5 feet of the candle, the candle is consumed, Valin's organ is destroyed, and the creature's missing organ is restored. The rite of reclamation is known to Valin and detailed on a scroll found in {@area area T5|454|x}. The characters might also be able to learn the ritual through research or a side quest.": "一个被称为开垦仪式的仪式涉及到在瓦林的生命值降至0后索取她身上的一些灰尘。该仪式描述了一个将灰尘与蜡混合以制造魔法蜡烛的过程，然后将点燃的蜡烛漂浮在一个圣水容器中。如果被赋予瓦林的一个器官的生物在蜡烛的5英尺范围内花了一整个漫长的休息时间，蜡烛就会被消耗掉，瓦林的器官就会被摧毁，而该生物所丢失的器官就会被恢复。复原的仪式为瓦林所知，并在{@area area T5|454|x}的卷轴上有详细说明。人物也可能通过研究或副线任务来学习这个仪式。",
	"A more direct restoration can be undertaken if the creature imbued with one of Valin's organs has been killed and the characters have access to the creature's original organ. Removing Valin's organ from the creature's body reveals it to be shriveled, glassy, and pulsing with unnatural life. If the creature's original organ is replaced within 1 hour of its death at the same time Valin's organ is destroyed, the creature returns to life immediately as if targeted by a {@spell resurrection} spell.

	"Three of the creatures that have received Valin's organs—Okuzor, Xemru Thaal, and Zeren Zoradius—have been transformed into canopic golems by the dark rituals the oracle learned from {@i The Canopic Being}.

She thus does not understand that the canopic golems have been created from Valin's visitors.

	"Naive curiosity paired with a lack of conversational practice makes Alessia honest to a fault. She remains unaware of Valin's evil nature—and of the fact that she is the living canopic vessel for Valin's heart. Alessia's own heart was removed three years ago as part of the unique ritual described in {@i The Canopic Being}.

	"If the ritual is not completed, Nintra regains all her hit points and expended spells in 1 hour. During that time, she is immune to damage. If she returns to life, Nintra summons six more shadow glass warriors and sets them on the characters, then tries to flee.": "如果仪式没有完成，Nintra会在1小时内恢复她所有的命中率和消耗的法术。在这段时间内，她对伤害是免疫的。如果她恢复了生命，Nintra会再召唤出六个影子玻璃战士，并让他们对付那些人物，然后试图逃跑。",

He bequeathed these books to Candlekeep and also gifted the Avowed with a series of live storytelling sessions. The longer-lived Avowed remember these performances with fondness and have passed the stories on to the adjutants over the years. One story stands out from all the others, and the Avowed of Candlekeep wonder about it to this day: the tale of the lost golem, featuring the one adventure that Alkazaar could not complete.

The Bedine are discussing what to do with the golem and how they can profit from it. The golem appears inactive, but the party can figure out how to activate the golem from the book. By talking with the Bedine, the adventurers learn about a ruined cave complex known as the Hall of Rainbows that could contain clues to the golem's origin.
