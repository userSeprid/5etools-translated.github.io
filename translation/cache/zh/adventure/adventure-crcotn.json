	"Long ago, a war between gods of good and evil scoured the surface of the world of Exandria. Both the noble Prime Deities and the selfish Betrayer Gods imbued their mortal champions with supernatural gifts that granted them strength enough to challenge their divine foes. The greatest of these champions was Alyxian the Apotheon, who received the blessings of three Prime Deities to save the world from the apocalyptic power of the Betrayer Gods.": "很久以前，一场善恶之神之间的战争席卷了埃克桑德里亚世界的表面。高贵的主神和自私的背叛者诸神都给他们的凡人冠军灌输了超自然的天赋，使他们有足够的力量来挑战他们的神性敌人。这些冠军中最伟大的是阿普斯安，他得到了三位主神的祝福，从背叛者诸神的末日力量中拯救了世界。",
	"Centuries later, all knowledge of this godlike hero has been lost to time, and two groups of adventurers are called upon to retrace this mythic hero's steps and free him from his timeless prison.

	"Xhorhas, on the continent of Wildemount, was once a land dominated by the Betrayer Gods. It was their seat of power during the Calamity, and after their defeat, it was left a war-scarred wasteland prowled by demons. Today, it is a land populated by diverse creatures and people often considered to be monsters by their neighbor, the totalitarian Dwendalian Empire. The dominant political power in Xhorhas is the Kryn Dynasty, founded by drow who fled the Underdark and escaped the fell influence of Lolth the Spider Queen. They have discovered the power of an unusual deity of light and rebirth called the Luxon. The Bright Queen Leylas Kryn leads her people to glory in this blighted land.": "荒野大陆上的Xhorhas，曾经是背叛者之神统治的土地。在灾变期间，这里是他们的权力所在地，在他们被打败后，这里就变成了一片被战争毁坏的荒地，到处是恶魔。今天，它是一个由不同的生物和人居住的土地，通常被他们的邻居，极权主义的德文达尔帝国认为是怪物。Xhorhas的主导政治力量是Kryn王朝，由逃离暗黑世界的乌鸦建立，并躲避蜘蛛女王Lolth的影响。他们发现了一个不寻常的光明和重生的神灵的力量，这个神灵叫做卢克逊。光明女王莱伊拉斯-克莱恩（Leylas Kryn）带领她的人民在这片枯萎的土地上获得荣耀。",
	"Many beings lived in the wastes of Xhorhas before the drow of the Kryn Dynasty escaped the Underdark and built their civilization on the surface. Goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, lizardfolk, kobolds, and countless other beings have banded together under the banner of the Kryn Dynasty—some willingly, others under duress.": "在克莱恩王朝的乌鸦逃离暗黑世界并在地面上建立他们的文明之前，许多生物都生活在霍哈斯的荒野上。哥布林、霍布林、虫人、兽人、蜥蜴人、哥布林，以及无数其他生命在克莱恩王朝的旗帜下联合起来--有些是自愿的，有些则是被胁迫的。",

	"This coastal town in northern Xhorhas is populated mostly by goblins and orcs. A number of drow, many of them politicians and soldiers of the Kryn Dynasty, reside here as well. Tension exists between the people who value the ways of the village elders and those who prioritize the laws of the Kryn Dynasty. The town has a strong cultural tradition of competition, and the local Festival of Merit is the backdrop for {@adventure chapter 1|CRCotN|1} of this adventure.": "这座位于Xhorhas北部的沿海城镇的居民大多是地精和兽人。一些鸦人，其中许多是克里王朝的政治家和士兵，也居住在这里。重视村里长老的方式的人和优先考虑克莱恩王朝法律的人之间存在着紧张关系。该镇有强烈的竞争文化传统，当地的功勋节是这次冒险的背景（%0%）。",
	"The military encampment of Bazzoxan keeps watch over the Betrayers' Rise, a dark temple that was instrumental to the Betrayer Gods during the Calamity. Xhorhasian explorers and settlers built the foundation of a new city around the looming stone structures of the abandoned sanctum—until demonic forces from within the old temple threw the burgeoning society into chaos.": "巴佐桑的军营一直在监视背叛者的崛起，这是一座黑暗的神庙，在灾变期间对背叛者的神灵很有帮助。Xhorhasian探险家和定居者围绕着这个被遗弃的圣殿的隐约的石头结构建立了一个新的城市的基础--直到来自旧神庙内的恶魔力量将这个新兴的社会带入混乱。",
	"As the characters discover in {@adventure chapter 3|CRCotN|3}, Bazzoxan is now locked in a stalemate between the Kryn Dynasty's forces and the demons of the Betrayers' Rise. This unholy site is the subject of constant research and of growing worry for the dynasty.": "正如人物在{@adventure chapter 3|CRCotN|3}中所发现的那样，巴佐桑现在正处于克里恩王朝的军队和背叛者崛起的恶魔之间的僵持状态。这个邪恶的地方是王朝不断研究的对象，也是王朝越来越担心的对象。",
	"The continent of Marquet is scarred by a vast, arid desert, which was created long ago when the Betrayer God known as Gruumsh the Ruiner struck a cataclysmic blow with his spear into Marquet's lush jungles.

	"Beneath Ank'Harel lie the remains of a former Marquesian metropolis. Its true name is lost to time, since nearly all records from before the Calamity were obliterated when Gruumsh destroyed the city. Modern scholars call it Cael Morrow, the Drowned City. The epithet refers to the fact that the ruins are submerged in a vast underground cistern—part of the same body of water that feeds the oasis that gives life to the city.": "在Ank'Harel的下面，有一个前侯赛因大都市的遗迹。它的真实名字已经被时间湮没，因为几乎所有灾难前的记录都在格鲁姆什摧毁该城市时被抹去了。现代学者称其为Cael Morrow，即淹没的城市。这个称谓是指废墟被淹没在一个巨大的地下蓄水池中--这也是滋养绿洲的水体的一部分，而绿洲赋予了这座城市生命。",
	"Hidden within Cael Morrow is a rift to the Netherdeep, which the characters discover in {@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}.": "在Cael Morrow中隐藏着一个通往Netherdeep的裂缝，人物在{@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}中发现了它。",
	"A realm of despair, the Netherdeep was created when the spear of Gruumsh pierced through the Material Plane and into the Elemental Plane of Water.

This location awaits the characters in {@adventure chapter 6|CRCotN|6}.": "一个绝望的领域，Netherdeep是在Gruumsh的长矛刺穿物质界并进入水元素界时产生的。它是一个由无光壕沟组成的星外迷宫，注入了一个半神的扭曲情绪，他既是Netherdeep的囚徒，也是狱卒。这个地方在{@adventure chapter 6|CRCotN|6}中等待着人物。",
	"Two moons hang in the sky of Exandria. One is Catha, a large, pale orb that cycles through its phases once per month. The other is Ruidus, a ghostly vermilion satellite that circles Exandria once every six months.": "埃克桑德里亚的天空中悬挂着两个月亮。一个是卡塔，一个大而苍白的球体，每个月循环一次其阶段。另一个是Ruidus，一个幽灵般的朱红色卫星，每六个月绕艾克桑德里亚一圈。",
	"Catha's brightness is constant, its phases predictable. Conversely, Ruidus exhibits strange behavior, seeming to glow more brightly at times or suddenly casting off its shadow to appear full. The vermilion moon often disappears from the night sky entirely, while at other times it unexpectedly flares with bright, ruddy light.": "Catha的亮度是恒定的，它的阶段是可预测的。相反，Ruidus表现出奇怪的行为，有时似乎会发出更亮的光，或突然投下它的阴影，显得很饱满。朱红色的月亮经常从夜空中完全消失，而在其他时候，它却意外地闪现出明亮的红光。",
	"Though this story presents Ruidus as a subject of superstition and folklore, it intentionally avoids discussing the moon's actual magical power. Any mystical powers that nonplayer characters in this story claim to receive from the vermilion moon are related to Ruidus only so far as people believe them to be. In truth, the powers those characters wield comes from a figure called the Apotheon. The true nature of Ruidus is a topic to be explored in other {@i Critical Role} stories.": "尽管这个故事将Ruidus作为迷信和民间传说的主题，但它有意避免讨论月亮的实际魔力。故事中的非玩家角色声称从朱红色的月亮上获得的任何神秘力量都与Ruidus有关，只是人们认为它们是这样的。事实上，这些角色所拥有的力量来自于一个叫做阿波提翁的人物。Ruidus的真实性质是一个将在其他（%0%）故事中探讨的话题。",
	"Not all people fear Ruidus, but superstitions about it are widespread across Exandria. Some of the more well-known superstitions include the following:": "并非所有的人都害怕Ruidus，但关于它的迷信在整个Exandria广泛存在。一些比较知名的迷信包括以下内容。",
	"Those who are born on a night when Ruidus is full are destined to bring suffering to others or to experience great tragedy in their own lives.": "那些在Ruidus满员的夜晚出生的人，注定要给别人带来痛苦，或者在自己的生活中经历巨大的悲剧。",
	"Those who study Ruidus and become obsessed with its secrets are compelled to cause misfortune and woe.": "那些研究Ruidus并沉迷于其秘密的人，被迫造成不幸和灾难。",
	"Plans made or set in motion when Ruidus is full are doomed to failure, often due to betrayal or miscommunication.": "当Ruidus满员时，所做的计划或启动的计划注定要失败，往往是由于背叛或沟通不畅。",
	"The story at the heart of this adventure begins long ago in an age shrouded in myth and legend, as befits an epic {@i Critical Role} tale.": "这场冒险的核心故事开始于很久以前的一个笼罩在神话和传说中的时代，正如一个史诗般的(%0)故事一样。",
	"During the Founding, a time when the gods still walked the face of Exandria, the world's divine creators discovered an unidentifiable power seeping through the fabric of reality. Legends assert that this alien influence was a threat to all life on Exandria, and the gods banded together to banish it.": "在建国时期，当诸神还在艾克桑德里亚的脸上行走时，这个世界的神圣创造者发现了一种无法识别的力量正在渗入现实的结构。传说中，这种外来的影响对艾克桑德里亚的所有生命都是一种威胁，众神联合起来驱逐了它。",
	"This cancerous incursion of dark power is said to have crystallized into Ruidus, the small, vermilion moon that hangs in the sky along with Catha, the world's natural moon. The gods agreed to create a tale about Ruidus to conceal its alien origin from the mortals of the world, informing them that it was a moon of ill omen, and its magical influence was always to be avoided. This tale concocted by the gods was not a lie, for Ruidus's alien magic twists the fate of those who are born or embark on ventures while bathed in its vermilion light.": "这种黑暗力量的癌细胞入侵据说已经结晶为Ruidus，这颗朱红色的小月亮与世界的自然月亮Catha一起挂在天空中。诸神同意创造一个关于Ruidus的故事，向世界上的凡人隐瞒它的异类起源，告诉他们这是一个不祥的月亮，它的魔法影响总是要避免的。众神编造的这个故事并不是谎言，因为Ruidus的外星魔法扭曲了那些在它的朱红色光芒下出生或开始冒险的人的命运。",
	"Some eons later, a schism rocked the pantheon of Exandria, splitting the divine beings into Betrayer Gods and Prime Deities. The Betrayer Gods strove to ruin and dominate the world, and they battled the Prime Deities in a war called the Calamity.": "几个世纪后，一场分裂震撼了埃克桑德里亚的万神殿，使神灵们分裂为背叛者之神和主神。背叛者诸神努力破坏和统治世界，他们在一场名为 \"灾难 \"的战争中与主神交战。",
	"Near the beginning of this war, a boy named Alyxian was born in the lands of Wildemount, the seat of the Betrayer Gods' power, beneath the full light of Ruidus. He was said to be cursed from birth and was viewed with suspicion by all around him, except for his parents. As a young man, he sought to defy his fate and distinguish himself on the field of battle. Alyxian found himself embroiled in the most vicious battles of the war. He fought selflessly and begged the Prime Deities to help him protect the innocent people caught up in their war. Thrice he asked, and thrice they answered, granting him greater and greater power. He was more than a champion of the gods; he had become the Apotheon—a noble warrior so suffused with divine energy that he was halfway to godhood himself. In those times, he wore a gods-gifted amulet known as the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} as a symbol of his divine covenants.": "在这场战争即将开始的时候，一个名叫Alyxian的男孩出生在Wildemount的土地上，这里是背叛者神力的所在地，在Ruidus的全光之下。据说他一出生就受到了诅咒，除了他的父母，周围的人都对他抱有怀疑。作为一个年轻人，他试图反抗自己的命运，在战场上脱颖而出。Alyxian发现自己被卷入了战争中最恶毒的战斗。他无私地战斗，乞求主神帮助他保护被卷入战争的无辜人民。他三次请求，他们也三次回应，给予他越来越大的权力。他不仅仅是诸神的冠军；他已经成为阿波提翁--一个充满神性能量的高贵的战士，他自己也在成为神的半路上。在那个时代，他戴着一个被称为\"%0%\"的神赐护身符，作为他的神圣盟约的象征。",
	"Eventually, the war brought the Apotheon to the great jungle city now known as Cael Morrow, a utopian domain of elves and orcs. These orcs were the first generation of their kind, who had been transformed by the spilled blood of Gruumsh the Ruiner. Although fear had reigned for a short time after the transformation, the two peoples soon realized they were still kin. The city was the jewel of the lush and verdant continent of Marquet, and its people gave thanks daily to Corellon the Arch Heart for their protection.": "最终，战争把阿波提翁带到了现在被称为Cael Morrow的巨大丛林城市，一个由精灵和兽人组成的乌托邦领域。这些兽人是他们的第一代同类，他们被毁灭者格鲁姆什洒下的鲜血改造了。虽然在改造后的短时间内，恐惧笼罩着这两个民族，但他们很快意识到他们仍然是亲属。这座城市是马奎特大陆上郁郁葱葱的宝石，它的人民每天都在感谢大心脏科里隆对他们的保护。",
	"The Ruiner despised the Arch Heart and swore to annihilate Cael Morrow and all of Marquet with a single stroke of his spear. He strode into the center of the city, smiting all who dared raise a blade against him. When he reached the city's heart, Gruumsh raised his spear to strike the earth with cataclysmic force—but his blow was intercepted by the Apotheon at the last possible second.": "毁灭者鄙视拱心，发誓要用他的长矛一举消灭卡奥-莫罗和整个马尔凯。他大步走进城市的中心，痛击所有敢于对他举刀的人。当他到达城市的中心时，格鲁姆什举起他的长矛，以灾难性的力量击打大地--但他的打击在最后一秒被阿波提翁拦截了。",
	"The Apotheon's intervention kept Gruumsh from annihilating all life on Marquet, but the force of his spear thrust still brought the lands of Marquet to ruin. Fire raged across the lush jungle, turning verdant beauty into blasted desert, and Cael Morrow was shunted deep into the earth. Towers toppled, stone crumbled, and all trace of the great civilization was wiped from the face of Exandria.": "阿普特恩的干预使格鲁姆什没有消灭马尔凯特的所有生命，但他的长矛刺入的力量仍然使马尔凯特的土地遭到破坏。火焰在郁郁葱葱的丛林中肆虐，将青翠的美景变成了被炸毁的沙漠，而卡奥-莫罗也被甩到了地底深处。塔楼倒塌，石头碎裂，伟大文明的所有痕迹都从埃克桑德里亚的脸上抹去了。",
	"In that moment of destruction and death, the Apotheon's connection to Ruidus flared to life. A rift was torn between worlds, in which alien energy from an unknown realm and the waters of Cael Morrow's oasis mingled to produce a lightless realm of water and strange magic. There, in what came to be known as the Netherdeep, the Apotheon has been trapped for untold ages, consumed with sadness, furious over his defeat, and yearning for his freedom.": "在那个毁灭和死亡的时刻，阿波提翁与Ruidus的联系被激发出来。世界之间出现了一道裂缝，来自未知领域的外来能量和Cael Morrow绿洲的水混合在一起，产生了一个无光的水和奇怪的魔法领域。在那里，在后来被称为Netherdeep的地方，Apotheon已经被困了无数个时代，被悲伤所吞噬，对他的失败感到愤怒，并渴望着他的自由。",
	"In time, the immortal Apotheon fell into a long and troubled slumber. In his dreams, the barren caverns of the Netherdeep began to shift. His memories filled the darkness, and a cocoon of melancholy formed around his body. From this Heart of Despair emerged a crimson element that embodied the Apotheon's power. It spread, growing and crystallizing as it moved, until all of the Netherdeep was suffused with its power.": "随着时间的推移，不朽的Apotheon陷入了漫长而不安的沉睡。在他的梦中，Netherdeep的贫瘠洞穴开始转变。他的记忆充满了黑暗，他的身体周围形成了一个忧郁的茧。从这个 \"绝望之心 \"中出现了一个深红色的元素，体现了阿波提翁的力量。它蔓延开来，随着它的移动而成长和结晶，直到整个Netherdeep都被它的力量所充斥。",
	"Centuries have passed since the Calamity, and life has returned to the desert lands of Marquet. A grand city called Ank'Harel has been built around a desert oasis. Little did its founders know that the water of their oasis originated in the Netherdeep, and that beneath the new desert metropolis was an underwater cavern holding the ruined city of Cael Morrow.": "灾难过后，几个世纪过去了，马凯的沙漠土地上又恢复了生机。一座名为Ank'Harel的宏伟城市在沙漠绿洲周围建成。城市的创建者们并不知道，他们的绿洲之水源自尼瑟德普，而在这个新的沙漠大都市下面，有一个水下洞穴，里面有废墟般的凯尔莫罗城。",
	"A new form of conflict entered the story when the Allegiance of Allsight, an influential group of academics in Ank'Harel, discovered a strange mineral in the sunken ruins beneath their city. This substance—a slick, oily stone veined with blood-like streaks—possessed unknown magical properties. The Allegiance tried to keep its discovery secret, but the news soon attracted the attention of a rival faction.": "一个新的冲突形式出现在故事中，Allsight联盟，一个在Ank'Harel有影响力的学术团体，在他们城市下面的沉没废墟中发现了一种奇怪的矿物。这种物质是一种光滑的、油性的石头，上面有血一样的条纹，拥有未知的魔法特性。联盟试图对其发现保密，但这一消息很快引起了一个敌对派别的注意。",
	"The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream—a secret occult society obsessed with the magic of the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus—heard a rumor about the discovery of this mineral. Consortium agents broke into the Allegiance of Allsight's excavation site in Cael Morrow and learned about the discovery firsthand. They dubbed the mineral \"ruidium,\" because its red veins and its mysteriousness reminded them of the light and power of Ruidus.": "朱雀梦财团--一个痴迷于恶兆之月瑞德斯的魔法的秘密神秘社团--听到了关于发现这种矿物的传言。财团的特工闯入Allsight的Allegiance在Cael Morrow的挖掘现场，亲身了解了这一发现。他们把这种矿物称为 \"Ruidium\"，因为它的红色脉络和它的神秘性让他们想起了Ruidus的光和力量。",
	"The consortium continued sneaking into the excavation, hunting further deposits of the mineral, and discovered a planar rift within the ruins. One of their agents succeeded in getting inside the rift—and when that agent returned, she claimed that she had entered a dark, underwater realm where the walls themselves were veined with ruidium. She managed to recover a sample and escape before the water's intense pressure crushed her body.": "财团继续潜入挖掘现场，寻找更多的矿藏，并在废墟中发现了一个平面裂缝。他们的一名特工成功地进入了裂缝--当这名特工回来时，她声称自己进入了一个黑暗的水下世界，那里的墙壁本身就有Ruidium的纹理。她设法找到了一个样本，并在水的巨大压力将她的身体压碎之前逃脱了。",
	"When that sample of ruidium was torn from the Netherdeep, the shock of the extraction roused the dormant Apotheon from his slumber. All at once, centuries of accumulated grief crashed down upon him, and the Netherdeep roared with the strength of his tempestuous emotions.": "当Ruidium的样本从Netherdeep中被撕开时，提取的冲击将沉睡的Apotheon从他的沉睡中唤醒。一下子，几个世纪以来积累的悲痛向他袭来，Netherdeep因他暴躁的情绪的力量而咆哮。",
	"The power that flows from the Apotheon is no longer truly his own. Try as he might to hang on to the memory of the hero he once was, he is driven entirely by his tortured emotions. Throughout his centuries of isolation, the dormant, dreaming Alyxian had hoped for someone to find and rescue him. But when mortals discovered him, they seemed interested only in stealing his power for themselves. The furious Apotheon tapped into the alien nature of the Netherdeep to cause ruidium to slowly corrupt all who hold it.": "从Apotheon流出的力量不再是真正属于他的。尽管他试图坚持他曾经是英雄的记忆，但他完全被他被折磨的情绪所驱使。在他与世隔绝的几个世纪里，这个休眠的、正在做梦的Alyxian一直希望有人能找到并拯救他。但当凡人发现他时，他们似乎只对为自己窃取他的力量感兴趣。愤怒的Apotheon利用Netherdeep的异样性质，使Ruidium慢慢腐蚀所有持有它的人。",
	"Alyxian beseeched the three gods he had prayed to in ancient times—Sehanine the Moon Weaver, Avandra the Change Bringer, and Corellon the Arch Heart—to send heroes to save him. Despite being sealed behind the Divine Gate, the gods were able to propel the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} to a site where Alyxian once beseeched the Moon Weaver for aid long ago. The jewel materialized within a sunken temple in the Emerald Gulch near Jigow, and the gods hoped that a good-hearted band of heroes would find it, learn of the Apotheon's plight, and rescue their tortured champion. The {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} is currently dormant, waiting to be awakened by a determined hero.": "Alyxian恳求他在古代祈祷过的三位神明--织月者Sehanine、改变者Avandra和拱心者Corellon--派英雄来拯救他。尽管被封在神门之后，诸神还是能够将{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}推进到阿利仙很久以前曾经向织月者祈求援助的地方。这颗宝石在吉高附近的翡翠谷的一个沉没的神庙里出现，众神希望一帮好心的英雄能找到它，了解阿普特恩的困境，并拯救他们受折磨的冠军。这个{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}目前处于休眠状态，等待着被一个坚定的英雄所唤醒。",
	"The first chapter of this adventure begins in Jigow, a Xhorhasian town populated mostly by orcs and goblins brought together by the Kryn Dynasty. Smaller populations of other peoples live among them. Unlike some other Kryn settlements, the people of Jigow have maintained their city's distinctive culture. Jigow's most popular event is the annual Festival of Merit, in which locals and visitors compete in tests of strength and cunning. Rivalries are forged, bets are won and lost, and bragging rights are secured for the year—until the next festival.": "这场冒险的第一章开始于吉高，这是一个霍尔哈斯人的城镇，居民大多是由克里恩王朝带来的兽人和哥布林。其他民族的小部分人口生活在他们中间。与其他一些克莱恩定居点不同的是，吉高人保持了他们城市的独特文化。吉高最受欢迎的活动是一年一度的功绩节，当地人和游客在其中进行力量和狡猾的测试。竞争的结果，赌注的输赢，以及一年的吹嘘权利--直到下一个节日的到来。",
	"During this event, destiny calls to two adventuring parties: the characters (run by your players) and a group of rival adventurers (run by you).

Here, the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} waits to be found. The discovery of this item and a vision in which Alyxian pleads with the characters to save him from his prison of darkness and despair set the adventure in motion.

He still has a connection to several holy sites where he received power from the gods during the Calamity, and his consciousness reaches out to certain mortals whose hearts resonate with his own.": "阿利仙被困在他自己制造的维度外监狱中，渴望自由。他与几个圣地仍有联系，在灾变期间，他在那里得到了诸神的力量，他的意识伸向了某些心脏与他自己共鸣的凡人。",
	"Beyond this, Alyxian yearns to be remembered. He is a being composed of little more than memory, sorrow, and hatred. He fears that the world has forgotten his sacrifice entirely—and the Netherdeep has preyed on his selfish urges, instilling in him an obsessive desire to be remembered and idolized by a world that seemingly has forsaken him.": "除此之外，Alyxian还渴望被人记住。他是一个由记忆、悲伤和仇恨组成的生命。他担心这个世界已经完全忘记了他的牺牲--Netherdeep利用了他自私的冲动，向他灌输了一种强迫性的欲望，希望被这个似乎已经抛弃了他的世界所记住和崇拜。",
	"Alyxian appears to the characters several times in visions. The version of himself he shows them is the idealized way he sees himself—someone who has always tried to do good but has been punished nonetheless. The Apotheon is trying to put his best self forward to get what he wants out of the characters. This isn't a false persona, but it isn't the whole picture. In later visions, when the characters are able to speak to Alyxian and ask him questions, probing too deeply can cause the Apotheon to reveal the more raw, selfish parts of himself.

	"Ultimately, your job is to try to balance the selfless man that Alyxian once was with the traumatized, manipulative being that he has become.

	"Like other {@i Critical Role} stories, this adventure walks a line between optimistic heroism and morally ambiguous character dilemmas.

Any topic or theme that makes a player feel unsafe should be avoided. If a topic or theme makes one or more players nervous but they give you consent to include it in-game, incorporate it with care.

	"Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling at high altitudes because of the water's pressure and cold temperature. For a creature without a swimming speed, each hour spent swimming at a depth greater than 100 feet counts as 2 hours for the purpose of determining {@condition exhaustion}, and swimming for an hour at a depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours.": "在深水中游泳类似于在高海拔地区旅行，因为水的压力和寒冷的温度。对于没有游泳速度的生物来说，为了确定（%0%），在深度大于100英尺的地方每游一小时算作2小时，在深度大于200英尺的地方游一小时算作4小时。",
	"Visibility underwater depends on water clarity and the available light.

	"Ruidium originates in the Netherdeep. It penetrates and grows into all things it touches. Inanimate objects that become bonded with ruidium are imbued with a sliver of the Apotheon's power. Creatures that interact with ruidium can be physically and emotionally corrupted by it. Their bodies become laced with ruidium veins, and their minds become tormented by the same emotions that haunt the Apotheon.": "Ruidium起源于Netherdeep。它渗透并成长为它所接触的所有事物。与Ruidium结合的无生命物体被灌输了Apotheon的一小部分力量。与Ruidium互动的生物可以在身体和情感上被它腐蚀。他们的身体会变成带有Ruidium的血管，他们的思想会被困扰Apotheon的相同情绪所折磨。",
	"When a creature is at risk of becoming corrupted, it must make a Charisma saving throw. The save DC varies based on the ruidium's virulence. On a failed saving throw, the creature gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} (see the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}) and becomes corrupted if it isn't already. From that point on, the creature takes {@dice 1d10} psychic damage whenever its level of {@condition exhaustion} increases or decreases by 1, until it's no longer corrupted (see \"{@area Ending Corruption|025|x}\" below).": "当一个生物有被腐蚀的风险时，它必须做一个魅力拯救动作。蓄力DC根据ruidium的毒性而变化。如果救赎失败，该生物将获得1级的（%0%）（见（%1%）），如果它还没有被腐蚀，则会被腐蚀。从那时起，每当它的（%3%）等级增加或减少1时，该生物就会受到（%2%）的精神伤害，直到它不再被腐蚀（见下面的\"（%4%）\"）。",
	"The first physical sign of corruption in a creature is a bright red rash, which appears on the creature's body where it made contact with the ruidium.

Decreasing a creature's level of {@condition exhaustion} doesn't affect the physical signs of corruption. Once a new physical sign appears, it can't be removed from the creature until its ruidium corruption is ended.": "生物腐败的第一个物理迹象是一个鲜红的皮疹，它出现在生物的身体上与Ruidium接触的地方。随着生物的{@condition exhaustion}等级的增加，腐败的迹象变得更加明显，正如瑞德姆腐败的物理迹象表所总结的那样。降低生物的（%1%）等级并不影响腐败的物理迹象。一旦一个新的物理迹象出现，它就不能从该生物身上去除，直到它的瑞德腐蚀结束。",

	"A creature beset by ruidium corruption also exhibits emotional signs of corruption that worsen as its level of {@condition exhaustion} increases. These symptoms include amplified feelings of regret, yearning, rage, and despair. A player whose character is corrupted by ruidium can roleplay these symptoms however they wish.

As with the physical signs of corruption, all emotional symptoms persist until the creature's ruidium corruption is ended.": "一个被Ruidium腐败困扰的生物也会表现出腐败的情感症状，并随着其（%0%）水平的提高而恶化。这些症状包括放大的后悔、渴望、愤怒和绝望的感觉。一个角色被Ruidium腐蚀的玩家可以随心所欲地扮演这些症状。(例如，玩家可以强调或放大他们角色的缺陷，或为他们的角色选择一个新的缺陷）。与堕落的身体症状一样，所有的情绪症状都会持续下去，直到该生物的Ruidium堕落结束。",
	"One ounce of ruidium can be substituted for 500 gp worth of any material component needed to cast a spell. A creature that casts a spell using ruidium as a replacement component must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain 1 level of {@condition exhaustion} after the spell is cast. If the creature isn't already suffering from ruidium corruption, it becomes corrupted if it fails the saving throw.": "一盎司的Ruidium可以替代价值500gp的施法所需的任何物质成分。使用Ruidium作为替代成分施法的生物必须在DC20的智力测验中获得成功，否则在施法后会获得1级（%0%）的效果。如果该生物还没有受到Ruidium腐蚀的影响，那么如果它没有成功，它就会被腐蚀掉。",

	"From the beginning, the characters are challenged by a rival adventuring party. This rivalry starts small, with the two groups first meeting while they play games of skill and strength in Jigow. As the rivals make their own way through the adventure, they grow in power and ambition just as the characters do. They are determined to prove that they are the true heroes of this story.": "从一开始，这些人物就受到了敌对的冒险队伍的挑战。这种竞争开始时规模不大，两组人在吉高玩技巧和力量的游戏时第一次见面。随着对手在冒险过程中的发展，他们的力量和野心也在增长，就像角色们一样。他们决心证明自己才是这个故事的真正英雄。",
	"This adventure presents five rivals. Ideally, the number of rivals should be equal to the number of characters in the players' party.

	"Ayo is a water genasi who was born to orc parents during a terrible storm in the Emerald Gulch. Her family has lived in Jigow for generations, and she's eager to leave home and see the world.": "阿尤是一个水精灵，在翡翠沟的一场可怕的风暴中由兽人父母所生。她的家族世代居住在吉高，她渴望离开家，看看这个世界。",
	"Ayo picked up her combat skills while working as a hunter for the town of Jigow. She recently joined up with her childhood friend Dermot, as well as Maggie Keeneyes, a mercenary who came to town several weeks ago. Despite Maggie's brusque demeanor, she became a loyal friend of Ayo and Dermot, and the three of them have become inseparable, even as more adventurers have joined their party.": "阿尤在为吉高镇做猎人时学会了战斗技能。她最近与她的童年朋友德莫特以及几周前来到镇上的雇佣兵麦琪-基尼耶斯会合。尽管玛姬举止粗鲁，但她成为了阿尤和德莫特的忠实朋友，他们三人已经变得形影不离，甚至有更多的冒险者加入他们的队伍。",
	"Ayo is hotheaded and appreciates people who make decisions as impulsively as she does. Nevertheless, she respects Dermot's even-tempered advice and dutifully plays the role of the wise leader. She has no patience for people who are indecisive, and she is infuriated by people who don't say what they really mean.": "阿尤是个急性子，欣赏像她一样冲动地做决定的人。尽管如此，她还是尊重德莫特平和的建议，并尽职尽责地扮演着明智的领导者的角色。她对那些优柔寡断的人没有耐心，她对那些不说真话的人感到愤怒。",
	"When you're the twelfth son of a poor goblin family in Jigow, the only way to make a name for yourself is to become a great champion—someone who can win bragging contests in the local taverns night after night. Young Dermot Wurder, however, wasn't interested in performing feats of strength or agility that would win him a boast-worthy epithet. Fame wasn't for him, nor was the aggressiveness that becoming famous required. He was more interested in cooking, planting flowers, and sewing clothes—doing the work that kept his family together while his carefree siblings dove off waterfalls and wrestled stray dogs.": "当你是吉高一个贫穷的妖精家庭的第十二个儿子时，为自己扬名立万的唯一途径是成为一个伟大的冠军--一个能在当地酒馆里夜夜赢得吹嘘的人。然而，年轻的德莫特-沃尔德对表演力量或敏捷性的壮举不感兴趣，这将为他赢得一个值得夸耀的外号。名声对他来说并不重要，成名所需的进取心也不重要。他更感兴趣的是做饭、种花和缝衣服--当他无忧无虑的兄弟姐妹从瀑布上跳下来和与流浪狗搏斗时，他做的工作使他的家庭团结一致。",
	"Dermot and Ayo Jabe have known each other long enough that their first meeting has vanished into the haze of youthful pre-memory. Dermot accompanied Ayo whenever he could, packing herbs and medicines when they went exploring in the woods.

	"Beautiful, ethereal, deathly, shadowy—all accurately describe Galsariad Ardyth, a drow in his two-hundredth year of life. He's recently taken up the study of arcane magic, and he's pursuing the life of an adventurer in hopes of improving his reputation within the Kryn Dynasty.

	"Galsariad appreciates people who share his interests and are willing to spend time studying with him, though he also likes it when people treat him with respect even if they don't care about magic.

Irv is young—just a few weeks past his nineteenth birthday—and he is secretly ashamed of his patchy beard and scrawny, human body. He has a bigger secret related to that feeling: he was consecuted in another life. The act of consecution is a sacred Kryn ritual of rebirth through the mystical power of the Luxon. Irvan has memories of his previous life as a bugbear of Den Hythenos, and he hopes to prove to himself that he can do great things without the aid of his powerful \"family\" in the Kryn Dynasty.": "他因是一个派对动物而赢得了声誉，他可以在一个晚上喝下一打酒，而且还能像大法官那样充满活力和优雅地跳舞。欧文很年轻--他的19岁生日刚过几个星期--他暗自为自己斑驳的胡子和瘦弱的人形身体感到羞愧。他有一个与这种感觉有关的更大的秘密：他在前世被迫害过。迫害行为是克莱恩的一种神圣仪式，通过卢克松的神秘力量重生。欧文有他前世作为登赫特诺斯的虫子的记忆，他希望向自己证明，没有他在克里恩王朝强大的 \"家族 \"的帮助，他也能做伟大的事情。",
	"He met Ayo and her friends when he traveled to Jigow to experience its contests of strength and skill. He sticks with the group in part because he's interested in what adventures they'll get into, and also because he's smitten with the group's newest addition, a drow arcanist named Galsariad.": "他在前往吉高体验力量和技巧的竞赛时遇到了阿尤和她的朋友。他坚持和这个团体在一起，部分原因是他对他们会有什么冒险感兴趣，也因为他对这个团体的最新成员--一个名叫加尔萨里德的鸦人奥术师--很感兴趣。",
	"People might laugh when a 12-foot-tall ogre orders a drink at a bar and says her name is Maggie, but they don't laugh for long. Some people fixate on her name, her enormous size, her muscles, or the weapon at her side. Wiser folk take notice of Maggie's bright blue eyes. All her life, people have considered Maggie a stupid meathead because of her size, but her eyes betray her intelligence. She can read others with a glance, whether in conversation or in a duel. When her eyes dart back and forth across a battlefield, they take in enough information to give her allies an advantage in the fight.": "当一个12英尺高的食人魔在酒吧点了一杯饮料并说她的名字叫麦琪时，人们可能会笑，但他们不会笑很久。有些人专注于她的名字，她巨大的体型，她的肌肉，或她身边的武器。更聪明的人则注意到麦琪明亮的蓝眼睛。在她的一生中，人们都认为麦琪是一个愚蠢的肉头，因为她的体型，但她的眼睛出卖了她的智慧。不管是在谈话中还是在决斗中，她都能一眼看透别人。当她的眼睛在战场上来回逡巡时，会吸收足够的信息，使她的盟友在战斗中获得优势。",
	"Things changed for Maggie when she first arrived in Jigow and met Ayo Jabe three weeks ago. She came looking for mercenary work to make ends meet but found a true friend instead. Ayo saw the intelligence in Maggie's eyes and was keen to hear Maggie's thoughts. They became fast friends, and Maggie would sooner die than let harm come to her new companion.": "三个星期前，麦琪第一次来到吉哥，遇到了阿尤-贾贝，事情就发生了变化。她是来寻找雇佣兵工作以维持生计的，但却发现了一个真正的朋友。阿约从麦琪的眼中看到了智慧，并热衷于倾听麦琪的想法。他们很快成为朋友，麦琪宁愿死也不愿让她的新伙伴受到伤害。",
	"Maggie loves poetry and music with profound lyrics, as well as matching wits with people as clever as she is. She hates being stereotyped and has a dim view of those who are too quick to judge others.": "麦琪喜欢诗歌和歌词深刻的音乐，也喜欢与像她一样聪明的人比拼智慧。她讨厌被定型，并对那些过于急于评判他人的人看法模糊。",
	"Each rival has goals. As the characters interact with the rivals, they might choose to help the rivals achieve their goals or use their own knowledge of those goals to manipulate the rivals into doing what they want. A Charisma check to ask for help (see \"{@area Asking for Help|031|x}\" below) is made with advantage if the rival thinks agreeing to the character's request will help achieve the rivals' goals and is made with disadvantage if it goes directly against the rivals' goals.": "每个对手都有目标。当角色与对手互动时，他们可能会选择帮助对手实现他们的目标，或者利用自己对这些目标的了解来操纵对手做他们想要的事情。如果对手认为同意人物的请求会有助于实现对手的目标，那么就可以通过魅力检查来寻求帮助（见下面的\"{@area Asking for Help|031|x}\"）；如果直接与对手的目标相违背，就会产生不利影响。",
	"The Rivals' Goals table summarizes each rival's goals at the start of this adventure. Some of them are broadly applicable and might never be definitively achieved. Others are highly specific (such as Galsariad's goal to match wits with an archmage). The rivals can acquire new goals as the adventure progresses, as you see fit.": "敌对者的目标表总结了每个敌对者在这次冒险开始时的目标。其中有些目标是广泛适用的，可能永远也无法明确地实现。其他的则是非常具体的（比如Galsariad的目标是与大法师比拼智慧）。随着冒险的进展，对手可以获得新的目标，只要你认为合适。",
	"A character can learn about one of a rival's goals by spending at least 1 minute in conversation with that rival and making a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. No check is necessary if the rival is friendly toward the character and divulges the information willingly.": "一个角色可以通过与对手交谈至少1分钟并进行DC10智慧（（%0%））检查来了解对手的一个目标。如果对手对角色很友好，并且愿意透露信息，则不需要检查。",
	"Ayo Jabe": "Ayo Jabe",
	"Become a hero like the ones she has read about in stories; make a friend she can be truly herself around; kill a legendary monster": "成为像她在故事中读到的那样的英雄；交一个可以在她身边真正做自己的朋友；杀一个传说中的怪物。",
	"Dermot Wurder": "Dermot Wurder",
	"Protect his friends; have a life-changing holy vision; discover that he has value himself, not just as someone who can help others": "保护他的朋友；有一个改变生活的圣洁愿景；发现他自己有价值，而不仅仅是可以帮助别人的人。",

	"Spar with a true tactical genius; write a song or poem that causes someone to weep with emotion; be able to retire and never kill again": "与真正的战术天才进行拼搏；写出让人感动流泪的歌曲或诗歌；能够退休，不再杀人",
	"Stat blocks for the rivals can be found in {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}. Each of the rivals has three stat blocks; like the characters, they become more powerful as the adventure progresses. The Rival Stat Blocks table shows you which stat blocks to use based on the chapter you are running.": "竞争对手的状态块可以在{@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}找到。每个对手都有三个状态块；和角色一样，随着冒险的进行，他们会变得更加强大。竞争对手的状态块表显示了根据你正在运行的章节使用哪些状态块。",
	"When the characters meet the rivals in {@adventure chapter 1|CRCotN|1}, all the rivals have an indifferent attitude toward them. It's up to you to determine when a rival's attitude toward a character might change. For example, after a combat encounter in which one character saves a rival's life or helps a rival achieve one of their goals (see the {@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}), you can decide if that deed enabled the rival to see the character in a new light, changing the rival's attitude toward the character from hostile to indifferent or indifferent to friendly. The {@book rules for changing attitude|DMG|8|Resolving Interactions} are detailed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "当人物在{@adventure chapter 1|CRCotN|1}中遇到对手时，所有的对手都对他们抱有冷漠的态度。由你来决定对手对某个角色的态度何时可能改变。例如，在一次战斗中，一个角色救了对手的命，或者帮助对手实现了他们的一个目标（见{@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}），你可以决定这个行为是否使对手对这个角色有了新的看法，使对手对这个角色的态度从敌视变为冷漠，或者从冷漠变为友好。{@book rules for changing attitude|DMG|8|Resolving Interactions}详见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。",
	"Since every rival's attitude toward the characters starts out as indifferent, it's important to note only the hostile and friendly relationships that blossom between the two parties and the reasons why the relationship became friendly or hostile.": "由于每个对手对人物的态度一开始都是冷漠的，所以只需要注意双方之间的敌对和友好关系，以及关系变得友好或敌对的原因。",
	"You can decide that certain actions—such as a character killing one of the rivals—automatically turn all the rivals hostile against all the characters. The converse isn't true; singular acts of kindness toward an individual rival aren't as likely to make all the rivals friendly toward all the characters.": "你可以决定某些行为--比如一个角色杀死一个对手--会自动使所有的对手对所有的角色产生敌意。反之亦然；对个别对手的单一善意行为并不可能使所有对手对所有角色都友好。",
	"{@i Critical Role} stories are known for their rich cast of characters. The characters created by the players are the protagonists of this story. No matter how important this adventure's demigod, power-hungry faction leaders, and precocious rival adventurers might seem to be, it's the player characters' story first and foremost.": "{@i Critical Role}故事以其丰富的人物阵容而闻名。玩家创造的角色是这个故事的主角。不管这个冒险的半神、渴望权力的派别领袖和早熟的敌对冒险者看起来有多重要，这首先是玩家角色的故事。",
	"Nevertheless, these other participants are of crucial importance. They exist to goad the heroes into making reckless decisions, to prey on their flaws, to spur the story forward when it stalls, and to enhance the mysteries of the world.": "然而，这些其他参与者具有至关重要的意义。他们的存在是为了诱导英雄们做出鲁莽的决定，利用他们的缺陷，在故事停滞不前时刺激其前进，并增强世界的神秘性。",
	"At times, the characters might want help from one or more rivals to accomplish their goals. Any character who requests help from a rival must make a successful Charisma check to convince that rival to help them. Consider that rival's relationship to the character in question, then consult the {@book Conversation Reaction|DMG|8|Conversation Reaction} table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine the DC of the check and the rival's reaction to the character's request.": "有时，人物可能希望得到一个或多个对手的帮助来完成他们的目标。任何请求对手帮助的角色都必须进行成功的魅力检查，以说服该对手帮助他们。考虑该对手与该角色的关系，然后参考{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book Conversation Reaction|DMG|8|Conversation Reaction}表，以确定检定的DC以及该对手对该角色请求的反应。",
	"As long as the characters haven't slain any of them, the rivals do their best to avoid killing the characters. If a battle erupts between the two groups, the rivals try to knock the characters {@condition unconscious} (see the {@book rules|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out} for doing so in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). In situations where that's not possible, Dermot Wurder uses his {@spell spare the dying} spell to stabilize a dying character.": "只要角色没有杀死他们中的任何一个，对手就会尽力避免杀死角色。如果两组人马之间爆发战斗，对手会试图击倒人物（%0%）（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中这样做的{@book rules|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}）。在不可能的情况下，德莫特-沃德用他的{@spell spare the dying}法术来稳定即将死亡的角色。",
	"If the heroes surrender, Ayo is usually happy to accept that outcome. She would prefer to let her foes go free, though she demands they stay out of her group's way.": "如果英雄们投降了，阿尤通常很乐意接受这个结果。她更愿意让她的敌人获得自由，尽管她要求他们不要妨碍她的团队。",
	"You determine if the situation is dire enough for the rivals to kill the characters or take them prisoner, or if they would even refuse to accept a surrender.": "你决定情况是否严重到足以让对手杀死人物或将他们俘虏，或者他们甚至会拒绝接受投降。",
	"This adventure begins in Xhorhas, where most humans are nomads; most elves are drow who live aboveground; dwarves and halflings are rare; and goblinoids, orcs, lizardfolk, kobolds, and other creatures sometimes seen as \"monstrous\" elsewhere are more populous than gnomes and dragonborn. Whether the characters are natives of Xhorhas or outsiders, assume they are aware of what's said in the \"{@area What the Characters Know|037|x}\" section below.": "这个冒险开始于Xhorhas，在那里大多数人类是游牧民族；大多数精灵是生活在地面上的乌鸦；矮人和半身人很少；地精、兽人、蜥蜴人、哥布林和其他有时在其他地方被视为 \"畸形 \"的生物比地精和龙裔更多。无论人物是Xhorhas的本地人还是外来者，都要假定他们知道下面\"{@area What the Characters Know|037|x} \"部分所说的内容。",
	"Before starting the adventure, consider spending a game session—colloquially called session zero—to establish expectations, share house rules, and help your players create characters. If you have a copy of {@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}, see that book's \"{@book Session Zero|TCE|4|Session Zero}\" section for advice on how to lay the groundwork in session zero for a fun campaign that exceeds your players' expectations.": "在开始冒险之前，考虑花一个游戏环节--俗称零环节--来建立期望，分享内部规则，并帮助你的玩家创建角色。如果你有一本《{@book Tasha's Cauldron of Everything|TCE}》，请参阅该书的\"{@book Session Zero|TCE|4|Session Zero} \"部分，了解如何在零会话中打下基础，以开展超出玩家期望的有趣活动。",
	"All the character races presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} are well suited for this adventure. If your players have access to {@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|EGW}, the race and subclass options presented in that book are available to them as well.

	"Additional race options appear in {@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}, with bugbear, duergar, goblin, hobgoblin, kobold, lizardfolk, minotaur, and orc being appropriate choices for players who want their characters to come from cultures or societies with roots in Xhorhas.": "额外的种族选项出现在{@book Monsters of the Multiverse|MPMM}中，对于那些希望自己的角色来自与Xhorhas有渊源的文化或社会的玩家来说，虫人、duergar、地精、hobgoblin、kobold、蜥蜴人、牛头人和兽人是合适的选择。",
	"All class options presented in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be used in this adventure, and players can choose options from other D&D books with your approval.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中介绍的所有等级选项都可以在这个冒险中使用，玩家可以在你的同意下从其他D&D书籍中选择选项。",
	"Dungeon Masters are fallible, just like everyone else, and even the most experienced DMs make mistakes. If you overlook, forget, or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. This is a big adventure with lots of interconnecting elements; no one expects you to internalize or memorize every aspect of it. As long as your players are having fun, everything will be just fine.": "地下城管理员是易变的，就像其他人一样，而且即使是最有经验的管理员也会犯错。如果你忽略了什么，忘记了什么，或者错误地描述了什么，请纠正自己并继续前进。这是一个有很多相互联系的元素的大冒险；没有人期望你把它的每个方面都内化或记住。只要你的玩家玩得开心，一切都会好起来的。",
	"The beginning of this adventure assumes the characters are familiar with each other. Are they using Jigow as a rest stop on their way elsewhere, are they residents of Jigow, or some combination of the two?": "这场冒险的开始是假设角色们彼此都很熟悉。他们是在其他地方的路上把吉哥作为休息站，还是吉哥的居民，或者两者的某种组合？",
	"If the players are unfamiliar with Exandria and the lands of Xhorhas, they might find it daunting to create a back story set in this world. If you have {@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|EGW}, the {@book Heroic Chronicle|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle} section in that book roots a character's history in the lands of Wildemount by helping the player determine their character's birth nation, home settlement, and relationships with family members, allies, and enemies. It also helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began.": "如果玩家对艾克桑德里亚和Xhorhas的土地不熟悉，他们可能会发现在这个世界上创造一个背景故事是很困难的。如果你有{@book Explorer's Guide to Wildemount|EGW}，该书中的{@book Heroic Chronicle|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}部分会帮助玩家确定角色的出生国、家乡定居点以及与家庭成员、盟友和敌人的关系，从而使角色的历史扎根于怀德蒙的土地。它还有助于确定在活动开始之前发生在角色身上的重大事件。",
	"Regardless of whether you use that information, asking the players the following questions about their characters can help them come up with a strong back story:": "无论你是否使用这些信息，向玩家询问关于他们角色的以下问题可以帮助他们想出一个强有力的背景故事。",

	"The Kryn Dynasty is the dominant nation in Xhorhas. It was founded by a drow queen named Leylas Kryn, who fled the Underdark and the tyrannical rule of Lolth the Spider Queen along with her disciples. The Bright Queen still rules the dynasty centuries later, and its cities contain more than just drow. Orcs, goblinoids, tieflings, humans, and many others call the cities of the dynasty their home. Countless more denizens of the dynasty are nomads who roam the wastes in clans, hunting mastodons and other Xhorhasian megafauna.": "克林王朝是Xhorhas的主导国家。它是由一位名叫莱伊拉斯-克莱恩（Leylas Kryn）的乌鸦女王建立的，她和她的弟子们一起逃离了暗黑世界和蜘蛛女王洛尔思的暴政。几个世纪后，光明女王仍然统治着这个王朝，而它的城市里不仅仅有乌鸦。兽人、地精、铁弗林、人类和其他许多人都把这个王朝的城市当作他们的家。王朝还有无数的居民是游牧民族，他们以部落的形式在荒原上游荡，猎杀乳齿象和其他Xhorhasian巨型动物。",
	"This coastal settlement is actually a string of villages that are home to a collection of folk from all over Xhorhas. Goblin and orc clans founded Jigow, which explains why the settlement is governed by two elders—a goblin and an orc. The Aurora Watch (the military arm of the Kryn Dynasty) maintains a presence here, under the command of a drow called Taskhand Durth Mirimm.": "这个沿海定居点实际上是一连串的村庄，是来自Xhorhas各地的居民的家。地精和兽人氏族建立了吉高，这也解释了为什么这个定居点由两位长老管理--一位地精和一位兽人。曙光守望（Kryn王朝的军事部门）在这里保持着存在，由一个叫Taskhand Durth Mirimm的乌鸦指挥。",
	"Townsfolk tend to be competitive, and friendly rivalries are commonplace. Most of Jigow's residents live in a central region called the Jumble.": "镇民们倾向于竞争，友好的竞争是很常见的。大多数吉高的居民都住在一个叫做 \"Jumble \"的中心区域。",
	"The official deity of the Kryn Dynasty, whose symbol appears on the nation's heraldry, is the Luxon. This mysterious divine entity of light and rebirth has granted its faithful several esoteric secrets, the greatest of which is consecution—the act of preparing one's soul for rebirth. Through consecution, some people within the Kryn Dynasty have lived many lifetimes, often in bodies different from the ones they were first born in. In the sequence of consecution, a drow might become a goblin, then be reborn as a bugbear, then an orc, and so on—all the while gaining greater knowledge about the world through their experiences. This process has no mechanical benefit, but players can make consecution and rebirth an interesting part of their characters' back stories.": "克林王朝的官方神灵是卢克松，其标志出现在国家的纹章上。这个神秘的光明和重生的神灵赋予其信徒一些神秘的秘密，其中最大的秘密是迫害--为重生准备灵魂的行为。通过迫害，克莱恩王朝的一些人已经活了很多世，往往是在与他们第一次出生时不同的身体中。在迫害的顺序中，一个鸦人可能会变成妖精，然后转生为虫人，然后是兽人，等等，同时通过他们的经历获得对世界的更多知识。这个过程没有任何机械上的好处，但玩家可以让迫害和重生成为他们角色背景故事中有趣的一部分。",
	"If a follower of the Luxon who has undergone the ritual of consecution dies within 100 miles of a Luxon beacon, their soul is ensnared by it and reincarnated within the body of a random Humanoid newborn within 100 miles of the beacon.": "如果一个经历过迫害仪式的卢克逊信徒在卢克逊信标100英里范围内死亡，他们的灵魂会被信标俘虏，并在信标100英里范围内随机转世到一个人形新生儿的体内。",

	"Like many of the heroic legends that echo throughout the annals of Exandrian history, this tale begins in peace—or what passes for peace in Jigow at festival time. Goblin children run through the streets, screaming with mirth, while orcs, humans, drow, and people of countless other folk clink tankards, hurl hatchets at targets, stuff their faces with meat pies, and plunge into the frigid waters of the Ifolon River—all in the name of friendly competition.": "就像许多回荡在艾克桑德历史长河中的英雄传说一样，这个故事是在和平中开始的，或者说，在吉高的节日里，和平也是如此。妖精的孩子们在街上跑来跑去，欢快地叫着，而兽人、人类、乌鸦和无数其他民族的人则碰着酒杯，向目标投掷斧头，用肉馅饼塞满脸，跳进冰冷的伊佛隆河水里--所有这些都是为了友好竞争。",
	"The characters are in Jigow during the city's annual Festival of Merit. Though they are the protagonists of this story, today they are but a small handful of excited festivalgoers amid a merry throng. Many of the Xhorhasians present are famed warriors, skilled athletes, cunning con artists, and talented arcanists. Among those taking part in the festivities are the characters' rivals, another group of adventurers whose fates are entwined with the characters.": "这些人物是在吉哥市一年一度的功德节期间出现的。虽然他们是这个故事的主角，但今天他们只是欢乐的人群中的一小撮兴奋的节日参与者。在场的许多霍哈斯人都是著名的战士、熟练的运动员、狡猾的骗子和天才的奥术师。参加庆典的人中有人物的对手，另一群冒险家，他们的命运与人物纠缠在一起。",

	"Jigow is located in northern Xhorhas on the banks of the Emerald Gulch and the Ifolon River.

	"The villages and townships that make up Jigow are loosely divided into three major areas: the Meatwaters, the main dock area on the shores of the Ifolon River; the Wetwalks, a collection of houses on stilts closest to the wetlands and marshes; and the Jumble, the most densely populated region of the city, where houses are built among giant mangrove trees or on the backs of horizonback tortoises and used as traveling homes.": "组成吉高的村庄和乡镇被松散地分为三大区域：Meatwaters，伊佛龙河岸边的主要码头区；Wetwalks，最靠近湿地和沼泽地的高跷房屋集合；Jumble，城市中人口最密集的区域，房屋建在巨大的红树林间或地平线上的乌龟背上，作为旅行的住所。",
	"Jigow has a council of elders who help its people resolve internal conflicts and a military presence in the form of the Aurora Watch—the soldiers of the Kryn Dynasty. The dynasty also has a political liaison in Jigow: a drow named Durth Mirimm (see {@area area J9|078|x}).

	"The Jumble is the heart of Jigow and home to a colorful patchwork of local cultures. The traditions of ancient Xhorhasian peoples, many of them orcs and goblins, live on in the peaceful chaos of the Jumble.

	"Jigow was built from the sweat of its founders' brows, the strength of their muscles, and the music of their voices. In Jigow, any chance to show off one's physical, social, or intellectual prowess is a welcome one, and there's no opportunity better than the annual festival. On this day, friendly and not-so-friendly contests between residents are settled. Every public space is filled with festival games, food stalls, or other amenities for the merrymakers, and plenty of shops and private residences have flung their doors wide to join in the revelry.": "吉高是由其创始人的眉毛的汗水、肌肉的力量和声音的音乐建立的。在吉高，任何展示自己身体、社交或智力的机会都是值得欢迎的，而没有什么机会比一年一度的节日更好了。在这一天，居民之间的友好和不友好的竞赛都会得到解决。每个公共场所都摆满了节日游戏、食品摊位或其他供欢庆者使用的设施，大量的商店和私人住宅也敞开大门，加入到狂欢中。",

	"You hear snippets of conversations as people pass by: a goblin mother telling her children not to go near the baby horizonback tortoises, a drow guard in shining insectile armor complaining to his partner that his gauntlet was crushed by a hulking orc while arm-wrestling, and a pair of young orcs in swimwear hollering as they rush toward the banks of the Ifolon River.": "你听到人们经过时的对话片段：一个地精母亲告诉她的孩子不要靠近小角背龟，一个穿着闪亮的昆虫盔甲的乌鸦卫士向他的伙伴抱怨他的铠甲在掰手腕时被一个巨大的兽人捏碎了，还有一对穿着泳装的年轻兽人一边叫喊一边冲向伊佛隆河岸。",

His fellow riders are ten {@creature Bandit||bandits} (lawful evil humans) mounted on {@creature Riding Horse||riding horses}.": "在荒原上一个罕见的晴天，被动智慧({@skill Perception})得分在15分以上的人物看到在半英里外的路上有一团尘土被掀起，并且继续朝他们走来。几分钟后，这些人物被骑着破烂的马的人类强盗包围了。这些强盗自称 \"夺路者\"。他们的首领是一个灰头土脸的人，名叫Postraeck，是一个中立的恶魔（%1%），骑着一匹威风凛凛的黑色（%2%）。波斯特雷克被称为 \"六刀\"，因为他身上一直带着六把匕首，每把都有一个名字（Boneshaver, Gleam, Grudge, Jabby, Pierce, and Tickles）。他的同伴是十个（3%）（合法的邪恶人类），骑着（4%）。",
	"Six-Knives claims that he's a Kryn tax collector and that he needs each of the characters to cough up 25 gp for the \"road 'n' infer-structure tax.\" No such tax exists, and the characters don't need to make any kind of check to glean that these hoodlums are not tax collectors. If the characters pay, Six-Knives tips his hat with a chuckle, and the Road Raiders gallop away.": "六刀声称他是克莱恩的收税员，他需要每个角色拿出25戈比作为 \"道路'n'推理结构税\"。没有这样的税，而且人物不需要做任何检查就能知道这些流氓不是收税人。如果人物付了钱，\"六刀 \"就会笑着向他的帽子致敬，\"夺路者 \"就会飞奔而去。",
	"If the characters refuse to pay, Six-Knives clicks his tongue and rears his horse. \"Let's loosen their purse-strings, y'all!\" he roars, ordering the bandits to attack. All of them, including Six-Knives, are cowards, and any bandit reduced to fewer than half their hit points tries to flee in their next turn.": "如果这些人物拒绝付款，\"六刀 \"就会咬咬牙，勒紧马缰。\"让我们松开他们的钱袋子吧，你们！\"他吼道，命令强盗们进攻。所有的人，包括 \"六刀\"，都是胆小鬼，任何被削弱到命中率低于一半的强盗都会在下一回合试图逃跑。",
	"Future occurrences of this encounter are with Six-Knives at the head of the group—or, if he's dead, one of his protégés, now a {@creature bandit captain}—hoping to plunder more coin from the characters' pockets or exacting revenge for their earlier losses.": "以后再遇到这种情况时，六刀就会成为这群人的首领--如果他死了，就由他的一个门徒，现在是{@creature bandit captain}--希望从人物的口袋里掠夺更多的硬币，或者为他们先前的损失进行报复。",
	"This encounter takes place only if the characters are trailing behind the rivals and traveling at a fast pace to catch up with them. The time of day when this encounter occurs is up to you.

	"If you think a rival has a chance to achieve one of their goals (see the {@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x} in the {@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}), this is an opportunity for them to try to achieve that goal. For example, Maggie, who wants to spar with a tactical genius, might invite a character to take a seat at her Dragonchess board and have a game. While they play, she makes conversation about battle tactics—how she prefers to gang up on foes and overwhelm them, rather than engaging in a fair fight, since, in her words, \"People who fight fair don't win fights.\" Determine the winner of the game by having each participant make an Intelligence check at the end of the conversation, with victory going to whoever rolls the highest.": "如果你认为对手有机会实现他们的某个目标（见{@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}中的{@area Rivals' Goals table|02c|x}），这就是他们尝试实现这个目标的机会。例如，想和一个战术天才切磋的麦琪，可能会邀请一个角色在她的龙门棋盘前坐一坐，来一局。当他们玩的时候，她会谈论战斗策略--她更喜欢群殴敌人并压倒他们，而不是进行公平的战斗，因为用她的话说，\"公平战斗的人不会赢得战斗。\" 在谈话结束时，让每个参与者进行智力检查，谁的分数最高，谁就获胜，以此来决定游戏的赢家。",

	"The characters can't sneak up on the rivals on the open road. If the rivals are camping, any character who tries to sneak into the camp must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to avoid being detected by Galsariad.

If not, combat breaks out as he shouts to rouse his allies.": "在开放的道路上，人物不能偷袭对手。如果对手在扎营，任何试图潜入营地的角色都必须通过DC16灵巧（（%0%））的检查来避免被Galsariad发现。如果Galsariad发现了入侵者，但对其中一个或多个入侵者很友好或无动于衷，他愿意静静地把事情说清楚。如果不是，战斗就会爆发，因为他喊叫着要唤醒他的盟友。",

	"From around the corner of a crumbling building, five twitching, skinless masses of blinking eyes and slavering mouths wriggle into view. One of them is shredding the flesh of a hapless soldier in three of its amorphous maws. Trumpets blare an alarm, and several Aurora Watch soldiers hurry into the streets. One of them, a male drow, pauses to address you. \"Newcomers? No time for pleasantries—draw your weapons or get to safety! Find me at the barracks after!\"": "从一栋摇摇欲坠的建筑物的拐角处，五个抽搐的、没有皮肤的、眼睛眨动的、嘴里发出奴役声的物体蠕动着进入人们的视野。其中一个正在用它的三个无定形的大嘴撕碎一个无能的士兵的肉。喇叭响起了警报，几个曙光之神的士兵匆匆忙忙地跑到街上。其中一个男性乌鸦停顿了一下，对你说。\"新来的？没有时间寒暄了--拔出你们的武器，或者到安全的地方去！\"。之后到军营找我！\"",
	"Five {@creature Gibbering Mouther||gibbering mouthers} have sneaked into Bazzoxan and are intent on consuming anyone in their path.

	"To the people of Bazzoxan, Verin is a beacon of hope amid the darkness that shrouds the town. But the weight of responsibility colors Verin's otherwise bright and youthful demeanor with melancholy. He cares about the town he has sworn to protect, but he is weary of the incessant threat posed by the denizens of the Betrayers' Rise.": "对于巴佐桑的人们来说，维林是笼罩在该镇的黑暗中的希望之光。但责任的重压使维林原本明亮而年轻的举止染上了忧郁的色彩。他关心他发誓要保护的小镇，但他对背叛者崛起的居民所构成的持续威胁感到厌倦。",
	"The alarms sounding from watchtowers across the town indicate that similar attacks are happening in other areas.

Characters can tell from everyone's drawn faces and practiced movements that attacks like this occur often. The characters can either get involved in the fight or run for safety.": "全镇的瞭望塔发出的警报声表明，其他地区也在发生类似的攻击。平民们前往安全的建筑物，而曙光守望的成员则动员起来与威胁作斗争。角色可以从每个人的表情和练习过的动作中看出，这样的攻击经常发生。角色们要么参与战斗，要么逃往安全地带。",
	"If the characters choose to help the Aurora Watch, everyone rolls initiative. {@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN|Verin} and two orc {@creature Guard||guards} of the Aurora Watch stay with the party, while the rest of the soldiers leave to secure other parts of the city.": "如果角色们选择帮助极光守卫，每个人都会掷出主动权。曙光守卫的{@creature Verin Thelyss|CRCotN|Verin}和两个兽人{@creature Guard||guards}留在队伍中，其余的士兵则离开去保护城市的其他地方。",
	"If the rivals are accompanying the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin directs the rivals to assist in defense of the infirmary ({@area area B3|0fe|x}).

	"If the characters flee, they must find a safe building in which to hide. It quickly becomes clear that most such places have already been barricaded shut by the residents holed up inside them. A character who wants to get into one of these safe houses must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince its occupants to open the door. Alternatively, a character can make a DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to scan the area, finding an available safe house on a success. A character can make either check once per minute. Every time a character gets a failure on one of these checks, a {@creature gibbering mouther} emerges from hiding and attacks that character.": "如果人物逃跑，他们必须找到一个安全的建筑物来躲藏。很快就会发现，大多数这样的地方已经被躲在里面的居民封锁了。想进入这些安全屋的角色必须通过DC20魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检定成功，才能说服里面的人打开门。或者，一个角色可以用DC20的智慧({@skill Perception})检查来扫描这个区域，如果成功，就能找到一个可用的安全屋。一个角色每分钟可以做一次这样的检查。每当一个角色在这些检查中失败，一个{@creature gibbering mouther}就会从藏身处出现并攻击该角色。",
	"If the rivals are with the characters when they enter Bazzoxan, Verin orders the rivals to stay and fight while the characters flee. Ayo Jabe doesn't like taking orders, but she falls in line—as do her companions.": "如果对手在人物进入巴佐克山时与他们在一起，维林就会命令对手留下来作战，而人物则逃跑。阿尤-贾贝不喜欢接受命令，但她和她的同伴们一样，服从命令。",

	"After the gibbering mouthers have been defeated, Aurora Watch soldiers begin carrying the wounded to the infirmary ({@area area B3|0fe|x}).

	"If the characters are with Verin when the battle ends, he formally introduces himself as the leader of Bazzoxan and apologizes that their arrival was complicated by the gibbering mouther attack. He answers general questions about Bazzoxan (anything found in the \"Bazzoxan Overview\" section below) but soon excuses himself to check on the rest of the town. He leaves the characters to explore Bazzoxan at their leisure and invites them to meet with him later at the Gatehold Barracks ({@area area B4|104|x}).": "如果战斗结束时人物和维林在一起，他就会正式介绍自己是巴佐克山的领袖，并为他们的到来被胡言乱语的人袭击而感到抱歉。他回答了关于巴佐克山的一般问题（任何问题都可以在下面的 \"巴佐克山概述 \"部分找到），但很快就借口去检查镇上的其他地方。他让角色们在闲暇时探索巴佐克山，并邀请他们稍后在Gatehold兵营（{@area area B4|104|x}）与他会面。",
	"Bazzoxan hums with activity. People are cleaning up debris from the last attack, tending to the injured, performing last rites for the dead, repairing fortifications, and preparing for the next incursion.

On rare occasions, more powerful demons attack, or demonic energy animates the bodies of dead Aurora Watch soldiers.": "巴佐克山充满了活力。人们正在清理上次袭击的残骸，照顾伤员，为死者举行最后的仪式，修理防御工事，并为下一次入侵做准备。由 \"背叛者的崛起 \"中的恶魔创造的口齿不清的人是常见的威胁，还有矮人、夸塞特和其他较小的恶魔。在极少数情况下，更强大的恶魔会发动攻击，或者恶魔的能量会使死去的极光守望士兵的尸体变得生动。",
	"Most of the town's inhabitants are soldiers who understand that their role here is not to defeat the horrors in the Betrayers' Rise, but to keep them in check for as long as possible.

	"Bazzoxan was once a thriving mining town, but it was ravaged when explorers awakened a portal to the Abyss in the depths of the Betrayers' Rise. Many of the town's buildings were destroyed when the first surge of demons attacked, and the town was hastily converted into a military outpost to hold the demons at bay. The only structures regularly tended to are the Aurora Watch barracks, most of which are buildings converted from their original purpose.": "巴佐桑曾经是一个繁荣的采矿镇，但当探险家们在背叛者崛起的深处唤醒了一个通往深渊的入口时，它被蹂躏了。当第一波恶魔袭击时，镇上的许多建筑都被摧毁了，镇子被匆忙地改成了军事前哨，以抵御恶魔的侵袭。唯一有规律的建筑是极光守望的军营，其中大部分是由原来的用途改造的建筑。",
	"Among the most prominent features of Bazzoxan are the town's two sacrifice engines, each one a 30-foot-deep pit lined with rows of silver blades. The blades can be made to spin by pulling a lever near the edge of the pit. A creature in the pit while the blades are spinning takes 44 ({@dice 8d10}) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns.": "巴佐桑最突出的特点是该镇的两个祭祀引擎，每个引擎都是一个30英尺深的坑，坑里有一排排银色的刀片。通过拉动坑边的杠杆，可以使刀片旋转。当刀片旋转时，坑里的生物在每个回合开始时都会受到44({@dice 8d10})的砍伤。",
	"In bygone days, servants of the Betrayer Gods threw mortals into these pits to appease their evil lords. Now, the Aurora Watch herds demons and other monsters into them to avoid prolonged battles.": "在过去的日子里，背叛者之神的仆人将凡人扔进这些坑里，以安抚他们邪恶的领主。现在，极光守望者将恶魔和其他怪物放进坑里，以避免长时间的战斗。",
	"The majority of Bazzoxan's inhabitants are members of the Aurora Watch. Also residing here are a handful of Kryn Dynasty arcanists attempting to find and seal the planar rifts that threaten the city. Dealing with these phenomena is far beyond the characters' abilities at present, and in any event they can't afford to linger in Bazzoxan, lest their rivals find the prayer site of Avandra before them. Nonetheless, this chapter provides an opportunity for you to foreshadow the devastation that the rift to the Netherdeep can cause for Ank'Harel later in the adventure.": "巴佐克斯安的大部分居民是极光守望的成员。这里还居住着少数克里恩王朝的奥术师，他们试图找到并封印威胁该城市的平面裂缝。处理这些现象远远超出了人物目前的能力，而且无论如何他们都不能在巴佐克山逗留，以免他们的对手在他们之前找到阿凡达的祈祷地。尽管如此，这一章还是为你提供了一个机会，预示着通往尼瑟斯底层的裂缝会在以后的冒险中对安克哈勒造成破坏。",
	"The few civilians who remain in Bazzoxan support the soldiers as well as they can and are trained in the basics of combat in case the forces from the Betrayers' Rise begin to overwhelm the military. Most residents are drow, but some goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears, orcs, and other Xhorhasian folk live here as well.": "留在巴佐桑的少数平民尽可能地支持士兵，并接受基本的战斗训练，以防背叛者崛起的部队开始压倒军队。大多数居民是鸦人，但也有一些地精、霍布格林、虫人、兽人和其他Xhorhasian人住在这里。",

The Bazzoxan Scenes table provides suggestions for small engagements the characters can experience while exploring the town.": "巴佐克山的大多数居民都避免交谈，如果有人找他们谈话，他们会说需要处理自己的职责。巴佐克山的场景表提供了人物在探索该镇时可以经历的小型约定的建议。",

	"After the encounter with the gibbering mouthers, the rivals lose some of their bluster. Though they try to keep up appearances, they are severely shaken by the experience. Galsariad is the most deeply affected, his already sarcastic demeanor becoming close to insulting toward friend and foe alike as his insecurities threaten to rise to the surface. Irvan becomes withdrawn, overwhelmed by the oppressive atmosphere in Bazzoxan and the morbid humor of the locals. Dermot throws himself fervently into following the Luxon's precepts, determined to do whatever it takes to protect his friends and rarely leaving Ayo's side. If he is persuaded to take a moment away from the group, he talks openly about his concerns. He recognizes that his friends have been traumatized and would like them to go home rather than continuing. No matter what, he intends to support them to the end.": "在遇到胡言乱语的人之后，对手们失去了一些虚张声势的能力。虽然他们试图保持表面形象，但他们被这次经历严重震撼了。加萨里德受到的影响最深，他本来就讽刺的举止变得对朋友和敌人都近乎侮辱，因为他的不安全感有可能上升到表面。欧文变得孤僻，被巴佐克山的压抑气氛和当地人的病态幽默所淹没。德莫特狂热地投入到遵守卢克逊的戒律中，决心不惜一切代价保护他的朋友，并且很少离开阿尤的身边。如果他被劝说离开这群人一会儿，他就会公开谈论他的担忧。他认识到他的朋友们已经受到了创伤，希望他们回家，而不是继续。无论怎样，他都打算支持他们到最后。",
	"If Ayo was injured in the encounter as a result of the characters' decision to run and hide, the rivals are hostile toward whomever they see as the characters' leader, and Maggie Keeneyes is hostile toward the entire party because of their cowardice. Ayo is shaken by the injuries, causing her to question her skill as a leader, but she bears no ill will toward the characters for putting their safety first.": "如果Ayo在遭遇战中受伤是由于角色们决定逃跑和躲藏的结果，那么对手们就会对他们认为是角色们的领导者的人产生敌意，而Maggie Keeneyes则会因为他们的胆怯而对整个队伍产生敌意。阿尤因受伤而动摇，使她对自己作为领袖的能力产生了怀疑，但她对角色们把自己的安全放在第一位的做法没有恶意。",

	"The two men are Reynard Allerton, a chaotic good {@creature scout}, and his bigger, older brother, Sebastian Allerton, a neutral good {@creature thug}. Their crematorium has two furnaces, each of which can hold up to four Medium bodies or one Large body at a time. The brothers are responsible for the proper disposal of corpses. Reynard seems to be the more gregarious of the siblings, although if the characters can coax Sebastian out of his silence with a joke or a kind remark, the older brother is also revealed to be a good-natured chatterbox.": "这两个人是雷纳德-艾勒顿（Reynard Allerton），一个混乱的好人（%0%），和他更大的哥哥，塞巴斯蒂安-艾勒顿（Sebastian Allerton），一个中立的好人（%1%）。他们的火葬场有两个炉子，每个炉子一次最多可以容纳四具中型尸体或一具大型尸体。兄弟俩负责妥善处理尸体。雷纳德似乎是兄弟俩中比较健谈的一个，不过如果人物能用一个笑话或一句好话把塞巴斯蒂安从沉默中哄出来，这个哥哥也会被发现是一个好脾气的话匣子。",

	"As the brothers (and any characters who decide to assist them) work through the stack of corpses, Reynard becomes increasingly reluctant to continue, asking the characters to tend to the bodies and making excuses for why he should tend the fire. A character who succeeds on a DC 11 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can tell that he's deliberately avoiding one of the large corpses near the bottom of the pile, out of disdain and horror.": "当兄弟俩（以及任何决定协助他们的角色）在这堆尸体中工作时，雷纳德变得越来越不愿意继续，他要求角色们照料尸体，并为他应该照料火堆找借口。一个通过DC11智慧（（%0%））检查成功的人物可以看出，他出于不屑和惊恐，故意避开靠近尸堆底部的一具大型尸体。",
	"Characters who are helping with the pile of bodies find the source of Reynard's disgust: a dead vrock whose body reeks of offal and blood. Reynard has been putting off the task of burning it because he finds the demon repulsive and because the corpse hasn't dissolved into a pool of demonic ichor as it should have, which suggests some sort of abnormality.": "正在帮助处理尸体堆的人物发现了雷纳德厌恶的源头：一个死掉的弗洛克，其身体散发着内脏和血腥味。雷纳德一直在拖延烧掉它的任务，因为他觉得这个恶魔令人厌恶，而且尸体没有像它应该的那样溶化成一滩恶魔的汁液，这表明它有某种异常情况。",
	"Before anyone can dispose of the vrock's remains, a commotion arises nearby:": "在所有人都能处理好弗洛克的遗体之前，附近出现了一阵骚动。",
	"\"Wait! Stop!\" a voice shouts from down the street. A bookish tiefling jogs into view. A variety of archaeology tools hang at his waist along with a satchel holding his notebooks. \"You can't burn that yet. I need to study it!\" Reaching into the satchel, he pulls out a badge and holds it up, as if the badge alone explained his reason for being here.": "\"等等！停下！\"一个声音从街道上喊道。一个书生气十足的铁弗林慢悠悠地走进了人们的视野。他腰间挂着各种考古工具，还有一个装着笔记本的挎包。\"你还不能烧掉这个。我需要研究它！\" 他把手伸进书包里，掏出一个徽章并举起来，仿佛光是这个徽章就能解释他来这里的原因。",
	"The tiefling is {@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN}, a lawful neutral {@creature scholarly agent|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix A|CRCotN|8}) from the Allegiance of Allsight.

	"Prolix introduces himself as an archaeologist from Ank'Harel, a city on the distant continent of Marquet.

	"Lacking experience with dead bodies, Prolix turns to the characters for assistance. A character who wants to extract the contents of the vrock's stomach must first cleave through the vrock's hide. To do so, the character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. A failed check triggers an eruption of spores from the vrock's corpse that fill a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the corpse. All creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned}.

	"A spectral figure blossoms forth from the amulet. This warrior, who called himself Alyxian in your previous vision, looks up at you with a faint smile and says, \"You came... you followed... you can find me.\" The crystals around you glow brightly, and your vision goes white. Then you see a company of armored soldiers, Alyxian among them, marching into the Betrayers' Rise. Their expressions are grim. Though they do not speak, you can tell that none of them expects to come home.": "一个幽灵般的身影从护身符中绽放出来。这个在你之前的幻象中自称为阿利仙的战士抬头看着你，带着淡淡的微笑说：\"你来了......你跟来了......你可以找到我。\" 你周围的水晶发着亮光，你的视野变成白色。然后你看到一连的装甲士兵，其中有阿利仙，正行进在背叛者的崛起中。他们的表情是严峻的。虽然他们不说话，但你可以看出他们中没有人期望回家。",
	"The vision shifts again, and everyone in the company of soldiers is dead except for Alyxian, who continues to fight while surrounded by the corpses of mortals and demons. He is hurled across the battlefield by the claws of a gorilla-like demon. The scene blurs, and he falls to his knees, pleading, before a simple wooden altar that bears the holy symbol of Avandra. At the end of his prayer, he's lifted to his feet by a tall young woman with light brown skin and flowing black hair.": "视线再次转移，连队里的每个人都死了，除了阿利贤，他在被凡人和恶魔的尸体包围时继续战斗。他被一个大猩猩般的恶魔的爪子扔到了战场上。场景模糊了，他跪倒在一个简单的木制祭坛前，恳求着，上面有阿凡达的神圣标志。在他的祈祷结束时，他被一个有着浅棕色皮肤和飘逸黑发的高大年轻女子扶起。",
	"A foreboding voice cuts through this scene of divine intervention, and Alyxian freezes. \"The Change Bringer and a mortal,\" the voice intones. \"What brings you into my sacred, devouring darkness? Even if you save him, Change Bringer, he will suffer. He will die. He will be forgotten. All that he has worked to save will crumble and be devoured by worms. Why invite further suffering? Let go. Give in. All is futile in the end, so why...\"": "一个不祥的声音划破了这个神圣的干预场面，阿利贤愣住了。\"变化的使者和一个凡人，\"这个声音沉吟道。\"是什么让你进入我神圣的、吞噬性的黑暗？即使你救了他，变化使者，他也会受苦。他将死去。他将被遗忘。他所努力拯救的一切都会崩溃，被虫子吞噬。为什么要招致更多的痛苦？放手吧。屈服吧。一切到头来都是徒劳的，那么为什么......\"",
	"As the voice trails off, Alyxian turns to face you and falls to his knees in tears. The scenery shifts, and the forsaken warrior is now underwater, amid the ruins of a sunken city. \"The Crawling King spoke true,\" he mutters. \"All was futile. All has been forgotten... and I am lost in darkness. Please, help me set it right.\"": "随着声音的消失，阿利森转过身来面对你，跪倒在地，泪流满面。景色变了，这个被抛弃的战士现在在水下，在一座沉没的城市的废墟中。\"爬行王说的是真的，\"他喃喃道。\"一切都是徒劳的。一切都被遗忘了......而我在黑暗中迷失了。请帮助我把它纠正过来。\"",
	"The final scene of the vision takes place in the Drowned City of Cael Morrow; recalling the appearance of this location will help the characters as they seek more information about the Apotheon in {@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}.": "异象的最后一幕发生在Cael Morrow的淹没之城；当人物在（%0%）中寻找更多关于Apotheon的信息时，回忆起这个地点的外观将有助于他们。",
	"The vision persists long enough for the characters to speak to Alyxian for a few moments. Once the characters have had three questions answered, the vision ends as new arrivals come on the scene (see \"Confrontation for the Jewel\" below). Alyxian addresses the characters' questions with the following information:": "异象持续的时间足以让人物与阿利森交谈片刻。一旦人物得到了三个问题的回答，幻象就会结束，因为有新的人来到了现场（见下面的 \"为宝石而对抗\"）。Alyxian用以下信息来回答人物的问题。",

	"He fought in the Calamity and was called the Apotheon because he beseeched the gods for power three times and three times received it—first on the shores of Wildemount, again in the depths of the Betrayers' Rise, and once more in a temple of Corellon the Arch Heart in a city of elves and orcs in the jungles of Marquet. These divine gifts transformed him from a mortal being into something more. Alyxian says that the city of elves and orcs was destroyed centuries ago. (This is partly true; the city Alyxian speaks of is now the underwater ruin called Cael Morrow, described in {@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}.)": "他在灾难中战斗，被称为阿普特恩，因为他三次向诸神祈求力量，三次都得到了力量--第一次是在荒野山庄的海岸，第二次是在背叛者崛起的深处，还有一次是在马奎特丛林中的精灵和兽人城市中的拱心神殿。这些神圣的礼物将他从一个凡人转变为更多的东西。Alyxian说那座精灵和兽人之城在几个世纪前就被摧毁了。（这部分是真的；Alyxian所说的城市现在是名为Cael Morrow的水下废墟，在{@adventure chapter 5|CRCotN|5}中描述。）",
	"Alyxian is imprisoned in an underwater place lit by a crimson glow. He grows angry as he explains that mortals are harvesting the source of the glow and leaving him in darkness, and that this act is torture for him. (This is both true and an indication of the Apotheon's emotional state; his fury is simmering beneath his sorrowful demeanor.)": "Alyxian被囚禁在一个被深红色光芒照亮的水下场所。他越来越愤怒，因为他解释说，凡人正在收割光芒的来源，把他留在黑暗中，这种行为对他来说是一种折磨。(这既是事实，也表明了阿波提翁的情绪状态；他的愤怒在他悲伤的举止下酝酿着）。",
	"Alyxian answers other questions as well as he can, drawing from information in the \"{@area Story Overview|00b|x}\" section of the {@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}. He portrays himself as sympathetic and helpless.": "Alyxian尽可能地回答了其他问题，他从{@adventure introduction|CRCotN|0}的\"{@area Story Overview|00b|x} \"部分的信息中得到了启发。他把自己描绘成富有同情心和无助的人。",

In Ank'Harel (and in much of Marquet at large), the god of death and fate is perceived differently from how she is regarded in the lands of Wildemount, Tal'Dorei, and Issylra. Bereft of her moniker \"the Raven Queen,\" here the god is associated with twilight, inevitability, and the passage of time, and she presides over the transition between life and death.

	"Situated on the far western side of the Guided District, the octagonal Tower of Memory juts out of the ground at a slightly crooked angle. The building was slated for demolition when the founder of the Sentinels of Memory, Watcher Trast, purchased it to use as a home for his small but zealous group of followers. The Sentinels have since spent little time repairing the structure, so cracks still show between the ivory bricks, and the wooden floorboards creak with every step.": "八角形的记忆之塔位于指导区的最西边，以一个稍微弯曲的角度伸出地面。当记忆哨兵的创始人，守望者特拉斯特，购买了这座建筑，作为他的小规模但狂热的追随者的家时，这座建筑就被计划拆除了。此后，哨兵们几乎没有花时间修理这座建筑，所以象牙色的砖块之间仍有裂缝，木质地板每走一步都会吱吱作响。",

	"Since all skyships in operation across Exandria must come to the shipyard once a year for maintenance and repair, the area near the shipyard has become a hodgepodge of cultures from around the world.

	"Built partially into the side of the mountain that borders the north side of the district, the Sunfire Forge is the premier blacksmith and weapons manufacturer in Ank'Harel. Its name comes from the forge's unique power source: liquid sunlight, harvested from the iridescent crystals lining its roof. The consistent heat of this concentrated form of energy allows for the creation of fine metalwork that incorporates fragile components such as arcane minerals and gem dust. Two glowing streams of sunfire cascade down the sides of the forge's pitched roof before coming to rest in stone reservoirs, where the liquid is stored before being funneled into the forge.": "太阳火锻造厂部分建在与该区北侧接壤的山的一侧，是安克哈雷尔的首要铁匠和武器制造商。它的名字来自于锻造厂独特的动力来源：液体阳光，从其屋顶上的彩虹色晶体中获取的。这种集中的能量形式所产生的持续热量，使其能够创造出精细的金属制品，其中包含了脆弱的成分，如奥术矿物和宝石粉。两股发光的太阳之火从锻炉倾斜的屋顶两侧倾泻而下，然后停在石头水库中，液体在被输送到锻炉之前被储存在那里。",

	"Its atmosphere permeated by the smell of wet earth, the River District is where most of the city's farming is done.

	"The Life Dome also serves an important agricultural purpose. Because the water that fills Ank'Harel's oasis flows not from a natural source but from underground caverns created by the acts of the gods, the water level frequently fluctuates. The water can surge forth or slow to a trickle, threatening to bring about floods or dry spells, respectively. To counteract this problem, the Life Dome instantly transmutes any water that exceeds the accepted level into vapor and stores it in the seams of the dome. When the water level drops, the stored vapor is transmuted back into liquid and fed into the irrigation canals.": "生命穹顶也有一个重要的农业用途。由于填充安克哈勒绿洲的水不是来自自然源头，而是来自众神行为所创造的地下洞穴，因此水位经常波动。水可能会涌出或减缓到涓涓细流，分别威胁到洪水或旱灾的发生。为了解决这个问题，生命穹顶将任何超过公认水位的水瞬间转化为蒸汽，并将其储存在穹顶的缝隙中。当水位下降时，储存的水蒸气又被转化为液体，并被输送到灌溉渠中。",

The Allegiance has recently located an item that was stolen during an encounter with one such thief: a {@item Figurine of Wondrous Power, Marble Elephant||figurine of wondrous power (marble elephant)}, now lying among the oddities and trinkets for sale at the Bone Garden in the Suncut Bazaar.

	"\"I rarely get visitors,\" the gnome explains before turning to face the Life Dome. He holds aloft a thin shard of iridescent, glowing quartz, and, with a quiet hum, one of the dome's glass panels suddenly comes alight with blue and purple arcane runes—which then flicker and fade, leaving behind an opening. \"Come on in! I'll give you the tour.\"": "\"我很少有访客，\"地精解释说，然后转身面对生命穹顶。他高举一块薄薄的彩虹色发光石英碎片，随着一声轻哼，穹顶的一块玻璃板突然亮起了蓝色和紫色的奥术符文--然后闪烁消逝，留下了一个开口。\"进来吧! 我给你介绍一下。\"",
	"The inside of the dome is humid and sweltering, the smell of damp earth hitting one's senses along with a blast of hot air. A series of crystal bridges span the oasis's 60-foot-diameter lake, and the edges of the dome are lined with vegetation. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 17 or higher notice a brief, cool current of air as they begin to move about inside the dome (the side effect of an {@creature invisible stalker} stealing Carliale's magic crystal).": "穹顶内部潮湿而闷热，潮湿的泥土气息与一阵阵热气一起冲击着人们的感官。一系列的水晶桥横跨绿洲的60英尺直径的湖泊，穹顶的边缘长满了植物。被动智慧({@skill Perception})得分在17分以上的角色在开始在穹顶内活动时，会注意到一股短暂的、凉爽的气流（这是{@creature invisible stalker}偷窃卡利亚尔的魔法水晶的副作用）。",

A character who surveys the area and makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds no disturbance in the sediment that would suggest an underground passage to lower caverns.": "湖底是一层厚厚的淤泥。勘察该区域并成功进行DC15智慧（（%0%））检查的人物，发现沉积物中没有任何扰动，表明有通往更低洞穴的地下通道。",

	"Relics retrieved from the Allegiance of Allsight's expeditions indicate that Cael Morrow was the site of a pre-Calamity society originally built above the water. Carliale theorizes that natural tectonic shifting caused the city to slip beneath the surface, but the fluctuation of the water level in the caverns seems to defy explanation.": "从Allegiance of Allsight的探险中收回的遗物表明，Cael Morrow是一个前卡拉米特社会的遗址，最初建在水面上。Carliale推断，自然构造的变化导致城市滑落到地表之下，但洞穴中水位的波动似乎无法解释。",
	"The Life Dome regulates the water flow to and through the canals. Using a combination of enchantment and engineering, the Life Dome dispenses water from the lake into the major canals while also drawing extra moisture from the air to supplement the water flow when necessary.": "生命之穹调节流入和通过运河的水流。利用魔法和工程的结合，生命穹顶将湖水分配到主要运河中，同时也从空气中吸取额外的水分，在必要时补充水流。",
	"The Life Dome normally functions automatically. As chief supervisor, Carliale can manually override the dome's controls and adjust the water level as needed.": "生命穹顶通常自动运行。作为首席监督员，卡利亚尔可以手动控制穹顶的控制装置，并根据需要调整水位。",

He assures the party that he must have dropped it back at the entrance.": "在谈话的某个时刻，卡利亚尔注意到他的奥术超控器--他用来打开生命穹顶的入口和调整穹顶控制的魔法水晶--已经从他的口袋里消失了。他向大家保证，他一定是把它丢在了入口处。",
	"As Carliale begins searching for his missing arcane override crystal, read:": "当卡利亚尔开始寻找他丢失的奥术超控水晶时，请阅读。",
	"The surface of the lake begins to churn white with foam, and seconds later an enormous geyser of water bursts upward and outward, sending you flying.": "湖面开始搅动白色的泡沫，几秒钟后，一个巨大的水泉向上和向外迸发，把你送上天。",
	"Everyone in the Life Dome is swept outside the dome and propelled along a 5-foot-deep canal by the sudden surge of water.": "生命穹顶中的每个人都被冲到穹顶之外，被突然涌来的水推到一个5英尺深的运河上。",
	"When they see that the characters survived the surge, two {@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers} move in for the kill. The {@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers} were summoned by Professor Lymmle Wist and infiltrated the Life Dome a short time ago without Carliale's knowledge, slipping through the entrance as the gnome arrived for work. The {@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers} focus their attacks on the characters, ignoring Carliale.": "当他们看到这些人物在激增中幸存下来时，两个（%0%）就开始行动，准备杀人。这两个{@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers}是由Lymmle Wist教授召唤出来的，不久前在Carliale不知情的情况下潜入了生命穹顶，在地精上班的时候从入口处溜走。2%）将他们的攻击集中在人物身上，无视卡利亚尔。",
	"After the battle, Carliale suspects that the {@condition invisible} stalkers' summoner is associated with either the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream or the Sentinels of Memory.

	"Characters who encountered the {@creature invisible stalker} at {@area Mystic Pursuits|1c9|x} (described earlier in the chapter) might assume that Amkezne, the owner of that shop, is behind the Life Dome incident. Amkezne denies any involvement and is telling the truth. If the characters use magical coercion or threaten to report her to the Hands of Ord, Amkezne tells them that she learned how to summon {@creature Invisible Stalker||invisible stalkers} in her final year at the Crystal Chateau and that the professor who taught her the arcane ritual was Lymmle Wist (see {@area mission 3|1e6|x} of this story track).": "在(%%1%)遇到{@creature invisible stalker}的角色（在本章前面有描述）可能会认为该店的老板Amkezne是生命穹顶事件的幕后推手。Amkezne否认有任何牵连，说的是实话。如果人物使用魔法胁迫或威胁要向奥德之手举报她，Amkezne会告诉他们，她在水晶城堡的最后一年学会了如何召唤（%%2%），教她奥术仪式的教授是Lymmle Wist（见本故事轨道的%%3%）。",
	"After foiling the ambush, the characters can take a moment to regroup before returning to the Crystal Chateau. After he hears their report, Prolix pays the characters the agreed amount of 300 gp and deeply apologizes for the events of the day. He expresses gratitude for the characters' skill, saying that he wishes the Allegiance of Allsight had more like them among their ranks.": "挫败伏击后，角色们可以在返回水晶城堡前花点时间重整旗鼓。在听取了他们的报告后，普罗利克斯向这些人物支付了约定的300金币，并为今天的事件深表歉意。他对这些人物的技能表示感谢，并说他希望 \"全知之盟 \"的队伍中有更多像他们这样的人。",
	"If this mission is successful, Prolix recommends the characters to Headmaster {@creature Gryz Alakritos|CRCotN} as potential new members. Within a week, Alakritos presents each character with a formal invitation to join the faction's ranks. Membership comes with the following benefits:": "如果这个任务成功，普利克斯就会向校长（%0%）推荐这些人物作为潜在的新成员。在一个星期内，阿拉克里托斯向每个角色发出正式邀请，邀请他们加入该派系的行列。会员资格有以下好处。",
	"Each new member receives an Allegiance of Allsight badge, which can be presented as proof of membership. If a badge is lost, a new one can be issued for 50 gp.": "每个新成员都会收到一个Allegiance of Allsight徽章，它可以作为成员资格的证明。如果徽章丢失，可以花50金币发行一个新的徽章。",

	"Lymmle previously owned a {@item ring of red fury|CRCotN} (see {@adventure appendix B|CRCotN|9|{@item Ring of Red Fury|CRCotN}}), which was given to her by the Consortium as a reward for her services.

Recently, with the Allegiance of Allsight on high alert after the attack at the Life Dome, Lymmle planted the ring on {@creature Prolix Yusaf|CRCotN} and plans to falsely accuse the tiefling of being a traitor.

	"Cael Morrow, the Drowned City, is the grave of thousands of Gruumsh's victims. Even Alyxian's sacrifice, which protected much of the land of Marquet at the cost of his freedom, could not save the city. Now, the center of Cael Morrow is a planar rift born from the place where Gruumsh's spear struck the earth.

The rift will draw the characters and their rivals into conflict once more—with the chance to become heroes.": "淹没之城Cael Morrow是成千上万格鲁姆什受害者的坟墓。即使是阿莱克斯安的牺牲，以他的自由为代价保护了马奎特的大部分土地，也无法拯救这座城市。现在，凯尔-莫罗的中心是一个平面裂缝，诞生于格鲁姆什的长矛击打大地的地方。这个裂缝是通往Netherdeep的大门，是腐蚀元素Ruidium的源头，也是Ank'Harel各派别的一个迷恋对象。这条裂缝将把人物和他们的对手再次卷入冲突--有机会成为英雄。",

	"{@creature Ayo Jabe (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Ayo Jabe}. Ayo's drive to prove herself a hero, and to prove herself superior to the characters, has brought her to this place.

Ayo is filled with cold fury toward anything that stands in her way, including her own insecurities.": "{@creature Ayo Jabe (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Ayo Jabe}. 阿尤想证明自己是个英雄，想证明自己比那些人物高明，这种动力把她带到了这个地方。她意识到她的追求使她的朋友们受到了创伤。这种感觉使她怀疑自己的领导能力。阿尤对任何挡在她面前的东西都充满了冷酷的愤怒，包括她自己的不安全感。",

Irvan fears that any further mistake could cost him his life—permanently.": "{@creature Irvan Wastewalker (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Irvan Wastewalker}. 当他在凯尔-莫罗（Cael Morrow）与滑行血鳍的战斗中失去手臂时，艾文的骑士风度消失了。他的派别盟友为他安装了一个时尚而实用的奥术假肢，但这次与死亡的擦肩而过使他变得脾气暴躁、小心翼翼和不信任。欧文担心，任何进一步的错误都会使他永久地失去生命。",
	"{@creature Maggie Keeneyes (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Maggie Keeneyes}. A deep melancholy has taken root in Maggie's heart. She continues the mission out of love for Ayo, but she fears that her leader's determination might not be enough to achieve victory.

She has shared her misgivings about this organization with Ayo on several occasions.": "{@creature Maggie Keeneyes (Tier 3)|CRCotN|Maggie Keeneyes}. 一种深深的忧郁在麦琪的心中扎下了根。出于对阿尤的爱，她继续执行任务，但她担心她的领导人的决心可能不足以取得胜利。玛姬不相信卡奥-莫罗（Cael Morrow）的Allsight特工（即使对手已经与该派别结盟），认为他们受到一股邪恶力量的影响。她曾多次与阿尤分享她对这个组织的疑虑。",
	"The rivals have become affiliated with a faction of your choice, most likely the Consortium of the Vermilion Dream.

	"A good time for the characters to encounter the rivals is when the characters try to leave Cael Morrow with something valuable in their possession, such as the Key to the Netherdeep (see the faction story tracks in {@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}) or the {@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN} in its {@item Jewel of Three Prayers (Exalted)|CRCotN|Exalted State} (see {@area area M9|2ad|x}).": "角色遇到对手的好时机是当角色试图带着有价值的东西离开Cael Morrow时，例如Netherdeep的钥匙（见{@adventure chapter 4|CRCotN|4}中的派系故事轨道）或其{@item Jewel of Three Prayers (Exalted)|CRCotN|Exalted State}中的{@item Jewel of Three Prayers|CRCotN}（见{@area area M9|2ad|x}）。",
	"If the characters get the better of the rivals in this chapter, you can use the rivals' defeat to change the pace of the exploration of the Netherdeep in the next chapter. The rivals could take a few days to lick their wounds and prepare for the next encounter with the characters. Or the rivals' defeat could reenergize them, prompting them to try to get a head start on exploring the Netherdeep.": "如果人物在这一章中战胜了对手，你可以利用对手的失败来改变下一章中探索尼瑟德普的节奏。竞争对手可以用几天时间来舔舐他们的伤口，为下一次与角色的相遇做准备。或者，对手的失败可以让他们重新振作起来，促使他们在探索Netherdeep的过程中取得先机。",

	"Rare are the things that remain beautiful after their deaths—Cael Morrow is one of them. Through the efforts of the Allegiance of Allsight, portions of the sunken city have been reclaimed and magically warded against the pervasive deluge.

	"Two of the ghosts look like male elves, and the third looks like a female orc. All three are dressed in elegant robes trimmed with fine embroidery. The ghosts are not hostile; they try to possess creatures only so they can share their stories and thus find peace after death, but they defend themselves if attacked. While possessing a creature, a ghost moves the creature's body as far from combat as possible and doesn't force the creature to attack.": "其中两个鬼魂看起来像男性精灵，第三个看起来像女性兽人。这三个人都穿着优雅的长袍，上面有精美的刺绣。鬼魂没有敌意；他们试图占有生物，只是为了让他们能够分享自己的故事，从而在死后找到安宁，但如果受到攻击，他们会自我保护。在附身于生物时，鬼魂会将生物的身体尽可能地远离战斗，并且不强迫生物进行攻击。",
	"Any character who is possessed by one of the ghosts experiences a vision of the ghost's past life: their families and friends, the shining alabaster spires of their city in its prime, and the frantic attempts at evacuation as Gruumsh began his assault. The vision ends with a scene showing the two elves and the orc in a splendid library, about to sacrifice their lives in a futile attempt to preserve their history so that those they loved would not be forgotten. They look out from a library window and behold a nearby temple. A lone warrior with a spear and shield—Alyxian—stands atop the building. He is cast in shadow while the hundred-foot-tall figure of Gruumsh looms over him and laughs. As Gruumsh's spear descends on the temple, the vision goes dark. The vision takes 1 minute to play out in full. When it is over, the ghost ends the possession.": "任何被鬼魂附身的角色都会经历鬼魂过去生活的幻象：他们的家人和朋友，他们的城市在全盛时期闪耀的雪花石尖顶，以及格鲁姆什开始进攻时疯狂的疏散尝试。幻象以一个场景结束，显示两个精灵和兽人在一个富丽堂皇的图书馆里，即将牺牲他们的生命，徒劳地试图保存他们的历史，以便他们所爱的人不会被遗忘。他们从图书馆的窗户向外看，看到了附近的一座神庙。一个手持长矛和盾牌的孤独战士--亚利桑--站在建筑物的顶端。他被笼罩在阴影中，而格鲁姆什那一百英尺高的身影在他头上晃动并大笑。当格鲁姆什的长矛落在神庙上时，视野变暗。幻象需要1分钟的时间才能完全展现出来。当它结束时，鬼魂结束了附身。",

	"Leaving behind the bustling streets of Ank'Harel and the gloom of Cael Morrow, the party now navigates the dark waters of the Netherdeep.

The Netherdeep is never fully isolated from any of these quasi-real locations. Ruidium formations, sea grass, and white coral appear on the outskirts of these places, and puddles of water lie on the ground—indications that the Netherdeep is not far away.": "当他们进入某些房间（区域{@area N2|2ec|x}、{@area N3|2f7|x}、{@area N4|2ff|x}、{@area N5|30d|x}和{@area N7|323|x}）时，角色会被传送到非水下的新地点--在那里他们可以与Alyxian过去的角色和地点互动，而实际上并没有改变过去。Netherdeep从未完全与这些准真实的地点隔离。在这些地方的外围出现了Ruidium结构、海草和白色珊瑚，地面上有水坑--这表明Netherdeep离我们并不遥远。",
	"Like living dioramas, these scenarios consist of more than just the characters witnessing events of Alyxian's life that he regrets; the characters are experiencing these moments from Alyxian's perspective and are given a chance to change what he did or might have done—not to change the past, but to help the Apotheon confront the choices he made. Some players will figure out this situation quickly, but others might need additional hints. For example, figures dressed in old styles of clothing and using obscure idioms might suggest to the characters that they've been transported not only to another place, but another time.": "就像活的透视画一样，这些场景不仅仅包括人物目睹Alyxian生活中令他后悔的事件；人物从Alyxian的角度体验这些时刻，并有机会改变他所做的或可能做的事情--不是为了改变过去，而是帮助Apotheon面对他所做的选择。有些玩家会很快弄清这种情况，但其他人可能需要额外的提示。例如，穿着旧式服装和使用晦涩成语的人物可能会暗示人物，他们不仅被带到了另一个地方，而且是另一个时代。",
	"Various effects in the Netherdeep can twist and amplify the emotions of visitors, causing them to act irrationally. They might be tempted to give in to their vices, face up to their flaws, or suffer in the same ways that Alyxian has. This effect doesn't use the rules for madness; rather, the visitors are being tormented by unresolved suffering, and this distinction will make for a more rewarding outcome if the characters help Alyxian reach catharsis in the final confrontation.": "Netherdeep中的各种效应可以扭曲和放大来访者的情绪，导致他们的行为不理性。他们可能会被诱惑向自己的恶习屈服，直面自己的缺陷，或者以Alyxian的方式遭受痛苦。这个效果没有使用疯狂的规则；相反，来访者正在被未解决的痛苦所折磨，如果角色在最后的对抗中帮助阿利仙达到宣泄，这种区别会使结果更有意义。",
	"The Apotheon's voice accompanies the characters while they explore the Grottoes of Regret. Within the grottoes, the Apotheon's tone is sorrowful, even reluctant, but helpful. He has spent many years wallowing in these torments and clings to them—they are familiar comforts at the same time that they wound him.": "阿普提翁的声音伴随着人物探索悔恨洞窟的过程。在石窟里，阿普特翁的语气是悲哀的，甚至是不情愿的，但却很有帮助。他多年来一直沉浸在这些折磨中，并紧紧抓住这些折磨--这些折磨既是他熟悉的安慰，同时也让他受伤。",
	"The Apotheon is never more than a disembodied voice in the Grottoes of Regret, but he's more willing to talk to the characters in this region than anywhere else in the Netherdeep. When the characters enter certain areas for the first time, the Apotheon pulls them out of the Netherdeep and drops them into scenes that hearken back to past events that continue to haunt him. His reason for involving the characters in these regretful episodes comes from one or more of these motivations:": "阿普特恩在悔恨之窟中从来都只是一个虚无的声音，但他在这个区域比在尼瑟斯底的任何地方都更愿意与角色交谈。当角色们第一次进入某些区域时，阿波提翁把他们从尼瑟斯地府拉出来，并把他们扔到那些让人回想起继续困扰他的过去事件的场景中。他让人物参与这些令人遗憾的情节的原因来自于这些动机中的一个或多个。",

If he thinks they can save Alyxian by healing his centuries-old trauma, rather than letting him go free without a second thought, Theo tries to lead them to the tools that will help them do so. He tries to bond with characters who are empathetic and gentle, but he also takes a keen interest in discerning and clever characters, and he will ask them questions both personal and philosophical. Only after he bonds with a character does he show his more childlike side, sometimes revealing an innocent sense of wonder, a desire to play games and laugh, or a need for fondness and affection.": "西奥的意图是评估这些人物的道德品质。如果他认为他们可以通过治愈阿利仙几个世纪以来的创伤来拯救他，而不是不假思索地让他逍遥法外，西奥试图引导他们找到能帮助他们这样做的工具。他试图与那些富有同情心和温柔的人物建立联系，但他也对那些有洞察力和聪明的人物产生浓厚的兴趣，他会向他们提出个人和哲学方面的问题。只有在他与一个人物结合后，他才会显示出他更像孩子的一面，有时会显示出一种天真的好奇心，一种玩游戏和笑的欲望，或者对喜欢和爱的需求。",

The following are the topics and Alyxian's replies:": "如果角色询问某些话题，你可以阅读或转述Alyxian的回答。每当他给出答案时，角色可以进行DC21智慧（（%0%））检查。如果检查失败，角色会认为他是真诚的、悲哀的、感激的。检查成功时，角色可以看出他的内心非常矛盾。在检查成功5个或更多的时候，角色也可以看出他越来越不耐烦地等待角色对他的评价。以下是这些话题和Alyxian的回答。",

By reaching out with words of empathy and compassion, the characters can help Alyxian achieve a kind of catharsis, leading to his redemption.": "当Apotheon以{@creature Alyxian the Tormented|CRCotN}、{@creature Alyxian the Callous|CRCotN}或{@creature Alyxian the Dispossessed|CRCotN}的形式嘲弄人物时，但潜在的悲伤和遗憾暗示着他体内仍然存在着一些人性的东西--他原始心理的片段，急于抑制他的破坏性倾向，但却无法摆脱驱使他行动的折磨。通过伸出同情和怜悯之手，人物可以帮助Alyxian实现一种宣泄，导致他得到救赎。",
