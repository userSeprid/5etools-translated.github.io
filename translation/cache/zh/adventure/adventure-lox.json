	"This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing, then ventures into Wildspace and the Astral Sea. The characters navigate these environments aboard ships that can traverse vast distances by using a magical form of travel known as spelljamming. Before running this adventure, read the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}, which contains information about these settings and how spelljamming works. The adventure assumes the characters have no prior experience with spelljamming—but that is about to change!": "这个《龙与地下城》的冒险从你选择的世界开始，然后冒险进入荒野空间和星海。角色们在这些环境中航行，通过使用一种被称为 \"咒语干扰 \"的神奇旅行方式，可以穿越遥远的距离。在进行这个冒险之前，请阅读{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}，其中包含了关于这些设置和咒语干扰如何工作的信息。这个冒险假定人物以前没有使用咒语干扰的经验--但这将会改变!",
	"The information in this book is for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now.": "本书中的信息仅供DM参考。如果你打算和别人一起玩这个冒险，请停止阅读。",
	"This story revolves around the characters' efforts to save their home world from an attack by an empire of astral elves. The attack is underway when the adventure begins. After taking refuge aboard a spelljamming vessel, the characters head for the stars to discover who is responsible for the attack and how they can save their world.": "这个故事围绕着人物努力拯救他们的家乡，使之免遭星际精灵帝国的攻击。冒险开始时，攻击正在进行中。在一艘法术干扰船上避难后，这些人物前往星空，探寻谁是这次攻击的罪魁祸首，以及他们如何拯救自己的世界。",
	"During the adventure, the characters encounter many space-dwelling creatures, some of which become companions on the party's voyage. The characters also meet Princess Xedalli, an astral elf who is embroiled in a power struggle with her twin brother, Prince Xeleth, over who will rule the empire that currently threatens the characters' world. With or without Xedalli's help, the characters must assemble an unlikely alliance to strike at the heart of the astral elf empire.": "在冒险过程中，角色们遇到了许多空间生物，其中一些成为了他们的同伴。角色们还遇到了Xedalli公主，一个星际精灵，她与她的孪生兄弟Xeleth王子卷入了一场权力斗争，争夺目前威胁到角色们世界的帝国的统治者。不管有没有Xedalli的帮助，这些人物必须组建一个不太可能的联盟，以打击星际精灵帝国的核心。",
	"The characters encounter many grandiose locations as the adventure unfolds, including an asteroid city known as the Rock of Bral and the imperial citadel of the astral elves, which orbits a star called Xaryxis.": "随着冒险的展开，角色们遇到了许多宏伟的地点，包括一个被称为布拉尔之石的小行星城市和星际精灵的帝国城堡，它围绕着一颗名为Xaryxis的恒星运行。",
	"The light of Xaryxis has nourished the Xaryxian Empire for millennia, serving as a wellspring for the magical power that the astral elves of Xaryxispace use to sustain their empire. A thousand years ago, the star's light began to fade, threatening the elves' prosperity, so Emperor Xavan turned the dying star into a parasite that leaches the life from worlds using crystal seeds harvested from the star.": "Xaryxis的光芒滋养了Xaryxian帝国数千年，作为Xaryxispace的星际精灵用来维持其帝国的神奇力量的源泉。一千年前，这颗恒星的光芒开始减弱，威胁到了精灵们的繁荣，所以Xavan皇帝把这颗垂死的恒星变成了一种寄生虫，利用从恒星上收获的水晶种子从世界上吸取生命。",
	"After the elves select a suitable host world, ships known as star moths release hundreds of astral seeds into the planet's atmosphere. The seeds fall from the sky and bury themselves in the ground and the oceans of the world. After the astral seeds take root, they produce enormous crystalline vines. The tendrils of these vines extend deep into the world and draw life energy from it. Once the vines have sapped a world of its energy, a process that can take months, they send out a bright beam of light that travels back to Xaryxis, temporarily replenishing the star's radiance and leaving the host world a barren husk.": "在精灵们选择了一个合适的宿主世界后，被称为星蛾的飞船向该星球的大气层释放了数百颗星体种子。这些种子从天而降，埋在世界的地面和海洋中。在星体种子生根发芽后，它们会产生巨大的结晶藤蔓。这些藤蔓的卷须延伸到世界深处，从世界中汲取生命能量。一旦这些藤蔓耗尽了一个世界的能量，这个过程可能需要几个月，它们就会发出一道明亮的光束，回到Xaryxis，暂时补充恒星的光芒，让宿主的世界变成荒芜的躯壳。",
	"Although Xaryxis shines brilliantly after each replenishment, it isn't long before the light of Xaryxis begins to wane once more, presaging the doom of another world.": "尽管每次补给后Xaryxis都会发出耀眼的光芒，但不久后Xaryxis的光芒就开始再次减弱，预示着另一个世界的末日。",
	"Once astral seeds have taken root on a host world, there is no easy way to stop the transformation—the vines are too thick and too numerous to be uprooted. Destroying the star Xaryxis, which acts as a lodestone for the astral seeds, is the only way to free a world from their grip. If the star goes dark, the crystal vines release their stored energy back into the host world, shrivel, and die.": "一旦星界种子在一个宿主世界上生根发芽，就没有简单的方法来阻止它的转变--藤蔓太粗，数量太多，无法被连根拔起。摧毁作为星界种子宿主的Xaryxis星，是使一个世界摆脱它们控制的唯一方法。如果这颗恒星变黑，水晶藤蔓就会把它们储存的能量释放到宿主世界中，萎缩并死亡。",
	"This adventure has four parts, each divided into three chapters. Each chapter is designed to be run as a single play experience lasting 2 to 3 hours, with the expectation that a group should be able to complete the adventure in twelve sessions of play.": "这个冒险有四个部分，每个部分分为三个章节。每一章都被设计成持续2到3小时的单一游戏体验，期望一个小组能够在12次游戏中完成这个冒险。",
	"Each chapter begins with an overview that gives you a sense of what is ahead for the heroes and recaps what has happened so far. There's no telling how a session will unfold, since the players have some control over the plot, but the text tries to give you enough information to run the various creatures and encounters. If the characters do something unexpected, improvise as best you can while gently steering them toward their main goal. Each chapter ends with a cliffhanger to set the stage for the next session, assuming things go as planned.": "每一章的开头都有一个概述，让你了解英雄们的未来，并回顾到目前为止所发生的事情。由于玩家对剧情有一定的控制权，所以不知道会话将如何展开，但文本试图给你足够的信息来运行各种生物和遭遇。如果角色们做了一些出乎意料的事情，你要尽可能地即兴发挥，同时温和地引导他们走向主要目标。每一章的结尾都有一个悬念，为下一节课做好铺垫，前提是事情按计划进行。",
	"The four parts of the adventure are as follows:": "冒险的四个部分如下。",
	"{@adventure Part 1: Seeds of Destruction|LoX|1} chronicles the devastation wrought by the astral seeds on the characters' home world and the party's escape into Wildspace. After fleeing to the Rock of Bral, the characters seek out Commodore Krux, a giff, hoping he can help them thwart the Xaryxian Empire's machinations and save the characters' world in the process.": "{@adventure Part 1: Seeds of Destruction|LoX|1}记录了星界种子对人物的家乡世界造成的破坏，以及当事人逃往荒野空间的过程。在逃到布拉尔岩石后，人物找到了吉夫准将克鲁克斯，希望他能帮助他们挫败夏里安帝国的阴谋并在此过程中拯救人物的世界。",
	"{@adventure Part 2: Terrors of the Void|LoX|2} deals with the characters' journey to the edge of their Wildspace system, where they encounter Princess Xedalli and learn the enormity of the task that lies before them. The characters head for Doomspace, where Krux plans to join a coalition of those that oppose the Xaryxian Empire.": "{@adventure Part 2: Terrors of the Void|LoX|2}讲述了角色们前往威尔兹空间系统边缘的旅程，在那里他们遇到了Xedalli公主，并了解到摆在他们面前的任务的艰巨性。角色们前往末日空间，在那里，克鲁克斯计划加入一个反对夏里安帝国的联盟。",
	"{@adventure Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace|LoX|3} begins with the party's arrival in Doomspace, where the coalition they had intended to join turns out to be a bunch of quarreling factions. They must find a way to unite the factions before attacking the Xaryxian Empire.": "{@adventure Part 3: Chaos in Doomspace|LoX|3}开始时，党员们来到了厄运空间，他们原本打算加入的联盟变成了一群争吵不休的派别。他们必须在进攻Xaryxian帝国之前找到一种方法来团结各派别。",
	"{@adventure Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse|LoX|4} describes Xaryxispace and the characters' climactic encounter with Prince Xeleth and the armada under his command. Finally, the characters arrive at the imperial citadel, where they discover the true cost of saving their world and must decide the fate of Xaryxis and the Xaryxian Empire before making the long voyage home.": "{@adventure Part 4: Saviors of the Multiverse|LoX|4}描述了Xaryxispace以及人物与Xeleth王子和他指挥的舰队的高潮遭遇。最后，人物到达了帝国城堡，在那里他们发现了拯救世界的真正代价，必须在长途跋涉回家之前决定Xaryxis和Xaryxian帝国的命运。",
	"To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}). In addition, you need the other two books included in this product: {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM} and the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}.": "要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版核心规则书（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））。此外，你还需要本产品中的另外两本书：{@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}和{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, you better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it.\" Usually, you can find the stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}; if the stat block is in {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}, the adventure's text tells you so.": "当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉线索，指向你的状态块，作为一种说法，\"嘿，管理员，你最好把这个生物的状态块准备好。你将会需要它。\" 通常，你可以在（%1%）中找到状态块；如果状态块在（%2%）中，冒险的文字会告诉你。",
	"Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, while magic items are described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, unless the adventure's text directs you to the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}.": "冒险中提到的法术和装备在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中描述，而魔法物品在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述，除非冒险中的文字指示你去{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}。",
	"The {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG} describes the many types of {@book spelljamming vessels|AAG|2|Spelljammer Vessels} mentioned in the adventure and includes deck plans for each one. At your discretion, you can provide the players with a copy of the deck plans for whatever ship they're sailing aboard and allow them to manage the ship's activity during encounters, freeing you to concentrate on running the nonplayer characters and their ships.": "{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}描述了冒险中提到的多种类型的{@book spelljamming vessels|AAG|2|Spelljammer Vessels}，包括每一种类型的甲板计划。根据你的判断，你可以为玩家提供一份他们所乘坐的任何船只的甲板计划，并允许他们在遭遇战中管理船只的活动，从而使你能够专注于管理非玩家角色和他们的船只。",
	"{@i Light of Xaryxis} is inspired by the 1980 film {@i Flash Gordon} and serialized Flash Gordon comic strips from the 1930s. The adventure's heroes, like Flash Gordon himself, must defeat otherworldly foes to save their home planet. Campy supporting characters, implausible situations, and over-the-top dialogue help push the story toward its inevitable conclusion. Absurd plot twists undercut the sense of urgency, keeping the heroes on their toes as they stumble from one cliffhanger to the next.": "{@i Light of Xaryxis}的灵感来自1980年的电影{@i Flash Gordon}和20世纪30年代的连载Flash Gordon漫画。冒险的英雄们，就像闪电侠戈登本人一样，必须打败其他世界的敌人来拯救他们的地球家园。蹩脚的配角、难以置信的情况和夸张的对话有助于将故事推向其不可避免的结论。荒谬的情节转折削弱了紧迫感，使英雄们在从一个悬念到另一个悬念的过程中保持警惕。",
	"Here are some things you can do to make {@i Light of Xaryxis} feel like the pulpy sci-fi tales that inspired it:": "这里有一些你可以做的事情，使{@i Light of Xaryxis}感觉像激发它的纸浆科幻故事。",
	"Watch the 1980 {@i Flash Gordon} film. It's not Shakespeare or Scorsese, but the dialogue is quotable, and the costumes and sets are fantastic.": "观看1980年（%0%）的电影。它不是莎士比亚或斯科塞斯的作品，但对白是可以引用的，服装和布景也很精彩。",
	"Any nonplayer character who isn't fighting the heroes should naturally defer to the heroes, giving players the sense that their characters matter (no matter how puny and insignificant they might seem to their enemies).": "任何不与英雄作战的非玩家角色都应该自然地服从于英雄，让玩家感觉到他们的角色很重要（无论他们在敌人看来是多么微不足道）。",
	"End each session with a cliffhanger. The adventure already has one at the end of each chapter, but you can create your own cliffhanger by ending a session with an unexpected threat, twist, or revelation.": "用一个悬念来结束每个环节。冒险故事在每一章的结尾都有一个悬念，但是你可以用一个意想不到的威胁、转折或启示来结束会议，创造你自己的悬念。",
	"When you're ready to begin a new chapter, read or paraphrase the recap that appears at the start of the chapter, embellishing it with pertinent events or memorable quotes from earlier game sessions.": "当你准备开始新的一章时，阅读或转述出现在这一章开头的回顾，用相关的事件或早期游戏环节中令人难忘的引言来润色它。",
	"The adventure assumes that the characters start at 5th level. If your players have characters of lower level, they will need to go on some other adventures first to gain enough experience to advance to 5th level. Both the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Starter Set} and the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Essentials Kit} contain adventures that will take characters from 1st level to 5th level. Alternatively, you can simply ask your players to create new 5th-level characters, as described in the next section.": "这个冒险假设角色从5级开始。如果你的玩家的角色等级较低，他们需要先去参加一些其他的冒险，以获得足够的经验来提升到5级。龙与地下城》{@i Starter Set}和《龙与地下城》{@i Essentials Kit}都包含了可以让角色从1级升到5级的冒险。另外，你也可以简单地要求你的玩家创建新的5级角色，如下一节所述。",
	"If spacefaring races are common on your world, you can add backgrounds and races from the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG} to the list of character options that players can choose from when creating their characters. As the DM, you decide what is available to your players and what isn't.": "如果航天种族在你的世界中很常见，你可以将背景和种族从（%0%）中添加到角色选项列表中，让玩家在创建角色时可以选择。作为管理人，你决定什么可以提供给你的玩家，什么不可以。",
	"If, during the adventure, a player wants to create a new character (perhaps because their previous one died or left the party), that player can roll up a new character of the same level as the rest of the adventuring party, choosing from the options available. If the party is in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, you can assume that all the character options from the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG} are available.": "如果在冒险过程中，有玩家想要创建一个新的角色（也许是因为他们之前的角色死了或者离开了队伍），该玩家可以卷起一个与冒险队伍其他成员相同等级的新角色，从现有的选项中选择。如果队伍是在荒野空间或星海，你可以假设{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}中所有的角色选项都是可用的。",
	"To create 5th-level characters for this adventure, players can use the {@book character creation steps|PHB|0} outlined in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. In addition to more hit points, class features, and spells, each character has normal starting equipment plus 625 gp to spend on additional nonmagical gear. If you're running a high magic campaign, each character also gains one uncommon magic item of the player's choice, subject to your approval.": "要为这次冒险创建5级人物，玩家可以使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中概述的{@book character creation steps|PHB|0}。除了更多的命中率、阶级特征和法术外，每个角色都有正常的起始装备，外加625金币用于购买额外的非魔力装备。如果你进行的是高魔法活动，每个角色还可以获得一个由玩家选择的不常见的魔法物品，但要经过你的批准。",
	"At the end of each of the adventure's parts, everyone in the party receives enough experience points to advance 1 level so that they are at the level they should be for the next chapter, as shown in the Character Levels table. Characters who finish the adventure advance to 9th level.": "在冒险的每个部分结束时，聚会中的每个人都会得到足够的经验值来提升1级，这样他们就会达到下一章应该达到的等级，如角色等级表所示。完成冒险的角色会提升到9级。",
	"The adventure begins in a coastal city or port town on a world where the characters are either seeking their fortunes or resting between adventures. Since most of this adventure takes place in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, the initial setting doesn't have much effect on how the adventure will play out. The characters' home world serves mainly to set the stakes for the story—it's in danger of being destroyed!—so using a world your players are familiar with works best, whether that is a published campaign setting or a world of your own creation.": "冒险开始于一个沿海城市或港口城市，在这个世界上，人物要么在寻找他们的财富，要么在冒险之间休息。由于这次冒险的大部分内容都发生在荒野空间和星海，所以最初的设定对冒险的发展并没有什么影响。角色们的家乡主要是为故事设定赌注--它有被摧毁的危险！--所以使用玩家们熟悉的世界是最好的，无论那是已出版的战役设定还是你自己创造的世界。",
	"If you used {@adventure Lost Mine of Phandelver|LMoP} (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Starter Set}) or {@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP} (the adventure in the Dungeons & Dragons {@i Essentials Kit}) to get the characters to 5th level, then {@i Light of Xaryxis} begins in the same region featured in those introductory adventures: the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms setting, on the world of Toril. The city of Neverwinter, one of several major ports along the Sword Coast, could easily be where the characters find themselves at the beginning of this adventure.": "如果你用{@adventure Lost Mine of Phandelver|LMoP}（《龙与地下城》{@i Starter Set}中的冒险）或{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}（《龙与地下城》{@i Essentials Kit}中的冒险）使角色达到5级，那么{@i Light of Xaryxis}就是从这些介绍性冒险中的同一个地区开始的：被遗忘的领域设定中的剑海岸，在托里尔世界。梦幻之城是剑海岸的几个主要港口之一，可以很容易地让人物在这次冒险的开始就找到自己。",
	"All the locations the characters visit in this adventure are described in this book, and further details about the {@book Rock of Bral|AAG|3} are provided in the {@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}.": "本冒险中人物所到的所有地点在本书中都有描述，而关于{@book Rock of Bral|AAG|3}的进一步细节在{@book Astral Adventurer's Guide|AAG}中提供。",
	"In addition to being a fascinating encounter in its own right, the {@creature starlight apparition|BAM} (see {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}) can be a useful device for you if a key nonplayer character meets an unfortunate and unexpected end. If, later in the adventure, the characters need a piece of information only that nonplayer character would know, you can have the nonplayer character appear in the form of a starlight apparition to guide the characters.": "除了本身是一个迷人的遭遇之外，如果一个关键的非玩家角色遇到了不幸和意外的结局，{@creature starlight apparition|BAM}（见{@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}）可以成为你有用的装置。如果在冒险的后期，角色们需要一个只有那个非玩家角色才知道的信息，你可以让那个非玩家角色以星光幻影的形式出现，引导角色。",
	"As the adventure opens, the characters are going about their daily business in a bustling coastal settlement, where everyone is talking about the spectacular meteor showers that have blazed through the sky the past several nights. In fact, what folks have witnessed are showers of astral seeds falling from space and plunging deep into the ground and water in and around the settlement. Some of these seeds have now germinated. The adventure begins when enormous crystalline vines erupt from beneath the streets, throwing the community into chaos.": "当冒险开始时，角色们正在一个繁华的沿海定居点做他们的日常工作，每个人都在谈论过去几个晚上在天空中闪耀的壮观的流星雨。事实上，人们所看到的是星际种子雨，它们从太空中坠落，深深地扎入定居点及其周围的地面和水中。其中一些种子现在已经发芽了。当巨大的结晶藤蔓从街道下面喷发出来，使社区陷入混乱时，冒险开始了。",
	"When you are ready to begin play, read:": "当你准备开始游戏时，请阅读。",
	"Your adventures have taken you to a coastal community, where local fishing boats share the harbor with trade vessels from far and wide. Lately everyone has been discussing the deluge of falling stars that has lit up the evening sky for the past several nights. Some say these celestial events are omens of impending disaster. Others believe they are a precursor to the gods descending from the heavens to walk the land. No one knows for sure.": "你的冒险已经把你带到了一个沿海社区，当地的渔船与来自远方的贸易船只共享港口。最近，每个人都在讨论在过去的几个晚上照亮夜空的大量坠落的星星。有些人说这些天体事件是即将发生的灾难的预兆。其他人则认为它们是众神从天而降，行走于大地的前兆。没有人知道是怎么回事。",
	"You are just finishing your midday meal while listening to a blacksmith tell about being awakened last night by a loud crash. According to the smith, a crystalline vine burst out of the ground and punched a hole through the roof of his neighbor's bakery. \"Must be divine punishment for the bad pies and steep prices,\" says the blacksmith with a nervous chuckle. Suddenly, the earth shakes violently beneath your feet. You hear the dull roar of a distant eruption. The smith and several others hurry outside. Joining them, you see a sinuous, crystalline vine erupting from the ground a few blocks away—tall enough to be seen above the rooftops. Screams of panic rise from the same direction.": "你刚吃完中午的饭，就听一个铁匠说起昨晚被一声巨响惊醒的事。据铁匠说，一根晶莹的藤蔓冲出地面，在他邻居的面包店屋顶上打了一个洞。\"这一定是对糟糕的馅饼和昂贵的价格的神圣惩罚，\"铁匠紧张地笑着说。突然，大地在你的脚下剧烈摇晃。你听到了远处火山爆发的沉闷轰鸣声。铁匠和其他几个人急忙跑到外面。和他们一起，你看到一条蜿蜒的结晶藤蔓从几个街区外的地面上喷发出来--高得可以在屋顶上看到。惊恐的尖叫声从同一方向传来。",
	"A sailor standing in your midst says, \"I think it's time I returned to my ship. You're welcome to join me. You would be wise to flee as well.\" With that, she makes her way toward the docks.": "一个站在你中间的水手说：\"我想我是时候回到我的船上了。欢迎你加入我。你也会明智地逃走的。\" 就这样，她向码头走去。",
	"The ground churns again, and more eruptions burst through the streets all around you. From these sites sprout smaller crystalline vines that uproot themselves and begin lurching through the streets, driving panicked citizens before them, while the enormous vine in the distance stretches ever taller.": "地面再次搅动，更多的喷发在你周围的街道上迸发出来。从这些地方萌发出更小的结晶藤蔓，它们连根拔起，开始在街道上蹒跚而行，把惊慌失措的市民赶到它们面前，而远处的巨大藤蔓则越伸越高。",
	"The friendly sailor, Elaina Sartell, is described later in the chapter. She flees at once, leaving the characters to decide their own course of action.": "本章后面将描述这位友好的水手，埃莱娜-萨特尔，。她马上逃走了，让人物决定他们自己的行动方向。",
	"The ambulatory vines are six {@creature Astral Blight|LoX|astral blights} (see the accompanying stat block). They focus their attacks on nearby commoners, ignoring the characters except for any who attack them. The blights' slow speed means the characters can evade them easily.": "伏地的藤蔓有6个（%0%）（见附带的状态块）。它们的攻击重点是附近的平民，除了攻击它们的人之外，无视其他角色。瘟疫的速度很慢，这意味着人物可以轻易地躲避它们。",
	"The characters have several choices for how to proceed:": "角色们对如何进行有几种选择。",
	"If the characters destroy all six blights, new ones appear; roll a {@dice d6} to determine how many. These new arrivals either burst up from the ground or shamble along streets and alleys, converging on the characters' location. Each time the characters defeat a group of blights, a new wave appears; repeat the die roll to see how many more blights arrive. With the appearance of each new wave, it should become increasingly obvious to the players that the characters can't eliminate all the blights and should consider a different course of action.": "如果角色们消灭了所有的六个瘟疫，就会有新的瘟疫出现；掷骰子（%0%）来决定有多少。这些新来的人要么从地面上冲起来，要么沿着街道和小巷晃荡，向人物的位置聚集。每当角色们打败了一群瘟疫，就会出现一波新的瘟疫；重复掷骰子，看看又有多少瘟疫到来。随着每一个新波次的出现，玩家们应该越来越清楚地认识到，角色们不可能消灭所有的瘟疫，应该考虑采取不同的行动方案。",
	"If the characters heed Elaina Sartell's advice and head to the docks, run the {@area \"Trouble at the Docks\"|012|x} encounter when they arrive.": "如果角色听从Elaina Sartell的建议，前往码头，那么在他们到达时，请执行（%0%）的遭遇战。",
	"If the characters try to barricade themselves in a building or find somewhere else in the settlement to hide, the increasingly violent earth tremors cause their shelter to partially collapse, making it apparent that there's no safe refuge in the settlement. The characters will need to choose another option.": "如果人物试图把自己堵在建筑物里，或者在定居点里找其他地方躲起来，越来越剧烈的地动会导致他们的庇护所部分坍塌，使得定居点里显然没有安全庇护所。人物将需要选择另一种方案。",
	"If the characters make their way toward the enormous crystalline vine, see \"{@area Crystalline Vine|010|x}\" below.": "如果人物向巨大的结晶藤蔓走去，请看下面的\"（%0%）\"。",

	"The vine growing in the center of the settlement sprouted after an astral seed fell from the sky, crashed into the bakery, and buried itself in the ground. The vine is 50 feet wide at its base, rises 1,000 feet into the air, and is still growing. It is made of an iridescent mineral that is impervious to the characters' spells and weapons. A character who makes a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check determines that the substance is a type of living crystal.": "生长在定居点中心的藤蔓是在一颗星体种子从天而降，撞向面包店，并埋入地下后萌发的。藤蔓的底部有50英尺宽，升到1000英尺的空中，而且还在不断生长。它由一种彩虹色的矿物制成，不受人物的法术和武器影响。一个角色如果成功地进行了DC10智力（（%0%））检查，就可以确定这种物质是一种活的水晶。",
	"No astral blights congregate near the crystalline vine, which means the characters can approach and study it without being attacked. The vine is warm to the touch and pulses with light. Any character who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check realizes that the vine's roots extend deep into the earth and are feeding on the planet's thermal energy. There appears to be no way to stop this process.": "没有任何星体疫病聚集在结晶藤附近，这意味着人物可以接近和研究它而不被攻击。藤蔓触摸起来很温暖，并有光的脉动。任何通过DC15智力（（%0%））检查成功的角色都会意识到，这根藤蔓的根系延伸到地球深处，正在吸收地球的热能。似乎没有办法阻止这个过程。",
	"As it grows taller, the vine also grows wider, slowly pushing away the dirt and debris from around its base. Inform the players that the tremors seem to be getting stronger as the vine grows, leaving them with two options: flee for the docks (see {@area \"Trouble at the Docks\"|012|x} below) or flee for the outskirts (see {@area \"Danger in the Streets\"|011|x} below).": "随着它的长高，藤蔓也越来越宽，慢慢地推开了它底部周围的泥土和碎石。告知玩家，随着藤蔓的生长，震感似乎越来越强，让他们有两个选择：逃往码头（见下文（%0%））或逃往郊区（见下文（%1%））。",
	"Astral blights roam the streets. Members of the local militia (use the {@creature guard} stat block) try to hold the blights at bay long enough for unarmed civilians to flee the vicinity. If the characters stay in a single location for longer than 1 minute, {@dice 1d6} {@creature Astral Blight|LoX|astral blights} (see the accompanying stat block) converge on their location and attack them.": "星际虫群在街上游荡。当地的民兵成员（使用（%0%）状态块）试图阻止瘟疫的发生，使手无寸铁的平民能够逃离附近。如果人物在一个地方停留的时间超过1分钟，{@dice 1d6}{@creature Astral Blight|LoX|astral blights}（见附带的状态块）就会聚集到他们的位置并攻击他们。",
	"The following events occur as the characters move through streets and alleys toward the outskirts of the settlement, but not if they head straight to the docks:": "当人物穿过街道和小巷走向定居点的郊区时，以下事件就会发生，但如果他们直接前往码头就不会发生。",
	"Tremors cause buildings close to the characters to collapse, catching them in an avalanche of debris.

	"A jolly boat can be lowered into the gravity plane of a larger ship or object, where it bobs like a boat in water. A jolly boat is too small to support a {@item spelljamming helm|AAG}, so the crew must use oars to steer and propel it as it \"floats\" in the gravity plane.

	"Although Krux doesn't approve of Fel's line of business, the giff has had a soft spot for her ever since the two met. Fel sees their relationship as purely transactional, but Krux is convinced the tiefling has a heart of gold, and he keeps trying to persuade her to give up smuggling. Now, with the party's arrival, Krux envisions the makings of a grand adventure, one he hopes that he and the characters can convince Fel to join.": "虽然克鲁斯不赞成费尔的生意，但自从两人相遇后，这个吉夫就对她有好感。菲尔认为他们的关系纯粹是交易关系，但克鲁斯相信这个铁皮人有一颗金子般的心，他一直试图劝说她放弃走私。现在，随着队伍的到来，克鲁斯预见到了一场盛大的冒险，他希望他和角色们能够说服菲尔加入。",
	"For her part, Fel is indifferent to the party's plight and says that if Krux wants his ship back ahead of time, he'll have to refund the rest of her lease payment, which amounts to 400 gp. Krux says he is prepared to pay her back. Fel, however, can sense the giff's desperation, so she insists on also being compensated for the lost revenue of her next venture, which she figures to be 3,000 gp. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check realizes Fel is bluffing—the tiefling secretly reckons she would be lucky to clear 1,000 gp—but she has always suspected Krux of having deep pockets and has no qualms about trying to gouge him. In truth, Krux has squandered most of his money and can barely afford to return the balance of Fel's lease payment, let alone pay the extra amount she's demanding.": "菲尔则对党的困境无动于衷，她说如果克鲁斯想要提前拿回他的船，他就必须退还她剩下的租赁费，也就是400金币。克鲁斯说他准备把钱还给她。然而，费尔能感觉到吉夫的绝望，所以她坚持要求对她下一次冒险的收入损失进行补偿，她认为这将是3,000金币。一个成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Insight})检查的角色意识到费尔是在虚张声势--铁皮人秘密地估计她能赚到1000金币就不错了--但她一直怀疑克鲁斯有很深的财力，所以毫不犹豫地想骗他。事实上，克鲁斯已经挥霍了他的大部分钱财，几乎没有能力归还费尔的租赁费余额，更不用说支付她所要求的额外金额了。",
	"Negotiation is not Krux's strong suit, and the giff turns to the characters for help in convincing Fel to let them use the ship. A character can do so by impressing upon her the urgency of the party's mission and succeeding on a DC 18 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. The check is made with advantage if the characters refund the rest of Fel's lease payment (400 gp). If the check fails, Fel is unmoved, and further attempts by that character to sway her fall on deaf ears.": "谈判不是克鲁克斯的强项，吉夫向角色们寻求帮助，以说服费尔让他们使用这艘船。一个角色可以这样做，他要让她对党的任务的紧迫性留下深刻印象，并在DC18魅力（{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}）检查中取得成功。如果角色们退还了Fel的剩余租赁费（400gp），则该检查具有优势。如果检定失败，Fel将不为所动，并且该人物进一步试图动摇她的想法将被置若罔闻。",
	"If the party doesn't have any spellcasters, Krux points out that they will need to hire a spelljammer. If the party tries to retain Fel's services for this purpose, the tiefling insists on a fee of 1,000 gp in addition to whatever agreement they reach regarding her other demands. If it's obvious the party can't pay what she's asking up front, Fel is willing to accompany them in exchange for a 25 percent share of any treasure they find until she is paid in full.": "如果队伍中没有任何法术师，克鲁克斯指出他们需要雇佣一个法术师。如果队伍试图为此雇佣菲尔的服务，那么除了他们就她的其他要求达成的任何协议之外，铁皮人还坚持要求支付1000金币的费用。如果他们显然无法预先支付她所要求的费用，费尔愿意陪伴他们，以换取他们找到的任何财宝的25%的份额，直到她得到全额付款。",
	"If the party threatens to take the {@i Second Wind} by force, Fel storms off the ship. Within an hour, she finds four {@creature Veteran||veterans} who are willing to help her retake the ship.

	"The first mate of the {@i Second Wind} is a neutral good {@creature hadozee explorer|BAM} (see {@book Boo's Astral Menagerie|BAM}) whom Krux refers to as Mister Flinch.

The hadozee knows about Krux's history with the astral elves but says nothing of it, replying, if pressed, that \"'tis not my tale to tell.\" Flinch has spent the last several months keeping an eye on the ship for Krux while serving in Fel's crew. He is relieved to have Krux back on board and glad to see his friend in such high spirits, though he privately worries that if their upcoming mission should fail, that might be more than the old soldier could bear.": "弗林奇是克鲁克斯准将的老战友，他与吉夫风雨同舟。哈多兹知道克鲁克斯与星际精灵的历史，但他什么也没说，如果被追问，他回答说：\"这不是我的故事\"。在过去的几个月里，弗林奇在费尔的船员中工作时，一直在为克鲁克斯盯着这艘船。他对克鲁克斯回到船上感到欣慰，也很高兴看到他的朋友情绪如此高涨，尽管他私下里担心，如果他们即将到来的任务失败，那可能是这位老战士所无法承受的。",
	"The tree rooted to the {@i Second Wind}'s sterncastle is a {@creature treant} named Starbough, who is largely indifferent to the aims of either Krux or the party.

Krux doesn't know much about Doomspace, though, so the ship's immediate destination is a lonely tower on an asteroid, where a wizard-cartographer named Topolah lives.

The giff stops drinking and moves about his ship with purpose and authority, barking out orders like the military commander he once was. Any time the conversation turns to Krux's history with the Xaryxian Empire, however, the giff becomes quiet and brooding. It's obvious there is a painful memory Krux doesn't feel comfortable sharing yet; if pressed, the giff waves dismissively, muttering, \"Things are bound to turn out differently this time.\" (More information about Krux's secret can be found in {@area chapter 7|0b5|x}.)": "有一个新的冒险项目占据了他的思想，使克鲁克斯的精神大振。吉夫停止了饮酒，带着目标和权威在他的船上走动，像他曾经的军事指挥官一样大声地发布命令。然而，一旦谈话转向克鲁克斯与夏里安帝国的历史，吉夫就会变得沉默和忧郁。很明显，有一段痛苦的记忆，克鲁斯还不太愿意分享；如果被追问，吉夫会不屑地挥挥手，嘀咕道：\"这次事情的结果一定会不一样。\" (关于克鲁斯的秘密的更多信息可以在（%0%）中找到。）",

His badly damaged flagship, the {@i Last Breath}, is all that remains after multiple engagements with the astral elves. The vampirate captain nevertheless still vows to destroy the Xaryxian Empire, but unbeknownst to him, his crew is on the verge of mutiny after their latest defeat.": "在这一章中，人物与格里姆佐德-加根海尔船长达成了共识，他承认夏利安人的船只已经完全摧毁了他的舰队。在与星际精灵的多次交战后，他那艘严重受损的旗舰（%0%）只剩下了。然而，这位吸血鬼船长仍然发誓要摧毁夏里安帝国，但他不知道的是，他的船员在最近的失败后正处于叛变的边缘。",
	"The {@i Last Breath} is a {@vehicle space galleon|AAG} that has been reduced to 90 hit points. Unless the characters take defensive measures, the galleon comes close enough for its captain, Grimzod Gargenhale, to be heard.

Care to identify yourselves?\"": "加根哈勒的语气很诱人，但他那双死黑的眼睛却闪烁着恶意的光芒。\"这里很危险。那个来自Xaryxis的威胁，指挥官Vael，不断向我们的系统派船，但我们尽了自己的职责，以减少星界精灵的队伍。你显然不是他们的人。愿意表明你们的身份吗？\"",

	"After making introductions, the vampirate captain confesses that his flagship and its crew are all that remains of his fleet. The rest fell prey to ships under the command of Vael, whom Gargenhale calls the scourge of pirates, raiders, and anyone else who refuses to bow to the might of Xaryxis. Despite these cautionary words, Gargenhale tells any belligerent or opportunistic characters that his crew has already died once—and they won't hesitate to do so again in defense of their ship.": "在做完介绍后，这位吸血鬼船长承认，他的旗舰和它的船员是他的舰队中仅存的。其余的都落入了瓦伊尔指挥的船只之手，加根哈尔称瓦伊尔是海盗、袭击者和其他任何拒绝向Xaryxis的力量低头的人的祸害。尽管有这些警告性的话语，Gargenhale告诉任何好战或投机的人物，他的船员已经死过一次了--他们会毫不犹豫地再次为保护他们的船而死。",
	"In conversation, Gargenhale is placid and convincing, but his words carry the bite of a vampire scorned. He warms quickly to characters who echo his distaste for the Xaryxian Empire.": "在谈话中，加根哈勒平和而令人信服，但他的话却带着被蔑视的吸血鬼的咬痕。他对那些赞同他对Xaryxian帝国的厌恶的人物很快就会感到温暖。",
	"Gargenhale wants to see the Xaryxian Empire crumble, but he's wary of embarking on a voyage to Doomspace alongside a bunch of nobodies.

	"Once Gargenhale is off his ship, one or more characters can try to coax the vampirate captain into joining their cause. If one character does all the talking, have that character make a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check; otherwise, have all participating characters make a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) group check. If Topolah is present, characters have advantage on this check.": "一旦Gargenhale离开了他的船，一个或多个角色可以尝试哄骗这位吸血鬼船长加入他们的事业。如果一个角色负责说话，让该角色进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查；否则，让所有参与的角色进行DC13魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）集体检查。如果Topolah在场，角色在这个检查中具有优势。",
	"On a successful check, Gargenhale pledges to help the characters save their world from destruction, asking for nothing in return.

	"As the captain of the {@i Second Wind}, Krux refuses to bend his knee to a vampirate, but a character can convince the giff to swallow his pride and yield to Gargenhale's authority by succeeding on a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. If no one succeeds on this check, Krux ends the impasse by offering to step down as captain of the {@i Second Wind} for the remainder of the mission, yielding command to any character who can tolerate undead allies better than he can.": "作为{@i Second Wind}号的船长，克鲁克斯拒绝向吸血鬼屈膝，但一个角色可以通过DC16魅力（{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}）的检查成功说服吉夫吞下他的骄傲并屈服于Gargenhale的权威。如果没有人成功，克鲁斯就会结束僵局，提出在任务的剩余时间里辞去{@i Second Wind}船长的职务，将指挥权让给任何比他更能容忍亡灵盟友的角色。",
	"When the two parties come to an agreement, Gargenhale bows deeply and invites the characters aboard his ship to celebrate their alliance with a bottle of Champagne du le Stomp.

When they were rebuked, the gods vented their fury by collapsing the sun, leaving behind a spiraling vortex called the Eye of Doom. Those who deny the existence of gods refute these claims and turn to ancient myths for explanation. Perhaps the angry sun was slain by a primordial foe taking the form of a comet, or perhaps the sun was the shell of a great dragon's egg that finally hatched, and the so-called Eye of Doom is the hatchling's hungry maw.": "接下来发生了什么并不为人所知，但猜测却比比皆是。有人说众神出现在费林和马拉斯的领导人面前，要求被崇拜。当他们被斥责时，众神通过崩塌太阳来发泄他们的愤怒，留下了一个被称为 \"末日之眼 \"的螺旋形漩涡。那些否认神灵存在的人驳斥了这些说法，并转向古代神话寻求解释。也许愤怒的太阳是被一个以彗星形式出现的原始敌人杀死的，或者太阳是一个最终孵化的大龙蛋的外壳，而所谓的 \"厄运之眼 \"是孵化出的小龙的饥饿大嘴。",

While {@condition invisible}, Xedalli addresses the characters through her illusion and praises them for their heroic attitude while discouraging them from getting involved in Xaryxian politics. While her illusion chatters on, Xedalli surreptitiously removes her {@item ring of shooting stars}, drops it on the sandy arena floor, and uses a {@spell sending} spell to communicate the following information to a character she can trust to act on it:": "Xeleth没有否认他姐姐的指责，她的话也没有改变目前的情况。Xedalli认为除了陪她哥哥回到Xaryxispace之外没有更好的选择。然而，随着遭遇的展开，她使用了与Xeleth相同的招数：她施展了{@spell mislead}，转身{@condition invisible}，同时创造了一个虚幻的自己的副本。当{@condition invisible}时，Xedalli通过她的幻象向人物讲话，赞扬他们的英雄态度，同时劝阻他们不要参与Xaryxian的政治。在她的幻象喋喋不休的时候，Xedalli偷偷地取下她的{@item ring of shooting stars}，把它丢在沙质的竞技场地板上，并使用{@spell sending}法术把以下信息传达给一个她可以信任的人物，让他根据这些信息采取行动。",

	"If he thinks Xedalli is dead, Xeleth assumes the characters have her ring and demands that it be tossed into his dragon's mouth (so that the dragon can safely transport it back to Xeleth's ship). If his dragon is defeated before it can deliver the ring, Xeleth orders Commander Vael to teleport to {@creature Vocath|LoX}'s base with eight {@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}, obtain the ring at any cost, and teleport back to the Xaryxia. {@creature Vocath|LoX}, if he's alive, helps the astral elves retrieve the ring. He hopes they'll leave in peace afterward, which they do.": "如果他认为Xedalli已经死了，Xeleth就会认为这些人物拥有她的戒指，并要求把它扔进他的龙的嘴里（这样龙就可以安全地把它运回Xeleth的船上）。如果他的龙在运送戒指之前被打败，Xeleth命令指挥官Vael带着八个{@creature Astral Elf Warrior|BAM|astral elf warriors}传送到{@creature Vocath|LoX}的基地，不惜一切代价获得戒指，然后传送回Xaryxia号。{@creature Vocath|LoX}，如果他还活着，就帮助星际精灵们取回戒指。他希望他们之后能平静地离开，而他们也确实如此。",
	"If Xeleth is unable to obtain Xedalli or her ring, his fleet opens fire on the ships docked at {@creature Vocath|LoX}'s base. (These ships are detailed in {@area chapter 8|0d6|x}). After 5 rounds of bombardment, the following ships are destroyed before their crews can mount a defense: the {@vehicle Shrike Ship|AAG|Skyrra}, the {@vehicle Lamprey Ship|AAG|Remora}, the {@vehicle Scorpion Ship|AAG|Vrusk}, the {@vehicle Space Galleon|AAG|Tarrasque}, and the {@vehicle Wasp Ship|AAG|Gadabout}.": "如果Xeleth无法获得Xedalli或她的戒指，他的舰队会向停靠在{@creature Vocath|LoX}基地的船只开火。(这些船在{@area chapter 8|0d6|x}中详细说明)。经过5轮轰炸，以下船只在船员能够进行防御之前就被摧毁：{@vehicle Shrike Ship|AAG|Skyrra}号、{@vehicle Lamprey Ship|AAG|Remora}号、{@vehicle Scorpion Ship|AAG|Vrusk}号、{@vehicle Space Galleon|AAG|Tarrasque}号和{@vehicle Wasp Ship|AAG|Gadabout}号。",
	"Neither the characters' ship nor the {@i Devil's Deal} ({@creature Vocath|LoX}'s {@vehicle damselfly ship|AAG}) is damaged in the initial bombardment.

	"After the astral elves' initial bombardment, {@creature Vocath|LoX} casts {@spell dimension door} and boards Xeleth's flagship to negotiate an end to the conflict. If Xedalli is nearby, the mercane takes her along, and together they work out a deal in which Xedalli surrenders to Xeleth and the astral elves leave without further incident.": "在星界精灵最初的轰炸之后，{@creature Vocath|LoX}施展{@spell dimension door}，登上了Xeleth的旗舰，就结束冲突进行谈判。如果Xedalli在附近，雇佣兵会带上她，他们一起达成协议，Xedalli向Xeleth投降，而星界精灵也会离开，不会再有什么意外。",
	"If {@creature Vocath|LoX} isn't around to negotiate a peaceful end to the conflict, Xeleth's fleet docks at the base and deploys troops once it's safe to do so. Enemy leaders are rounded up and executed, and any hope of forming a coalition among the Doomspace factions is lost. (Skip over the \"Alliance in Doomspace\" and \"{@area Assemble the Fleet!|119|x}\" sections.) When the characters are ready to leave Doomspace, continue with the \"{@area Red Dragon Rider|11a|x}\" section at the end of the chapter.": "如果{@creature Vocath|LoX}不在身边，无法通过谈判和平结束冲突，一旦安全，Xeleth的舰队就会停靠在基地并部署军队。敌人的领导人被围捕并被处决，在末日空间各派别之间形成联盟的任何希望都已破灭。(跳过 \"末日空间的联盟 \"和\"{@area Assemble the Fleet!|119|x} \"部分）。当人物准备好离开末日空间时，继续本章末尾的\"{@area Red Dragon Rider|11a|x} \"部分。",

	"A character approaches Vortshu, the {@creature aartuk elder|BAM} (who is indifferent toward them), and tries to convince Vortshu that war against the Xaryxian Empire would give the aartuks new worlds to conquer. It's a sound approach, given aartuks' devotion to gods of war. But the character gets a failure on their DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, so Vortshu refuses to join the coalition, perhaps making the argument that the thri-kreen are a greater threat to the aartuks than the Xaryxian Empire. Further attempts to sway Vortshu fail automatically until the characters convince another faction representative to join their coalition. Having previously won over the aarakocra, the characters now set their sights on T'kitka, the thri-kreen representative.": "一个角色接近Vortshu，{@creature aartuk elder|BAM}（他对他们漠不关心），并试图说服Vortshu，对Xaryxian帝国的战争会给aartuks带来新的世界来征服。鉴于阿尔图克人对战神的虔诚，这是一个合理的方法。但是这个人物在DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查中失败了，所以沃尔舒拒绝加入联盟，也许他提出的论点是，对阿尔图克人来说，特里格林的威胁比夏里安帝国更大。在人物说服另一个派别的代表加入他们的联盟之前，进一步试图动摇Vortshu的努力自动失败。在赢得了阿拉科克拉人的支持后，这些人物现在把目光投向了特里格林人的代表--特凯特卡。",

To improve T'kitka's attitude, the characters give her the {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} they took from the {@i Dark Star} in {@area chapter 2|04b|x}. This fabulous gift is enough to improve T'kitka's attitude to friendly. A character then succeeds on the DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, convincing T'kitka to join their coalition. With the thri-kreen now on board, the characters can make another attempt to convince Vortshu to join the coalition.": "和Vortshu一样，T'kitka对人物漠不关心。为了改善T'kitka的态度，角色们把他们在{@area chapter 2|04b|x}中从{@i Dark Star}那里得到的{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}送给她。这个美妙的礼物足以让T'kitka的态度变得友好。然后，一个角色在DC10魅力（（%3%））检查中成功，说服T'kitka加入他们的联盟。随着特里-格林的加入，人物可以再次尝试说服沃尔舒加入联盟。",
