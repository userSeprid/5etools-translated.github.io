	"More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.": "五百多年前，矮人和地精的部族达成了一项被称为 \"潘德夫契约 \"的协议，根据该协议，他们将在一个被称为 \"波浪回声洞 \"的奇妙洞穴中分享一个丰富的矿场。除了矿产资源外，这个矿场还蕴含着巨大的魔法力量。人类施法者与矮人和地精结盟，将这种能量引导并结合到一个伟大的锻造厂（称为 \"法术锻造厂\"），在那里可以制作魔法物品。时代是美好的，附近的人类城镇Phandalin（发音为fan-duh-lin）也随之繁荣起来。但是，当兽人横扫北方，把所有的东西都毁掉的时候，灾难发生了。",
	"A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures.

	"For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

	"In part 2, \"Phandalin,\" the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair.

	"Part 3, \"The Spider's Web,\" provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black Spider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.": "第三部分，\"蜘蛛网\"，为人物提供了在范达林周围地区的几个简短的冒险，因为他们要寻找更多关于黑蜘蛛和矮人丢失的矿场的信息。角色们在范达林捡到的线索可以引导他们在老猫头鹰井的废墟上窥探一个神秘的巫师，寻求一个危险的女妖的建议，赶走潜伏在怀恩托的一伙兽人，并调查雷树镇的废墟。",
	"Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}'s map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3.": "其中有几条线索指向克拉格玛城堡，它是克拉格玛妖精的首领格罗尔国王的据点。在这里，角色们发现黑蜘蛛是一个名叫Nezznar的乌鸦冒险家，而克拉格马夫地精为他工作（乌鸦是来自地下深处的精灵）。更重要的是，他们找到了{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}通往失落矿井的地图，或者从第三部分中发现的其他线索中得知矿井的位置。",

	"Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. Personality traits provide a glimpse into the character's likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An ideal is something that the character believes in or strives for above all else. A character's bond represents a connection to a person, place, or event in the world-someone the character cares about, a place the holds a special connection, or a treasured possession. A flaw is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.": "这套书中的每个人物都有两个性格特征（一个是正面的，一个是负面的），一个理想，一个纽带和一个缺陷。这些要素可以使角色更容易、更有趣地进行角色扮演。个性特征提供了对该角色的喜欢、不喜欢、成就、恐惧、态度或举止的一瞥。理想是指人物所相信的或为之奋斗的东西，高于其他一切。人物的纽带代表着与世界上某个人、某个地方或某个事件的联系--人物所关心的某个人、与之有特殊联系的某个地方、或某个珍贵的财产。缺陷是指别人可以利用的特性，使人物走向毁灭或使人物的行为违背他或她的最佳利益。",
	"When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to the drawbacks presented by a bond or flaw, you can give that player one inspiration as a reward. A player with inspiration can use it in a situation where his or her character's personality traits, ideal, or bond relate to what's happening. Spending inspiration gives the character advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.": "当一个玩家扮演了一个消极的人格特征，或者屈服于纽带或缺陷所带来的弊端，你可以给这个玩家一个灵感作为奖励。拥有灵感的玩家可以在他或她的角色的个性特征、理想或纽带与正在发生的事情有关的情况下使用它。花费灵感可以使该角色在一次能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力上获得优势。",
	"A character can have only one inspiration at a time.": "一个角色在同一时间只能有一个灵感。",

It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.": "就像奇幻小说或电影一样，冒险的背景是一个更大的世界。事实上，这个世界可以是DM和玩家所能想象的任何东西。它可以是文明初期的剑与魔法背景，野蛮人与邪恶的巫师作战；也可以是末世的幻想，精灵和矮人在科技文明的残骸中挥舞魔法。大多数D&D设定介于这两个极端之间：有骑士和城堡的中世纪高级幻想世界，以及精灵城市、矮人矿场和可怕的怪物。",

Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land.

	"On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places.

Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.": "在王国的道路和河流上，游吟诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵、水手和铁石心肠的冒险家，带着陌生、光荣、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的小路甚至可以把一个没有经验的青年带向世界的远方，实现他的荣耀梦想。每年都有数以千计来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的不安分的未来英雄来到永夜城和其他大城市，寻找财富和名声。",
	"Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren't necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "已知的道路可能很好走，但它们不一定安全。堕落的魔法、致命的怪物和残酷的地方统治者都是你在被遗忘的领域中旅行时面临的危险。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方可以避免龙的突然发怒。",
	"The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures.

In addition, any NPC at the inn can tell the characters that the Redbrands frequent the Sleeping Giant tap house at the east end of town—and that the ruffians are trouble.": "这些线索应该为角色们指出在范达林及其周边地区冒险的机会。此外，旅馆里的任何一个NPC都可以告诉角色，红袍人经常去镇子东边的沉睡巨人酒馆，而且这些流氓是个麻烦。",
	"The townmaster's hall has sturdy stone walls, a pitched wooden roof, and a bell tower at the back. Posted on a board next to the front door is a notice written in Common. It reads: \"REWARD—Orcs near Wyvern Tor! Those of a mind to face the orc menace should inquire within.\" The notice bears the town's seal and an indecipherable signature.": "镇长的大厅有坚固的石墙，有一个倾斜的木制屋顶，后面还有一个钟楼。前门旁边的一块木板上贴着一张用普通话写的通知。它写道。\"奖励--维文托附近的兽人! 那些有心面对兽人威胁的人应该向里面询问。\" 通知上有镇上的印章和一个难以辨认的签名。",
	"After questioning several locals, Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords' Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what's left of him, if something killed him. Sildar describes Iarno as \"a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties.\"": "在询问了几个当地人之后，Sildar得知Iarno Albrek，一个领主联盟的成员，大约两个月前在探索Tresendar庄园周围地区时失踪了，当时他刚到Pandalin不久。Sildar要求角色们调查庄园和周边地区，找到并带回Iarno--或者他的遗体，如果有东西杀了他的话。Sildar描述Iarno是 \"一个矮小的、黑胡子的人类巫师，三十多岁\"。",

If opened, the tombs contain mostly moldering bones and scraps of clothing, but see the \"Treasure\" section.": "每个石棺的石盖上都雕刻着墓中人的形象--两个人类男性和一个人类女性，都有高贵的气质。如果打开墓穴，里面大多是发霉的骨头和衣服的碎片，但请看 \"宝藏 \"部分。",

	"If the characters approach this room through the secret passage from {@area 7|095}, they can surprise the leader of the Redbrands—Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek.

	"The characters might instead choose to ask Agatha about something else—for example, the location of Cragmaw Castle, the location of Wave Echo Cave, the identity of the Black Spider, or Hamun Kost's question about Old Owl Well (see that section). Agatha is well informed and a capable diviner, so she can answer almost any single question pertaining to the adventure that the characters think to ask. However, the banshee answers only one question, so the characters should choose it carefully.": "角色们可能会选择向阿加莎询问其他事情--例如，克拉格莫城堡的位置、波浪回音洞的位置、黑蜘蛛的身份，或者哈蒙-科斯特关于老猫头鹰井的问题（见该部分）。阿加莎消息灵通，是个有能力的占卜师，所以她几乎可以回答人物想到的与冒险有关的任何一个问题。然而，女妖只回答一个问题，所以人物应该谨慎选择。",
	"Though most of the zombies have long since crumbled to dust, strange magic permeating the area has mutated the local vegetation into new and dangerous forms. Few people dare to venture into the ruined village now, and those who do so seldom stay long—with two notable exceptions. The druid Reidoth (see {@area 4|0df}) visits Thundertree from time to time, keeping a wary eye on its dangers. Cultists have also arrived recently (see {@area 13|101}) to treat with a dragon that claims Thundertree as its domain (see {@area 7|0eb}).": "虽然大多数僵尸早已碎裂成尘埃，但弥漫在该地区的奇怪魔法使当地的植被变异成新的危险形式。现在很少有人敢于冒险进入这个废墟般的村庄，而那些敢于冒险的人也很少久留，但有两个明显的例外。德鲁伊Reidoth（见{@area 4|0df}）时不时地访问雷霆树，对它的危险保持警惕的目光。崇拜者们最近也来到这里（见{@area 13|101}），与一条声称雷霆树为其领地的龙进行对话（见{@area 7|0eb}）。",
	"Four {@creature ash zombie|LMoP|ash zombies} (see the \"Ash Zombies\" sidebar) lurk in the shadows in this building, slumped against the walls or under the bar.

They pursue any characters they see, attacking until destroyed.": "四个（%0%）（见 \"灰烬僵尸 \"侧边栏）潜伏在这栋建筑的阴影中，斜靠在墙壁上或酒吧下面。当生物进入时，这些僵尸就会呻吟和骚动，慢慢地爬起来（花费一半的速度来这样做--见规则手册中的 \"俯卧 \"部分）。它们会追击它们看到的任何角色，攻击直到被消灭。",
	"Reidoth is adept at staying away from the ash zombies that overrun the village, as well as avoiding the area's mutated plants. He knows that dangerous spiders lurk in the ruins at the base of the hill, and he suspects that someone is hiding out on the eastern side of town—he's seen \"folk in black masks and cloaks\" (the cultists) skulking around. However, he is currently most concerned by the fact that a green dragon has moved into the tower ({@area 7|0eb}) since the last time he was here. He warns the characters of all these threats, and suggests that they leave Thundertree before they get themselves killed.": "Reidoth善于远离村子里泛滥的灰烬僵尸，也善于避开该地区的变异植物。他知道山脚下的废墟里潜伏着危险的蜘蛛，他怀疑有人躲在镇子的东边，他看到 \"戴着黑色面具和斗篷的人\"（邪教分子）在附近徘徊。然而，他目前最担心的是，自从他上次来这里之后，一条绿龙已经搬进了塔楼（{@area 7|0eb}）。他警告这些人物所有这些威胁，并建议他们在自己被杀之前离开雷霆树。",
	"A wide chimney and rotted piles of firewood jumbled outside the walls of this sagging building suggest that it was a smithy in its day.": "这座下垂的建筑墙外有一个宽大的烟囱和错落有致的腐烂木柴堆，表明它在当时是一个铁匠铺。",

	"The entrance tunnel leads into a large cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies—sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.": "入口通道通向一个由天然岩柱支撑的大洞穴，里面有三根石笋。在洞穴的西部，岩石柱的后面，有三张床铺和一堆普通用品--一袋面粉、一袋盐、一桶咸肉、灯笼、一壶灯油、铁镐、铁锹和其他装备。在这些物资中，你看到一具矮人矿工的尸体，至少已经死了一个星期。",
	"This chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind. A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron.

	"Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections—high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors—dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres—attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.": "陡峭的悬崖将这个大洞穴分成三个部分--两端的高台，中间的低台。雕刻的石阶爬上了壁架。中间部分有两张大桌子，还有一对老式火炉。一张较小的桌子矗立在东边的壁架上。几十个死去的战士--矮人、侏儒、兽人和食人魔--的骸骨证明了很久以前这里发生的激烈战斗。",
	"Like the fungi cavern at {@area 8|169}, this chamber poses a serious obstacle that prevents Nezznar from reaching his objective—the Forge of Spells ({@area 15|17d}).
