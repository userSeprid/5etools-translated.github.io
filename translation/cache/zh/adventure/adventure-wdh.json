	"A simple question began rattling around in my head over two years ago as I was bidding farewell to Barovia, dragging myself out of the depths of Maelstrom, and planning a yearlong expedition to Chult. Where do we go next? After mulling over several options, we decided it would be refreshing to return to civilization. Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a treasure hunt with an urban backdrop. We've visited Waterdeep before, but not like this. Clever heroes will respect the city's rules. Those who get on the city's bad side are in for a rough time, as the City of Splendors is home to some of the most powerful figures in the Forgotten Realms.": "两年多前，当我告别巴罗维亚，把自己从漩涡深处拖出来，并计划对楚尔特进行为期一年的考察时，一个简单的问题开始在我脑海中回荡。我们下一步该去哪里？在琢磨了几个方案之后，我们决定回到文明社会中去，这将是一件令人振奋的事情。水底世界。龙劫》是一个以城市为背景的寻宝游戏。我们以前访问过沃特迪普，但不是这样的。聪明的英雄们会尊重城市的规则。那些对城市不利的人将会有一段艰难的时光，因为辉煌之城是被遗忘的王国中一些最强大的人物的家。",
	"Charlie Sanders, a lifelong D&D player, brought his experience writing for television to the project by helping flesh out the story bible months before work on the adventure was scheduled to begin. Matthew Mercer, whom you might know from the livestreamed show {@i Critical Role}, lent us his boundless imagination and helped flesh out the villains and their motives. A D&D adventure is only as good as its villains, and Waterdeep: Dragon Heist has multiple baddies to choose from.": "查理-桑德斯，一个终生的D&D玩家，把他为电视写作的经验带到了这个项目中，在冒险计划开始前的几个月帮助充实了故事圣经。马修-默瑟（Matthew Mercer），你可能在直播节目中认识他（%0%），他借给我们无限的想象力，帮助充实了反派人物和他们的动机。一场D&D冒险的好坏取决于它的反派人物，而《水底世界》。水底世界：龙之劫》有多个坏蛋可供选择。",
	"Before I pull back the curtain and lead you into the heart of Waterdeep, I wish to thank Ed Greenwood for making the City of Splendors what it is: the kind of magical place you wish in your heart was real.": "在我拉开帷幕，带领你进入沃特德普的中心地带之前，我想感谢艾德-格林伍德，是他让辉煌之城成为现在的样子：那种你心里希望是真实的神奇之地。",

	"Welcome to Waterdeep, the Crown of the North, where a wondrous tale of urban adventure is about to unfold. Our story begins with the gathering of adventurers at the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern. {@creature volothamp \"volo\" geddarm|ToA|Volothamp Geddarm}, the famous explorer and raconteur, has a quest for them-one that entangles the characters in a bitter conflict between two nefarious organizations. If the adventurers complete his quest, Volo rewards them handsomely. Yet a much greater prize lies hidden somewhere in the City of Splendors, waiting to be claimed. Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters starting at 1st level. By the end of the story, the characters will be at least 5th level. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now!": "欢迎来到沃特迪普，北方的王冠，在这里一个奇妙的城市冒险故事即将展开。我们的故事从冒险家们在 \"打哈欠的门 \"旅馆和酒馆的聚会开始。著名的探险家和说书人{@creature volothamp \"volo\" geddarm|ToA|Volothamp Geddarm}为他们准备了一个任务--将这些人物卷入两个邪恶组织的激烈冲突中。如果冒险家们完成了他的任务，沃罗会给他们丰厚的奖励。然而，一个更大的奖励隐藏在辉煌之城的某个地方，等待着他们去领取。水底世界。龙与地下城》的冒险是为1级开始的角色设计的。在故事结束时，角色将至少达到5级。如果你打算以玩家的身份运行这个冒险，那么现在就不要再读了",
	"If you're looking for higher-level adventure content set in Waterdeep, a companion product titled {@i Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage} explores the vast dungeon under Waterdeep known as Undermountain and is designed for characters of levels all the way up to 20th.": "如果你正在寻找以水底世界为背景的更高层次的冒险内容，一个名为{@i Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的配套产品探索了水底世界下被称为Undermountain的巨大地下城，是为等级一直到20级的角色设计的。",
	"Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a treasure hunt set against an urban backdrop. The adventure's plot can be summarized as follows:": "Waterdeep: 龙之劫》是一个以城市为背景的寻宝游戏。该冒险的情节可以概括为以下几点。",
	"Half a million gold coins are hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. Many individuals know about the cache and are looking for it. Adventurers can join the hunt and prevent the cache from falling into evil hands.": "50万枚金币藏在沃特迪普的某个地方。许多人知道这个藏匿处，并且正在寻找它。冒险家们可以加入追捕行动，防止藏匿处落入邪恶之手。",
	"The city is threatened by escalating tension between two power groups that is on the verge of flaring into violence. The Zhentarim, a shadowy network of mercenaries, and {@creature Xanathar|WDH}, the beholder crime lord of Waterdeep, are at odds, and when they clash, the characters are pulled into the conflict.": "这座城市受到了两个权力集团之间不断升级的紧张局势的威胁，这种紧张局势正处于爆发暴力的边缘。Zhentarim，一个阴暗的雇佣兵网络，和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}，Waterdeep的beholder crime lord，正处于矛盾之中，当他们发生冲突时，人物被拉入冲突之中。",
	"In Waterdeep, a gold coin is called a dragon. Before he was ousted from his position as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Dagult Neverember embezzled half a million dragons and hid them in a secret vault. As a security precaution, he arranged for all knowledge of the vault's location and defenses to be magically erased from his mind and the minds of his subordinates. The wizard who performed the procedure trapped this knowledge within an artifact called the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}. The wizard disappeared shortly thereafter, and Dagult hid the stone in the Palace of Waterdeep.": "在沃特德普，一个金币被称为一条龙。在他被赶出水底世界开放领主的位置之前，达古特-纽伦堡挪用了50万条龙，并把它们藏在一个秘密的保险库里。作为一项安全预防措施，他安排将所有关于金库位置和防御的知识从他和他的下属的脑海中用魔法抹去。执行该程序的巫师将这些知识保存在一个名为\"%0%\"的工艺品中。此后不久，这位巫师就消失了，达古特将这块石头藏在水底宫殿中。",
	"Dagult was off rebuilding the city of Neverwinter when the other Lords of Waterdeep voted him out of office. He immediately made plans to retrieve the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} and smuggle his cache of dragons out of Waterdeep. His spies plucked the stone from the palace but were killed while trying to leave the city. The stone was stolen and passed from one hand to another like a common jewel until it wound up in the clutches of {@creature Xanathar|WDH}.": "当水底世界的其他领主投票把他赶下台时，达古特正去重建永夜城。他立即制定了计划，要取回{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}，并将他的龙的藏匿处偷运出水底世界。他的间谍从宫殿里摘取了石头，但在试图离开城市时被杀。这块石头被盗，像普通的珠宝一样从一个人手中传到另一个人手中，直到它落入（1%）的魔掌。",
	"The {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} is actually an aboleth transformed by magic. In this inanimate state, the aboleth can read the mind of any creature that attunes to the stone, as well as modify that creature's memory. A creature attuned to the stone can also extract information from the aboleth, including lore about Neverember's vault.": "这个{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}实际上是一个被魔法改造过的Aboleth。在这种无生命的状态下，aboleth可以读取任何与石头相适应的生物的思想，并修改该生物的记忆。适应这块石头的生物也可以从阿波勒斯身上提取信息，包括关于纽恩堡金库的传说。",
	"Built long ago by dwarves, the vault is warded against all forms of magical detection and intrusion. Its current protector is an adult gold dragon named {@creature Aurinax|WDH}, who is also the current wielder and guardian of the {@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH}, which has the power to prevent other dragons from entering the city. In exchange for the staff, {@creature Aurinax|WDH} promised to guard the gold until such time as Neverember or his appointed vassals removed it.": "这个金库是由矮人在很久以前建造的，它的防护措施是防止所有形式的魔法探测和入侵。它目前的保护者是一只名为（%0%）的成年金龙，他也是（%1%）的现任持有者和守护者，它有能力阻止其他龙进入这个城市。作为对法杖的交换，{@creature Aurinax|WDH}承诺守护金子，直到纽伦堡或他指定的附庸将其移除。",
	"The map in the back of this book has the city of Waterdeep on both sides. One side can be shown to players. The other side is for the DM and includes tags marking important locations in the adventure.": "本书后面的地图两面都有水底城。一面可以给玩家看。另一面是给管理员看的，包括标记冒险中重要位置的标签。",
	"Beneath the city streets lurks a criminal underworld, its leader a beholder called {@creature Xanathar|WDH}. Hoping to gain a political foothold in Waterdeep, agents of the Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) recently tried to ally their organization with the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild. The architect of this attempt was a clone of the wizard {@creature Manshoon|WDH}, a founder of the Black Network long thought dead.": "在城市的街道下潜藏着一个犯罪的地下世界，它的领导者是一个叫{@creature Xanathar|WDH}的人。真塔林（Zhentarim）（也被称为黑网）的代理人希望在沃特迪普获得一个政治立足点，最近试图将他们的组织与（1%）公会结盟。这一企图的策划者是巫师{@creature Manshoon|WDH}的克隆人，他是黑网的创始人，长期以来被认为已经死亡。",
	"While the two sides were negotiating in {@creature Xanathar|WDH}'s lair, the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} suddenly disappeared from where {@creature Xanathar|WDH} had hidden it. The paranoid beholder accused the Black Network of stealing it and slew the Zhentarim envoys who were present. When the Zhents retaliated by attacking {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild outposts, {@creature Xanathar|WDH} took their actions as confirmation of the Black Network's vile intentions. Now the bad blood between the Zhentarim and {@creature Xanathar|WDH} has begun to spill into the streets, threatening peace throughout the city.": "当双方在{@creature Xanathar|WDH}的巢穴中进行谈判时，{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}突然从{@creature Xanathar|WDH}隐藏的地方消失了。妄想症患者指责黑网偷走了它，并杀死了在场的镇特使。当镇特人通过攻击{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会的前哨站进行报复时，{@creature Xanathar|WDH}认为他们的行动证实了黑网的卑鄙意图。现在，真塔里姆和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}之间的仇恨已经开始蔓延到街上，威胁着整个城市的和平。",
	"Who actually stole the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}? The answer: a rock gnome named Dalakhar. After Lord Neverember used magic to discern the gemstone's location, he sent forth a succession of spies to infiltrate {@creature Xanathar|WDH}'s lair and obtain it. Dalakhar succeeded where many others before him had failed, but his success turns out to be short-lived.": "究竟是谁偷了（%0%）？答案是：一个叫达拉哈的岩石侏儒。在Neverember勋爵用魔法辨别出宝石的位置后，他派出了一连串的间谍，潜入(%%)的巢穴并获得它。达拉哈成功了，在他之前的许多人都失败了，但他的成功是短暂的。",
	"The Yawning Portal serves as the default starting point for this story. One of the first people the adventurers meet there is Volothamp Geddarm. He has just returned from a tour promoting his latest book, {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|vgm}, and he has a quest for the characters.": "打哈欠的门户是这个故事的默认起点。冒险家们在那里最先遇到的人之一是沃洛桑-格达姆。他刚从巡回宣传他的新书《%0%》回来，他有一个任务要交给这些人物。",
	"One of Volo's friends, a handsome simpleton named {@creature Floon Blagmaar|WDH}, has disappeared, seemingly kidnapped. The search for Floon leads to the revelation that he was caught up in a case of mistaken identity, and the characters are actually looking for two victims. The intended target was Lord Neverember's estranged son, {@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}. Agents of the Zhentarim waylaid him because they want to know everything that Renaer knows about the cache of dragons. (Unfortunately for them, Renaer is ignorant of the cache and its whereabouts). If the characters rescue him, Renaer proves to be a worthy ally to adventurers hoping to make a name for themselves in Waterdeep.": "沃罗的一个朋友，一个名叫（%0%）的英俊憨厚的人，失踪了，似乎是被绑架了。寻找福隆的过程中发现，他被卷入了一个身份错误的案件中，而这些人物实际上是在寻找两名受害者。预定的目标是Neverember勋爵的疏远的儿子，{@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}。Zhentarim的代理人拦截了他，因为他们想知道Renaer所知道的关于龙的缓存的一切。(对他们来说，不幸的是，雷纳对藏匿处和它的下落一无所知）。如果角色们把他救出来，那么对于希望在Waterdeep扬名立万的冒险者来说，Renaer证明是一个值得信赖的盟友。",
	"As a reward for rescuing Floon, Volo gives adventurers the deed to a building in the North Ward that looks out onto a wide cul-de-sac hemmed in by old residences and shops. The property used to be a tavern with a residence on the upper floors. The tavern has been closed for years, and the residence is haunted by a poltergeist that the characters can lay to rest.": "作为解救弗隆的奖励，沃罗将北区的一栋建筑的地契给了冒险者，这栋建筑可以看到一条宽阔的死胡同，被古老的住宅和商店包围着。这栋楼以前是一家酒馆，上面有一栋住宅。酒馆已经关闭多年，而住宅则被一个鬼魂困扰着，人物可以让它安息。",
	"Waterdeep is blanketed by an undispellable magical effect called {@i Ahghairon's dragonward}. The effect originates from somewhere under Ahghairon's Tower in the Castle Ward and is permanent. Dragons and all other creatures of the dragon type are physically unable to enter the city (or its sewers) as long as the dragonward persists. The effect doesn't extend to the harbor or into Undermountain.": "Waterdeep被一种不可驱使的魔法效果所笼罩，这种效果叫做（%0%）。该效果来自城堡区阿格海隆塔下的某处，并且是永久性的。只要向龙效应持续存在，龙和所有其他龙类生物就无法进入城市（或其下水道）。这个效果不会延伸到港口或进入地下山。",
	"A creature of the dragon type that is touched by the {@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDH|11}) can ignore {@i Ahghairon's dragonward} and move through the city freely. The effect lasts until the creature is touched again by the staff, or until the passage of a period of time specified by one who is attuned to the staff.": "被{@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH}(见{@adventure appendix A|WDH|11})触及的龙类生物可以无视{@i Ahghairon's dragonward}并在城市中自由移动。该效果持续到该生物再次被法杖触及，或者直到与法杖相适应的人指定的时间段过去。",
	"The {@i dragonstaff} is currently in the possession of an adult gold dragon named {@creature Aurinax|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}), who guards a hidden vault under the city.": "目前，{@i dragonstaff}被一条名为{@creature Aurinax|WDH}的成年金龙所拥有(见{@adventure appendix B|WDH|12})，他守卫着城市下的一个隐藏的金库。",
	"As time goes on, the characters attract the attention of local factions hoping to recruit them while they settle into the city. Eventually, these relatively peaceful times are shattered when a fireball detonates near their new residence. The characters are swept up in the aftermath of this horrific event and can try to get to the bottom of it. Who cast the {@spell fireball} spell and why? Who was the intended target? They can investigate the incident on behalf of a guild or a faction, or they can become involved for reasons of their own.": "随着时间的推移，这些人物吸引了当地派别的注意，希望在他们融入城市的同时招募他们。最终，当一个火球在他们的新住所附近引爆时，这些相对平静的时光被打破了。角色们被卷进了这一恐怖事件的后果中，并可以尝试去了解它的真相。谁施展了{@spell fireball}的咒语，为什么？谁是预定的目标？他们可以代表一个公会或一个派别调查这个事件，也可以因为自己的原因而卷入其中。",
	"One casualty of the fireball is in fact its intended target: Lord Neverember's spy, Dalakhar. Whoever killed the gnome now has the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}, the key to finding the lost cache of dragons. One way or another, depending on the alliances-and the enemies-they have made in the city, the characters become embroiled in the chase for the stone and the hoard it protects.": "火球的一个牺牲者实际上是它的预定目标。永恒之城的间谍，达拉哈尔。杀死地精的人现在有了{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}，这是找到丢失的龙藏的关键。或多或少，取决于他们在城市中结成的联盟和敌人，这些人物都卷入了对石头和它所保护的囤积物的追逐中。",
	"When you run this adventure, you choose its main villain at the outset. Your choice determines the season of the year in which the story takes place, as well as the antagonists in several of the encounters in chapter 4. The villain you choose opposes the player characters, while the villains you don't choose become part of the backdrop and could help the characters or hinder them.": "当你运行这个冒险时，你在一开始就选择它的主要反派。你的选择决定了故事发生在哪一年的哪个季节，以及第四章中几个遭遇战中的对手。你选择的反派会反对玩家角色，而你不选择的反派则会成为背景的一部分，可能会帮助角色或阻碍他们。",
	"As another unusual feature of this adventure, the villains aren't meant to be killed, nor are they out to kill the player characters. The villains are after a treasure hoard, and the adventurers' ultimate goal is to keep the treasure out of their clutches.": "作为这次冒险的另一个不同寻常的特点，恶棍们并不是要被杀死的，他们也不是要杀死玩家角色。恶棍们的目标是宝藏，而冒险家们的最终目标是不让宝藏落入他们的魔掌。",
	"You can swap out one villain for another at any time.

	"{@creature Xanathar|WDH} has a healthy fear of {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH} and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Waterdeep's Open Lord.

Activity in the city slows to a crawl, since Waterdavians are unaccustomed to such heat.": "沃特德普的夏天相当舒适，是市民和游客在户外聚集的好时机。市场比一年中的任何时候都要繁忙。但有时，暖空气从南方推上来，在城市北部和东部的山谷里定居。这些空气被困住，形成可能持续几天或几周的热浪。城市里的活动会慢下来，因为沃特达威人不习惯这种热。",

An explosion tears through Trollskull Alley, prompting an investigation that hurls the characters into conflict with some secondary villains, culminating in a bloody confrontation at a noble estate.": "第三章开始于几天或几周之后，让人物有时间适应城市生活并追求自己的兴趣。一场爆炸撕裂了巨魔胡同，引发了一场调查，使人物与一些次要的恶棍发生冲突，最终在一个贵族庄园发生了一场血腥的对峙。",
	"In chapter 4, the characters race to find the gold. The encounters in this chapter and the order in which they occur change depending on the villain you've chosen. The chapter concludes with the discovery of Lord Neverember's treasure vault and a showdown with its gold dragon guardian.

You can gently steer characters in a different direction, drop hints that urge them to use extreme caution, or make deadly encounters easier. It also bears remembering that the villains are meant to be thwarted, not killed, and they are rarely spoiling for a fight. Adventurers who get in over their heads can be knocked {@condition unconscious} rather than killed. Such characters might awaken in an alley, a sewer tunnel, or a prison cell, with or without their gear. Conversely, they might awaken safe and sound with all their gear in a private residence, being cared for by friendly NPCs who took them in.": "如果角色在完成第四章之前发现自己在反派的巢穴中，请准备好即时调整，因为每个巢穴中的挑战对于低于五级的角色来说都很难克服。你可以温和地引导角色往不同的方向走，给他们一些提示，敦促他们使用极度谨慎的方法，或者让致命的遭遇变得更容易。还应该记住，反派人物是要被挫败的，而不是要被杀死的，他们很少会破坏一场战斗。陷入困境的冒险者可以被击倒（%0%），而不是被杀死。这样的角色可能会在小巷、下水道或牢房中醒来，无论是否有装备。相反，他们可能会在私人住宅中带着所有装备安然醒来，并得到收留他们的友好NPC的照顾。",

	"Characters who overtly engage in criminal behavior are quickly cornered and arrested by members of the City Watch. Those charged with committing a crime are brought before a magister to be judged.

	"When the authorities show up to arrest one or more player characters for breaking the law, you can handle the arrest in one of two ways.": "当当局出现逮捕一个或多个玩家角色的违法行为时，你可以用两种方式之一来处理逮捕行为。",
	"The first approach is to roleplay the encounter with the arresting officers of the City Watch. The benefit of this approach is that characters can choose to go quietly or resist. The drawback is that the encounter might devolve into a fight-or-flight situation, leading to one or more characters becoming fugitives. If the party includes one or more characters who aren't lawful, such an outcome is likely. To mitigate this drawback, you might allow fugitive characters to forge alliances with NPCs who can help clear their names.": "第一种方法是对与城市守望的逮捕人员的遭遇进行角色扮演。这种方法的好处是，角色可以选择安静地离开或反抗。缺点是，这种遭遇可能会演变成不战而屈人之兵的局面，导致一个或多个角色成为逃亡者。如果聚会中包括一个或多个不守法的角色，这样的结果就很可能发生。为了减轻这个缺点，你可以让逃亡的角色与能够帮助他们洗脱罪名的NPC结成联盟。",
	"If the threat of arrest becomes tedious, you can switch to the second approach, which is to merely inform the players that one or more characters have been arrested. You can describe the arrest, the subsequent detention, and the events leading up to the trial. The drawback to this approach is that player characters have no control over the situation. (This sense of helplessness has the virtue of being realistic, if not fun.) To mitigate this drawback, you might allow characters to make ability checks to influence the outcome; for example, a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check might enable a character to bribe an official or sow enough doubt in the mind of a magistrate to have the case thrown out.": "如果逮捕的威胁变得乏味，你可以改用第二种方法，也就是仅仅告知玩家一个或多个角色被逮捕了。你可以描述逮捕，随后的拘留，以及导致审判的事件。这种方法的缺点是，玩家角色无法控制局势。(这种无助感即使不有趣，也有现实的优点。)为了减轻这个缺点，你可以让角色进行能力检查以影响结果；例如，成功的魅力（劝说）检查可以使角色贿赂官员或在地方法官心中播下足够的怀疑，从而使案件被驳回。",
	"Important NPCs in the adventure are given names, but many of the secondary NPCs aren't named. {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge} contains an appendix of {@5etools tables you can use to randomly generate names|names.html} for human and non-human NPCs if you have trouble coming up with names on your own.": "冒险中的重要NPC都有名字，但许多次要NPC没有名字。{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}包含一个人类和非人类NPC的附录{@5etools tables you can use to randomly generate names|names.html}，如果你在自己想出名字的时候遇到困难。",

Kenku that are still alive and present are taken into custody, and it doesn't take long for the City Watch to conclude that the dead men are members of the Zhentarim and the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, since violent encounters between the two factions are becoming ever more frequent. While his constables search the warehouse, Captain Staget questions the characters.": "在人物找到雷纳后不久，一位名叫Hyustus Staget的城市守卫队队长（LG男性伊鲁斯坎人（%0%））带领一打人（%1%）来到仓库。在接到可疑活动的报告后，他们闯了进去，试图阻止任何人离开。仍然活着并在场的肯库被拘押起来，没过多久，城市守望者就得出结论，死者是赞塔林和（%%2%）公会的成员，因为这两个派别之间的暴力冲突越来越频繁。在他的警员们搜查仓库的时候，斯塔吉特队长询问了这些人物。",

After all, he reasons, if the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild and the Zhentarim want to destroy each other, why not let them?": "斯塔吉特队长是一个紧张的人，帮助维持码头区的和平。码头区的每个店主、公会成员、旅店老板和酒馆老板都认识他，而且大多数人都尊重他，不管他们对城市守望者的看法如何。斯塔吉特不相信谣言或流言蜚语，他不喝酒，也不会让愤怒影响到他的心情。他的工作是遏制码头区的暴力，但他一直在拖后腿。毕竟，他的理由是，如果{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会和Zhentarim想摧毁对方，为什么不让他们这样做呢？",
	"Staget once had the warehouse under surveillance, but elected to pull the detail to bolster patrols throughout the Dock Ward-a decision he now regrets. That surveillance was part of an attempt to catch a known Zhent instigator named {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}, a \"big fish\" rumored to be responsible for much of the recent strife. Staget doesn't share this information with strangers.": "斯塔吉特曾经监视过这个仓库，但他选择抽调人员加强对整个码头区的巡逻--他现在对这个决定感到后悔。那次监视是为了抓住一个已知的Zhent煽动者的一部分，他的名字叫{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}，据传是一条 \"大鱼\"，对最近的纷争负有很大责任。斯塔吉特不与陌生人分享这些信息。",
	"Staget and Renaer recognize each other, though they aren't well acquainted. The involvement of a Neverember noble prompts the captain to be on his best behavior. He is prepared to overlook any crimes committed by the characters as long as Renaer is with them, but he gives them a folded sheet of parchment with the Code Legal written on it and encourages them to read it.

	"If the characters ask for the Watch's help in locating Floon, Staget makes it clear that he won't send a force into the sewers in search of someone who might well be a Zhent or {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild spy. If they appear intent on involving themselves further in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, Staget imparts some free advice before letting them go:": "如果这些人物请求守望者帮助找到弗隆，斯塔吉特明确表示，他不会派人进入下水道寻找一个很可能是赞特或（%0%）公会间谍的人。如果他们似乎有意进一步卷入赞塔林和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会之间的冲突，斯塔吉特在放他们走之前给了一些免费的建议。",

	"At this point, the characters likely know that Floon was kidnapped by {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild members who mistook him for {@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}, and that he was taken to a hideout in the sewers.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or 5 gp in bribes allows the characters to trace the kidnappers' path through back alleys to a circular metal cover inset in the pavement. The cover is easily lifted, revealing a ladder down into the sewers.": "在这一点上，人物可能知道Floon是被{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会成员绑架的，他们误以为他是{@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}，他被带到了下水道的一个藏身处。如果人物没有从Kenku那里得知Floon被带到哪里，询问当地人可以发现很多人看到他被拖走。成功通过DC15智力（调查）检查或5戈比的贿赂，可以让角色追踪绑匪的路径，穿过后巷，找到一个嵌入路面的圆形金属盖。这个盖子很容易就被掀开了，露出了一个通往下水道的梯子。",

	"Dalakhar, a rock gnome spy working for Lord Dagult Neverember, was on his way to see the characters when the fireball went off, killing him and ten other people. The gnome is important because he was carrying the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDH|11})-the key to finding Lord Neverember's hidden cache of gold. Hounded by agents of the Zhentarim, the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, and Bregan D'aerthe, Dalakhar was unable to escape from Waterdeep with the artifact, so he planned to entrust it to the characters briefly, for surely the folk who rescued Lord Neverember's son could keep it safe where he could not.": "达拉哈，一个为达古特-纽文尔勋爵工作的岩石地精间谍，当火球爆炸时，他正在去见这些人物的路上，他和其他十个人都死了。这个地精很重要，因为他带着{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDH|11}）--找到Neverember勋爵隐藏的黄金库的关键。被Zhentarim、{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会和Bregan D'aerthe的特工追捕，Dalakhar无法带着神器逃出Waterdeep，所以他打算把它短暂地托付给这些人物，因为救出Neverember勋爵儿子的人肯定能在他无法做到的地方保护它。",

	"Three members of the Black Network, including the Zhent assassin {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}), were close to nabbing Dalakhar when they were caught in the blast. Of the three, only Urstul survived. Though he was wounded, he was able to pluck the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} from Dalakhar's pocket before fleeing the scene. While other survivors were coming to their senses, Urstul stumbled through the smoke and haze and eventually made his way back to Gralhund Villa a short distance away.": "三名黑网成员，包括赞特刺客{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}（见{@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}），在接近抓捕达拉哈时被卷入爆炸。这三个人中，只有乌尔斯图尔幸存下来。虽然他受了伤，但在逃离现场之前，他还是从达拉哈的口袋里掏出了{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}。当其他幸存者逐渐清醒过来的时候，乌尔斯图尔跌跌撞撞地穿过烟雾和阴霾，最终回到了不远处的格拉洪德别墅。",
	"The heads of the Gralhund noble family, {@creature Yalah Gralhund|wdh} and her husband, {@creature Orond Gralhund|wdh|Orond}, are providing coin and shelter to Urstul and his fellow Zhents in exchange for the promise of getting their fair share of the hidden cache of gold. But the Gralhunds aren't willing to put their trust entirely in the Black Network; they sent out their own agent to shadow the Zhents, eliminate Dalakhar, and obtain the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} on their behalf. Yalah gave the would-be assassin a {@item necklace of fireballs} with instructions on how and when to use it. When it seemed as though Dalakhar might give {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh} the slip, this agent hurled one of the beads from the necklace to stop the gnome in his tracks.": "Gralhund贵族家族的首领{@creature Yalah Gralhund|wdh}和她的丈夫{@creature Orond Gralhund|wdh|Orond}向Urstul和他的Zhents同伴提供钱币和住所，以换取他们在隐藏的黄金库中获得公平份额的承诺。但格拉洪德人并不愿意完全信任黑网；他们派出了自己的特工来跟踪甄子丹，消灭达拉哈，并代表他们获得（2%）。亚拉给了这个可能的刺客一个{@item necklace of fireballs}，并说明了如何和何时使用它。当达拉哈似乎可能给{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}滑倒时，这个特工从项链上扔下一颗珠子，阻止了地精的行动。",
	"The Gralhunds' assassin is a {@creature nimblewright|wdh} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}) that escaped from the House of Inspired Hands, the temple of Gond in the Sea Ward, a month ago.

	"A magistrate provides the City Watch with a warrant to search Gralhund Villa. Sometime afterward, Cromley visits the characters by himself and, as a courtesy, tells them what happened:": "一位地方法官向城市守望者提供了搜查格拉洪德别墅的许可。之后的某个时候，克罗姆利独自拜访了这些人物，出于礼貌，告诉他们发生了什么。",
	"Officers arrived to find Lord Gralhund {@condition unconscious}, Lady Gralhund in shock, and their half-orc bodyguard bloodied but unbowed.": "警官们赶到时发现格拉洪德勋爵（%0%）、格拉洪德夫人处于震惊之中，他们的半兽人保镖浑身是血但没有受伤。",
	"Apparently, the Gralhunds had been held hostage for more than a tenday by agents of the Black Network. Most of the Zhents were killed during a bloody revolt led by Lord Gralhund himself.": "显然，Gralhunds已经被黑网的特工挟持了一个多星期了。大多数Zhents人在Gralhund勋爵本人领导的血腥叛乱中被杀。",
	"The Zhent leader, {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}, was among those who got away. He's still at large. The Watch plans to step up its search for him.": "Zhent的领导，{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}，是那些逃脱的人中的一员。他仍然在逃。观察团计划加强对他的搜寻。",
	"Of the nimblewright, there was no sign. According to the Gralhunds, the construct was delivered to Gralhund Villa weeks earlier. The family took it in, not realizing it was a Zhentarim spy. Lady Gralhund reported that it stole her {@item necklace of fireballs}.": "敏捷的人，没有任何迹象。根据格拉洪德家族的说法，这个构造物在几周前被送到了格拉洪德别墅。这家人收留了它，没有意识到它是一个Zhentarim的间谍。格拉洪德夫人报告说，它偷走了她的（%0%）。",
	"Cromley's summary of events is based on information given to the City Watch by the Gralhunds and is riddled with falsehoods. The hostage situation, Lord Gralhund's heroism, and the theft of Lady Gralhund's {@item necklace of fireballs} never happened. The nimblewright's affiliation with the Zhentarim is also a lie. The Gralhunds' account further doesn't explain why the {@creature nimblewright|wdh} would use the {@item necklace of fireballs} to inflict harm on the Zhents if it was working with them. If characters raise that question, Cromley thinks for a moment and then ventures the guess that the nimblewright underestimated the necklace's explosive power.": "克罗姆利对事件的总结是基于格拉洪德家族给城市守望者的信息，其中充满了虚假的内容。人质事件、格拉洪德勋爵的英雄主义以及格拉洪德夫人的盗窃事件（%0%）从未发生过。nimblewright与Zhentarim的关系也是一个谎言。Gralhunds的说法更没有解释为什么{@creature nimblewright|wdh}会利用{@item necklace of fireballs}对Zhents造成伤害，如果它是与他们合作的话。如果人物提出这个问题，克罗姆利思考了一会儿，然后大胆猜测，敏捷的人低估了项链的爆炸力。",
	"The characters can insert themselves into Gralhund Villa and accost its residents with impunity if they're careful to pin the violence on the Zhents or if they're able to enter and leave unseen before the City Watch shows up to arrest everyone.": "如果他们小心翼翼地将暴力事件归咎于Zhents，或者他们能够在城市守望者出现逮捕所有人之前神不知鬼不觉地进入和离开，那么这些人物就可以插入Gralhund Villa，并肆无忌惮地搭讪其居民。",
	"Sneaking in or out of the villa without being seen or heard by neighbors and passersby requires each character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill can take disadvantage on the check to grant advantage on another party member's check (essentially compensating for a less stealthy companion).": "在不被邻居和路人看到或听到的情况下溜进或溜出别墅，需要每个角色在DC15灵巧（隐身）检查中取得成功。熟练掌握隐身技能的人物可以在检查中处于劣势，从而在另一个成员的检查中获得优势（基本上是对隐身能力较差的同伴的补偿）。",
	"If the characters side with the Gralhunds in the conflict, Lady Gralhund is inclined to overlook their trespass. Her demeanor sours, however, if they start asking too many questions. She vigorously denies accusations that her family is involved with the Black Network and claims the Zhents were holding her family hostage (a false claim also parroted by her husband, her bodyguard, her children, and her staff). If the characters assault any member of the household or brandish weapons in an attempt to intimidate, the Gralhunds inform the City Watch of the party's crimes.": "如果角色们在冲突中站在格拉洪德一边，格拉洪德夫人就会倾向于忽略他们的侵犯行为。然而，如果他们开始问太多的问题，她的态度就会变坏。她极力否认关于她的家族与黑网有关的指控，并声称Zhents人挟持了她的家人（她的丈夫、她的保镖、她的孩子和她的工作人员也是这样的错误说法）。如果人物攻击任何家庭成员或挥舞武器试图恐吓，格拉洪德人就会将该党的罪行告知城市守望。",
	"During the characters' invasion of Gralhund Villa, the {@creature nimblewright|wdh} flees the estate with the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} (see chapter 4 for more information on its destination). If the characters are using Nim's nimblewright detector to track the nimblewright, the device lets them know that the nimblewright has fled the scene, but not the direction it went.": "在人物入侵Gralhund Villa的过程中，{@creature nimblewright|wdh}和{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}一起逃离了庄园（关于其目的地的更多信息，见第4章）。如果角色们使用尼姆的小精灵探测器来追踪小精灵，这个装置会让他们知道小精灵已经逃离了现场，但不知道它去的方向。",
	"Gralhund Villa sits in the middle of an upper-class residential neighborhood in the North Ward. Here are some general facts to keep in mind:": "格拉洪德别墅坐落在北区的一个上层住宅区的中间。以下是一些需要记住的一般事实。",
	"The streets around the villa have pedestrians and coaches traveling along them at all hours, though traffic is heavier during the day.": "别墅周围的街道上随时都有行人和教练车在行驶，不过白天的交通比较繁忙。",

	"Neighbors and bystanders alert the City Watch if they hear loud, disturbing noises (such as a {@spell thunderwave} spell) coming from the estate or if they see anything suspicious. The Watch sends a {@creature mage} and six {@creature veteran||veterans} (one {@creature sergeant|WDH} and five constables) to investigate, and it takes {@dice 1d6 + 4} minutes for this force to arrive.": "邻居和旁观者如果听到来自庄园的响亮、令人不安的声音（如{@spell thunderwave}的咒语），或看到任何可疑的东西，就会向城市观察站报警。观察站派出一名（%%1%）和六名（%%2%）（一名（%%3%）和五名警员）去调查，这支队伍需要（%%4%）分钟才能到达。",

	"An {@spell arcane lock} spell is cast on the gates. Forcing them open requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, while picking the lock requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The spell doesn't bar members of the Gralhund family, their staff, their guards, or Lady Gralhund's {@creature nimblewright|wdh} from opening the gates.": "一个{@spell arcane lock}的咒语被施加在大门上。强行打开需要成功进行DC25力量（运动）检查，而开锁则需要成功进行DC20灵巧检查，使用盗贼的工具。这个咒语并不禁止格拉洪德家族的成员、他们的工作人员、他们的卫兵或格拉洪德夫人（%1%）打开大门。",
	"The estate is well tended. In spring and summer, large trees provide shade. The trees begin shedding leaves in the fall. By winter, their branches are stripped bare.": "这座庄园被精心打理。在春天和夏天，大树提供了阴凉。这些树在秋天开始落叶。到了冬天，它们的树枝被剥光了。",
	"Through the trees, the characters can see a large balcony ({@area G17|116}) enclosed by an iron railing above the mansion's main entrance.

	"The yard is looked after by a menacing groundskeeper named Hurv Taldred (LE male Illuskan {@creature cult fanatic}) and his two quiet {@creature mastiff||mastiffs}. The Gralhunds paid a necromancer to perform a ritual on Hurv and his mastiffs.

Characters who are members of the faction are safe for the time being, as long as they keep a low profile. Otherwise, they too are rounded up and questioned over a period of several days, until the Lords of Waterdeep ascertain their level of involvement in the violence at Gralhund Villa.

	"Istrid fears being arrested by the City Watch. Although she wasn't involved in the matters concerning Gralhund Villa, she is worried that the Watch will uncover her illegal currency-lending operation in the course of its investigations. She offers the characters 10 pp just for meeting with her and promises another 40 pp if the characters agree to help her lie low for a tenday-half to be paid once a deal is struck and half at the end of her stay. If they decline her offer and the party includes one or more Zhentarim members, she threatens that if she's arrested and charged with a crime, she will reveal their affiliation and bring them down with her.": "伊斯特丽德担心被城市监察局逮捕。虽然她并没有参与有关格拉洪德别墅的事情，但她担心守望先锋会在调查过程中发现她的非法货币借贷业务。她给人物提供了10个pp，只是为了和她见面，并承诺如果人物同意帮助她潜伏一天，则再提供40个pp--交易达成后支付一半，在她逗留结束后支付一半。如果他们拒绝了她的提议，并且队伍中包括一个或多个Zhentarim成员，她威胁说如果她被逮捕并被指控犯罪，她将揭露他们的隶属关系并把他们也拉下水。",
	"If the characters decide to let Istrid hide out at their tavern, she uses a disguise kit to make herself up to be a male dwarf named Jorn. If asked to do so, she's willing to perform chores around the place once she settles in. Ultimately, no one comes looking for her, but the longer she stays hidden, the more testy and demanding she becomes.": "如果角色们决定让伊斯特丽德躲在他们的酒馆里，她会用一个伪装工具把自己装扮成一个名叫乔恩的男性矮人。如果被要求这样做，一旦她安顿下来，她愿意在这里做一些杂务。最终，没有人来找她，但她藏得越久，她就变得越暴躁，要求越高。",
	"If the characters tolerate her bad behavior, Istrid leaves at the end of the tenday as promised and pays characters the remainder of what she owes. Characters who are members of the Zhentarim gain an added benefit for harboring Istrid in her time of need: their renown in the faction increases by 2.": "如果角色们容忍她的不良行为，伊斯特丽德就会按照承诺在这一天结束时离开，并向角色们支付她所欠的剩余款项。作为Zhentarim成员的角色，在Istrid需要帮助的时候庇护她会获得额外的好处：他们在该派系中的声望增加2。",
	"If, on the other hand, the characters throw her out or rat her out to the City Watch, Istrid becomes their mortal enemy and tries to undermine them at every turn.": "另一方面，如果这些人物把她赶走或向城市守望者告发她，伊斯特丽德就会成为他们的死敌，并试图处处破坏他们。",
	"As a precaution against being double-crossed, Istrid shared her plan concerning the characters with at least one other member of the Doom Raiders (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}). If the characters betray or harm Istrid, her former adventuring companions use every resource at their disposal to ruin the characters. The laws of Waterdeep discourage them from attacking the characters openly, but they can damage the party's business by scaring off their clientele, and characters might find themselves the targets of worse if they dare to leave the confines of the city.": "为了防止被人出卖，伊斯特丽德至少与厄运突击队的另一名成员分享了她关于这些角色的计划（见（%0%））。如果这些角色背叛或伤害了伊斯特丽德，她以前的冒险伙伴们就会利用他们所掌握的一切资源来毁掉这些角色。沃特德普的法律不鼓励他们公开攻击角色，但他们可以通过吓跑客户来破坏聚会的生意，如果角色敢于离开城市的范围，他们可能会发现自己成为更糟糕的目标。",
	"If you're leveling up characters using story milestones instead of tracking experience points, the characters advance from 3rd to 4th level if they conducted their own investigation into the fireball incident and affected the outcome of events in Gralhund Villa. Otherwise, they are still 3rd level at the start of chapter 4.": "如果你使用故事里程碑来提升人物的等级，而不是追踪经验值，那么如果他们对火球事件进行了自己的调查并影响了格拉洪德别墅事件的结果，那么人物就会从第三级升到第四级。否则，他们在第四章开始时仍然是第三级。",
	"Gold makes people do strange things, and Lord Neverember's hidden cache of dragons is up for grabs. The {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} knows where the treasure vault is located and how to get inside, and much of this chapter focuses on the characters' hunt for the artifact. The challenges before them depend on the villain (or villains) that you selected to oppose them.

	"In chapter 3, Lady Gralhund's {@creature nimblewright|wdh} took the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} and fled with it. The nimblewright delivers the artifact to a location and leaves it there for the main villain or villains to retrieve:": "在第三章中，格拉洪德夫人的（%0%）拿走了（%1%）并带着它逃走了。敏捷的人把文物送到一个地方，并把它留在那里，让主要的反派或恶棍去取回。",
	"If {@creature Xanathar|WDH} is the villain, the stone is delivered to a mage named {@creature Grinda Garloth|WDH}.

	"If Jarlaxle is the villain, the stone is delivered to Fenerus Stormcastle, a lamplighter in the Trades Ward. Fenerus has a criminal history and is currently in trouble with the law.": "如果贾拉索是恶棍，石头就会被送到贸易区的点灯人费纳斯-斯托姆卡斯尔手中。费内鲁斯有犯罪史，目前正陷入法律的困境。",
	"If {@creature Manshoon|WDH} is the villain, the stone is brought to {@creature Thrakkus|wdh}, a dragonborn butcher in the Field Ward who chops up bodies for the Zhentarim.": "如果{@creature Manshoon|WDH}是坏蛋，石头就会被带到{@creature Thrakkus|wdh}那里，他是田野区的一个龙裔屠夫，为Zhentarim劈开尸体。",
	"If the characters can't pick up the trail after the {@creature nimblewright|wdh} escapes with the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}, they might turn to the City Watch, the City Guard, or a friendly faction for help, which comes forth in {@dice 1d4} days. If it occurs to none of the characters, an NPC suggests that the party visit the House of Inspired Hands to see whether the priests of Gond know a way to find it (see \"Nim's Secret\"). Thereafter, armed with Nim's nimblewright detector, the characters can sweep the city. But by the time they find the nimblewright, it has already delivered the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} to its intended destination.": "如果在（%0%）带着（%1%）逃跑后，角色们无法捡到线索，他们可能会向城市守望者、城市卫队或一个友好派别求助，这在（%2%）天内就会出现。如果没有一个角色想到这一点，一个NPC建议他们去拜访 \"灵感之家\"，看看冈德的牧师们是否知道找到它的方法（见 \"尼姆的秘密\"）。此后，在尼姆的灵巧探测器的武装下，人物可以扫荡整个城市。但是，当他们找到敏捷的人时，它已经把{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}送到了它的目的地。",
	"When it is finally found, the {@creature nimblewright|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}) is wearing a stolen cloak and hiding under a pile of uncollected garbage in an alley. Exactly where and when the characters stumble upon it is up to you. With nowhere to go and no other purpose, it fights until destroyed. Regardless of where and when this event takes place, six members of the City Watch ({@creature veteran||veterans}) arrive as the fight ends. Drawn by the commotion, the Watch couldn't care less about the nimblewright and believes any plausible story the characters tell them. (As a construct, it had no rights to speak of.) The officers are near the end of their shift and eager to move on; they urge the characters to go home and cause no further mischief.": "当它最终被发现时，{@creature nimblewright|WDH}（见{@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}）穿着一件偷来的斗篷，躲在小巷里一堆未被收集的垃圾下面。角色们究竟在什么地方、什么时候偶然发现它，取决于你。由于无处可去，也没有其他目的，它一直战斗到被摧毁。无论这一事件发生在何时何地，当战斗结束时，六名城市守望者（{@creature veteran||veterans}）到达。在这场骚乱的吸引下，守望者们根本不关心这个灵活的人，他们相信人物告诉他们的任何合理的故事。(作为一个结构体，它没有任何权利可言。)警官们已经接近下班时间，急于继续工作；他们敦促角色们回家，不要再惹麻烦了。",
	"Lady Gralhund gave her {@creature nimblewright|wdh} a map showing where to take the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}, but she forgot to tell it to destroy the map once the stone was delivered. Characters who search the nimblewright's remains find the folded-up map, which depicts one of Waterdeep's wards. Written on the map is an X with a name next to it. This map points the characters to where they need to be, setting off a sequence of encounters (see \"Encounter Chains\" below). The main villain determines which ward the map depicts and what name is written on it:": "Gralhund女士给了她（%0%）一张地图，显示了拿（%1%）的地方，但她忘了告诉它，一旦石头送到，就把地图毁掉。搜索敏捷者遗体的角色发现了折叠起来的地图，上面描绘了沃特迪普的一个防护区。地图上写着一个X，旁边是一个名字。这张地图将人物指向他们需要去的地方，引发一连串的遭遇战（见下文 \"遭遇战链\"）。主要的反派决定了地图所描绘的是哪个区，上面写的是什么名字。",

	"If the characters obtain the stone earlier than expected, it proves uncooperative and tries to separate itself from the party as quickly as possible, refusing to share any knowledge with characters in the meantime. The stone tries to take control of anyone who attunes to it, triggering a conflict (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}). If the stone fails to take control, it can't try again against that character until the next dawn. If the stone succeeds in taking control of its owner, it orders that character to deliver it to whichever location sets into motion the sequence of encounters discussed in this chapter (see \"Encounter Chains\"). Once the stone divests itself of its current owner, it tries to erase all knowledge of itself from that character's mind (see the item's description in appendix A). Any player whose character is forced to forget about the stone carries the burden of roleplaying that memory loss.

He presents a detailed plan that commingles the attractions of the Sea Maidens Faire with the bizarre inventions of the temple-a plan that is well received.": "奇迹之日是秋季最盛大的游行，贾拉索希望海女节能成为其中的一部分。他化身为扎尔多兹-佐德，在节日的前一天拜访了沃特德普的贡德神庙--灵感之手之家，与负责组织游行的圣徒们进行协调。他提出了一个详细的计划，将海女节的景点与神庙的怪异发明结合起来--这个计划受到了好评。",
	"The evening before the Day of Wonders, workers begin assembling the wagons and floats of the Sea Maidens Faire on the pier. Early the following morning, the docks are a hive of activity as performers practice their routines and caged creatures are offloaded one by one. An hour before highsun on this crisp and windy autumn day, the Sea Maidens Faire makes its way to the House of Inspired Hands to meet up with the Gond worshipers and their contraptions. From there, the parade strikes out in earnest, marching through Waterdeep's streets to the cheers of the local folk. Zardoz Zord serves as grand marshal, leading the parade on the back of a rainbow-feathered {@creature diatryma|WDH} summoned using his {@item feather of diatryma summoning|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDH|11}). For Jarlaxle, the parade is a chance to show off and be cheered; he has no ulterior motive for participating in the event.": "奇迹之日的前一天晚上，工人们开始在码头上组装海女节的马车和花车。第二天清晨，码头上热闹非凡，表演者们在练习他们的表演，笼子里的生物被一个个卸下来。在这个秋高气爽的日子里，在太阳升起前一小时，海女节来到灵感之家，与贡德崇拜者和他们的装置会合。在那里，游行队伍认真地出发了，在当地人的欢呼声中穿过瓦特德普的街道。扎尔多兹-佐德（Zardoz Zord）担任大元帅，骑着用他的（%%1%）召唤出来的彩虹羽翼（%0%）（见（%%2%））带领游行队伍。对贾拉索来说，游行是一个炫耀和被欢呼的机会；他参加这个活动并没有什么特别的动机。",
	"As the Sea Maidens Faire parades through Waterdeep, the characters can slip aboard one or more of Jarlaxle's ships. If things turn violent aboard a ship, its captain uses a {@spell sending} spell to contact Jarlaxle. Jarlaxle is supremely confident that his crews can overcome any threat, so he doesn't rush to their defense at the first sign of trouble. Only if the characters do considerable damage will he treat their attack as a setback.": "当海女节在水底世界巡游时，人物可以溜上贾拉索的一艘或多艘船。如果船上的情况变得很糟糕，其船长会使用一个{@spell sending}的法术来联系贾拉索。贾拉索对他的船员们能够克服任何威胁非常有信心，所以他不会在出现麻烦的第一时间赶去保卫他们。只有当这些人物造成相当大的伤害时，他才会把他们的攻击当作一次挫败。",
	"If the characters escape a confrontation on the ships but leave behind witnesses who can identify them, it takes Bregan D'aerthe several days to track them down (assuming Jarlaxle hasn't already met them). Although killing the characters would be easy at that point, Jarlaxle would rather put them to work for him. He has them watched but doesn't provoke hostilities until such time as the reward clearly outweighs the risks.": "如果这些人物逃脱了船上的对抗，但留下了可以指认他们的证人，那么Bregan D'aerthe需要几天时间来追踪他们（假设Jarlaxle还没有见过他们）。虽然这时杀死这些人物很容易，但贾拉索宁愿让他们为他工作。他监视着他们，但在回报明显大于风险之前，他不会挑起敌对行动。",
	"The Sea Maidens Faire parade ends where it started-at the docks. As the attractions are being loaded back onto their ships, the Faire's {@creature polar bear} gets loose, fleeing into the Dock Ward before its handlers can corner it. News of the escaped bear spreads quickly, and sightings are frequent. If the characters impressed one of the drow ship captains, he contacts them by way of a {@spell sending} spell and asks for help. He wants the bear retrieved before the City Guard finds and kills it, offering a reward of either 250 gp or a {@item potion of water breathing}.": "海上少女节的游行在它开始的地方结束--在码头。当景点被装回船上时，嘉年华的{@creature polar bear}熊松开了手，在它的饲养员将它逼到墙角之前逃进了码头区。逃跑的熊的消息很快就传开了，而且经常有人看到。如果角色们对其中一位乌鸦船长印象深刻，他就会通过{@spell sending}的法术与他们联系，请求帮助。他希望在城市卫队发现并杀死熊之前把它找回来，并提供250金币或一个{@item potion of water breathing}的奖励。",
	"The characters can track and corner the polar bear with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Whether a check succeeds or fails, each attempt represents 1 hour of searching. If the characters find the bear within 4 hours, it can be lured back to the Sea Maidens Faire with food or a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The captain then makes good on the promised reward. If the characters don't find the bear, members of the City Guard get to it first and kill it.": "角色们可以通过成功的DC16智力（调查）或智慧（生存）检查来追踪并逼近北极熊。无论检定是成功还是失败，每次尝试都代表1小时的搜索。如果角色们在4小时内找到北极熊，可以用食物或成功的DC14智慧（动物处理）检查将它引回海女节。然后船长就会兑现承诺的奖励。如果人物没有找到熊，城市卫队的成员会先找到它并杀死它。",
	"{@creature Manshoon|WDH} yearns to rule Waterdeep as a tyrant, take over the Zhentarim, and use both seats of power to plunder and control the Sword Coast. He needs the gold in the Vault of Dragons to pay off Masked Lords and Zhentarim leaders whose support will be instrumental when the time comes to oust Lady {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH} as Open Lord. {@creature Manshoon|WDH} has a long list of powerful enemies, among them the Harpers, Elminster of Shadowdale, Halaster Blackcloak of Undermountain, and the Blackstaff of Waterdeep.

	"A head-on battle with {@creature Manshoon|WDH} isn't likely to go well for the characters. That said, the wizard's greatest weakness is that he has powerful enemies in Waterdeep. The risk of exposure keeps him hidden, and the characters can thwart him by furnishing his enemies with proof that he's alive (after a fashion) and operating in Waterdeep. When it comes to {@creature Manshoon|WDH} clones, deciding to \"let the city deal with it\" is a wise course of action.": "与{@creature Manshoon|WDH}的正面战斗对人物来说不可能很顺利。也就是说，这个巫师最大的弱点是他在沃特迪普有强大的敌人。暴露的风险使他隐藏起来，而角色们可以通过向他的敌人提供证据来挫败他，证明他还活着（在某种程度上）并在水底世界活动。当涉及到{@creature Manshoon|WDH}克隆人时，决定 \"让城市来处理它 \"是一个明智的行动方案。",
	"If the characters find themselves at the evil wizard's mercy, {@creature Manshoon|WDH} will gladly trade their pitiful lives for the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} and the keys to unlock the Vault of Dragons. In exchange for helping him get the gold, he promises the characters 10 percent of the trove (50,000 gp). {@creature Manshoon|WDH} has no intention of honoring this agreement, but it can help buy the characters some time.": "如果人物发现自己处于邪恶巫师的怜悯之下，{@creature Manshoon|WDH}会很乐意用他们可怜的生命来换取{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}和开启龙库的钥匙。作为帮助他获得金子的交换条件，他答应给人物10%的宝库（50,000金币）。{@creature Manshoon|WDH}并不打算履行这个协议，但这可以帮助人物争取一些时间。",
	"If the characters manage to kill {@creature Manshoon|WDH} and the local authorities are made aware of the act, no murder charges are filed. Rather, the characters' actions are celebrated. {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH} summons them to the Palace of Waterdeep to thank them officially, in her capacity as Open Lord. Sometime later, {@creature Vajra Safahr|WDH} invites them to Blackstaff Tower to thank them for their service and offer them membership in Force Grey.": "如果人物成功杀人（%0%），并且当地政府知道了这一行为，就不会提出谋杀指控。相反，人物的行为受到了赞扬。{@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}召唤他们到水底宫殿，以开放领主的身份正式感谢他们。稍后，{@creature Vajra Safahr|WDH}邀请他们到黑石塔，感谢他们的服务，并为他们提供灰色力量的成员资格。",

	"Once {@creature Manshoon|WDH}'s whereabouts are established, the City Guard cordons off and surrounds Kolat Towers. The Blackstaff and the Watchful Order assist as needed.

	"If the characters offer up their tavern for the feast, guild representatives arrive to stock and decorate it for the event. During the three days before the holiday, the tavern is bustling with activity and excitement. Hundreds show up on the day of the feast to partake—not only residents of Trollskull Alley, but also folk from neighboring streets. There's plenty of food to go around, but the tavern practically groans under the weight of the crowd, and additional tables are set up outside to handle the overflow. People don't appear to mind, even as heavy snow begins to fall. Members of the City Watch are on hand to make sure everyone behaves.": "如果人物提供了他们的酒馆作为盛宴，公会代表就会赶来为活动储备和装饰酒馆。在节日前的三天里，酒馆里充满了活动和兴奋。宴会当天，数以百计的人前来参加，不仅有巨魔头巷的居民，还有邻近街道的居民。有很多食物可以吃，但酒馆几乎被人群的重量压得喘不过气来，外面还摆上了更多的桌子，以应对人满为患。人们似乎并不在意，即使大雪开始飘落。城市守望的成员在现场确保每个人的行为。",
	"Nothing violent happens during the Deadwinter Day feast, but the tavern suffers damage as a result of the crowds. The Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild offers to make repairs for free, but the characters must close the establishment for a tenday to facilitate the work. The closure has no effect on business in the long term, however, since the feast fosters such goodwill that clients return in force when the tavern reopens.": "在死冬日的盛宴上没有发生任何暴力事件，但酒馆却因为人多而受到了损害。木匠、屋顶工和绘图师协会提供免费维修服务，但这些人物必须关闭酒馆一个工作日以方便工作。然而，从长远来看，这次关闭对生意没有影响，因为这次盛宴培养了人们的好感，当酒馆重新开张时，顾客们又纷纷回来了。",
	"The feast is a great opportunity for characters to hobnob with neighbors, guild members, and City Watch constables, as well as to gather information on local happenings.": "宴会是一个很好的机会，可以让角色与邻居、行会成员和城市守望者打成一片，也可以收集当地发生的信息。",
	"If the characters make an enemy of {@creature Manshoon|WDH}, he tries to capture one of them and replace that character with a magical duplicate created using the {@spell simulacrum} spell. If one of the players is absent for a game session and circumstances allow it, {@creature Manshoon|WDH} targets that character for replacement while the rest of the party is distracted by other matters. You don't need to roleplay the character's capture; just assume it happens. To create a simulacrum of the character, {@creature Manshoon|WDH} needs some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of the character's body. Once he obtains the necessary components from the captured character, he creates the simulacrum and sends it to the party with instructions to spy on the group and undermine it from within.": "如果这些角色与{@creature Manshoon|WDH}为敌，他就会试图抓住其中一个角色，用一个用{@spell simulacrum}法术创造的魔法复制品来替换这个角色。如果其中一个玩家在游戏环节中缺席，而情况又允许，那么（%%2%）就会在其他玩家被其他事情分散注意力时，以该角色为目标进行替换。你不需要对这个角色的被抓进行角色扮演，只要假设它发生了。为了创造一个角色的模拟物，{@creature Manshoon|WDH}需要一些头发、指甲碎片或其他角色的身体碎片。一旦他从被抓获的角色身上获得了必要的成分，他就会创造出这个模拟人，并将其发送给党派，指示其监视这个团体并从内部破坏它。",
	"If {@creature Manshoon|WDH} embeds a simulacrum within the party, talk privately to the player whose character has been replaced. Then have that player run the simulacrum until it is destroyed or the character it replaced is reintroduced. The simulacrum has the same statistics as the character, but it has only half the character's hit point maximum and can't gain levels.": "如果{@creature Manshoon|WDH}在党内嵌入了一个模拟物，与角色被替换的玩家私下交谈。然后让该玩家运行这个模拟物，直到它被摧毁或者被替换的角色被重新引入。模拟物具有与角色相同的统计数据，但它只有角色最大命中率的一半，并且不能获得等级。",
	"Welcome, Traveler! You have in your hands the foremost and most up-to-date guide to the city—smiled over by none other than its Open Lord, Lady {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}. This chapbook will serve you well until my seminal work on the subject, Volo's Guide to Waterdeep—sadly long out of print, but now a tome prized by collectors—can be updated and printed anew. Ask any broadsheet seller, innkeeper, shopkeeper, tavern owner, or bookseller if they'll soon have copies of the new edition for sale!": "欢迎，旅行者! 你手中的是最重要和最新的城市指南--由其开放的领主夫人（%0%）微笑着主持。这本小册子会让你受益匪浅，直到我在这方面的开创性著作《沃特德普指南》--遗憾的是早已绝版，但现在是收藏家们珍视的巨著--能够被更新和重新印刷。问问任何一个卖大字报的人、旅店老板、商店老板、酒馆老板或书商，他们是否很快就会有新版的副本出售!",
	"Likely you have already arrived in Waterdeep and borne witness to some of its many wonders. But in case this pamphlet has found its way beneath your worthy eyes in anticipation of your visit, due to the commendable efforts of some friend or family member who loves you dearly, I shall explain briefly the circumstances of entry.": "也许你已经来到了沃特德普，并见证了它的许多奇迹。但是，如果这本小册子在你的期待中出现在你的眼前，由于一些深爱你的朋友或家人的值得称赞的努力，我将简要地解释进入的情况。",
	"You will have traveled through lands claimed and controlled by the Lords of Waterdeep long before you see its walls. If you've come from the south by the Trade Way, you'll have met the City Guard at their post at Zundbridge. From the north by way of the Long Road, you'll have passed under their watchful eyes at the town of Rassalantar. And whether by land or sea, you'll likely also have been spotted by the Griffon Cavalry—even if you have not spotted them.": "在看到沃特德普的城墙之前，你已经走过了沃特德普领主要求和控制的土地。如果你从南边的贸易之路过来，你会在尊德桥（Zundbridge）遇到城市卫队的岗哨。如果你从北边的长路过来，你会在拉萨兰特镇上经过他们的监视。无论从陆路还是海路，你都有可能被狮鹫骑兵发现，即使你没有发现他们。",
	"Worry not. Waterdeep is a welcoming city, and you have nothing to fear from these guardians unless you lead a rampaging army of orcs, a horde of gnolls, or similar. They don't even require a toll be paid. (Beware any City Guard who demands a toll, and report the incident to a magister of Waterdeep at your earliest convenience.)": "不要担心。沃特德普是一座热情洋溢的城市，你不用害怕这些守护者，除非你率领一支横冲直撞的兽人军队，一群地精，或者类似的人。他们甚至不要求你支付通行费。(小心任何要求过路费的城市守卫，并在你方便的时候向沃特迪普的魔法师报告这一事件）。",
	"If you travel in a large caravan or on a ship, you will be required to register with a magister at the gate at which you arrived or with the harbor magister. Magisters can easily be recognized by the black robes they wear (and, in fact, are commonly called \"black robes\" as a result) and the City Guard force that always accompanies them. Be aware that magisters can pass a sentence without a trial. It behooves you to treat them with proper respect.": "如果你乘坐大型商队或乘船旅行，你将被要求在你到达的大门处向治安官登记，或向港口的治安官登记。执政官很容易被认出，因为他们穿着黑色的长袍（事实上，因此通常被称为 \"黑袍\"），而且城市警卫队总是伴随着他们。请注意，魔法师可以不经审判而判刑。你应该对他们给予适当的尊重。",
	"If you travel overland in a small party or alone, you aren't required to register with a magister unless your stay extends beyond a tenday. At that point, you must register with a magister either at the harbor, the gates, or the city courts. Discovery of your failure to do so can result in a fine or forced labor. Of course, registration subjects you to monthly taxation. But as a truculent old acquaintance from the Dales once told me, \"The sheep gives the shepherd its fleece or there'll be mutton for dinner.\" That is, the magisters will get you either way, so you might as well register up front.": "如果你以小队或单独旅行，你不需要向治安官登记，除非你的逗留时间超过一个工作日。这时，你必须在港口、城门或城市法院向治安官登记。如果发现你没有这样做，就会被罚款或强迫劳动。当然，登记后你要按月缴税。但是，正如一位来自山谷的暴躁的老熟人曾经告诉我的那样，\"羊给了牧羊人它的羊毛，否则就会有羊肉吃。\" 也就是说，无论如何，地方官都会抓到你，所以你最好先登记一下。",
	"That said, many canny visitors with business for a month or a season betimes avail themselves of the hospitality of inns in Undercliff, the pleasant farmland east of the city proper. The less well-off often find accommodation in the Field Ward. Because neither are official wards of the city, they aren't subject to taxation. Note, however, that because both these areas have yet to be formally accepted as wards of the city, they don't benefit from the securities of Guild Law or the protection of the Watch. If you choose to follow this path, be on your guard. Fools rush in where auditors fear to tread.": "尽管如此，许多精明的游客如果有一个月或一个季度的生意，就会利用Undercliff的旅店来招待他们，Undercliff是城市东部的宜人农地。不太富裕的人通常会在菲尔德区找到住宿。因为这两个地方都不是城市的正式行政区，所以它们不需要纳税。然而，请注意，由于这两个地区还没有被正式接受为城市的行政区，他们不能享受到公会法的保障或守望的保护。如果你选择走这条路，就要提高警惕。傻瓜们会冲进审计师害怕踩踏的地方。",
	"Regardless of what size party you arrive with or by what means, if you arrive by night or in winter, expect to register. In winter and at night the gates are shut. Ships aren't expected at night or as a regular occurrence after the first frost of the coming season, and are often met at docking by a magister—or by a contingent of the Guard who will hold travelers aboard until a magister can be summoned.": "无论你和什么规模的团队一起到达，或通过什么方式到达，如果你在夜间或冬季到达，预计要登记。在冬季和夜间，大门是关闭的。船只在夜间或在即将到来的季节的第一场霜冻后不会定期出现，而且在停靠时通常会有魔法师接应--或者由警卫队的特遣队接应，他们会在召唤魔法师之前将旅行者留在船上。",
	"None of these rules apply to the city's least used gate, the West Gate. This smaller gate opens onto the Mud Flats—a mucky beach used by clam diggers, shore fishers, and those brave enough to bathe in the cold waves. Those who make a living through fishing with nets or traps also use this gate, keeping their small boats on the beach to avoid docking fees. Locals register with the Guard as they exit and as they enter. No magister is stationed at the gate, but no new arrivals to Waterdeep are accepted here.": "这些规则都不适用于这个城市最不常用的大门--西门。这个较小的门通向泥滩--挖蛤蜊的人、岸上钓鱼的人和那些敢于在寒冷的海浪中洗澡的人所使用的淤泥海滩。那些用渔网或陷阱捕鱼为生的人也使用这个门，把他们的小船放在海滩上，以避免停靠费。当地人在离开和进入时都要向警卫队登记。门口没有魔法师驻守，但这里不接受新来的水底世界的人。",
	"If you approach by air, expect a vigorous pursuit by and confrontation with the Griffon Cavalry. Only specially licensed individuals and mounts can fly over Waterdeep. It is best to land well outside the city and approach on foot.": "如果你从空中接近，预计会受到狮鹫骑兵的猛烈追击和对抗。只有获得特别许可的个人和坐骑才能在沃特迪普上空飞行。最好是在城外降落，然后步行接近。",
	"The splendors that await you in Waterdeep are legendary. Each of the city's wards is detailed in this work, telling you what to expect depending on where you are, as well as what thrilling things you might see and do. Before that, however, there are the small matters of knowing something of the history of the place you visit, and of understanding how to comport yourself in the Sword Coast's grandest metropolis.": "在沃特德普，等待你的是传奇般的辉煌。这部作品详细介绍了城市的每一个区，告诉你根据你所处的位置会发生什么，以及你可能会看到和做什么令人激动的事情。然而，在这之前，还有一些小事要做，那就是了解你所访问的地方的一些历史，以及了解如何在剑海岸最宏伟的大都市中表现自己。",
	"There shall come a time when our city and its deepwater bay shall grow in fame and fortune across many realms and many worlds. Folk shall know of Waterdeep, our City of Splendors, and sing its praises. I have seen it thus, and I endeavor to make it true.": "总有一天，我们的城市和它的深水湾会在许多领域和许多世界中名利双收。人们将知道沃特迪普，我们的辉煌之城，并对其大加赞赏。我已经看到了这一点，我努力让它成为现实。",
	"People have inhabited the plateau upon which Waterdeep stands for longer than human histories record. But as is the way across the dangerous North, civilization at the foot of Mount Waterdeep has crested and ebbed in great waves. Elf scholars assure me that it was once the site of Aelinthaldaar, the capital of their ancient empire of Illefarn. So it was already a glorious place when a dwarf prospector named Melair discovered mithral beneath the mountain. In agreement with the Illefarni, Melair called kith and kin to mine under the mountain and in the plateau, and thus Clan Melairkyn came to rule below as the Illefarni did above.": "在沃特德普所处的高原上，人们居住的时间比人类历史记录的时间还要长。但就像危险的北方一样，沃特德普山脚下的文明在大浪淘沙中起起伏伏。精灵学者向我保证，这里曾经是艾林塔尔达的所在地，是他们古老的伊勒法恩帝国的首都。因此，当一个名叫Melair的矮人探矿者在山下发现了米塔尔的时候，这里已经是一个辉煌的地方。在与伊勒法恩人达成协议后，梅莱尔召集亲属在山下和高原上采矿，于是梅莱尔金氏族就像伊勒法恩人在山上一样统治了山下。",
	"But this fruitful alliance lasted less than the lifetime of a dwarf, for the emperor of the elves—what they call a \"coronal\"—commanded that all leave in the Retreat, that great exodus of elves from Faerûn to their mystical isle of Evermeet. Not all elves agreed with this edict, and many were determined to stay. Well, what emperor has ever willingly allowed another to sit in his throne? The coronal had all of Aelinthaldaar razed by magic, and the remaining elves splintered into separate kingdoms. The Melairkyn, of course, saw this as a breaking of their bargain, and never again did they deal with elves. Instead, they tunneled ever deeper under the mountain, never to be heard from again.": "但这种富有成效的联盟持续了不到一个矮人的一生，因为精灵的皇帝--他们称之为 \"冕下\"--命令所有的人在撤退中离开，那是精灵们从法鲁恩到他们的神秘岛屿Evermeet的大迁徙。并非所有的精灵都同意这一命令，许多人决心留下来。好吧，哪个皇帝曾心甘情愿地让另一个人坐在他的宝座上？冠冕堂皇地用魔法夷平了Aelinthaldaar的所有地方，剩下的精灵们分成了不同的王国。当然，Melairkyn认为这是对他们交易的破坏，他们再也没有和精灵打过交道。相反，他们在山下的隧道里越挖越深，再也没有人听到他们的消息。",
	"So it was that the humans who came to the deepwater harbor found it empty and suitable for their own purposes. For more than a thousand years, folk lived and traded at the site of what would become Waterdeep, but their identities remain a mystery—with a curious exception. We know that at some point during this period, the wizard Halaster Blackcloak built his tower at the base of Mount Waterdeep and came to rule the lands around—until he, like the Melairkyn, vanished under the mountain.": "因此，来到深水港的人类发现它是空的，适合他们自己的目的。一千多年来，人们在后来成为沃特德普的地方生活和交易，但他们的身份仍然是个谜--只有一个奇怪的例外。我们知道，在这一时期的某个时刻，巫师哈拉斯特-布莱克拉克（Halaster Blackcloak）在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔楼，并开始统治周围的土地，直到他和梅莱尔金人一样，消失在山下。",
	"Various warlords later claimed the plateau's harbor as their own, but it was one known as Nimoar who is best remembered. A History of Waterdeep: Age One, The Rise of the Warlord records how Nimoar raised a wooden stockade to protect the settlement around the harbor, claiming rule over the town that by then was being called \"Nimoar's Hold, the Town of Waters Deep.\" War between orcs and elves in lands farther north drove hordes of trolls south to claw at the fledgling city, and amid this danger, Nimoar died of old age. Many bloody struggles unfolded between local folk and {@creature troll||trolls}, until the magic of a youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the \"everlasting ones, \"which were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon improved slowly in skill and power with the passage of the years, until he became a great mage. He is said to have discovered a supply of potions of longevity, or learned the art of making such, for he lived on and on, still physically in his prime for decade after decade. {@i A History of Waterdeep: Age Two}, The Lords' Rule Begins records that in the year 1032 DR, Ahghairon (then in his 112th winter) argued with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength of arms to create a northern empire. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. But when Ahghairon magically turned aside all who sought to lay hands on him, Raurlor struck at the mage with his own sword. Ahghairon then rose into the air, just out of reach, and used his magic to transmute Raurlor's blade into a hissing serpent. When the serpent struck Raurlor, he died in full view of his shocked followers.": "后来，各种军阀都声称高原的港口是他们自己的，但最让人记住的是一个被称为尼莫尔的人。沃特德普的历史。第一纪元，军阀的崛起》记录了尼莫尔是如何在港口周围筑起木栅栏来保护定居点的，并声称要统治这个当时被称为 \"尼莫尔之地，水深镇 \"的城镇。兽人和精灵在更北边的土地上的战争，驱使成群的巨魔南下抓捕这个新生的城市，在这种危险中，尼莫尔老死。许多血腥的斗争在当地人和{@creature troll||trolls}之间展开，直到一个名叫阿格海龙的青年的魔法扭转了战争的命运，使 \"永恒的人 \"被摧毁或被驱散。随着岁月的流逝，Ahghairon的技能和力量慢慢提高，直到他成为一个伟大的法师。据说他发现了长寿药水的供应，或者学会了制造长寿药水的技术，因为他一直活到现在，十年来身体仍然处于壮年。{@i A History of Waterdeep: Age Two}，《领主的统治》记载，在公元1032年，阿格海隆（当时是他的第112个冬天）与当时的沃特德普战神劳尔勒争论起来。劳尔勒想利用瓦特德普获得的财富和武器力量建立一个北方帝国。阿加隆在众人面前藐视他，劳尔勒命令将法师拴起来。但当阿格海龙用魔法将所有试图对他下手的人拒之门外时，劳尔勒用自己的剑劈向法师。阿格海龙随后升到空中，就在他够不着的地方，用他的魔法将劳尔勒的剑变成了一条嘶嘶作响的大蛇。当大蛇击中劳尔勒时，他在他震惊的追随者的注视下死去。",
	"Ahghairon then gathered the leaders of Waterdeep's armies and powerful families. While runners sought to bring them to the castle, flames roared and crackled in the empty warlord's throne at Ahghairon's bidding, so that none could sit there. Then, when the gathered host of worthies met in the audience chamber, the wizard seated himself on the flaming throne. Immediately the fires died away, leaving both the throne and Ahghairon unharmed.": "阿加隆随后召集了瓦特德普的军队和强大家族的领导人。当跑者试图把他们带到城堡时，火焰在阿格海龙的命令下在空荡荡的军阀宝座上咆哮和噼啪作响，因此没有人能够坐在那里。然后，当聚集在一起的贵族们在觐见厅开会时，巫师坐在了燃烧的宝座上。大火立即熄灭，王座和阿格哈隆都没有受到伤害。",
	"From this seat-the very one on which the Open Lord sits to this day-Ahghairon decreed how the city would be governed. While he would sit as lord openly, a council of other lords of nearly equal power would rule with him. But the identity of those other lords would be hidden even from each other, thus preventing any of them from being approached and influenced by bribe or threat. So it was that Ahghairon established Waterdeep's system of governance.": "在这个座位上--至今开放领主就坐在这个座位上--阿海龙决定了这个城市的管理方式。虽然他将作为领主公开坐镇，但由其他权力几乎相等的领主组成的议会将与他一起统治。但是，这些其他领主的身份将被隐藏起来，甚至相互之间也不知道，从而防止他们中的任何一个被接近并被贿赂或威胁所影响。就这样，阿格海龙建立了瓦特德普的管理制度。",
	"Ahghairon was instrumental in establishing many of Waterdeep's other institutions, such as its black-robed magisters, its Griffon Cavalry, and the city's many guilds. The first Open Lord ruled wisely for over two centuries before the magic sustaining his health failed. He now lies entombed in his tower, which you can still see standing in the courtyard of the Palace of Waterdeep. Beware that you don't approach too close, however, lest you stumble into the invisible barrier-a \"force cage,\" I am told-that surrounds the tower.": "阿加隆在建立沃特德普的许多其他机构方面发挥了作用，比如它的黑袍魔法师，它的狮鹫骑兵，以及城市的许多公会。在维持他健康的魔法失效之前，第一位开放领主明智地统治了两个多世纪。他现在躺在他的塔里，你仍然可以看到他站在水底宫殿的院子里。然而，请注意不要走得太近，以免你绊倒在环绕着塔的无形屏障--据说是 \"力之笼\"。",
	"Within that barrier lie additional protective wards, as demonstrated by the floating bones of the last person who tried to defy them. The name of this poor soul has been lost to time, but the miscreant was likely a wizard who sought to steal the magic treasures that had been entombed with their former owner. Now they hang in the air beyond the invisible force cage in rough semblance of their natural position, occasionally displaced temporarily by strong winds or mischievous children with long sticks.": "在这道屏障中还有额外的保护措施，正如最后一个试图违抗它们的人的漂浮的骨头所显示的那样。这个可怜人的名字已经被时间湮没了，但这个恶棍很可能是一个巫师，他试图偷取与前主人一起被埋葬的魔法宝藏。现在，它们悬挂在无形的力之笼外的空中，与它们的自然位置相差无几，偶尔会被强风或拿着长棍的调皮的孩子们暂时取代。",
	"Ahghairon's wise rule is celebrated on the first day of Eleasis, which has come to be known as Ahghairon's Day. For more about this day, see \"City Celebrations.\"": "阿赫海隆的英明统治在Eleasis的第一天得到庆祝，这一天被称为阿赫海隆日。关于这一天的更多信息，见 \"城市庆典\"。",
	"Many significant events stand out in Waterdeep's history. But none have had so great an effect on daily life than the three apocalyptic periods known as the Time of Troubles, the Spellplague, and the Sundering-the most recent (and hopefully final). On all these occasions, the actions of gods at war with one another led to the loss or the twisting of magic in the world. During the Time of Troubles, Waterdeep stood at the center of events. But the effects of the more recent crises can still be seen in the city today, even though they occurred a great distance from where Waterdeep stands.": "在沃特德普的历史上有许多重大事件。但对日常生活影响最大的莫过于三个世界末日时期，即动乱时期、法术之灾和最近的（希望是最后的）毁灭。在所有这些时期，诸神之间的战争行为导致了世界上魔法的丧失或扭曲。在动乱时期，沃特德普站在事件的中心。但是最近的危机的影响今天仍然可以在这个城市看到，尽管它们发生在离沃特迪普很远的地方。",
	"When the gods walked among mortals during the Time of Troubles, they were cast down to the world by the mysterious Overgod Ao in 1358 DR. Until then, none but the gods had known of Ao's existence, and since then, we have learned little more. As all know, the crisis began with the theft of the Tablets of Fate by the vile and ambitious gods Bane and Myrkul, later joined by Bhaal. These mystic artifacts supposedly determine the extent of the gods' power, and dictate how they use that power. As punishment for this affront, Ao cast down the gods (or the ones that humans worshiped, at any rate) and then demanded that they return the tablets to him.": "当诸神在动乱时期在凡人中行走时，他们在1358年被神秘的超神Ao赶下了世界。在那之前，除了诸神之外，没有人知道敖的存在，从那时起，我们就知道得很少了。众所周知，危机始于卑鄙和野心勃勃的神明班恩和米尔库尔偷窃命运之片，后来又有巴尔加入。这些神秘的神器据说决定了诸神的权力范围，并决定了他们如何使用这种权力。作为对这一冒犯的惩罚，敖将诸神（或人类崇拜的那些神，至少）赶下台，然后要求他们将石板还给他。",
	"But Ao was not omniscient, it seems, nor overly wise. The gods didn't seek out the tablets, and thus it was left to mortal heroes to sort out the mess. They did so, their efforts culminating in Waterdeep. It was on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep that Ao was last seen, when he granted godhood to the human heroes Kelemvor, Midnight (who became Mystra), and Cyric.": "但是，Ao似乎并不是全知全能的，也不是过于睿智的。诸神没有寻找石板，因此留给凡人的英雄们去解决这个麻烦。他们这样做了，他们的努力在沃特德普达到了顶点。人们最后一次见到敖是在沃特德普山的山坡上，当时他将神的身份授予了人类英雄凯勒莫、午夜（后来成为了米斯特拉）和赛里克。",
	"It is no surprise, then, that Waterdeep has since attracted a steady stream of pilgrims who worship Midnight at Mystra's temple and pay homage to Kelemvor in the City of the Dead. It might surprise you, though, to learn that Waterdavians had a short-lived penchant for worshiping Ao. The Cynosure-that great marble-pillared structure on the edge of the Market, now rented out for private and public events-was built as a temple to Ao. But his worship fell from favor when all prayers to him went unanswered, and folk realized they had no idea what he stood for or who he was. You can visit the Cynosure to see sculptures and paintings of all the major participants and events in the Time of Troubles. Entrance is free to the public on any day when no event (such as a meeting of guilds, a noble's coming-of-age ball, or some such) is scheduled.": "因此，沃特德普自此吸引了源源不断的朝圣者，他们在Mystra的神庙里朝拜Midnight，在死亡之城向Kelemvor致敬，这并不奇怪。不过，你可能会惊讶地发现，沃特达威人曾有过短暂的崇拜奥的癖好。Cynosure--位于市场边缘的那个巨大的大理石柱状结构，现在被出租用于私人和公共活动--是作为Ao的神庙而建造的。但是，当所有对他的祈祷都没有得到回应时，他的崇拜就不受欢迎了，人们意识到他们不知道他代表什么或他是谁。你可以参观Cynosure，看看动乱时期的所有主要参与者和事件的雕塑和绘画。在没有活动（如行会会议、贵族的成年舞会或其他类似活动）的任何一天，公众可以免费进入。",
	"In the Year of Blue Fire (1385 DR), the Spellplague gripped the world. None knew it at the time, but it has since been divined that Cyric's long hatred for Mystra boiled over and led to his murder of the goddess of magic. I was absent from the world at this time-indisposed by the force of an {@spell imprisonment} spell. Elminster has since explained the events to me, but I must confess that much of what he said made little sense. It was a long lecture having something to do with stars, \"crystal spheres,\" and \"demiplanar reality mirrors.\" Suffice it to say, parts of our world switched with parts of another one, and magic was again disrupted.": "在蓝火之年（1385 DR），法术瘟疫笼罩了整个世界。当时没有人知道，但后来人们猜测，西里克对神秘拉的长期仇恨沸腾起来，导致他谋杀了这位魔法女神。我当时不在这个世界上，被一个{@spell imprisonment}咒语的力量所驱使。埃尔明斯特后来向我解释了这些事件，但我必须承认，他说的很多东西都没有什么意义。那是一个很长的讲座，与星星、\"水晶球 \"和 \"半平面现实镜 \"有关。我只想说，我们世界的一部分与另一个世界的一部分交换了，魔法再次被打乱。",
	"During this period, the powerful magical fields that protect and affect Waterdeep became unstable. This led to the disastrous activation of most of Waterdeep's amazing walking statues during an earthquake. In the years before, the walking statues were often hidden on the Ethereal Plane, to be called forth only in times of great peril. Many in the city doubted that such massive, sapient constructs were even real, let alone that they guarded the city invisibly. The Spellplague confirmed their existence for all to see, though, and each carved a swath of destruction through Waterdeep before it was stopped. Now the walking statues stand about the city in various states of readiness or disarray-one of the most obvious of Waterdeep's so-called splendors.": "在这一时期，保护和影响瓦特德普的强大魔法场变得不稳定。这导致沃特德普的大部分神奇的步行雕像在地震中被灾难性地激活。在之前的几年里，这些行走的雕像经常被隐藏在虚空界，只有在非常危险的时候才会被召唤出来。城市里的许多人都怀疑这种巨大的、有智慧的建筑是否真实存在，更不用说它们在无形中守护着这座城市。不过，法术瘟疫证实了它们的存在，而且在被阻止之前，每一个都在沃特迪普划出了一条毁灭之路。现在，这些行走的雕像以各种准备或混乱的状态矗立在城市中，这是沃特德普所谓的辉煌中最明显的一个。",
	"After the Spellplague came the Sundering. Elf scholars insist on calling it the Second Sundering, asserting that the creation of Evermeet thousands of years ago was a similar happening. Regardless of the name you give it, the event that unfolded beginning in 1482 DR was the result of another world-called Abeir, I am told-passing again into our own. The gods were once more cast into the mortal realm, this time embodied in mortal beings known as Chosen. The old troublemaker Ao seems to be the cause of it all, though why he chose to cast down the gods was a matter of dispute even among those entities while they were with us.": "咒语瘟疫之后，又发生了毁灭。精灵学者们坚持称其为 \"第二次毁灭\"，并断言几千年前创建的 \"永恒之城 \"也是类似的事件。不管你给它起什么名字，从1482 DR开始的事件是另一个世界--我听说叫Abeir--再次进入我们世界的结果。诸神再次被抛入凡间，这次体现在被称为神选者的凡人身上。老的麻烦制造者敖似乎是这一切的原因，尽管他为什么选择把众神赶下台，甚至在那些实体与我们在一起时也是一个争议问题。",
	"Apparently, all of this was foreseen by Waterdeep's legendary wizard Khelben Arunsun, and it was only through his wisdom and the efforts of Elminster, {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}-now the Open Lord of Waterdeep-and a handful of others that the world was saved. According to Elminster, Ao remade the Tablets of Fate as a result, restoring the divine order and separating Abeir from Toril. But take that as you may. According to that roguish longbeard, he saves the world without anyone noticing every other month or so.": "显然，这一切都被沃特德普的传奇巫师凯尔本-阿伦森预见到了，只有通过他的智慧和埃尔明斯特{@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}--现在是沃特德普的公开领主--以及其他少数人的努力，世界才得以拯救。根据艾尔明斯特的说法，亚奥因此重新制作了命运之片，恢复了神圣的秩序，并将亚伯尔与托里尔分开。但你可以接受这个说法。据那个无赖的长胡子说，他每隔一个月左右就会在没有人注意的情况下拯救世界。",
	"Waterdeep is, by and large, the most civilized city on the Sword Coast. Yet civilized doesn't mean safe, nor does it mean easy to navigate. Many day-to-day elements of life in Waterdeep that residents take for granted are, to new arrivals, a bevy of wonders and dangers not seen in any other settlement within a thousand miles. Here's what you need to know to survive your first few hours in the city. Mark this section for frequent reference!": "总的来说，沃特迪普是剑海岸上最文明的城市。然而，文明并不意味着安全，也不意味着容易驾驭。在沃特德普，许多居民认为理所当然的日常生活元素，对于新来的人来说，都是千里之外的其他定居点所没有的奇迹和危险。以下是你需要知道的，以便在这个城市的最初几个小时里生存下去。在本节中做个标记，以便经常参考。",
	"Waterdeep is no village led by hidebound hierarchs or petty fiefdom ruled by the whim of a warlord. It is a city of laws molded by Tyr's spirit of justice. As a rule, you can trust members of the City Watch to do their duty diligently, and you can expect that the city's magisters will be fair. If you have cause to come before the Masked Lords or the Open Lord herself, rest assured that if your cause be just, justice will be done. If, however, you find yourself in the wrong, know that though it might take time to weigh that wrong on Tyr's scales, his hammer will fall—and it will be wielded by Waterdeep with a vengeance.": "沃特德普不是一个被束缚的等级制度所领导的村庄，也不是一个被军阀的一时兴起所统治的小领地。它是一座由泰尔的正义精神所塑造的法律之城。通常情况下，你可以相信城市守望的成员会尽职尽责，你也可以期待城市的魔法师们能做到公平。如果你有理由来到假面领主或公开领主面前，请放心，如果你的理由是公正的，正义会得到伸张。然而，如果你发现自己有错，你要知道，尽管在泰尔的天平上衡量这个错误可能需要时间，但他的锤子会落下，而且会被水底世界挥舞着复仇。",
	"Unlike in less civilized settlements, punishment for crimes in Waterdeep isn't typically used as public entertainment. Scheduled executions occur behind the high walls of Castle Waterdeep, and floggings are carried out in the watch post nearest the sentencing. The Watch makes every effort to take individuals into custody quietly, so as not to disrupt other citizens. Those bystanders generally return the favor by giving altercations between criminals and the Watch a wide berth.": "与文明程度较低的定居点不同，在沃特德普，对犯罪的惩罚通常不作为公共娱乐。预定的处决发生在沃特德普城堡的高墙后面，而鞭打则是在离判刑地点最近的哨所进行的。守望者会尽一切努力悄悄地把人拘押起来，以免影响其他公民。旁观者一般都会投桃报李，对罪犯和守夜人之间的争吵给予宽恕。",
	"Waterdeep has a complex library of law and custom set by precedent, the main body of which can be read in the Code Legal. This document is available in multiple languages at the Palace of Waterdeep, and (in the Common tongue) provided on request by the magisters at the gates and in the harbor. Be aware that the Code Legal provides only an outline of typical sentences for various offenses, and magisters have broad discretion when meting out justice as they see fit. Any Masked Lord can overturn a magister's ruling, but there's rarely a Masked Lord around when you need one.": "沃特德普有一个复杂的法律和习惯的先例库，其主要内容可以在《法典》中阅读。这份文件在沃特德普的宫殿里有多种语言的版本，并且（普通话）在门口和港口的魔法师们的要求下提供。请注意，法典只是提供了各种罪行的典型判决大纲，而魔法师们在执行他们认为合适的司法时有广泛的自由裁量权。任何蒙面人都可以推翻治安官的裁决，但当你需要时，很少有蒙面人在身边。",
	"Individuals accustomed to the rough-and-tumble life in much of the North are often surprised by the fact that Waterdavians go about unarmed and unarmored. Yet Waterdeep doesn't have any law that forbids carrying weapons or armor. Instead, it has a culture of civility that makes such behavior unnecessary.": "习惯了北方大部分地区粗暴生活的人，往往会对沃特代普人不带武器、不穿盔甲的行为感到惊讶。然而沃特德普并没有任何法律禁止携带武器或盔甲。相反，它有一种文明的文化，使得这种行为没有必要。",
	"Dueling has long been illegal in Waterdeep, as has any sort of act involving assault. Individuals caught brawling by the Watch will all be arrested and judged regardless of who started the fracas, or why. (The tavern brawls that typically break out under the influence of too much drink will often be overlooked by the Watch, as long as the proprietor doesn't seek payment for damages and no one is significantly injured.) Sport fighting, such as boxing or wrestling, is legal only if it occurs in a location registered with the city for that purpose. Additionally, any blade more than one foot in length is subject to an extra tax whenever it is sold, which helps to explain why Waterdavians prefer to carry knives and knuckledusters for self-defense.": "决斗在沃特迪普长期以来都是非法的，任何涉及攻击的行为也是如此。被守夜人抓到的斗殴者都会被逮捕和审判，不管是谁挑起的争吵，也不管为什么。(酒馆里的争吵通常是在喝多了酒的影响下发生的，只要老板不要求赔偿损失，也没有人受到严重伤害，就会被观察团忽略。） 体育搏斗，如拳击或摔跤，只有在向城市注册的地点进行才是合法的。此外，任何长度超过一英尺的刀片在出售时都要缴纳额外的税，这有助于解释为什么Waterdavians喜欢携带刀具和指套进行自卫。",
	"Businesses and individuals do employ armed guards, but except for nobles or foreign envoys, few people travel about the city with such protection. As such, the sight of armed and armored individuals walking the streets who aren't in the livery of the city or one of its noble houses inspires caution in most Waterdavians. Folk assume that you wouldn't bother lugging around such equipment unless you either intend violence or expect that it might soon be visited upon you.": "企业和个人确实雇佣了武装警卫，但除了贵族或外国使节，很少有人在城市中旅行时有这样的保护。因此，看到那些没有穿戴城市或贵族服饰的武装和装甲人员在街上行走，大多数沃特达维亚人都会小心谨慎。民间认为，除非你打算使用暴力，或者预期暴力会很快降临到你身上，否则你不会费力地拖着这种装备。",
	"The first soldiers you see in service to the city will be the members of the City Guard who patrol the roads leading to Waterdeep, watch the walls, guard civic structures, and protect magisters. Waterdeep's streets, however, are policed by an altogether different force: the City Watch. The similarity of their names often confuses newcomers, so I offer this handy mnemonic: \"The Guard guards the walls while the Watch watches all.\"": "你最先看到的为城市服务的士兵是城市卫队的成员，他们在通往沃特德普的道路上巡逻，看守城墙，守卫市政建筑，保护魔法师。然而，沃特德普的街道则由一支完全不同的力量来维持治安：城市守卫。他们名字的相似性常常使新来的人感到困惑，所以我提供了这个方便的记忆法：\"卫队守卫着城墙，而守望则监视着一切。\"",
	"You can recognize any member of the City Watch by the uniform: a green-and-goldenrod doublet and a tall steel helmet. Each typically carries a long truncheon, a dagger, and a buckler. Because most citizens in Waterdeep don't bear weapons, these tools prove a more than ample deterrent to criminal activity. Members of the Watch typically don't carry crossbows or other weapons to attack at range, but running from the Watch—though it may be a time-honored tradition for local miscreants—rarely works out for newcomers to the city. I guarantee that all members of the Watch know the streets they patrol and that area's residents better than you do, even if you stay in Waterdeep for ten seasons.": "你可以从制服上认出任何城市守望的成员：绿色和金黄色的连衣裙和一个高大的钢盔。每个人通常都带着一把长棍、一把匕首和一个扣环。由于沃特德普的大多数市民都不携带武器，这些工具对犯罪活动的威慑力是非常充分的。守望先锋的成员通常不携带弓箭或其他武器进行远程攻击，但逃避守望先锋--尽管这可能是当地不法分子的一个历史悠久的传统--对于初来乍到的人来说很少奏效。我保证，所有的守望者成员都比你更了解他们巡逻的街道和该地区的居民，即使你在沃特德普呆了十个季度。",
	"The City Watch has watch posts throughout the city. These stations are often off the main thoroughfares, tucked away in small courtyards or at cross streets. A watch post can be recognized by the green-and-gold lantern outside it, lit even during the day with a {@spell continual flame} spell. A watch post serves as an organizational headquarters and armory. Anyone who wishes to report a crime may do so at a watch post in the event a Watch constable can't be found elsewhere. A watch post typically contains a few holding cells where people arrested for crimes can be detained until they're marched to a courthouse jail before standing trial.": "城市守望者在整个城市都设有监视站。这些哨所通常远离主干道，隐藏在小院子里或十字路口。观察站可以通过它外面的金绿色灯笼来识别，即使在白天也可以用{@spell continual flame}的咒语来照明。观察站是一个组织总部和武器库。在其他地方找不到守望者的情况下，任何想报案的人都可以在守望所报案。观察站通常包含几个拘留室，因犯罪而被捕的人可以被拘留，直到他们被押送到法院的监狱，然后接受审判。",
	"Small squads head out from the watch posts on daily and nightly rounds of the city streets, or on special assignments involving protection or investigation. A mere pair of Watch operatives might discreetly patrol in the Castle Ward; in contrast, squads of eight walk the Dock Ward, increasing to as many as a dozen at night. If Watch members spot trouble they can't handle, they blow shrill tin whistles to summon more of their members-an act that alerts nearby citizens as well.": "小分队从哨所出发，每天和每晚在城市街道上巡视，或执行涉及保护或调查的特殊任务。仅仅一对守望者可能会在城堡区谨慎地巡逻；相比之下，八人小队在码头区巡逻，晚上会增加到十几个。如果守夜人发现了他们无法处理的麻烦，他们会吹响尖锐的锡哨，召唤更多的成员--这一行为也会提醒附近的市民。",
	"City Watch members follow a strict code of conduct that makes them one of the most trusted police forces aside from paladin-patrolled Elturgard. As long as you don't engage in unlawful behavior, you can expect to be left untroubled by the Watch.": "城市守望的成员遵循严格的行为准则，使他们成为除圣骑士巡逻的埃尔图加德之外最值得信赖的警察部队之一。只要你不从事非法行为，你就可以期望不受守望的困扰。",
	"Members of the City Watch employ a sort of slang in dealing with the public. As a visitor, it behooves you to know what they mean.": "城市守望的成员在与公众打交道时使用一种俚语。作为一名访客，你有必要了解他们的意思。",
	"\"What befalls?\" means \"Someone tell me what's going on here.\"": "\"发生了什么？\"意思是 \"谁来告诉我这里发生了什么\"。",
	"\"Hold!\" means \"Don't move a muscle.\"": "\"别动！\"意思是 \"一动不动\"。",
	"\"Down arms!\" means \"Drop your weapons.\"": "\"放下武器！\"意思是 \"放下你的武器\"。",
	"\"Talk truth!\" means \"Answer me\" or \"Tell the whole story.\"": "\"说真话！\"意思是 \"回答我 \"或 \"说出整个故事\"。",
	"\"Robes\" references the black robes-in other words, one of the magisters. \"Do we need robes here?\" or something similar should be taken as a threat.": "\"长袍 \"指的是黑袍--换句话说，就是魔法师之一。\"我们这里需要长袍吗？\"或类似的话应被视为一种威胁。",
	"Expect to be questioned at the gate, or when you register with a magister, regarding your ability to cast arcane magic. Wizards, sorcerers, and other arcane spellcasters who intend to stay in Waterdeep for any length of time are required to register with the city, and will be strongly encouraged to join the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, headed by the Blackstaff.": "在门口，或者在你向魔法师登记时，你会被询问你施展奥术魔法的能力。巫师、魔法师和其他打算在沃特迪普停留任何时间的奥术施法者都需要向城市注册，并被强烈鼓励加入以黑杖为首的魔法师和保护者守望团。",
	"Members of the Watchful Order are expected to render service to the city when called upon, acting as temporary members of the City Watch or City Guard. Their expertise often helps investigators determine whether magic was used to commit a crime in the city. Members can also expect to be tapped for assistance during and after fires, natural events that cause multiple casualties, or other nonmagical disasters.": "守望会的成员应邀为城市提供服务，充当城市守望或城市卫队的临时成员。他们的专业知识经常帮助调查人员确定魔法是否被用来在城市中犯罪。在火灾、造成多人伤亡的自然事件或其他非魔法灾难发生时和发生后，成员们也会被要求提供援助。",
	"Members of the Watchful Order form a more or less sociable association in the city, working together to keep an eye on any spellcasters who opt not to join their guild. Any havoc caused by a spellcaster in Waterdeep risks drawing the wrath of the Lords of Waterdeep-so it behooves the Watchful Order to watch all its members.": "警戒团的成员在城市中形成了一个或多或少的社交协会，共同监视那些选择不加入他们公会的施法者。任何由施法者在沃特德普造成的破坏都有可能引起沃特德普领主的愤怒--所以守望者协会有必要监视其所有成员。",
	"As should be expected of any city of standing, Waterdeep mints its own coins. All taxes, fines, and guild fees must be paid either in Waterdavian coin or the currency of any member settlement of the Lords' Alliance. Though no law requires you to pay for goods or services in Waterdavian coin, the drudgery of weighing foreign currency and checking its purity prompts many retailers and operators of swift-exchange businesses-including drays and hire-coaches-not to accept anything but coins minted in Waterdeep.": "正如任何一个有地位的城市所期望的那样，瓦特德普铸造了自己的硬币。所有的税收、罚款和公会费用都必须用沃特达维亚的硬币或领主联盟任何成员定居点的货币支付。虽然没有法律要求你用沃特代夫的硬币来支付商品或服务，但称量外国货币和检查其纯度的繁琐工作促使许多零售商和交换业务的经营者--包括马车和出租马车--不接受任何东西，只接受在沃特代夫铸造的硬币。",
	"Though you can trade your coinage for Waterdeep currency with anyone willing to do so, the exchequers at the Palace of Waterdeep make exchanges with no associated fee. The queue there can be quite long, necessitating that you make an appointment-often a day or more in advance. For a swifter transaction, I recommend any member of the Guild of Trusted Pewterers and Casters, or of the Jewelers' Guild. Both have the most reliable scales and abide by guild-wide rates of exchange.": "虽然你可以用你的钱币与任何愿意这样做的人交换水底世界的货币，但水底宫殿的赋税所可以进行交换，而且没有相关费用。那里的排队时间可能很长，需要你提前预约--通常是提前一天或更长时间。要想更快地完成交易，我推荐可信的铸币师和铸造师公会的任何成员，或者珠宝商公会的成员。两者都有最可靠的秤，并遵守全行会的汇率。",
	"Be sure to exchange taols and harbor moons before leaving the city, as their value greatly diminishes elsewhere!": "在离开城市之前，请务必兑换陶器和港月，因为它们在其他地方的价值会大大降低",
	"Here are images of the city's coins, which aren't to scale.": "以下是该市硬币的图片，并非按比例绘制。",
	"Copper coin about the size of a thumbnail (1 nib = 1 common copper coin)": "大约拇指甲大小的铜币（1个笔尖=1个普通铜币）。",
	"Silver coin, slightly smaller than the nib (1 shard = 10 nibs)": "银币，比笔尖略小（1个碎片=10个笔尖）。",
	"Brass coin, about two inches square with a hole large enough for a nib to fit in (1 taol = 200 nibs)": "黄铜币，大约两英寸见方，有一个足以容纳笔尖的孔（1两=200笔尖）。",
	"Gold coin, half again as large as a nib (1 dragon = 100 nibs)": "金币，又有笔尖那么大的一半（1龙=100笔尖）",
	"Platinum coin, twice as large as a nib (1 sun = 1,000 nibs)": "铂金币，是笔尖的两倍（1个太阳=1,000个笔尖）。",
	"Platinum crescent inset with electrum, about three inches long with a hole large enough for a nib to fit in (1 harbor moon = 5,000 nibs)": "铂金月牙嵌有电子石，约三英寸长，有一个足以容纳笔尖的孔（1个港月=5,000笔尖）。",
	"As established in the first year of the reign of the previous Open Lord, Dagult Neverember, Waterdeep collects a monthly tax from all who live within its official wards. The tax is 1 shard per person above the age of ten years, and is collected door-to-door by patrols of the City Guard on the last day of each month.": "沃特德普在上一任城主Dagult Neverember统治的第一年，就向所有居住在其官方辖区内的人征收每月的税。税金为10岁以上的人每人1沙德，由城市卫队的巡逻队在每月的最后一天挨家挨户收取。",
	"Individuals who so desire can pay a single dragon in tax and receive a writ exempting them for twelve months, but the writ must be produced every month when the Guard calls, or a new payment is required. If the Guard knocks at a door and receives no answer, a notice of lien with an estimation of tax is affixed to the door. The debt must be dealt with before the next month ends, with payment to be made to any magister.": "有此愿望的个人可以支付一条龙的税款，并收到一份免除他们12个月的令状，但每个月当卫兵打电话时必须出示令状，否则需要重新支付。如果卫兵敲门而没有得到回应，门上就会贴上一张留置通知书，上面有估计的税额。债务必须在下个月结束前解决，并向任何地方官支付。",
	"Those who have no fixed residence can still be taxed if they are confronted in any building, be it an inn or an outhouse. So if you're out and around on the last day of the month, you'll no doubt experience \"taxing traffic\" as the streets become clogged with people trying to avoid the collectors.": "那些没有固定住所的人，如果他们在任何建筑物中面对面，无论是客栈还是外屋，仍然可以被征税。因此，如果你在这个月的最后一天外出游玩，你无疑会经历 \"征税交通\"，因为街道被试图避开征税人的人堵住了。",
	"Waterdeep also raises revenue by charging other fees, such as the following: {@b 1 nib} per day for rental of a stall in the Market {@b 1 shard} (above and beyond any fines imposed) from anyone convicted by a magister, per conviction {@b 1 dragon} per conveyance leaving the city, empty or full {@b 5 dragons} per ship that touches dock in Waterdeep (except for city ships and diplomatic vessels), collected from the captain and covering a stay of up to fourteen days (a ship that leaves the harbor and returns during that time pays the tax upon reentry)": "沃特德普还通过收取其他费用来增加收入，如以下。(在市场上租用摊位，每天要交纳（%0%）的费用（高于任何罚款），任何被法官定罪的人，每次定罪都要交纳（%2%），每艘离开城市的船只，不管是空船还是满船，都要交纳（%3%），向船长收取，最多可停留14天（离开港口的船只在这段时间内返回，重新进入时要交纳税款）。",
	"In times of trouble, direct taxes can also be imposed: {@b A fire tax} (usually 1 dragon per household), levied whenever a fire destroys a large portion of the city {@b A wall tax} or harbor tax (usually 1 dragon per household) raised to directly pay for needed repairs or expansions {@b A lance tax} raised to provide a payroll for mercenaries hired by the city when required (usually 1 shard per household each tenday until the Lords repeal the tax)": "在困难时期，也可以征收直接税：{@b A fire tax}(通常每户1条龙)，每当火灾摧毁城市的大部分时就征收{@b A wall tax}或港口税(通常每户1条龙)，以直接支付所需的维修或扩张{@b A lance tax}，在需要时为城市雇用的雇佣兵提供工资(通常每户1个沙德，直到领主废除该税)。",
	"Perambulating is the superior manner of experiencing the city and all its splendors. But if you've come with your own conveyance, the weather is inclement, or some other reason drives you to use the roads, the following are facts you need to know.": "漫步是体验这个城市和它所有辉煌的优越方式。但是，如果你带着自己的交通工具来，天气恶劣，或者有其他原因促使你使用道路，以下是你需要知道的事实。",
	"Waterdeep is a city of broad boulevards that thrum with traffic. All day and well into the night, a bewildering melee of wagons, {@item cart|PHB|carts}, horse and pony riders, {@item carriage|PHB|carriages}, buggies, hire-coaches, and Waterdeep's signature towering drays (further discussed below) surges through its major thoroughfares. Fortunately, most roads are flanked by paved sidewalks that give pedestrians plenty of space, and most of the widest roads have raised dividers that allow an individual crossing a street a safe space to step out of the fray and wait for traffic to pass.": "沃特迪普是一个宽阔的林荫大道的城市，车水马龙。从白天到夜晚，马车、（%0%）、骑马人、（%1%）、马车、出租马车以及沃特德普特有的高耸的卡车（下文将进一步讨论）在主要干道上涌动，令人困惑。幸运的是，大多数道路的两侧都有铺好的人行道，给行人足够的空间，而且大多数最宽的道路都有凸起的隔离带，让过马路的人有一个安全的空间走出战场，等待车辆通过。",
	"The city's centuries-old layout dictates its traffic patterns today. Waterdeep lies on a plateau adjacent to a long mountain that shields much of it from the sea. In the southern third of the city, where the land slopes up from the harbor, the High Road and the Way of the Dragon are the two main south-north roads. These converge both at the Waymoot near the southern gate, and in the heart of the Trades Ward where the city is at its narrowest-bounded by Castle Waterdeep, high on a spur of the mountain, and the walls of the City of the Dead. The conjoined boulevard then splits to the north, continuing as the High Road, and to the west as a boulevard called Waterdeep Way, heading toward the Palace of Waterdeep (not to be confused with Waterdeep Castle, which it passes hard by). In the middle of the city, six boulevards run north from Waterdeep Way, where they meet the road that encircles the Market. On the other side of the Market, five boulevards continue north.": "这个城市几个世纪以来的布局决定了今天的交通模式。沃特迪普位于一个高原上，毗邻一座长山，将大部分地区挡在了海上。在城市的南部，土地从港口开始倾斜，高路和龙之路是两条主要的南-北道路。这两条路在南门附近的Waymoot汇合，并在贸易区的中心地带汇合，那里是城市最狭窄的地方，由高高在上的山脊上的沃特迪普城堡和死亡之城的城墙所包围。这条连在一起的大道随后向北分开，继续作为高路，向西则是一条名为沃特德普路的大道，向沃特德普宫（不要与沃特德普城堡混淆，它与沃特德普城堡擦肩而过）前进。在城市的中央，有六条林荫道从沃特德普路向北延伸，在那里与环绕市场的道路相接。在市场的另一边，有五条林荫大道继续向北。",
	"The aforementioned boulevards, along with the Street of the Singing Dolphin in the Sea Ward, are the major arteries of the city. Hire-coaches and drays can be most frequently found on those streets, and traffic is at its most hectic there. Most other roads in the city run east to west, but regardless of their direction, traffic elsewhere is generally less hectic and thus safer to cross.": "上述林荫大道以及海区的海豚之歌街是城市的主要干道。在这些街道上可以最频繁地发现出租汽车和卡车，那里的交通也是最繁忙的。城市中的大多数其他道路都是由东向西行驶的，但无论其方向如何，其他地方的交通通常不那么繁忙，因此过马路也比较安全。",
	"Thanks to the Scriveners', Scribes', and Clerks' Guild, Waterdeep has a remarkable custom of labeling its streets, and even many of its alleyways and courts. The method of identification varies by ward and neighborhood (including brass plates, carvings in stone, and stencil-painted wooden signs), but street names are typically displayed on the corners of buildings at intersections, roughly a dozen feet above ground. The name of the road you travel on will be on the wall nearest, while the name of the crossing road will be around the corner. Simply ingenious!": "由于文士、抄写员和书记员公会的存在，沃特德普有一个显著的习惯，那就是给街道，甚至许多小巷和庭院贴上标签。识别方法因病区和街区而异（包括铜板、石刻和钢印木牌），但街道名称通常显示在十字路口的建筑物拐角处，大约离地十几英尺。你所走的路的名字会在离你最近的墙上，而穿过的路的名字则会在拐角处。简直是巧夺天工!",
	"Proud Mount Waterdeep provides a useful landmark for general orientation. It stands stark across the skyline to the west, its far slopes dropping right into the sea. A spur of the mountain juts inland, and atop the easternmost point of this spur stands Castle Waterdeep. If you can see these landmarks, it's relatively easy to orient yourself. The mountain peak looms over the southern third of the city near the port in the south. The City of the Dead lies opposite the northern ridge of Mount Waterdeep, which descends down to the Field of Triumph, the city's great coliseum.": "骄傲的沃特德普山为一般方向提供了一个有用的地标。它在西边的天际线上矗立着，其远处的山坡直接落入大海。这座山的一个支脉向内陆延伸，在这个支脉的最东端，矗立着沃特德普城堡。如果你能看到这些地标，就会比较容易确定自己的方向。山峰俯瞰着城市南部三分之一的地方，靠近南部的港口。亡灵之城位于沃特德普山北侧的山脊对面，山脊向下延伸至凯旋场，即城市的大竞技场。",
	"One of Waterdeep's titanic walking statues, no longer mobile, offers another way to orient yourself on a local scale. At nine stories tall, twice the height of any buildings nearby, the Honorable Knight stands guard in a block of buildings between Snail Street and the Way of the Dragon. Positioned as it is nigh the place where four wards meet, you can use it to judge where you stand. If it is south and west of your position, you are in the Trades Ward. North and west? The Southern Ward. South and east? The Castle Ward. North and east? You're in the Dock Ward.": "沃特德普的一个巨大的步行雕像，不再移动，提供了另一种在当地范围内定位的方法。尊敬的骑士有九层楼高，是附近任何建筑的两倍，它站在蜗牛街和龙之路之间的建筑区里守卫。由于它的位置靠近四个区的交界处，你可以用它来判断你所处的位置。如果它在你位置的南面和西面，你就在贸易区。北面和西面？南方区。南部和东部？城堡区。北面和东面？你是在码头区。",
	"During particularly heavy traffic and at congested areas such as the great oval road around the Market, you might see a member of the City Watch serving as a traffic warden. Traffic wardens signal with small blue hand flags for traffic to proceed, and with yellow flags for traffic to hold. A traffic warden can often be heard blowing a whistle. When you hear it, look to the warden to see if you are being signaled. Failure to take care might result not only in accident but also arrest.": "在交通特别繁忙和拥挤的地方，如市场周围的大椭圆形道路，你可能会看到城市观察的成员担任交通管理员。交通协管员用蓝色小手旗示意交通继续前进，用黄旗示意交通暂停。经常可以听到交通协管员吹响哨子。当你听到哨声时，请看向交通管理员，看你是否得到了信号。如果不注意，不仅可能导致事故，还可能被逮捕。",
	"Natives of the City of Splendors are notoriously slow to take offense. A Waterdavian plainly states their feelings as a warning, so that one is apt to hear \"I don't find that amusing, friend,\" said pleasantly before real anger is shown. Some visitors misinterpret such behavior as cowardice or ignorance (\"He was too stupid to realize I insulted him!\"). For those who act on such misjudgments, however, surprise and regret are the usual results.": "辉煌之城的居民是出了名的慢热。一个Waterdavian人明确表示他们的感受是一种警告，所以人们很容易听到 \"我不觉得这很有趣，朋友\"，在真正的愤怒表现出来之前，愉快地说道。一些游客将这种行为误解为懦弱或无知（\"他太愚蠢了，没有意识到我侮辱了他！\"）。然而，对于那些根据这种错误判断行事的人来说，惊讶和后悔是通常的结果。",
	"Most Waterdavians are also slow to take fright unless facing magic or monsters. A swaggering warrior threatening them is quite likely to be stared at calmly, or even sneered at. \"The only mortals that Waterdavians fear are a few unstable wizards and the Lords,\" {@creature Durnan|WDH} often says to those who are surprised by the nonchalance of the Yawning Portal's regulars concerning the open entrance to Undermountain in their midst. \"And only when they've incurred the wrath of said persons themselves.\"": "除非面对魔法或怪兽，大多数Waterdavians也很难受到惊吓。一个大摇大摆的战士威胁他们，很可能会被平静地盯着，甚至是嗤之以鼻。\"沃特达维亚人唯一害怕的凡人是一些不稳定的巫师和领主，\"{@creature Durnan|WDH}经常对那些惊讶于打哈欠门的常客对他们中间的地下山的开放入口不以为然的人说。\"而且只有在他们自己招致上述人员的愤怒时才会这样。\"",
	"These towering vehicles are, I believe, unique to Waterdeep. Invented by exiles from Lantan in the last century, a dray is a long, glassed-in carriage with bench seating that provides additional open-air bench seating on its roof. The driver sits at the level of the roof seating, providing a vantage point to see over other traffic and make eye contact with other dray drivers. You can enter this contraption through the back whenever it stops or slows down enough to make mounting the rear step safe.": "这些高大的车辆，我相信是水底世界独有的。上个世纪，流亡者从兰坦岛发明了这种车，它是一种长条形的玻璃马车，有长椅，在车顶上还有露天长椅。司机坐在车顶的座位上，提供了一个有利的位置，可以看到其他的交通，并与其他车夫进行眼神交流。只要它停下来或慢下来，使安装后部台阶变得安全，你就可以从后面进入这个装置。",
	"A fare taker stands at the back of the lower seating area to take your coin (typically 2 to 4 nibs). You can choose to ride inside or ascend the spiral stairway at the rear to ride atop the vehicle. Most drays run on the main north-south boulevards, but some circle the Market, and a few run along the smaller east-west roads in rough areas. Be warned that when the demand for drays is high-during rain or snow, or to get to or from an event at the Field of Triumph-conditions become crowded and perfect for pickpockets.": "一个售票员站在下层座位区的后面，收取你的硬币（通常是2至4个尼布）。你可以选择在车内乘车，或登上车尾的螺旋形楼梯，在车顶乘车。大多数车在南北向的主干道上行驶，但也有一些车绕着市场行驶，还有一些车在粗糙地区的东西向小路上行驶。要注意的是，在雨雪天气，或在前往凯旋门的活动现场时，对车的需求很大，情况会变得很拥挤，很适合扒手。",
	"If you desire to travel in relative comfort and be the master of your destination, simply give a spirited wave and shout to any hire-coach driver who has no passengers. Each of these handsome, two-wheeled black coaches comfortably seats two travelers (perhaps four if you're quite slim and very well acquainted), who ride facing the road ahead. The hire-coach's driver sits high and to the rear of the carriage, manipulating the horses by means of long reins and a short whip on a rod. The fare must be agreed upon and paid before the journey, but only rarely will the cost exceed a half-dozen shards.": "如果你希望在相对舒适的环境中旅行，并成为你目的地的主人，只需向任何没有乘客的出租汽车司机挥手喊话即可。这些英俊的双轮黑色客车每辆都能舒适地坐下两名旅客（如果你相当苗条且非常熟悉的话，也许是四名），他们面向前方的道路乘坐。出租马车的司机坐在车厢后面的高处，用长缰绳和一根短鞭操纵着马匹。车费必须在出行前商定并支付，但很少有费用会超过半打沙子。",
	"The well-to-do-or those who want to ride in luxury during a day out-can hire a full carriage, many of which are as finely outfitted as those owned by the nobility. Up to eight can take such a ride in silken comfort. Prices and services vary, but generally you agree to rent the carriage, the services of the driver, and any attendant servants or guards for a full day.": "富裕的人--或者那些想在一天中乘坐豪华马车的人--可以租用一辆完整的马车，其中许多马车的装备和贵族拥有的马车一样精美。最多可以有八个人乘坐这样的马车，享受丝绸般的舒适。价格和服务各不相同，但一般来说，你同意租用马车，司机的服务，以及任何随行的仆人或警卫一整天的时间。",
	"The folk of Waterdeep often remain indoors in the colder months, particularly when it rains or snows. The flow of trade and travelers into the city slows to a trickle during winter, and as a result, traffic diminishes and drays and hire-coaches become more scarce. Fortunately, the Fellowship of Carters and Coachmen works with the Wheelwrights' Guild and the Wagon-makers' and Coach Builders' Guild to convert the drays and hirecoaches that do operate into sledges, so that some are available even in the worst weather.": "在寒冷的季节里，沃特德普的人们经常呆在室内，尤其是在下雨或下雪的时候。冬天，进入城市的贸易和旅行者的流量减弱，因此，交通减少，马车和出租马车变得更加稀少。幸运的是，车夫和马车夫联谊会与车轮工协会和马车制造商和马车制造商协会合作，将正在运营的马车和出租马车改装成雪橇，因此，即使在最恶劣的天气下，也有一些马车可以使用。",
	"Nobility in Waterdeep are granted the right to bear arms. In the legal code of the city, this means not merely the ability to carry a weapon, but the right to retain up to seventy equipped soldiers. These soldiers always wear a house's colors and the house's \"arms of grace\"-a heraldic device often borne on a shield, worn as a cloak pin, or affixed to a helmet. Others throughout the city, even foreign dignitaries, are permitted to retain only up to sixteen armed warriors, and laws against impersonating those in the employ of the nobility mean that other mercenaries and bodyguards most often dress plainly, so as not to be mistaken for the retinue of a noble. So your first clue that you might be in the company of a noble is the sight of a large number of armed and uniformed soldiers.": "沃特德普的贵族们被授予携带武器的权利。在城市的法律规范中，这不仅仅意味着携带武器的能力，还意味着保留多达70名装备齐全的士兵的权利。这些士兵总是穿着家族的颜色和家族的 \"恩典之臂\"--一种通常带在盾牌上的纹章装置，作为斗篷别针佩戴，或者贴在头盔上。整个城市的其他人，即使是外国政要，也只允许保留最多16名武装战士，而禁止冒充贵族雇员的法律意味着其他雇佣兵和保镖往往穿着朴素，以免被误认为是贵族的随行人员。因此，你可能与贵族为伍的第一个线索是看到大量的武装和穿制服的士兵。",
	"Many nobles, particularly younger ones seeking entertainment, travel without an entourage of guards or only in the company of other nobles. In this case, you'll know you're in the presence of nobility because of the deference others give them. Follow suit, and you should be fine.": "许多贵族，尤其是寻求娱乐的年轻贵族，在旅行时没有随行的护卫，或者只与其他贵族为伴。在这种情况下，你会知道你是在贵族的面前，因为其他人对他们的尊重。跟随他们，你应该会没事的。",
	"Above all, be polite. Always address a known noble as \"Lord\" or \"Lady.\" A short bow or a nod of the head to acknowledge a noble upon each meeting and parting is customary. Obsequiousness and servility is something all Waterdavians scorn, but you should also beware of acting in an overly familiar, boastful, or disrespectful way when in the presence of any noble. Though this sort of behavior isn't a crime, and laws against dueling prevent a noble from initiating a direct armed confrontation, the noble families of Waterdeep have immense power in the city, often in unexpected quarters. Many have influence in nations as distant as Calimshan and Cormyr. Be assured that any slighting of a noble will not be forgotten or easily forgiven.": "最重要的是，要有礼貌。始终称呼已知的贵族为 \"大人 \"或 \"女士\"。每次见面和离别时，对贵族的简短鞠躬或点头致意是惯例。谄媚和奴性是所有Waterdavians所鄙视的，但你也应该提防在任何贵族面前表现得过于熟悉、夸夸其谈或不敬。虽然这种行为不是犯罪，而且禁止决斗的法律也阻止了贵族发起直接的武装对抗，但水底城的贵族家族在城市中拥有巨大的权力，往往是在意想不到的地方。许多人在遥远的卡林山（Calimshan）和科米尔（Cormyr）等国家都有影响力。请放心，任何对贵族的轻视都不会被遗忘或轻易原谅。",
	"If you're not certain whether someone is a noble, address the gentleman as \"Saer\" or the gentlewoman as \"Goodwoman.\" Neither will give offense, and generally a noble will politely correct you as to their actual title.": "如果你不确定某人是否是贵族，可以称呼绅士为 \"Saer\"，或者称呼绅士为 \"Goodwoman\"。这两种称呼都不会引起反感，而且一般来说，贵族会礼貌地纠正你他们的实际头衔。",
	"Whenever you find yourself in a bustling city, you're likely to spot a wonderful variety of folk. You hear words in languages utterly foreign to you, and you smell dishes both delectable and strange. Waterdeep is the ultimate city of such delights, and before long, the alien thing becomes familiar to you, and the stranger becomes your friend.": "每当你发现自己身处一个繁华的城市时，你很可能会发现各种奇妙的民俗。你会听到完全陌生的语言，闻到既美味又陌生的菜肴。沃特德普是这样一个充满乐趣的终极城市，不久之后，陌生的东西变得熟悉起来，而陌生人则成为你的朋友。",
	"The people of Waterdeep are among the greatest of its splendors. Fashion, comportment, love-these things are practiced with an art and a zest in the city uncommon elsewhere. Visit a festhall or festival and see for yourself! And don't miss the cross-dressing performers who regale audiences with humor and song. Fabulous-that word doesn't begin to describe it, especially when they enhance the merriment with magic.": "沃特德普的人民是其最伟大的财富之一。时尚、举止、爱情......这些东西在这个城市里以一种艺术和热情的方式进行着，这在其他地方是不多见的。您可以去参观宴会厅或节日，亲眼看看。不要错过那些用幽默和歌曲为观众表演的变装表演者。妙不可言--这个词还不足以形容它，尤其是当他们用魔术来加强欢乐的时候。",
	"The city is also a haven for those who define for themselves what it means to be a man or a woman, those who transcend gender as the gods do, and those who redefine entirely who they are. What confidence! I never tire of witnessing it. I have seen folk in Waterdeep whose lives are more magical than the marvels possible with spells.": "这座城市也是那些为自己定义为男人或女人的人的天堂，那些像神一样超越性别的人，以及那些完全重新定义自己是谁的人。多么自信啊! 我从来没有厌倦过目睹它。我在沃特德普见过一些人，他们的生活比法术带来的奇迹更神奇。",
	"Nobles in Waterdeep are patrons of and investors in all manner of businesses in the city and abroad, as well as the many expressions of the arts. They spend coin to fund celebrations, contests at the Field of Triumph, upkeep at the city's temples and shrines, civic projects, guild events, and charitable actions such as burial of the unknown dead. Their motives are manifold, but their actions-no matter the reason-earn them loyalty and high regard from those who benefit from their largesse.": "沃特德普的贵族们是城市和国外各种商业的赞助者和投资者，也是许多艺术表现形式的赞助者。他们花钱资助庆祝活动、凯旋场的比赛、城市的寺庙和神殿的维护、公民项目、公会活动和慈善活动，如埋葬无名死者。他们的动机是多方面的，但他们的行为--不管是什么原因--都能为他们赢得忠诚和从他们的慷慨中受益的人的高度评价。",
	"Seeking patronage from a noble without having been introduced to that person is considered an insult, so you must first befriend someone in a noble's employ or circle of influence. Doing so is no guarantee of ultimate success; much time and coin can be wasted trying to curry favor with an acquaintance of a noble who turns out to be unscrupulous or of little help for some other reason. My advice is to do something deserving of attention, whatever your vocation, and someone from the noble families of Waterdeep will eventually show an interest.": "在没有被介绍给贵族的情况下向其寻求赞助被认为是一种侮辱，所以你必须先与贵族的雇员或影响圈中的人交朋友。这样做并不能保证最终的成功；为了讨好一个贵族的熟人，可能会浪费很多时间和金钱，而这个熟人原来是不择手段的，或者因为其他原因而没有什么帮助。我的建议是做一些值得关注的事情，无论你的职业是什么，沃特德普的贵族家族最终会对你感兴趣。",
	"In the words of that quarrelsome acquaintance of mine from the Dales, \"Before you strut your stuff in the chickens' preening circle, get to know the other cocks first.\" This colorful aphorism applies well to the affairs of nobility, because when you have interaction with a noble, you are at the same time dealing with one's entire family-as well as a network of business associates and allies. That situation can put you in a troublesome spot if you are unaware of the noble's connections.": "用我那个来自山谷的爱吵架的熟人的话说，\"在你在鸡的预演圈里大显身手之前，先认识一下其他的鸡。\" 这句丰富多彩的箴言很适用于贵族事务，因为当你与一个贵族交往时，你同时也在与他的整个家族打交道--以及一个商业伙伴和盟友网络。如果你不了解贵族的关系，这种情况会让你陷入麻烦的境地。",
	"No aspect of life in Waterdeep goes untouched by at least one of its more than forty guilds. Virtually every profession has an associated guild, and there's hardly a citizen of the city who doesn't belong to one or more guilds, or doesn't work for someone who does. As a visitor to Waterdeep, you need to know this, lest you run afoul of \"Guild Law.\" Guild Law isn't technically in the legal code of Waterdeep, but guilds are mentioned in the oldest surviving legal documents-penned by Ahghairon himself-and the rules of Guild Law are respected by wise city folk.": "在沃特德普的生活中，至少有40多个行会中的一个没有被触及。几乎每一种职业都有一个相关的行会，在这个城市里，几乎没有一个公民不属于一个或多个行会，或者不为某个行会工作。作为沃特迪普的访客，你需要知道这一点，以免你触犯了 \"公会法\"。严格来说，行会法并不在沃特德普的法律条文中，但在现存的最古老的法律文件中提到了行会--由阿格海隆亲自撰写的--而且行会法的规则受到了明智的城市居民的尊重。",
	"Guilds take their laws seriously, as do members of the City Watch and the magisters. If you flout a guild's traditions, you can expect not only public scorn but also a visit from enforcers of the law. In addition, many guilds have their own codes of accusation, trial, and punishment, such as:": "行会认真对待他们的法律，就像城市守望的成员和魔法师一样。如果你藐视一个行会的传统，你不仅可以期待公众的蔑视，还可以期待法律执行者的拜访。此外，许多行会都有自己的指控、审判和惩罚守则，如：。",
	"A member of the Bakers' Guild who sells bread baked in the wrong shape will be drenched with water and coated in his own flour.": "面包师协会的成员如果出售烤错形状的面包，将被淋上水并涂上自己的面粉。",
	"Heckling a member of the Jesters' Guild will result in the offending party being jeered at in public by no less than four guild members for a period of four days.": "嘲笑一个小丑公会的成员将导致违规方在公开场合被不少于四名公会成员嘲笑，为期四天。",
	"Any ship that unloads its cargo without due observance or aid by the Guild of Watermen shall have its cargo seized or thrown into the harbor.": "任何船只在没有适当遵守或得到水手公会援助的情况下卸货，其货物将被扣押或扔进港口。",
	"Many guilds have codes that entwine each other, complicating matters even more for the outsider. In Neverwinter, if you want to construct a building, you simply purchase the land and hire workers to build it. In Waterdeep, the Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild must first be consulted upon designation of the plat, then brought in to draw or approve the construction plan. The Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild must then clear and prepare the site, only after which will you be able to hire members of the Carpenters', Roofers', and Plaisterers' Guild to erect the structure.": "许多行会都有相互纠缠的守则，使外来者的事情更加复杂。在《永夜》中，如果你想建造一座建筑，你只需购买土地并雇佣工人来建造它。在沃特德普（Waterdeep），测量师、地图和制图师公会必须在指定地图时首先进行咨询，然后请他们来绘制或批准施工计划。然后，水窖工和水管工公会必须清理和准备场地，只有在这之后，你才能雇用木匠、屋顶工和绘图工公会的成员来建造结构。",
	"Moreover, the work will not be complete until members of the Guild of Fine Carvers and the Guild of Stonecutters, Masons, Potters, and Tile-makers design and craft any decorative elements of wood, stone, or ceramics, and after the Most Careful Order of Skilled Smiths and Metalforgers has manufactured and installed any door hinges. If the building is to be connected to the sewers or a city water supply, the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild must be called upon again to do that work. Want glazed windows installed? For that, you need to hire members of the Guild of Glassblowers, Glaziers, and Spectacle-makers.": "此外，在精雕细琢协会和石匠、石工、陶工和瓦工协会的成员设计和制作任何木头、石头或陶瓷的装饰元素之前，以及在最谨慎的熟练工匠和金属锻造师协会制造和安装任何门铰链之后，这项工作才算完成。如果建筑物要与下水道或城市供水系统连接，则必须再次要求酒窖和水管工协会来完成这项工作。想要安装玻璃窗？为此，你需要雇用玻璃工、玻璃匠和眼镜制造者协会的成员。",
	"If you do business in the city as anything other than a purchaser of goods and services, I strongly advise you to seek out a local solicitor and pay to be guided through the process. No guild of solicitors exists, so be sure your choice comes highly recommended by individuals you can trust. To learn the peculiarities of any guild's rules, consult someone on duty at the guild headquarters or ask a senior guild member.": "如果你在本市做生意，而不是作为商品和服务的购买者，我强烈建议你寻找一个当地的律师，并在整个过程中支付指导费。没有律师公会，所以要确保你的选择是由你可以信任的人强烈推荐的。要了解任何行会规则的特殊性，请咨询行会总部的值班人员或询问行会的高级成员。",
	"All that said, working at a guild-related profession without being a member of that guild isn't illegal. Guild members have no lawful recourse to interfere in the business of someone who chooses to not join the organization. But if you practice a trade or operate a business without becoming a member of the appropriate guild, word spreads, and you'll find that your coin isn't good for purchasing the goods or services of anyone who is a guild member. Since that group includes virtually everyone who sells the necessities of life or offers shelter for a fee, the benefits of joining a guild swiftly become apparent to those who procrastinate in this regard.": "综上所述，在没有成为该公会成员的情况下从事与公会有关的职业并不违法。公会成员没有合法的手段来干涉那些选择不加入该组织的人的生意。但是，如果你在没有成为相应公会成员的情况下从事贸易或经营业务，消息就会传开，你会发现你的金币不适合购买任何公会成员的商品或服务。由于这个群体几乎包括所有出售生活必需品或有偿提供住所的人，对于那些在这方面拖延的人来说，加入公会的好处很快就会显现。",
	"Newcomers to the city of Waterdeep are often confused by the importance that Waterdavians give to wards. In other cities, such as Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter, districts are bounded by rivers or walls. But in Waterdeep, one can traverse from ward to ward by crossing a street-a fact that offers the drivers of hire-coaches some amusement when an ignorant tourist requests a ride to an adjacent ward.": "初来乍到的沃特德普市的人经常会被沃特德普人对区块的重视所迷惑。在其他城市，例如博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和永冬（Neverwinter），地区是以河流或城墙为界的。但在沃特德，人们只需穿过一条街道就可以从一个区到另一个区--当一个无知的游客要求乘车到相邻的区时，这个事实让出租汽车的司机感到有些好笑。",
	"Each ward has its own history, legends, and traditions based around who lived there in the past, famous or infamous events, and the uncanny things that continue to occur. For example, children (and even some adults) hop on one foot when crossing Asmagh's Alley in the Castle Ward. Why? Well, Asmagh was an apothecary who {@condition poisoned} many patients, then buried them upright beneath the alley under cover of night. He was discovered, and some say that as many as eighty bodies were subsequently pulled up from holes under the alley's wide flagstones. Though this happened over a century ago, children passing through the alley still sing a song: \"Hop for the hollows, hop for the dead, hop on the flagstones, hop on their heads.\" As you stroll down Warrior's Way or the Street of Silver, listen for the children's delighted screams and go give it a try.": "每个区都有自己的历史、传说和传统，围绕着过去谁住在那里、著名或臭名昭著的事件，以及不断发生的不可思议的事情。例如，孩子们（甚至是一些成年人）在穿过城堡区的阿斯马格巷时，会用一只脚跳过去。为什么？嗯，阿斯马格是一个药剂师，他（%0%）许多病人，然后在夜色的掩护下将他们直立埋在小巷下面。他被发现了，有人说后来有多达八十具尸体从小巷宽大的石板下的洞里被拉了出来。虽然这发生在一个多世纪以前，但经过小巷的孩子们仍然唱着一首歌。\"跳到空洞里，跳到死人身上，跳到石板上，跳到他们头上\"。当你漫步在勇士之路或银色之街时，听着孩子们高兴的尖叫声，去试一试吧。",
	"These shared stories and traditions impart to each ward a different culture, just as much as distinctions of class and wealth. Yet nothing drives residents to identify with their wards as much as festivals and sport. Nearly every race and parade in the city features a competition between wards as part of the festivities. On such days, homes and businesses fly the colors of their wards, trot out their mascots, and sing rousing songs that celebrate where they live. If you stay in the city for even a month, you're sure to see some version of this display of civic spirit.": "这些共同的故事和传统给每个区带来了不同的文化，就像阶层和财富的区别一样。然而，没有什么能像节日和体育一样促使居民认同他们的选区。该市几乎每场比赛和游行都有各区之间的竞争，作为庆祝活动的一部分。在这样的日子里，家庭和企业都会悬挂他们区的颜色，派出他们的吉祥物，并唱着振奋人心的歌曲来庆祝他们居住的地方。如果你在这个城市呆上哪怕一个月，你肯定会看到这种公民精神的某种展示。",
	"The many idioms and slang expressions of Waterdavians would take a whole book to explore, but here I explain a few that might otherwise mystify.": "沃特达威人的许多成语和俚语表达方式需要一整本书来探讨，但在这里我解释一些可能会让人感到神秘的东西。",
	"{@b \"Dabbler but no master\" and \"No mastery blazing forth\"} These idioms trace their origin to Ahghairon, who early on in his studies of magic humbly said, \"I am no wizard. I am a dabbler but no master of magic; it seems no mastery burns within me.\" Both now serve as expressions of false modesty applied to any skill or craft, not just magic use.": "{@b \"Dabbler but no master\" and \"No mastery blazing forth\"}这些成语可以追溯到阿格海龙，他在研究魔法的早期就谦虚地说：\"我不是魔法师。我是个涉猎者，但不是魔法大师；似乎没有掌握的东西在我体内燃烧。\" 现在，这两种说法都是适用于任何技能或工艺的虚假谦虚的表达，而不仅仅是魔法的使用。",
	"{@b \"Sharpjaws,\" \"fastfists,\" \"bullyblades,\" and \"alleyblades\"} Those who boast of martial skill but who shrink from violence or lack real ability are \"sharpjaws.\" In sharp contrast are Waterdeep's \"fastfists\" (any lout easily provoked to violence), \"bullyblades\" (battle-hardened mercenaries hired as muscle), and \"alleyblades\" (muggers and thieves).": "{@b \"Sharpjaws,\" \"fastfists,\" \"bullyblades,\" and \"alleyblades\"}那些自诩武艺高强，但却畏惧暴力或缺乏真正能力的人是 \"尖牙利齿\"。与此形成鲜明对比的是沃特迪普的 \"快拳手\"（任何容易被激怒的暴徒）、\"恶霸之刃\"（被雇佣为肌肉的战斗力强的雇佣兵）和 \"小巷之刃\"（抢劫者和小偷）。",
	"{@b \"Longride\" and \"Last ride\"} To a caravan merchant, a drover, or a farmer from the lands around Waterdeep, as well as any Waterdavian who rides for sport, recreation, hunting, or falconry, the late afternoon is \"longride,\" and dusk is \"last ride.\"": "{@b \"Longride\" and \"Last ride\"}对于商队商人、赶牲口的人或来自水底世界周围土地的农民，以及任何为运动、娱乐、狩猎或猎鹰而骑马的水底世界人来说，午后是 \"longride\"，而黄昏是 \"最后一程\"。",
	"{@b \"Which the greater thief?\"} Tuezaera Hallowhand was a famous \"lone cat\" thief of Waterdeep in the 1200s DR, who disappeared suddenly and is thought to have come to a violent end. She once robbed a wizard and wrote this on his wall with a fingertip dipped in his favorite red wine: \"I take things. You take freedom with your spells. Which of us is the greater thief?\" Waterdavians now use this phrase in argument with one another over all kinds of matters when comparing wrongs done.": "{@b \"Which the greater thief?\"} Tuezaera Hallowhand是12世纪DR时期Waterdeep著名的 \"独行猫 \"盗贼，她突然消失了，人们认为她是以暴力结束的。她曾经抢劫过一个巫师，用指尖蘸着他最喜欢的红酒在他的墙上写下了这样一段话：\"我拿东西。你用你的法术夺取自由。我们谁是更大的盗贼？\" 现在，沃特达维亚人在相互争论各种问题时，在比较所做的错事时都会使用这句话。",
	"{@b \"Doth thy mirror crack?\" or \"Hurl but think not?\" or \"Take but not count cost? Be nothing, then!\"} {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}, then the Lady Mage of Waterdeep when she was married to Khelben \"Blackstaff\" Arunsun, once publicly rebuked an overambitious wizard of the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors thusly: \"If I hurl spells but think not of consequences, I am nothing. If I take lives but count not the cost, I am nothing. If I steal in the night and see not the faces of the devastated come the next morning, I am nothing. If I make decrees like a ruler but undertake none of the other responsibilities of the throne, I am nothing. And if I do all these things in the name of the Watchful Order, I am less than nothing. Doth thy mirror crack?\"": "{@b \"Doth thy mirror crack?\" or \"Hurl but think not?\" or \"Take but not count cost? Be nothing, then!\"} {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH}，当时是水底世界的女法师，当她与 \"黑杖 \"阿伦森结婚的时候，曾经公开斥责过一个好高骛远的法师和保护者守望团的巫师这样说。\"如果我施展法术却不考虑后果，我就什么都不是。如果我夺取生命却不计较代价，我就什么都不是。如果我在夜里偷东西，第二天早上不看被破坏的脸，我就什么都不是。如果我像统治者一样制定法令，却不承担王位上的其他责任，我就什么都不是。如果我以守望先锋的名义做所有这些事情，我就什么都不是。你的镜子有裂缝吗？\"",
	"These scornful words are remembered and used almost daily in Waterdeep even a century later.": "这些轻蔑的话语，即使在一个世纪之后，在沃特德普也几乎每天都会被人记住和使用。",
	"The Sea Ward stands proud on the high ground above Mount Waterdeep's sunset shadow. The rich and the powerful (or those who wish you to think such of them, and can afford the rent) reside or run their businesses here. When the warlords and pirates of early Waters Deep gained enough gold, they built fortresses on what used to be fields of grass tousled by sea wind. You can still see the remains of some of those old castles incorporated into the palatial homes of the noble families that dwell in the Sea Ward. For the best all-around view of the glittering homes enshrouded by garden walls, go to where Diamond Street and Delzorin Street cross, nigh to Mystra's House of Wonder, and simply spin in a circle.": "海上区骄傲地矗立在沃特德普山日落阴影之上的高地上。富人和有权势的人（或者那些希望你对他们有这样的看法，并能负担得起租金的人）在这里居住或经营他们的生意。当早期沃特深山的军阀和海盗们获得了足够多的黄金，他们就在过去被海风吹乱的草场上建造堡垒。你仍然可以看到其中一些旧城堡的遗迹被纳入居住在海区的贵族家庭的宫殿式住宅中。要想全面了解被花园围墙掩盖的闪闪发光的房屋，请到钻石街和德尔佐林街交叉的地方，靠近神秘拉的奇迹之家，然后简单地转一圈。",
	"Blue and gold are the Sea Ward's colors in competitions, and the ward's mascot is the sea lion-a fanciful combination of fish and feline. There's a persistent but patently false legend that the famous Lion Gate at the Field of Triumph is the gaping maw of a sea lion. The architectural designs for the gates show this to be false, however, and they can be viewed in the Map House-the guildhall of the Surveyors', Map-, and Chart-makers' Guild in the Castle Ward.": "蓝色和金色是海区在比赛中的颜色，海区的吉祥物是海狮--鱼和猫的幻想组合。有一个持续存在但明显错误的传说，即凯旋门上著名的狮子门是海狮的大嘴。然而，狮门的建筑设计表明这是假的，它们可以在地图馆中看到--位于城堡区的测量师、地图和制图师公会的会堂。",
	"Must-see locations in the Sea Ward begin, of course, with the Field of Triumph, but just across the street is the no less remarkable House of Heroes-the largest temple in the city. Dedicated to Tempus, its many grand halls celebrate the city's champions of both battle and sport. The winners of ward competitions are paraded here after their victories, often carried on shoulders or passed from hand to hand over the heads of a crowd. It is a sight you shouldn't miss.": "海区的必游之地当然是从凯旋场开始的，但就在街对面是同样引人注目的英雄之家--城市中最大的庙宇。它的许多大殿都是为了庆祝城市的战斗和体育冠军。病房比赛的获胜者在胜利后会在这里游行，通常被扛在肩上，或从人群的头顶传到手边。这是你不应该错过的一幕。",
	"You should also visit the House of Wonder. This is surely the most splendid temple dedicated to the gods of magic—with Mystra foremost among them, of course—in all the world. Although your eye will be drawn to its ornate towers, brilliant mosaics, and magical displays, look also for the humble violets growing amid the ostentation. These delicate flowers were Ahghairon's favorite, and they are planted about the temple in memory of him.": "你还应该参观奇迹之家。这肯定是世界上最辉煌的供奉魔法之神的寺庙--当然，其中最重要的是Mystra。尽管你的目光会被其华丽的塔楼、辉煌的马赛克和神奇的展示所吸引，但也要注意在这些浮华中生长的卑微的紫罗兰。这些精致的花朵是阿格海龙的最爱，它们被种植在寺庙周围以纪念他。",
	"Two other temples in the ward are as impressive, but in different ways. The beauteous House of the Moon has the tallest tower of any temple in the city, rising some seventy-five feet above the street. At its top, priests of Selûne bask in the light of the moon in all seasons. The House of Inspired Hands, dedicated to Gond, presents an altogether less peaceful experience. Here, all the great innovative minds of the city invent and experiment, attempting to create everything from flying machines to stronger door hinges. But don't expect a museum of marvels such as can be found in Baldur's Gate. At this site, \"worship is work,\" as anyone at the temple is liable to tell you.": "病区里的另外两座寺庙也同样令人印象深刻，但方式不同。美丽的月亮之家拥有本市所有寺庙中最高的塔，高出街道约75英尺。在塔顶，塞鲁恩的祭司们一年四季都沐浴在月光下。献给贡德的 \"灵感之家 \"呈现出一种完全不那么平静的体验。在这里，这个城市所有伟大的创新者都在进行发明和实验，试图创造出从飞行器到更坚固的门铰链的一切。但不要指望会有像博德之门那样的奇迹博物馆。在这个地方，\"崇拜就是工作\"，寺庙里的任何人都有可能这样告诉你。",
	"If you're looking for some good fortune, you should surely visit the Tower of Luck, a temple complex dedicated to Tymora. The \"tower\" in question is actually a many-pillared atrium ingeniously roofed over with glass. Beneath the roof, a bronze sculpture of a diminutive Tymora, depicted as a laughing young girl, appears to be leaping from the very top of an astounding fountain. To pay your respects and make a wish, you come around to the fountain on a walkway and toss your coin to Tymora. Managing to land it in her outstretched hand is a sure sign of her favor.": "如果你正在寻找一些好运气，你一定要去幸运之塔，这是一个供奉泰莫拉的寺庙群。这座 \"塔 \"实际上是一个多柱式中庭，巧妙地用玻璃盖住了屋顶。在屋顶下，一个矮小的泰莫拉的青铜雕塑，被描绘成一个欢笑的年轻女孩，似乎正从一个令人震惊的喷泉的顶部跃出。为了表达你的敬意并许下愿望，你走到喷泉旁的走道上，把你的硬币扔给泰莫拉。如果你能把硬币投到她伸出的手中，那就意味着她一定会对你有好感。",
	"If you need to refresh yourself during your travels, or perhaps to primp before an important meeting or a night out, visit Sune's faithful at the Temple of Beauty. Its marbled public baths and mirrored salons are open from before dawn to after dusk. There's no fee for these services, or for the advice and aid of the temple's many pleasant attendants, but donations are encouraged.": "如果你在旅行中需要养精蓄锐，或者在一个重要的会议或夜晚之前需要捯饬一下，请到苏妮的忠实于美容殿堂。它的大理石公共浴池和镜面沙龙从黎明前到黄昏后都开放。这些服务是不收费的，也不需要寺庙里许多愉快的服务员的建议和帮助，但鼓励大家捐款。",
	"Two parks in the Sea Ward might also be worth your time. The Shrines to Nature, just a block away from the Tower of Luck, are resplendent gardens dedicated to nature gods like Mielikki and Silvanus. The park is closed to all except residents of the Sea Ward. Yet from beyond the iron fence that surrounds it, you can catch glimpses of the superb shrines, statues, and fountains within. The Heroes' Garden is the only green space in the city that is open to the public besides the City of the Dead, but it is tucked away so far to the north in the Sea Ward that it gets few visitors-which is a pity, since the fine statuary in this lush garden portrays many of the figures important to the city's history.": "海区的两个公园可能也值得你去看看。自然神殿（Shrines to Nature）与幸运之塔仅一街之隔，是供奉米利基和希尔瓦娜斯等自然之神的华丽花园。除了海区的居民之外，这个公园不对任何人开放。然而，从环绕它的铁栅栏外，你可以瞥见里面的精湛的神龛、雕像和喷泉。英雄园是本市除死灵之城外唯一向公众开放的绿地，但它被隐藏在海区的北面，所以游客很少--这很可惜，因为这个郁郁葱葱的花园里的精美雕像描绘了许多对本市历史很重要的人物。",
	"I hesitate to mention a last location in the Sea Ward, and I will not reveal where to find it, for reasons that will soon become apparent. There is a house in the Sea Ward without windows or doors. You can't see it from the street, and those who live near it will not speak of it to others. You'll know you are near it when you see blue tiles on the streets and walls leading into an alley that passes under the surrounding buildings. At night, these tiles glimmer dimly with the blue light of foxfire. More than one route leads into the Blue Alley, as this place is known, but there are precious few ways out. Most who enter don't come back. If you see blue tiles, turn around and walk away before it is too late.": "我犹豫着要不要提到海区的最后一个地点，我也不会透露在哪里找到它，原因很快就会明白。在海区有一座没有门窗的房子。你从街上看不到它，住在它附近的人也不会对别人说起它。当你看到街道和墙壁上的蓝色瓷砖通向一条从周围建筑下穿过的小巷时，你就知道你在它附近。到了晚上，这些瓦片闪烁着昏暗的狐火蓝光。进入蓝巷的路线不止一条，因为这个地方被称为蓝巷，但出去的路却少得可怜。大多数进入的人都不会再回来。如果你看到蓝色瓦片，在为时已晚之前转身离开。",
	"For the best experience in the North Ward, go there just before dawn, buy a broadsheet, and settle in at a café with a view of the street. Watch as the ward comes quietly to life around you. At first, it will be so silent that you'll be able to hear the resident a street over who opens her sash for fresh air and clears her throat. Then the birdsong will begin, and shortly thereafter, you'll hear and then see the drays arriving with servants. These aren't the live-in staff used by noble houses, but people hired to come and work for a day. Most of them come from less affluent parts of the city, arriving with the tools of their trade and outfitted in their customary garb: launderers and cooks in white, chimney sweeps and housecleaners in black, valets and child-minders in gray, gardeners in green, and tutors in blue.": "为了获得在北区的最佳体验，在黎明前去那里，买一份大报，并在一个可以看到街道的咖啡馆里坐下。看着病区在你周围安静地生活起来。起初，它是如此安静，以至于你能听到隔着一条街的居民为呼吸新鲜空气而打开窗帘，清理她的喉咙。然后，鸟鸣开始了，不久之后，你会听到，然后看到载着仆人的马车驶来。这些人不是贵族之家所使用的住家员工，而是被雇来工作一天的人。他们中的大多数人来自城市中不太富裕的地区，带着他们的贸易工具，穿着他们习惯的服装来到这里：洗衣工和厨师穿白色衣服，扫烟囱的人和家庭清洁工穿黑色衣服，男仆和儿童保姆穿灰色衣服，园艺师穿绿色衣服，家庭教师穿蓝色衣服。",
	"As these servants spread out to knock on doors and begin their work, the residents of the ward take their exits, parting fondly with spouses and children, their footsteps tramping along the sidewalks or taking them into rattling hire-coaches. In the span of just an hour, the North Ward comes to noisy life and then settles again into quiescence, until later in the day when the process reverses itself, as residents return from work and servants leave.": "当这些仆人分散开来敲门并开始工作时，区里的居民也纷纷离开，与配偶和孩子们深情地告别，他们的脚步声在人行道上踩着，或者把他们带进嘎嘎作响的出租汽车。在短短的一个小时内，北区开始喧闹起来，然后又沉寂下来，直到一天的晚些时候，当居民下班回来，仆人离开时，这个过程就会反转过来。",
	"The liveliest, and perhaps the loveliest, part of the ward is the Cliffwatch. Here, the plateau upon which Waterdeep sits features cliffs so steep and high that the city wall is interrupted to either side of them. Some of the most lavish residences and most luxurious taverns and inns of Waterdeep stand along this space, boasting terraces and balconies that allow one to take in the beautiful sight of the countryside to the east. Yet you need not pay their high prices, for a public walkway along the cliff's edge offers pedestrians ample opportunity to enjoy the view.": "最有活力，也许也是最可爱的部分是悬崖观景区。在这里，沃特德普所处的高原上有着陡峭高大的悬崖，以至于城墙在其两侧被打断。沃特德普一些最奢华的住宅和最豪华的酒馆和旅馆就矗立在这片空间里，拥有露台和阳台，让人可以欣赏到东边乡村的美丽景色。然而你不需要支付他们的高价，因为沿着悬崖边的公共通道为行人提供了充分的机会来欣赏美景。",
	"The North Ward's colors are green and orange, and its mascot is the gentle white dove, depicted in flight. Many North Ward homes have dovecotes on their roofs, and the great flocks of the birds that circle over the city at dawn and dusk are a delight to behold.": "北区的颜色是绿色和橙色，其吉祥物是温柔的白鸽，被描绘成飞行的样子。许多北区家庭的屋顶上都有鸽子笼，大群的鸽子在黎明和黄昏时分在城市上空盘旋，让人赏心悦目。",

	"The Castle Ward is the heart and mind of Waterdeep, if not its soul. It houses the city's military forces, courts, government, and the Market-the largest market square of any city in the North. It encompasses the City Navy's docks in the Great Harbor and all of Mount Waterdeep, and it is home to six walking statues, numerous temples, and many other landmarks.": "城堡区是沃特德普的心脏和思想，如果不是它的灵魂的话。它是城市的军事力量、法庭、政府和市场的所在地--北方所有城市中最大的市场广场。它包括了城市海军在大港的码头和所有的沃特德山，它是六个步行雕像、许多寺庙和许多其他地标的所在地。",
	"Castle Waterdeep stands above the city on a great bluff that extends out from the mountain, its towers soaring hundreds of feet into the sky. It surprises many to learn that this isn't where Waterdeep's rulers reside, nor from where the city is governed. The castle was and is a redoubt of last defense should the city be attacked, but for well over a century, the ruler of Waterdeep has occupied the Palace of Waterdeep-also known as Piergeiron's Palace, and still called that by elderly and longlived citizens (including many elves).": "沃特德普城堡矗立在城市之上，位于从山上延伸出来的巨大悬崖上，其塔楼高达数百英尺，直入云霄。很多人惊讶地发现，这里并不是沃特德普的统治者居住的地方，也不是城市管理的地方。城堡过去和现在都是城市被攻击时的最后防御堡垒，但一个多世纪以来，沃特德普的统治者一直占据着沃特德普的宫殿--也被称为皮尔吉隆的宫殿，并且仍然被年长的公民（包括许多精灵）这样称呼。",
	"Though not quite as large as the castle, the palace is far more comfortable and lavishly decorated, with many halls used by government officials, guildmasters, and nobles for meetings and court proceedings. If you have reason to be invited (not compelled, I should hope!) to meet with the Masked Lords or the Open Lord of Waterdeep, it will likely take place in the audience chamber of the palace. There, you can witness the ancient and humble throne that Ahghairon first sat upon so long ago.": "虽然没有城堡那么大，但宫殿却要舒适得多，而且装饰豪华，有许多大厅供政府官员、行会会长和贵族们开会和法庭诉讼使用。如果你有理由被邀请（而不是被迫，我应该希望！）与假面领主或水底世界的公开领主会面，很可能会在宫殿的谒见厅进行。在那里，你可以目睹阿格海隆很久以前第一次坐上的古老而谦逊的王座。",
	"Many other buildings in the ward are given over to city business, including several courts for magisters and the barracks of the City Guard. So many of the ward's structures are offices and meeting halls for business owners, solicitors, publishers, and the like that the Castle Ward has the smallest resident population of all the wards.": "该区的许多其他建筑都用于城市商业，包括几个法官的法庭和城市卫队的兵营。该区的许多建筑都是企业主、律师、出版商等的办公室和会议厅，因此城堡区的居民人口是所有区中最少的。",
	"Many landmarks of interest are found in this ward aside from the six walking statues (discussed later in this chapbook). You could hardly see them all in a day, but the following are highly recommended.": "除了六座行走的雕像（在本章后面讨论）之外，在这个病房里还有许多有趣的地标。你很难在一天内看完它们，但以下是强烈推荐的。",
	"Blackstaff Tower is a squat black blot in the otherwise pretty ward. Humble though the edifice might be, looking at the place for too long can give you a queasy feeling and the sense that you are being watched-almost as if the tower itself has turned an unseen and wrathful eye upon you. Perhaps you think this fanciful. Well, go and try it yourself!": "布莱克斯塔夫塔是其他漂亮病房中的一个黑色斑点。尽管这座建筑可能很简陋，但看久了会让你有一种恶心的感觉，感觉你正在被监视--几乎就像这座塔本身对你投以看不见的愤怒的目光。也许你认为这是在胡思乱想。那么，自己去试试吧",
	"On the opposite end of the mountain, close to the Naval Harbor, stands {@creature Mirt|WDH}'s Mansion. Once a fortress-like and glowering tower, it has been upgraded with more delicate fashions of architecture since the return of its long-absent owner.": "在山的另一端，靠近海军港湾的地方，矗立着{@creature Mirt|WDH}的大厦。它曾经是一座像堡垒一样令人生畏的塔楼，自从其长期不在的主人回来后，它已经被升级为更精致的建筑风格。",
	"{@creature Mirt|WDH} has quite a history with {@creature Durnan|WDH}, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Together they descended into \"the Well, \"as the entrance to Undermountain was known in olden days. Waterdeep used to throw criminals in the Well, leaving them to die horribly in Undermountain's dungeons. {@creature Durnan|WDH} and {@creature Mirt|WDH} entered the dungeons of their own free will-and not only that, but returned laden with treasures. Both used magic to extend their lives, but they eventually parted ways. {@creature Mirt|WDH} kept on with a life of adventure, while {@creature Durnan|WDH} built the tavern called the Yawning Portal over the Well and now, almost two centuries later, charges coin to descend into it. Not a bad way to part fools from their money!": "{@creature Mirt|WDH}与{@creature Durnan|WDH}有一段历史，他是打哈欠门户的所有者。他们一起下到 \"井 \"里，这是在过去被称为地下山的入口。水底世界曾经把罪犯扔进井里，让他们在山下的地牢里可怕地死去。{@creature Durnan|WDH}和{@creature Mirt|WDH}自愿进入地牢，不仅如此，还满载财宝而归。两人都用魔法来延长他们的生命，但他们最终还是分道扬镳了。{@creature Mirt|WDH}继续过着冒险的生活，而{@creature Durnan|WDH}则在水井上方建造了名为 \"打哈欠 \"的酒馆，并且在近两个世纪后的今天，收取硬币进入其中。把傻瓜从他们的钱财中分离出来的方法还真不赖!",
	"The glorious Spires of the Morning, dedicated to Lathander, is one of Waterdeep's most beautiful temples. But it is rivaled in this ward by the Temple of the Seldarine, dedicated to all the elf gods. The journey through Mount Melody Walk, a tunnel cut through Mount Waterdeep, to New Olamn's academy of music and other arts is a wondrous daytime excursion. The Market offers a wild array of sights, smells, and sounds in which folk might lose themselves for a tenday. The Font of Knowledge is a temple to Oghma, yes, but also the city's largest public library. Titles written throughout the ages can be viewed here-under the watchful eyes of the temple's priests. In short (if I can claim this section of the enchiridion to be such), the Castle Ward offers far too many splendors to list them all here.": "献给拉坦德的辉煌的晨曦之塔，是沃特德普最美丽的寺庙之一。但在这个病房里，它可以与供奉所有精灵之神的塞尔达林神庙相媲美。通过沃特德普山的隧道--\"旋律山\"，前往新奥兰姆的音乐和其他艺术学院，是一次奇妙的白天旅行。市场提供了一系列疯狂的景象、气味和声音，人们可能会在其中迷失自己一个星期。知识之泉是奥格玛的庙宇，没错，但也是该市最大的公共图书馆。古往今来的书籍都可以在这里看到--在神庙祭司的注视下。简而言之（如果我可以说这部分内容是这样的话），城堡区提供了太多的辉煌，无法在此一一列出。",
	"The Castle Ward's colors are blue and purple, and its mascot is a griffon, typically depicted in gold. These borrow colors from the city's flag and reference the Griffon Cavalry, of course. Champions for the ward often come from among the ranks of the Guard, the Navy, or the Cavalry. Although such competitors have often had the advantage in races and competitions, their crowds of rabidly cheering fans are naturally much smaller than those of other wards.": "城堡区的颜色是蓝色和紫色，其吉祥物是一只狮鹫，通常被描绘成金色。这些颜色来自城市的旗帜，当然也参考了狮鹫骑兵的颜色。病房的冠军往往来自于警卫队、海军或骑兵队的队伍中。虽然这样的竞争者在比赛和竞赛中经常有优势，但他们狂热的欢呼人群自然比其他区的人少得多。",
	"Shopping, shopping, shopping galore! Or eating, eating, eating! Or drinking, drinking, drinking! Or lavish accommodations, or fine art, or legendary parties! The Market in the Castle Ward is the largest market square in the city, but the Trades Ward is like a market town in itself-and is easily thrice the Market's size.": "购物，购物，购物多多! 或吃，吃，吃! 或饮酒、饮酒、饮酒! 或奢华的住宿，或精美的艺术，或传奇的聚会! 城堡区的市场是本市最大的市场广场，但贸易区本身就像一个集镇--其规模是市场的三倍。",
	"This ward bustles day and night with activity, both on the street and on balcony walkways that run the length of blocks and are sometimes layered five stories high. Shop signs appear to leap out from buildings, whose sides are plastered with advertisements all vying for the attention of the eye. Glove shops, shoe shops, jewelry stores, perfumeries, flower shops, cake shops, taverns, cafés, tea shops, inns, row houses, boarding schools, offices, dance academies, grocers, pottery stores, armor vendors-as long as it's not illegal, you can find it in the Trades Ward. But if you are looking for something illegal, the Trades Ward is likely the place to get that too. Do not do so too loudly, though. The City Watch has a heavy presence in this ward, in the form of both open patrols and officers working out of uniform.": "这个区日日夜夜都很热闹，无论是在街上还是在阳台走道上，都有很多活动，这些活动贯穿整个街区，有时有五层楼那么高。商店的招牌似乎从建筑物中跳了出来，建筑物的侧面贴满了广告，都在争夺人们的目光。手套店、鞋店、珠宝店、香水店、花店、蛋糕店、酒馆、咖啡馆、茶馆、旅店、排屋、寄宿学校、办公室、舞蹈学院、杂货店、陶器店、盔甲店--只要不是非法的，你都能在贸易区找到。但是，如果你正在寻找非法的东西，贸易区也可能是获得这些东西的地方。不过，不要太大声。城市监察局在这个区有很多人，包括公开巡逻和不穿制服的官员。",
	"As befits a place of so much business, many guilds have their halls in this ward. Of particular note is the House of Light, the hall of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters. Outside the building, a wagon-sized mound of wax with hundreds of wicks is kept lit day and night, while being continually built up with adhered candles. Inside, the best works of the guild are put on display and sold, including not just candles of various colors, {@item lamp|PHB|lamps}, and chandeliers, but elaborate waxwork constructions that depict all sorts of subjects from personages of note, to dragons, to complex and abstract lattices-all represented as fantastical candles.": "作为一个生意兴隆的地方，许多行会都在这个区设立了他们的大厅。特别值得注意的是光之屋，即Chandlers and Lamplighters公会的大厅。在建筑外面，有一个马车大小的蜡堆，上面有数以百计的灯芯，日夜不停地点燃，同时不断地用附着的蜡烛堆积起来。在里面，公会最好的作品被展示和出售，不仅包括各种颜色的蜡烛，{@item lamp|PHB|lamps}和吊灯，还包括精心制作的蜡制品，这些蜡制品描绘了各种主题，从知名人士到龙，再到复杂抽象的格子，都表现为幻想的蜡烛。",
	"Magic users should be wary in the Court of the White Bull. Long ago, this plaza was a grazing area for livestock, including an albino calf that was born here. The calf's owner built the White Bull Tavern, which thrived on the spot for years and gave the area its name. You'll not find the tavern now, though. It vanished, utterly destroyed during an infamous spell battle between the archmage Thongalar the Mighty and the evil mage Shile Rauretilar and his apprentices. In the storm of magic that touched down here, Shile and his apprentices all perished and the fabric of the Weave was rent, such that Azuth, god of wizards, was forced to appear and set things right. He is said to have stitched reality and the Weave back together, but a wrinkle in the fabric remains. To this day, magic brought to bear in the Court of the White Bull sometimes goes awry, and the use of magic items and spells is forbidden in the area.": "魔法使用者在白牛宫应保持警惕。很久以前，这个广场是牲畜的放牧区，包括一只在这里出生的白化牛犊。小牛的主人建造了白牛酒馆，它在这个地方繁荣了多年，并为这个地区命名。不过，你现在找不到这家酒馆了。它消失了，在大法师汤加勒（Thongalar the Mighty）和邪恶法师希勒-劳瑞提拉（Shile Rauretilar）及其学徒之间一场臭名昭著的法术战中被彻底摧毁。在落在这里的魔法风暴中，Shile和他的学徒们全部丧生，编织的结构被破坏，以至于巫师之神Azuth被迫出现，将事情纠正。据说他把现实和 \"织网 \"重新缝合在一起，但 \"织网 \"上仍有一条皱纹。时至今日，在白牛宫中使用的魔法有时会出错，而且在该地区禁止使用魔法物品和咒语。",
	"The Trades Ward uses green and purple as its colors, and its mascot is the mimic. This tradition supposedly arose because when mascots were first chosen, the Trades Ward took a chest of gold as its own-and was roundly mocked by citizens of other wards for not picking a creature. Now, every four years, the ward reveals a new object for its mascot, declaring it to be the mimic. The nature of the object is subject to much speculation and rumor until its unveiling. For months afterward, the object becomes the source of practical jokes in Waterdeep. Rock gnomes and wizards cause illusory mouths to lunge from real versions of the object, artisans craft beautiful fakes out of cake or paper that are easily crushed when assumed to be real, and so on. As of the writing of this enchiridion, the current mimic is a tankard.": "贸易区使用绿色和紫色作为其颜色，其吉祥物是模仿者。这个传统据说是因为在第一次选择吉祥物时，贸易区把一箱金子作为自己的吉祥物--而且因为没有选择一个生物而被其他区的公民嘲笑了一番。现在，每隔四年，该区就会公布一个新的吉祥物，宣布它是模仿者。该物品的性质在其揭幕之前一直受到很多猜测和谣言的影响。之后的几个月里，该物品成为沃特德普的恶作剧之源。岩石侏儒和巫师使虚幻的嘴从该物体的真实版本中跳出来，工匠们用蛋糕或纸制作美丽的假货，当被认为是真实的时候很容易被粉碎，等等。截止到撰写这篇enchiridion时，目前的模仿品是一个坦克。",
	"It is called the Southern Ward, not the South Ward. Waterdavians are peculiar about this, and if you insist on referring to it as the South Ward, expect to be corrected or thought a fool. The name derives not merely from its southerly location in the city, but from the southerners who settled in this district as the city grew. Today, the ward still hosts most of the traveling merchants who visit the city, and is made up of many enclaves, blocks, and streets primarily occupied by citizens who trace their ancestry to other realms.": "它被称为南区，而不是南区。沃特达维亚人对此很特别，如果你坚持把它称为南区，那么你会被纠正或认为是个傻瓜。这个名字不仅来自于它在城市中的南部位置，而且来自于随着城市的发展在这个区定居的南方人。今天，该区仍然是大多数访问该市的旅行商人的所在地，由许多飞地、街区和街道组成，主要由那些祖籍在其他国家的公民占据。",
	"One can indulge in the finest halfling food here, enjoy the best singers of Calishite music, and examine the most stunning works of dwarven crafting-but the first challenge is finding where these treats are housed. The Southern Ward has long been a district of laborers catering to travelers, so its folk have adopted the architectural custom of building homes and businesses above stables or around inn yards, near to where wagon trains are housed.": "在这里，人们可以品尝到最好的半身人食物，欣赏到最好的卡利希特音乐歌手，研究最令人惊叹的矮人工艺作品--但第一个挑战是找到这些美食的存放地点。南区长期以来一直是迎合旅行者的劳工区，所以它的居民采用了在马厩上方或旅馆院子周围建造房屋和商业的建筑习惯，靠近马车列车停靠的地方。",
	"Residents of the Southern Ward take pride in their legacy as overland travelers and hardworking folk, so it should be no surprise that the ward's mascot is the mule. On their competition flags, a pugnacious mule in rampant pose stands on a field of red and white-colors said to represent the blood and tears the people of the Southern Ward have shed during their labors.": "南方区的居民对他们作为陆路旅行者和勤劳人民的遗产感到自豪，所以该区的吉祥物是骡子也就不奇怪了。在他们的比赛旗帜上，一头顽皮的骡子以横冲直撞的姿态站在红色和白色的场地上，据说这代表了南方区人民在劳作中流下的血和泪。",
	"Not a landmark as such, but surely a sight that must be seen, is the Moon Sphere. This isn't a structure but an event that occurs during every full moon, when a glowing, spherical field of blue light appears in the square known as the Dancing Court. Any creatures that enter the sphere find that they can fly about inside it just by willing themselves to do so. For centuries, Waterdavians have used these supernatural events to develop a unique flying style of dance-but amateur enthusiasts aren't welcome, except on certain daylight appearances of the full moon.": "月球不是一个地标，但肯定是一个必须看到的景象，这就是月球。这不是一个结构，而是一个在每个满月期间发生的事件，当一个发光的、球形的蓝色光场出现在被称为舞蹈法庭的广场上。任何进入球体的生物都会发现，只要他们愿意，就能在球体内飞行。几个世纪以来，沃特达维亚人利用这些超自然的事件发展出一种独特的飞行舞蹈风格--但业余爱好者并不受欢迎，除非在满月的某些白天出现。",
	"Even when the full moon isn't out, the Dancing Court is worth visiting because of the adjacent festhall, the Jade Dancer. During appearances of the Moon Sphere, people sometimes daringly leap into the field of magic from the balconies of this three-story tavern, dance hall, and inn. But the festhall takes its name from a peculiar dancer within it rather than those in the court outside. The \"Jade Dancer\" is an eight-foot-tall jade statue of a woman that magically animates and dances for patrons-and on occasion serves as a bouncer. Elminster has informed me that despite its dexterity and seemingly fragile beauty, the Jade Dancer is as puissant as a stone golem. So enjoy the show, but don't get too rowdy.": "即使在满月没有出来的时候，舞苑也是值得一游的，因为相邻的宴会厅--玉舞厅。在月球出现的时候，人们有时会大胆地从这个三层楼的酒馆、舞厅和旅馆的阳台上跃入魔法领域。但这个舞厅的名字来自于里面一个奇特的舞者，而不是外面那些宫廷里的舞者。玉石舞者 \"是一尊八英尺高的玉石雕像，它能神奇地让顾客活起来，为他们跳舞，有时还充当保镖。埃尔明斯特告诉我，尽管 \"玉舞者 \"很灵巧，看起来也很脆弱，但它却像石雕一样强大。因此，请欣赏表演，但不要太过喧闹。",
	"The Dock Ward was long considered the most dangerous district in the city, but the Field Ward has since taken that title. I don't doubt the residents of the Dock Ward are glad of it, for in some respects this area has never truly deserved its bad reputation.": "长期以来，码头区被认为是本市最危险的地区，但后来菲尔德区取代了这个称号。我并不怀疑码头区的居民对此感到高兴，因为在某些方面，这个地区从来就没有真正配得上它的坏名声。",
	"Yes, aside from the Field Ward, this is the area where most of Waterdeep's poor reside. Yes, it is home to some of the least literate people in the city. Yes, most of its taverns are inhabited by habitual drinkers, and far too many inns charge by the hour. But all must concede this: the residents of the Dock Ward often work the hardest while living under the harshest conditions.": "是的，除了田野区之外，这里是沃特德普大多数穷人居住的地方。是的，这里是城市中一些最不识字的人的家。是的，这里的大部分酒馆都住着惯于喝酒的人，而且有太多的酒馆按小时收费。但所有人都必须承认：码头区的居民往往在最艰苦的条件下工作。",
	"Warehouses, poorhouses, and tenements dominate much of the area. Streets are steep throughout, and few have space alongside for pedestrians. Wandering through the ward can be a bewildering journey without a guide. Except in the immediate vicinity of the piers, shop signs and advertising of any kind are rare, and warehouses and other businesses often have no sign at all. You either know where you are going and have reason to be there-or you are lost, and a likely mark for pickpockets or worse.": "仓库、济贫院和公寓在该地区的大部分地区占主导地位。整个街道都很陡峭，很少有街道旁边有空间供行人通行。在没有向导的情况下，在该区徘徊可能是一个令人迷惑的旅程。除了紧邻码头的地方，任何形式的商店招牌和广告都很罕见，而仓库和其他企业往往根本没有任何标志。你要么知道你要去哪里，并且有理由去那里，要么你就迷路了，很可能成为扒手或更糟的人的目标。",
	"Streetlamps don't fare well in the Dock Ward. Their candles, oils, and glass are too regularly stolen or smashed. The Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters makes a halfhearted attempt to repair the streetlamps at the start of each season, but for most of the year, locals are forced to carry their own light when traveling these streets at night.": "路灯在码头区的情况并不乐观。他们的蜡烛、油和玻璃经常被偷或被砸。在每个季节开始的时候，Chandlers和Lamplighters协会都会半心半意地尝试修复路灯，但在一年中的大部分时间里，当地人在晚上走过这些街道时，不得不自己带着灯。",
	"The colors of the Dock Ward are burgundy and orange, and its mascot is a swordfish that has always been depicted as green for reasons lost to time. The folk of the Dock Ward take competition seriously, and they frequently draft their champions from the rough-and-tumble sailors who come to the city. (Some say they draft pirates, but that is pure slander.) Frequent complaints arise that these women and men are more citizens of the sea than of the Dock Ward itself. But if they register with a magister and pay taxes, they are as welcome to compete as any long-term resident of Waterdeep.": "码头区的颜色是酒红色和橙色，其吉祥物是一条剑鱼，由于时间的原因，它一直被描绘成绿色。码头区的居民认真对待竞争，他们经常从来到这个城市的粗犷的水手中征召他们的冠军。(有人说他们招募的是海盗，但这纯属诽谤。)经常有人抱怨说，这些女人和男人与其说是码头区本身的公民，不如说是海洋的公民。但是，如果他们在治安官那里登记并缴税，他们就会像沃特德普的任何长期居民一样受到欢迎，参与竞争。",
	"I could write a book about the City of the Dead. It is such a fascinating place, filled with so much history and so many stories. But alas, there would be few buyers for Volo's Guide to the City of the Dead, since it would be of interest mainly to Waterdavians-and the topic is one about which they are already intimately knowledgeable.": "我可以写一本关于死亡之城的书。它是一个如此迷人的地方，充满了如此多的历史和故事。但可惜的是，《沃罗亡灵之城指南》的买家会很少，因为这本书主要是水城人感兴趣的，而这个主题是他们已经非常了解的。",
	"The City of the Dead is no drab cemetery. It is a great park of grassy hills, tended flower beds, artfully placed clusters of trees and bushes, beautiful sculptures, astounding architecture, and gravel paths that wend intriguingly through it all. Long ago, Waterdavians largely abandoned the practice of burying their dead, instead entombing them in mausoleums. For centuries, the major mausoleums here have each been connected to an extradimensional space where the dead are taken, mourned, and interred.": "亡灵之城不是单调的墓地。它是一个巨大的公园，由草山、精心照料的花坛、艺术地放置的树木和灌木丛、美丽的雕塑、令人震惊的建筑，以及耐人寻味地穿过这一切的砾石路组成。很久以前，沃特达维亚人基本上放弃了埋葬死者的做法，而是将他们埋在陵墓中。几个世纪以来，这里的主要陵墓都与一个外太空相连，死者在那里被带走、哀悼和安葬。",
	"Those who can afford it memorialize the departed with sculptures, making the City of the Dead an open-air museum that features some of the most stunning, haunting, mournful, and downright eerie statues ever crafted in marble or bronze. Nobles and wealthy merchants have competed to erect the grandest markers for their dead, leading to a wide variety of styles and concepts created by artists at the height of their skills.": "那些有能力的人用雕塑来纪念逝者，使亡灵之城成为一个露天博物馆，其中有一些用大理石或青铜制作的最令人惊叹、最令人不安、最悲痛、最阴森的雕像。贵族和富商们竞相为他们的死者建立最宏伟的标记，导致了艺术家们在他们的技能高峰期创造出各种各样的风格和概念。",
	"One of the cemetery's most impressive attractions is the Warriors' Monument. This intricate, sixty-foot-high sculpture depicts a circle of women and men striking down trolls, orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears, and barbarians, all of which are falling backward and outward around the warriors. Above all of them, a flying griffon rider spears a skeletal knight whose breastplate bears the symbol of Myrkul, god of the dead. But this statue is also a fountain, and the wounds on these combatants gush water! Don't try to imagine it—just go see it. And see it as Waterdavians do: pack a midday feast, have a picnic, and then take a stroll through the beauty of the place.": "墓地中最令人印象深刻的景点之一是勇士纪念碑。这座复杂的、60英尺高的雕塑描绘了一圈女人和男人击倒巨魔、兽人、霍布格林、虫人和野蛮人的场景，所有这些人都在勇士周围向后和向外倒下。在他们所有人的上方，一个飞翔的狮鹫骑士用长矛刺向一个骷髅骑士，他的胸甲上有亡灵之神米尔库尔的标志。但这个雕像也是一个喷泉，这些战斗人员身上的伤口会喷出水来! 不要试图去想象它--只要去看它。而且要像沃特达维亚人那样去看：准备好中午的盛宴，进行一次野餐，然后漫步在这个美丽的地方。",
	"There's more to the city of Waterdeep than just the wards within its walls. If you have need to visit the environs of the city, here's what you'll need to know.": "沃特德普城不仅仅是城墙内的病房，还有更多的东西。如果你需要访问这个城市的周边地区，这里有你需要知道的东西。",
	"This district was once a caravan yard between Waterdeep's two northernmost walls, kept free of settlement to serve as a killing field in times of war. As refugees from various calamities settled there after not being allowed into the city's wealthy northern neighborhoods, the area has grown up into a lawless town of its own.": "这个地区曾经是沃特德普最北边的两道城墙之间的一个商队院子，没有人定居，在战争时期作为一个杀戮场。由于来自各种灾难的难民在不被允许进入城市北部的富人区后定居于此，这个地区已经成长为一个无法无天的城镇。",
	"Though not an official ward of the city, the Field Ward is commonly referred to as one. The Watch doesn't patrol this area, however, and many crimes go uninvestigated. The City Guard oversees the Field Ward from the walls around it, but its members get involved only when folk moving into or out of the city are threatened.": "虽然不是城市的一个正式区，但田野区通常被称为一个区。然而，守夜人并不在这一地区巡逻，许多犯罪行为都没有得到调查。城市守卫队从其周围的城墙上监督田野区，但其成员只有在进出城市的人受到威胁时才会参与。",
	"The area is a muddy mess, populated by the poorest people and those who take advantage of those folks' desperation. It has no sewer system and isn't served by the Dungsweepers' Guild-a fact that will be quite evident to your nose if you venture here. I don't recommend that you spend any more time here than it takes to pass through from one gate to the next.": "该地区是一个泥泞的烂摊子，居住着最贫穷的人和那些利用这些人的绝望的人。这里没有下水道系统，也没有扫墓者协会的服务--如果你在这里冒险，你的鼻子会很明显地感觉到这个事实。我不建议你在这里花更多的时间，而不是从一个门到另一个门的时间。",
	"The Guild of Butchers operates several slaughterhouses, smokehouses, and leather-making facilities in the area-noisome operations that have been pushed out of the city proper. A word to the wise: being friendly with a burly fellow who is good with a knife is one of your best defenses in the Field Ward. The other place you might solicit aid is Endshift Tavern, a popular stop for off-duty members of the City Guard, situated on the corner of Endshift Street and the Breezeway. Though the guards might not be inclined to assist you, your status as a visitor to Waterdeep technically obliges them to help you reach the city proper in safety.": "屠夫协会在该地区经营着几家屠宰场、烟馆和皮革制造厂--这些令人厌恶的业务已经被赶出了城市的范围。明智之举是：与擅长用刀的魁梧家伙友好相处是你在野外区最好的防御措施之一。另一个你可以寻求援助的地方是恩德什特酒馆，这是城市卫队下班后最受欢迎的地方，位于恩德什特街和微风走廊的拐角处。虽然卫兵们可能不愿意帮助你，但从技术上讲，你作为沃特德普的游客，他们有义务帮助你安全地到达城市本身。",
	"The place where the High Road and the Way of the Dragon meet in the south of the city is called the Waymoot. At the center of the crossroads, a high signpost stands with hanging arrows pointing toward the harbor and each of the city gates. Created by the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors and funded by local merchants, the signpost magically directs travelers to well-known distant locations when the names of those locations are spoken into a crystal on the post. The magic of the Waymoot writes the destination onto the proper arrow of the signpost and indicates its distance from Waterdeep in miles. Folk are thereby sent out of the harbor or the appropriate gate leading north, east, or south, depending on their destination.": "高路和龙路在城市南部交汇的地方被称为 \"Waymoot\"。在十字路口的中心，矗立着一个高高的路标，上面悬挂着指向港口和每个城门的箭头。这座路标是由魔法师和保护者的守望会创建的，并由当地商人资助，当人们对着路标上的水晶说出那些地点的名字时，路标就会神奇地将旅行者引向遥远的知名地点。Waymoot的魔法将目的地写在路标的正确箭头上，并指出它与水底世界的距离，单位是英里。民众由此被送出港口或通往北边、东边或南边的适当大门，这取决于他们的目的地。",
	"Unfortunately for newcomers, the Waymoot is of no use whatsoever in finding locations within Waterdeep. You will, however, find a number of enterprising individuals near the crossroads who take advantage of this fact to offer their services as city guides. Though some reputable members of this cadre will guide you true for a fair fee, plenty of citizens with nothing to lose or gain by doing so will also readily set you on the right course if you're simply polite.": "不幸的是，对于新来者来说，Waymoot在寻找Waterdeep的位置方面没有任何作用。然而，你会发现在十字路口附近有一些有进取心的人，他们利用这一事实提供他们的服务，作为城市的向导。虽然这些人中有些有名望的成员会以合理的价格为你提供指导，但如果你有礼貌的话，很多没有任何损失或收益的市民也会很乐意为你提供正确的路线。",
	"This area of rolling grassland and small wooded areas east of the city is a rural community focused on farming and animal husbandry, and which caters to travelers. It is also the site of a large and well-protected training camp for the City Guard, and a prison farm run by the City Watch (called Amendsfarm) where those convicted of minor offenses work off their debt to the city. Many gnomes and halflings live in this region, and most buildings are built to reflect their stature.": "城市东部这片由连绵起伏的草地和小树林组成的地区是一个以农业和畜牧业为主的农村社区，它为旅行者提供服务。这里也是城市守卫队的大型训练营地和城市守卫队经营的监狱农场（称为Amendsfarm），那些被判定犯有轻罪的人在这里工作，以偿还他们对城市的债务。许多地精和半身人居住在这个地区，大多数建筑都是为了反映他们的身材。",
	"Two noble families have estates in Undercliff. The Amcathra estate is used for the housing and final training of horses bred in the town of Amphail, many of which are sold to the City Guard. The Hothemer noble house has an estate where its members conduct business in overland trade-beyond the reach of Waterdeep's auditors.": "有两个贵族家族在安德克里夫拥有庄园。Amcathra庄园用于饲养和最终训练在Amphail镇饲养的马匹，其中许多马匹被出售给城市卫队。霍特赫默（Hothemer）贵族家族有一个庄园，其成员在那里进行陆路贸易，这是沃特迪普的审计人员所不能及的。",
	"If you visit this area, I recommend the Snobeedle Orchard and Meadery, owned and run by the Snobeedle halflings. They have a delightful drinking hall and a shop sized for larger patrons, and you can pick your own fruit when it is in season.": "如果你访问这个地区，我推荐Snobeedle果园和蜂蜜酒厂，由Snobeedle半身人拥有和经营。他们有一个令人愉快的饮酒大厅和一个为较大的顾客而设的商店，当水果到了季节，你可以自己采摘。",
	"Tales of this legendary dungeon below Waterdeep are told well by many in the city, but I'll provide you with the basic truths here.": "关于这个位于沃特迪普城下的传奇地牢的故事，城里的很多人都说得很好，但我在这里为你提供基本的真相。",
	"Beneath the plateau of Waterdeep lies the largest and deepest dungeon in the world. It sprawls out under the city, said to plunge as many as twenty levels deep. The Melairkyn dwarves first excavated the tunnels that would become Undermountain, and the drow are said to have dug their own tunnels up from below. All were claimed, altered, and expanded by the mad wizard Halaster and his apprentices-who are believed to dwell in the dungeons to this day. What drove them deep into the earth remains a mystery, but Undermountain's allure is a siren song that still draws many. If you want to see adventurers descend into the depths, or perhaps glimpse some returning with wondrous treasures, visit the Yawning Portal in the Castle Ward.": "在沃特迪普的高原下有一个世界上最大、最深的地牢。它在城市下蔓延开来，据说深达20层。梅莱金（Melairkyn）矮人首先挖掘了后来成为地下山的隧道，据说乌鸦也从下面挖出了自己的隧道。所有这些都被疯狂的巫师哈拉斯特和他的学徒们索取、改变和扩大--据说他们至今还住在地牢里。是什么驱使他们深入地底仍然是个谜，但地下山的诱惑力仍然吸引着许多人。如果你想看到冒险者进入深渊，或者也许瞥见一些人带着奇妙的宝物回来，请访问城堡区的打哈欠门户。",
	"A description of each of the features that cause Waterdeep to be called the City of Splendors would require a library's worth of paper. This chapbook can't hope to encompass them all, no matter its author's expertise with a quill. However, I shall endeavor to enlighten you about several sights that have not been mentioned earlier, and to expand upon some previously covered.": "如果要描述沃特德普被称为 \"辉煌之城 \"的每一个特征，就需要一个图书馆的纸张了。这本小册子不可能囊括所有的内容，不管作者对毛笔的专业知识如何。不过，我将努力向你们介绍一些以前没有提到的景点，并对以前涉及的一些景点进行扩展。",
	"You'll find no city on the Sword Coast or in all the North half as civilized as Waterdeep. It's not just the law of the land that makes this so, but also the comforts that life here provides.": "在剑海岸或整个北境，你找不到像沃特迪普这样一半文明的城市。这不仅仅是因为这里的法律，还有这里的生活所提供的舒适性。",
	"In most other towns and cities, you'll start with an early-morning stumble on the stairs as you carry your night soil down to deposit it outside. But in Waterdeep, many buildings are connected directly to the sewers. Public facilities for those out and about can be found all around the Market and the Field of Triumph, and near the largest city squares. In places without ready access to sewers or public outhouses, members of the Dungsweepers' Guild make multiple rounds each day, collecting urine and excrement separately-for use in industry and agriculture, respectively. Take comfort that in Waterdeep, you'll always find a pot to piss in.": "在大多数其他城镇，你会从清晨在楼梯上跌跌撞撞开始，因为你把你的夜行土搬到外面去存放。但在沃特迪普，许多建筑都直接与下水道相连。在市场和凯旋场周围，以及最大的城市广场附近，都可以找到供人们外出活动的公共设施。在没有下水道或公共厕所的地方，扫地僧公会的成员们每天都要进行多次巡视，分别收集尿液和粪便，分别用于工业和农业。在沃特迪普，你总能找到一个可以小便的罐子，这让你感到安慰。",
	"Also notice how clean the streets are kept. This upkeep is due in large part to the hard work of the Dungsweepers' Guild. Dungsweepers can be seen working their brooms and carts at every hour of the day-and for a few hours after dark-all over the city, removing not just animal dung but other refuse. This service is free to all, paid for by taxes rendered to the city-although an egregious amount of trash left for pickup does result in a separate bill from the guild.": "还请注意街道是如何保持清洁的。这种维护在很大程度上归功于扫粪工协会的辛勤工作。扫粪工在一天中的每一个小时都可以看到他们的扫帚和小车，而且在天黑后的几个小时里，在整个城市里工作，不仅清除动物粪便，而且清除其他垃圾。这项服务对所有人都是免费的，由向城市征收的税款支付--尽管大量的垃圾留待捡拾，也会导致公会的单独账单。",
	"Another amenity soon appreciated by visitors is Waterdeep's water system. With public fountains and wells all about the city, clean water is plentiful. Many buildings have pumps of their own to draw water from the local supply, and some even possess taps that pour out water with the twist of a knob. This convenience is made possible by the inventiveness of the Gondar, the industry of the Cellarers' and Plumbers' Guild, and the magic that Waterdeep inherited from the Illefarni elves.": "另一个很快被游客欣赏的设施是瓦特德普的供水系统。城市里到处都有公共喷泉和水井，干净的水很充足。许多建筑都有自己的水泵，可以从当地的水源中抽取水，有些建筑甚至拥有水龙头，只要拧一下旋钮，就可以把水倒出来。这种便利是由刚达人的创造力、酒窖和水管工协会的工业以及沃特迪普从伊勒法尼精灵那里继承的魔法所带来的。",
	"Waterdeep is also a city of light. {@spell continual flame} spells illuminate many signs and streetlamps in the wealthier parts of the city. Elsewhere, the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters keeps the streets lit (excepting the Field Ward and the most dangerous areas of the Dock Ward). Not only that, but hundreds of {@item driftglobe||driftglobes} bob about the City of the Dead at night, departing to float over the rest of the city each morning. Such is not typical behavior for driftglobes, I assure you!": "沃特迪普也是一座光之城。在城市的富人区，{@spell continual flame}法术照亮了许多标志和路灯。在其他地方，钱德勒和点灯人公会保持着街道的照明（除了田野区和码头区最危险的区域）。不仅如此，数以百计的(1%)的人晚上在亡灵之城晃荡，每天早上离开，在城市的其他地方漂浮。我向你保证，这不是漂流球的典型行为。",
	"Lastly, no city in the world is as literate as Waterdeep. Oghma's priests from the Font of Knowledge offer free instruction in reading to all who desire it, and the city has over thirty publishers of broadsheets in addition to chapbook printers and book publishers. Large paper advertisements are plastered onto alley walls, and smaller ones are passed out by those hired by businesses to trumpet their services. Printed menus can be found posted in the windows of most eateries and are handed out to those who dine within. Admittedly, you'll see less reading material in the Dock Ward and the Field Ward, but this fact is notable only because of its preponderance elsewhere.": "最后，世界上没有一个城市像沃特迪普那样有文化。奥格玛的知识之泉的牧师们为所有渴望阅读的人提供免费的指导，除了小册子印刷商和书籍出版商之外，这个城市还有超过30家大报出版商。大的纸质广告贴在小巷的墙壁上，小的广告则由商家雇佣的人传出，以吹嘘他们的服务。大多数餐馆的橱窗里都贴有印刷的菜单，并分发给在里面就餐的人。诚然，在码头区和田野区，你会看到较少的阅读材料，但这一事实之所以值得注意，只是因为它在其他地方占了上风。",
	"Waterdeep doesn't have the fabled flying ships of Halruaa, but it does deploy an aerial defense force. Brave warriors of the City Guard light out from the Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, riding fearsome griffons that have been bred and trained for that purpose. Each of the riders is equipped with a ring of feather falling—not merely to prevent death from mishap, but to allow them to perform stunning feats of aerial acrobatics.": "Waterdeep没有传说中的Halruaa的飞船，但它确实部署了一支空中防御力量。勇敢的城市卫队战士骑着可怕的狮鹫从沃特德普山顶的峰顶空军基地出发，这些狮鹫都是专门培育和训练的。每个骑手都配备了一个羽毛坠落环--不仅仅是为了防止误伤死亡，而且还能让他们完成令人惊叹的空中杂技表演。",
	"In both martial displays and in real battles against flying threats such as manticores, harpies, and outlaw wizards, the griffon riders actually leap off their mounts into the open air! For a breath-stealing moment, they fall like stones, closing in on their targets at incredible speed. Their opponents rarely see the death blow, distracted as they are by other mounted griffon riders. When they are past the danger, the free-falling riders then suddenly halt in the air, drifting like feathers until their griffon companions swoop in and they regain their saddles. Working in concert with one another in this fashion, members of the Griffon Cavalry can rapidly eliminate any threat to the city-and even catch the body of the offender before it hits the rooftops below.": "在武术表演和对抗飞行威胁的真实战斗中，如刺尾狮、女妖和非法巫师，狮鹫骑士实际上从他们的坐骑上跳到了空旷的地方！他们像石头一样落下。在一个令人窒息的时刻，他们像石头一样落下，以难以置信的速度逼近他们的目标。他们的对手很少看到致命的一击，因为他们被其他骑马的狮鹫骑士分散了注意力。当他们越过危险时，自由落体的骑手会突然停在空中，像羽毛一样漂浮着，直到他们的狮鹫同伴俯冲过来，他们才重新回到自己的鞍上。以这种方式相互配合，狮鹫骑兵的成员可以迅速消除对城市的任何威胁--甚至在犯罪者撞上下面的屋顶之前抓住其尸体。",
	"Riders of the Griffon Cavalry are trained to stay above the rooftops, not because they fear crashing into towers and weather vanes, but because the smell of so much horseflesh in the streets below can sometimes drive their griffons into a frenzy.": "狮鹫骑兵的骑手被训练成呆在屋顶上，不是因为他们害怕撞上塔楼和风向标，而是因为下面街道上那么多马肉的味道有时会使他们的狮鹫陷入狂热。",
	"Over a century ago, just one of these eight behemoth statues stood visible at the northern foot of Mount Waterdeep, on a bluff called Gull Leap. Ninety feet tall, it resembled a bald human staring out to sea. Later events (discussed below) caused it to be transformed into the statue known today as the Sahuagin Humbled.": "一个多世纪以前，这八座巨兽雕像中只有一座矗立在沃特德普山的北麓，在一个名为 \"鸥跃 \"的悬崖上。它有90英尺高，就像一个盯着大海的秃头人类。后来的事件（在下文中讨论）导致它变成了今天被称为 \"萨瓦金谦卑 \"的雕像。",
	"When the Spellplague gripped Waterdeep in 1385 DR, six more walking statues suddenly appeared in the city, wandering to wreak havoc even as the Sahuagin Humbled remained motionless. The authorities and citizens of Waterdeep succeeded in stopping three of these new statues, breaking the Swordmaiden and the Hawk Man, and sinking the God Catcher into the street up to its waist. Then all the statues mysteriously stopped their rampage just as quickly as they had begun it. Tsarra Chaadren, the Blackstaff at the time, couldn't command them to return to their former hiding places on the Ethereal Plane. Consequently, the city repaired itself and built up around them. Much later, in 1479 DR, the eighth statue-the Griffon-emerged from the Ethereal Plane to defend Ahghairon's Tower against intrusion. It roosted there for a time before flying to its current position near Peaktop Aerie on Mount Waterdeep. Once more, this activity seemed to be outside the Blackstaff's control. Thankfully, all the walking statues have been dormant for well over a decade now, serving only as beautiful, cyclopean reminders of Waterdeep's might.": "当法术瘟疫在公元1385年笼罩沃特迪普时，又有六座行走的雕像突然出现在城市中，即使在萨瓦金-谦卑者一动不动的情况下，也在游荡着进行破坏。沃特德普的当局和市民成功地阻止了其中三个新雕像，打碎了剑女和鹰人，并将捕神者沉入街道，直到其腰部。然后，所有的雕像都神秘地停止了它们的横冲直撞，就像它们开始时一样迅速。当时的黑杖Tsarra Chaadren无法命令他们回到他们以前在虚空界的藏身之处。因此，城市自我修复并在他们周围建立起来。很久以后，在公元1479年，第八座雕像--狮鹫从虚空界出现，保卫阿格海龙之塔免受入侵。它在那里栖息了一段时间，然后飞到了沃特德普山的峰顶艾里附近的当前位置。再一次，这种活动似乎超出了黑杖的控制范围。值得庆幸的是，所有的步行雕像都已经休眠了十几年，只是作为美丽的，提醒沃特德普的力量的cyclopean。",
	"This is perhaps the most famous walking statue in the city, thanks to its dramatic pose, its nearness to the Market, and the self-evident magic of its existence. The statue is of a well-muscled but impassive male human with its left leg sunk to the hip in the street, the result of a spell cast by the Blackstaff at the time of its rampage. Its left hand and right foot press against the ground as if it is trying to pull itself out. Its right arm is raised skyward, and above its open palm floats a sphere of stone. Its gaze looks up toward the sphere, and the pattern of bird droppings around its eyes gives it the appearance of weeping.": "这也许是本市最著名的步行雕像，这要归功于它戏剧性的姿势，它离市场很近，以及它存在的不言而喻的魔力。雕像是一个肌肉发达但无动于衷的男性人类，其左腿沉入街道的臀部，这是黑杖在其横行时施法的结果。它的左手和右脚压着地面，似乎在试图把自己拉出来。它的右臂朝天举起，张开的手掌上方漂浮着一个石球。它的目光看向球体，眼睛周围的鸟粪图案使它看起来像是在哭泣。",
	"All about the statue, climbing up its chest and on its knee and shoulders, is a tenement that carries the name \"the God Catcher.\" The tenement's landlord is Aundra Blackcloak, an unsociable sorcerer who is rarely seen in the city except when she alights from the door carved in the floating sphere, which serves as her home. On the rare occasions when she wants to meet with city folk (typically to purchase odd substances for magical purposes), she appears unannounced on balconies or rooftops after dark. Her dealings are polite, though, and she pays fair coin. She never confides in anyone or talks about her own doings-and if anyone but she has ever seen the inside of her spherical home, they've said nothing publicly about it.": "围绕着雕像，爬上它的胸膛，在它的膝盖和肩膀上，是一个带有 \"神捕 \"之名的租房。这个公寓的房东是昂德拉-布莱克拉克（Aundra Blackcloak），她是一个不善交际的巫师，除了从浮动球体上雕刻的门下来时，她很少在城市里出现，这是她的家。在少数情况下，当她想与城市居民见面时（通常是为了购买用于魔法的奇特物质），她会在天黑后突然出现在阳台或屋顶上。不过，她的交易是有礼貌的，而且她会支付公平的硬币。她从不向任何人倾诉，也不谈论她自己的所作所为--如果除了她之外有人看到过她的球形房子的内部，他们也没有公开说过这件事。",
	"The walking statue called the Griffon is shaped like the beast for which it is named. Though it stands on all four legs, its back is fully twenty feet off the ground, making it a mount fit for a storm giant. Although it has shown itself to be capable of flight, with the granite feathers of its wings spreading like a bird's, the Griffon now merely stands in a regal pose near Peaktop Aerie atop Mount Waterdeep, looking to the southeast over the Dock Ward. Newcomers sometimes assume it to be a monument to Waterdeep's Griffon Cavalry, but Waterdavians know better.": "被称为狮鹫的步行雕像的形状就像它被命名的那只野兽。虽然它用四条腿站立，但它的背离地面足有20英尺，使它成为适合风暴巨人的坐骑。虽然它已经展示了自己的飞行能力，翅膀上的花岗岩羽毛像鸟儿一样张开，但狮鹫现在只是以一种威严的姿势站在沃特德普山的峰顶艾丽斯附近，看着东南方向的码头区。新来的人有时会认为它是沃特德普的狮鹫骑兵的纪念碑，但沃特德普人更清楚。",
	"For years, the only visible walking statue of Waterdeep was known simply as \"the walking statue.\" It stood at the foot of Mount Waterdeep near the head of Julthoon Street. Then, after its critical role in defending the city against an invasion of sahuagin in 1370 DR, Khelben Blackstaff reshaped the statue into a sahuagin. It now bows low toward the House of Heroes on bended knee-a gesture of obeisance to the city, and an acknowledgment of the sacrifice of all who fought for the city in that war.": "多年来，沃特德普唯一可见的步行雕像只被称为 \"步行雕像\"。它矗立在朱尔通街头附近的沃特德普山脚下。然后，在1370 DR年它在保卫城市抵御萨瓦金人的入侵中发挥了关键作用后，凯尔本-布莱克斯塔夫将雕像重塑为萨瓦金人。它现在向英雄之家低头屈膝，这是一个向城市致敬的姿态，也是对所有在那场战争中为城市而战的人的牺牲的认可。",
	"This walking statue stopped its rampage as it approached the Market, then fell backward and sat upon a building. When it settled, its arms fell limp at its sides and its head tilted forward onto its chest, giving the impression that it had fallen asleep. The statue's huge stone battleaxe still stands nearby, its haft angled upright and its blade half buried in the cobbles. The rubble of the crushed building was long ago rebuilt into a broad stone stair (with railings and a ramp that drunkards are often rolled down) that ascends from the cobbles to the statue's lap. That lap now holds a two-story tavern also built from the rubble, called Gralkyn's Tankard. The {@condition unconscious} pose of the statue and the tavern in its lap made the name of the Great Drunkard a natural fit.": "这座行走的雕像在接近市场时停止了横冲直撞，然后向后倒下，坐在一座建筑物上。当它落座时，它的双臂瘫软在两侧，头向前倾斜到胸前，给人的感觉是它已经睡着了。雕像的巨大石质战斧仍然矗立在附近，它的斧柄倾斜直立，斧刃半埋在鹅卵石中。被击碎的建筑物的瓦砾早已被重建成一个宽阔的石阶（有栏杆，还有一个醉汉经常被滚下来的斜坡），从鹅卵石上升到雕像的腿上。那一圈现在有一个两层楼的小酒馆，也是在废墟上建起来的，叫格拉金的酒馆。雕像的{@condition unconscious}姿势和它腿上的酒馆使 \"大醉鬼 \"这个名字变得自然而然。",
	"This fair lady caused much chaos when she was active. The statue has the appearance of a female elf, whose hair and clothing appeared to flow naturally as it walked through the city during the Spellplague. When the walking statues stopped, this one toppled onto its side, taking on the appearance of a titanic sculpture of a noble lady asleep in her garden.": "这位美丽的女士在活动时引起了许多混乱。这座雕像有一个女性精灵的外表，在法术瘟疫期间，它的头发和衣服在城市中行走时显得自然流畅。当行走的雕像停止时，这尊雕像翻倒在一边，呈现出一个贵族夫人在花园里睡觉的泰坦雕塑的样子。",
	"The Honorable Knight is a statue of a male warrior in plate armor with a shield and {@item longsword|PHB}. When the walking statues stopped, it bowed to those opposing it, straightened, sheathed its sword, and doffed its shield, setting it point down on the ground and upright by its side. It then ceased motion in this position, facing southwest toward the harbor, and looking for all the world like a castle guard standing at ease. The pose it assumed led to its naming, and it is viewed with respect by the citizens of the southerly wards.": "尊敬的骑士是一尊身穿板甲、手持盾牌和（%0%）的男性战士的雕像。当行走的雕像停下来时，它向反对它的人鞠了一躬，直起身来，将剑入鞘，并脱下盾牌，将它点在地上，竖立在身旁。然后，它在这个位置上停止了运动，面向西南方向的港口，看起来就像一个站在那里的城堡守卫。它的这个姿势导致了它的命名，它被南区的公民们尊重着。",
	"This statue looks like a winged, hawk-headed being, and thus locals call it the Hawk Man. I can reveal that in fact it bears much resemblance to an aarakocra, one of the bird-people said to live in the Star Mounts in the High Forest. The statue's wings are folded tightly against its back and have never unfurled, leaving its flight capability uncertain. It was brought low during its rampage across the city, and now it tilts decidedly toward the northeast due to a missing right foot-long ago broken up for building rubble, along with its right arm. Its left arm is extended out toward the north, palm forward as if in a gesture to say, \"Stop.\"": "这座雕像看起来像一个有翅膀的鹰头人，因此当地人称它为鹰人。我可以透露，事实上，它与阿拉科克拉非常相似，据说是住在高森林的星山的鸟人之一。这座雕像的翅膀紧紧地折叠在背上，从未展开过，因此它的飞行能力不确定。它在横穿城市的过程中被压得很低，现在它明显地朝东北方向倾斜，因为它的右脚早就被拆成了建筑废墟，连同它的右臂一起。它的左臂向北伸出，手掌向前，似乎在做一个手势，说：\"停下。\"",
	"The body has been hollowed out and turned into a tower shared by several wealthy tenants, which is officially known as Sparaunt Tower after its owner. The statue's left hand extends over a courtyard to the north, wherein lies the entrance of a tunnel carved through the arm. Visitors and residents can ring a bell in the courtyard, whereupon a door guard acknowledges the ringer and lowers a rope ladder for tenants and expected guests (or a rope chair that is drawn up for guests who are infirm or laden with heavy items).": "雕像的身体被挖空了，变成了一座由几个富有的房客共同使用的塔，以其主人的名字正式命名为斯帕拉伊特塔。雕像的左手伸向北边的一个院子，那里有一个刻在手臂上的隧道入口。游客和居民可以在院子里摇铃，这时门卫会确认摇铃人，并为房客和预期的客人放下绳梯（或为体弱或携带重物的客人拉起绳椅）。",
	"This statue appears virtually identical to the Honorable Knight, except for its female form and open-faced helm. It was felled during the Spellplague after causing much chaos and slaughter. The residents of Waterdeep's North Ward funneled much of their frustrated and dismayed reaction to its rampage into dismantling the statue, parts of which can now be found all over the North Ward, either incorporated into buildings or as bits of freestanding sculpture.": "这座雕像与荣誉骑士几乎一模一样，除了它的女性形态和敞开式头盔。在法术瘟疫期间，它在造成大量混乱和屠杀后被砍倒。沃特德普北区的居民将他们对雕像横行的失望和沮丧的反应都用在了拆除雕像上，现在可以在北区的各个地方找到它的部件，有的被纳入建筑中，有的则是独立的雕塑碎片。",
	"The head of the Swordmaiden sits in a stand of tall trees in the center of the block of the North Ward bounded by Hassantyr's Street, Tarsar's Street, Whaelgond Way, and Ussilbran Street. The center of its jaw and mouth have been replaced by a door, which leads into the shop known as Thort's Findings. Undevvur Thort is a wizened ex-adventurer who leans on a cane (which some locals insist is more than just a cane). He lives in the small shop, whose many levels, staircases, and landings fill the hollowed-out interior of the head, and which is crammed with oddments sold to Thort by adventurers and other travelers. These items bear little placards in Thort's beautiful, flowing handwriting that identify them (or at least provide speculation as to their origin and purpose). Nobles and wealthy merchants who desire props for themed revels often rent some of Thort's wares as decoration-and many sages, alchemists, and wizards visit him regularly in search of potentially useful items.": "剑女的头颅坐落在北区以哈桑泰尔街、塔萨尔街、瓦赫贡路和乌西尔布兰街为界的街区中心的高大树木中。它的下巴和嘴的中心已经被一扇门所取代，这扇门通向被称为 \"索尔特的发现 \"的商店。恩德弗尔-索特是一个拄着手杖（有些当地人坚持认为这不仅仅是一根手杖）的古怪的前冒险家。他住在小商店里，商店的许多楼层、楼梯和楼道填满了头顶的空心内部，里面塞满了冒险家和其他旅行者卖给托特的零星物品。这些物品上有托特美丽流畅的笔迹的小标语牌，可以识别它们（或者至少可以猜测它们的来源和用途）。贵族和富有的商人希望为主题狂欢提供道具，他们经常租用托特的一些物品作为装饰--许多圣人、炼金术士和巫师经常拜访他，寻找潜在的有用物品。",
	"Waterdeep has as many alleys as Baldur's Gate has cats, and each has a name and a story. Here are a few that you might wish to see—or should know to avoid.": "沃特德普的小巷就像博德之门的猫一样多，每条小巷都有一个名字和一个故事。这里有几条你可能希望看到的，或者应该知道如何避免的。",
	"This short avenue from Caravan Court to the Trollwall in the Southern Ward is haunted by the hooded ghost of the mage Ruid, whose touch causes deathly chills to those he meets on foggy nights. All attempts to banish or turn the spirit have failed. Those who brave its unearthly approach and allow Ruid to pass through them learn a secret truth about someone or something in their life—if they survive.": "从商队法庭到南区巨魔墙的这条短短的大道被法师瑞德的蒙面鬼魂所困扰，他的触摸让那些在雾夜里遇到的人感到死亡的寒意。所有驱逐或转化这个幽灵的尝试都失败了。那些敢于接近它并让瑞德穿过他们的人，会了解到关于他们生命中的某人或某事的秘密真相--如果他们能活下来的话。",
	"This is the lair of the Hand that Sings, a magical phantasm of a hand with a mouth in its palm. The hand is said to snatch valuables it fancies—especially magical ones—when it encounters them, and to occasionally attack folk in the darkness, strangling them or tripping them into fatal falls. Most often, though, it takes no notice of those who don't bother or follow it, eerily singing fragments of old Sword Coast ballads and love songs as it drifts through the night.": "这里是 \"会唱歌的手 \"的巢穴，它是一只手的魔法幻影，手掌里有一张嘴。据说这只手在遇到它喜欢的贵重物品--特别是有魔法的物品时，会抢走它们，偶尔也会在黑暗中攻击人们，勒死他们或把他们绊倒在地，造成致命伤害。但大多数情况下，它对那些不打扰或跟踪它的人不闻不问，当它在夜里漂流时，阴森森地唱着古老的剑岸民谣和情歌的片段。",
	"This passage crosses two city blocks and winds through the interior of a third, running between and (for the most part) parallel to Julthoon Street and Traders' Way in the North Ward. It is, unsurprisingly, home to many cats that feed on scraps from the surrounding butchers' shops, but it is also known for the many carved stone heads of people and animals that adorn the alley's buildings. Individuals who have walked the alley alone report that some of the heads whispered cryptic messages to them.": "这条通道穿过两个城市街区，并蜿蜒穿过第三个街区的内部，在北区的朱尔通街和商人路之间，（大部分时间）与朱尔通街平行。毫不奇怪，它是许多猫的家，它们以周围肉店的残羹剩饭为食，但它也因小巷建筑上的许多人和动物的石雕头像而闻名。独自走过这条小巷的人说，一些头像对他们说着神秘的信息。",
	"Found at the southern entrance to the House of Inspired Hands in the Sea Ward, this alley serves as the testing ground for inventions considered too dangerous to operate inside the temple. The locals are generally unconcerned about the risks, though, and stand watching while food vendors circulate among them.": "这条小巷位于海区灵感之屋的南部入口处，是被认为太危险而不能在寺庙内操作的发明的试验场。不过，当地人一般不关心这些风险，而是站在一旁观看，而食品小贩则在他们中间流通。",
	"This alley in the Sea Ward is named after the first leader of the House of Wonder, but is more infamous for its Circle of Skulls. This infrequent and unpredictable haunting takes the form of seven floating skulls, which hover in a circle and argue with one another in whispered tones about events in the city. If they are interrupted, their reaction reportedly varies from being helpful to engaging in murderous spell-slinging.": "这条位于海区的小巷是以奇迹之家第一任领导人的名字命名的，但更多的是因其骷髅圈而臭名昭著。这个不经常发生的、不可预测的闹鬼事件以七个漂浮的骷髅头为形式，它们围成一圈，以低声的语调相互争论着城市中的事件。如果他们被打断，据说他们的反应会有所不同，有的会帮助别人，有的会施展杀人的法术。",
	"This alley in the Dock Ward suffers from a magical curse that causes three daggers to appear out of thin air and attack passersby. The daggers swoop and fly about, making multiple attempts at murder before vanishing again. This magical effect, the result of a spell cast by a long-dead wizard, has resisted all attempts to dispel it. Some locals boast of how many times they've crossed the alley and lived to tell of it, but the appearance of the daggers is entirely a matter of chance, and unpredictable. So take my advice and don't test Tymora's favor.": "这条位于码头区的小巷受到了一个神奇的诅咒，导致三把匕首凭空出现并攻击路人。匕首在空中飞来飞去，多次试图杀人，然后又消失了。这种神奇的效果，是一个早已去世的巫师施展的咒语的结果，它抵制了所有驱除它的尝试。一些当地人吹嘘说，他们曾多少次穿过小巷并活到现在，但匕首的出现完全是一个机会问题，而且是不可预测的。所以听我的建议，不要试探泰莫拉的好感。",
	"At many times of year, hardly a tenday can pass in Waterdeep without the staging of some rite, race, or rousing ceremony of civic pride. Here I briefly summarize the most widely celebrated events on the calendar, from the first of Hammer to the last of Nightal.": "在一年中的许多时候，沃特德普几乎没有一天不举行一些仪式、竞赛或振奋人心的公民自豪感的典礼。在这里，我简要地总结了日历上最广泛的庆祝活动，从锤子的第一个月到Nightal的最后一个月。",
	"Marking the start of the new year, this observance is a widely recognized day off work, when folk sip warmed ciders and broths (often laced with herbs for health and to bring on visions) and stay inside. They tell tales of what interested them or was important in the year just done, and discuss what they intend to do or should deal with-or things that everyone \"should keep a hawk's clear eye on\"-in the year ahead.": "这个纪念日标志着新的一年的开始，是一个被广泛认可的休息日，人们在这一天啜饮温热的苹果酒和肉汤（通常加有健康和带来幻觉的草药）并呆在屋里。他们讲述刚刚过去的一年中他们感兴趣或重要的事情，并讨论他们打算做什么或应该处理什么，或者每个人在未来一年中 \"应该保持清醒的头脑 \"的事情。",
	"Such talk inevitably leads to discussions of politics, wars, and the intentions of rulers. Maps are usually consulted, and it's widely considered lucky to possess and examine a map on Wintershield. Map sales are brisk in the tenday preceding this holiday.": "这种谈话不可避免地会导致对政治、战争和统治者意图的讨论。人们通常会查阅地图，而且人们普遍认为在冬盾节上拥有和检查地图是一种幸运。在这个节日的前一天，地图的销售非常火爆。",
	"Led by the clergy of Sune, Sharess, and Lliira, the Grand Revel is a day of dancing, music, and the consumption of sweet treats of all kinds, from chocolate to red firemint candies. Although some of the dancing is wanton and performed for show, large-scale ring dances in the street for all ages are also popular. All the dancing ends at dusk, after which bards and minstrels perform at \"love feasts\" for families. Couples-or those desiring to become couples-slip away together to kiss, exchange promises, and trade small tokens of affection (often rings blessed by clergy with prayers of faithfulness). Even if you have no paramour, indulge a little in the dance and food of this fine tradition. The night might be cold, but your heart will be warmed.": "在苏内、沙雷斯和利拉的神职人员的带领下，大狂欢节是一个充满舞蹈、音乐和消费各种甜食的日子，从巧克力到红色火薄荷糖。虽然有些舞蹈是放肆的，是为了表演，但在街上为所有年龄的人表演的大型环形舞蹈也很受欢迎。所有的舞蹈在黄昏时分结束，之后游吟诗人和吟游诗人在 \"爱情盛宴 \"上为家庭表演。情侣们--或者那些希望成为情侣的人--一起溜走，亲吻，交换承诺，并交换小的感情信物（通常是由神职人员祝福的戒指，并祈祷忠贞）。即使你没有伴侣，也要在这一优良传统的舞蹈和食物中放纵一下。夜晚可能很冷，但你的心会被温暖。",
	"This holiday is named in honor of Lathander's first prophet, Rhyester, a young blind boy who was cured of that blindness by the dawn's light on this day more than seven centuries ago. That holy event occurred in the vicinity of Silverymoon, but Lathander has long had a much larger temple in Waterdeep, and a following to match. Each of the faithful dons bright garb of sunrise hues and keeps one eye covered until the next dawn in honor of Rhyester. If you want to feel like a local, catch the eye of any celebrant you see and wink. Fine friendships have grown from far less.": "这个节日是为了纪念拉桑德的第一位先知雷斯特而命名的，他是一个年轻的盲人，在七个多世纪前的这一天被黎明的光芒治愈了失明。那个神圣的事件发生在银月城附近，但拉桑德长期以来在沃特迪普有一个更大的寺庙，并有相应的追随者。每位信徒都会穿上明亮的日出色调的服装，并将一只眼睛遮住，直到下一个黎明，以纪念雷斯特。如果你想让自己感觉像个本地人，那就吸引你看到的任何一个庆祝者的目光并眨眼。美好的友谊是从更少的地方成长起来的。",
	"The veil between this world and the faerie realm of the Feywild is thought to be weak on this day. Though this phenomenon provokes caution in rural areas (with folk avoiding woodlands, putting offerings of food on doorsteps, and the like), it is an occasion of much drinking, singing, and dancing in Waterdeep. The wealthy host elaborate masked balls, while poorer folk don costumes of their own make and travel door to door, gaining brief entry into the celebrations in exchange for performing a song or a short play. All adopt the guises of fey beings and the supposed rulers of the Feywild, such as Queen Titania, Oberon, and Hyrsam, the Prince of Fools. Those inclined to remain sullen in the face of such frivolity had best stay home, for celebrants do their utmost to evoke a smile from those they meet.": "人们认为在这一天，这个世界和精灵世界之间的面纱会变得脆弱。尽管这一现象在农村地区引起了人们的警惕（人们避开林地，在门前摆放食物等），但在沃特德普，这一天是一个喝酒、唱歌和跳舞的好时机。富裕的人举办精心设计的面具舞会，而贫穷的人则穿上自己制作的服装，挨家挨户地走访，通过表演一首歌或一出短剧来换取进入庆典的机会。所有的人都采用精灵生物和精灵世界的所谓统治者的伪装，如泰坦尼亚女王、奥伯伦和愚人王子海尔萨姆。那些倾向于在这种轻浮面前保持沉默的人最好呆在家里，因为庆祝者会尽最大努力唤起他们遇到的人的微笑。",
	"This festival celebrates the sea, maritime trade, and the gods of the sea, navigation, and weather. It spans the last tenday of Ches, and includes a series of boat races, the Shipwrights' Ball at the Shipwrights' House, and guild-sponsored galas at the Copper Cup festhall. According to custom, the winners of the various competitions don't keep their trophies and earnings, but deliver them to the priests of Umberlee at the Queenspire, her temple on the beach by the east entrance to the Great Harbor, at the conclusion of the festival.": "这个节日是为了庆祝海洋、海上贸易以及海神、航海和天气。它跨越了切斯的最后一个工作日，包括一系列的赛船活动，在船匠之家举行的船匠舞会，以及在铜杯宴会厅举行的公会赞助的晚会。根据习俗，各种比赛的获胜者并不保留他们的奖杯和收入，而是在节日结束时将它们交给女王陛下的祭司Umberlee，她的庙宇位于大港东入口的海滩上。",
	"The last two days of Fleetswake are the occasion of the Fair Seas Festival. During this time, there is much feasting on seafood, the harbor is strewn with flower petals, and City Guards go from tavern to tavern collecting offerings for Umberlee. Collection boxes also appear at large festival gatherings. Upon sunset of the final day, the collected coin is placed in chests and dumped into the deepest part of the harbor.": "Fleetswake的最后两天是公平海洋节的时机。在这期间，有很多海鲜大餐，港口散布着花瓣，城市卫队从一家酒馆到另一家酒馆为翁贝利收集祭品。募捐箱也出现在大型节日集会上。在最后一天的日落时分，收集到的硬币被放在箱子里，倾倒在港口的最深处。",
	"This festival has existed in a number of forms since the first trade-meets occurred here more than two millennia ago, and an uncountable amount of wealth remains sunken in what has long been known as Umberlee's Cache. The area is closely watched by merfolk guardians, whose standing orders are to kill anyone attempting to disturb it. Rumors abound that the chests have magical protections; one story tells of thieves who stole some of the collection years ago and tried to leave the city under false pretenses, only to see a squall spring up as soon as their ship left the harbor. A huge wave shaped like a hand swept the thieves overboard, but spared the ship and its crew.": "自从两千多年前在这里举行第一次贸易会议以来，这个节日一直以多种形式存在，而且在长期以来被称为Umberlee's Cache的地方还沉淀着难以计数的财富。该地区受到人鱼守护者的密切关注，他们的长期命令是杀死任何试图扰乱它的人。有一个故事说，多年前有一个盗贼偷了一些收藏品，并试图以虚假的名义离开城市，但当他们的船离开港口时，却看到一场暴风雨。一个像手一样的巨浪把盗贼们冲下了海，但船和船员们却幸免于难。",
	"This festival has long gathered a number of older holidays under one name, stretching those celebrations into a holiday season that lasts a tenday. Among the rituals in homage to the goddess of wealth and trade are these: {@b Caravance (Tarsahk 1}). This gift-giving holiday commemorates the traditional arrival of the first caravans of the season into the city. Many parents hide gifts for their offspring in their homes, telling the children that they were left by Old Carvas—a mythical peddler who arrived with the first caravan to reach Waterdeep, his wagon loaded down with toys for children to enjoy. {@b Goldenight (Tarsahk 5}). This festival celebrates coin and {@item gold|PHB}, with many businesses staying open all night, offering midnight sales and other promotions. Some celebrants and customers decorate themselves with gold dust and wear coins as jewelry. {@b Guildsmeet (Tarsahk 7}). On this holiday, guild members gather in their halls for the announcement of new policies and a celebration of business concluded for the year. These gatherings culminate in a gala festival and dance sponsored by several guilds, which lasts from dusk till dawn and overruns the Market, the Cynosure, the Field of Triumph, and all areas in between. {@b Leiruin (Tarsahk 10}). In times long past, Waukeen caught Leira, the goddess of illusions and deception, attempting to cheat her in a deal, and buried her under a mountain of molten gold as punishment. A commemoration of that event, Leiruin is the day for guild members to pay their annual dues and for guildmasters to meet with the Lords of Waterdeep and renew their charters for another year.": "这个节日长期以来将一些古老的节日集中在一个名称下，将这些庆祝活动延伸到一个持续一个星期的节日中。在向财富和贸易女神致敬的仪式中，有这些仪式。{@b Caravance (Tarsahk 1}). 这个赠送礼物的节日是为了纪念这个季节的第一批商队到达城市的传统。许多父母在家中为他们的后代藏起礼物，告诉孩子们这些礼物是由老卡瓦斯留下的--一个神话中的小贩，他随着第一个到达水底世界的商队来到这里，他的马车上装满了供孩子们享用的玩具。{@b Goldenight (Tarsahk 5}). 这个节日庆祝硬币和（%2%），许多商家整夜营业，提供午夜销售和其他促销活动。一些庆祝者和顾客用金粉装饰自己，并将硬币作为珠宝佩戴。{@b Guildsmeet (Tarsahk 7}). 在这个节日里，行会成员聚集在他们的大厅里，宣布新的政策，并庆祝这一年的业务结束。这些聚会的高潮是由几个行会赞助的盛大节日和舞蹈，从黄昏持续到黎明，并在市场、Cynosure、凯旋场和所有地区之间泛滥。{@b Leiruin (Tarsahk 10}). 在很久以前，沃基恩抓住了幻觉和欺骗的女神莱拉，试图在交易中欺骗她，并将她埋在熔金山下作为惩罚。作为对这一事件的纪念，Leiruin是公会成员缴纳年度会费的日子，也是公会会长与沃特德普领主会面并续签新一年特许状的日子。",
	"Rural areas around the city observe this holiday in the traditional sense of shared activities of plowing fields and moving (or \"running\") livestock. But within the city, the holiday is celebrated with a series of races. Foot, horse, and chariot races are run through courses in each ward, and the winners from each ward compete at the Field of Triumph. If you really want to see the wards come to life, this is the time. Pick your favorite, wear its colors, and cheer alongside its residents. Better yet, if you're of an adventuresome bent, register in your favored ward and compete! Who knows? Your name or visage might soon have a place in the House of Heroes.": "城市周围的农村地区以传统意义上的耕地和移动（或 \"跑\"）牲畜的共同活动来庆祝这个节日。但在城市里，这个节日是以一系列的比赛来庆祝的。徒步、骑马和战车比赛在每个区的赛道上进行，每个区的获胜者在凯旋场上进行比赛。如果你真的想看看各区的情况，现在就是时候了。挑选你喜欢的，穿上它的颜色，和它的居民一起欢呼。更好的是，如果你有冒险精神，在你喜欢的选区注册并参加比赛！谁知道呢？谁知道呢？你的名字或形象可能很快就会在英雄之家占有一席之地。",
	"On this day commemorating Waterdeep's victory in the Second Trollwar, children run through the city acting like trolls, banging on doors and growling, from highsun till dusk. Home and shop owners are expected to give the children candy, fruits, or small items. Those who give no treat can expect to become the target of a trick at sundown. This mischief typically takes the form of \"troll scratchings\" at doors and windows. Those with more malicious intent sing screechingly in the wee hours, and hurl raw eggs at windows, signs, and the heads of those who try to stop them. Have some candy on hand or some sweet rolls, and all will be calm where you live.": "在这一天，为了纪念沃特德普在第二次巨魔战争中的胜利，孩子们会像巨魔一样在城市中奔跑，敲打着门，咆哮着，从早到晚。家庭和商店的主人都会给孩子们糖果、水果或小物品。那些不给礼物的人可以期待在日落时分成为恶作剧的目标。这种恶作剧通常采取在门窗上 \"抓巨魔 \"的形式。那些怀有更多恶意的人在凌晨时分尖锐地唱歌，并向窗户、标志和那些试图阻止他们的人的头投掷生鸡蛋。准备一些糖果或甜面包，你住的地方就会很平静。",
	"This day is a time of trade fairs. Most shops are closed, and street sales are suspended for all but walking food peddlers. Guildhall Day celebrates the fruits of everyone's labor with revelations of new products, innovations, fashions, and signage extolling the extent and quality of guild members' services and wares. These offerings usually take the form of glittering displays, but guilds sometimes also sponsor brief plays or other hired entertainments (jugglers, singers, magic shows put on by hedge wizards and professional raconteurs) at which prizes or free samples are distributed. Many guilds try to recruit during this time. Guildhall Day is an excellent time to browse the city's merchandise-and it doesn't matter if you can't afford what you see, because you can't buy it that day anyway.": "这一天是交易会的时间。大多数商店都关闭了，除了步行的食品小贩外，所有的街道销售都暂停了。公会日庆祝每个人的劳动成果，展示新产品、创新、时尚，并打出招牌，颂扬公会成员的服务和商品的范围和质量。这些产品通常采取闪亮的展示形式，但行会有时也会赞助简短的戏剧或其他雇佣的娱乐活动（杂耍者、歌手、篱笆巫师和专业说书人的魔术表演），在这些活动中分发奖品或免费样品。许多行会试图在这段时间内招募人员。市政厅日是浏览城市商品的绝佳时机--如果你买不起你所看到的东西也不要紧，因为无论如何你都不能在那天买到它。",
	"This day in Kythorn is celebrated with bonfires and rituals to \"tame\" or \"drive down\" dragons. In Waterdeep, the celebrations take the form of parades that center around effigies built of wood and cloth and filled with straw. Each effigy is named and has a traditional depiction, for it represents one of a handful of dragons the city has faced in its history. After being paraded to a square near where the dragon was defeated or driven off, the enormous effigy is burned.": "在凯索恩，人们用篝火和 \"驯服 \"或 \"赶走 \"龙的仪式来庆祝这一天。在沃特迪普，庆祝活动采取游行的形式，围绕着用木头和布做的、装满稻草的塑像。每个雕像都被命名，并有一个传统的描述，因为它代表了这个城市在历史上所面对的少数几条龙之一。在游行到龙被打败或被赶走的地方附近的广场后，巨大的遗像被烧毁。",
	"The height of the celebration comes when the effigy of Kistarianth the Red is burned on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep. A dracolich version of Kistarianth is then carried up the slopes and burned as well. These proceedings symbolize the defeat of Kistarianth first by the paladin Athar, and again decades later by his son, Piergeiron. Tradition dictates that the winners of the races run during the Plowing and Running take the role of the dragons' slayers, with the champion of the chariot race representing Athar and the champion of the horse race playing Piergeiron.": "庆祝活动的高潮是在沃特德普山的山坡上焚烧红衣主教基斯塔里亚斯的遗像。然后，一个龙人版本的基斯塔里亚斯被抬上山坡，也被烧毁。这些程序象征着基斯塔里亚斯先是被圣骑士阿塔尔打败，几十年后又被他的儿子皮尔吉隆打败。传统上，在 \"耕耘和奔跑 \"期间，比赛的获胜者将扮演屠龙者的角色，战车比赛的冠军代表Athar，赛马比赛的冠军则扮演Piergeiron。",
	"This day commemorates the birth of the city. The Field of Triumph is the site of illusory displays that chronicle the history of Waterdeep, as well as martial exhibitions by the Guard and other worthies. Many festhalls sponsor Founders' Day costume contests, with prizes going to those who wear the best recreations of the garb of historical personages.": "这一天是为了纪念城市的诞生。凯旋场是记录沃特德普历史的虚幻展览的场所，也是卫队和其他贵族的武术表演的场所。许多宴会厅都会举办建城节服装比赛，那些穿着最能体现历史人物服装的人将获得奖品。",
	"Once banned as frivolous and distracting, the practice of veiling Castle Waterdeep with an illusion has been reinstated. Several mages come together to produce the effect, which seemingly transforms the castle into the ancient log fortress of Nimoar. The illusion typically lasts from midday to sunset (unless someone has the audacity and magical might to dispel it) and is regarded as a stunning work of magical art.": "曾经因为轻浮和分散注意力而被禁止的用幻象遮蔽沃特德普城堡的做法又被恢复了。几个法师一起产生这种效果，似乎把城堡变成了尼莫尔的古老原木堡垒。幻象通常从中午持续到日落（除非有人有胆量和魔法力量来驱散它），并被认为是一件令人惊叹的魔法艺术作品。",
	"Sornyn is a festival of both Waukeen and Lathander, and is used for planning business, making treaties and agreements, and receiving envoys from unknown lands and traditional foes. Much wine is drunk over this three-day occasion when, as the saying goes, \"My enemy is like family to me.\" If you are a newcomer to the city, this time is an excellent opportunity for you to engage with new partners in business or to gain financial support for some endeavor. My agreement to write Volo's Guide to Waterdeep was signed on a warm Sornyn evening many years ago, so who knows where your own initiative will take you?": "Sornyn是Waukeen和Lathander的节日，用于计划业务，签订条约和协议，以及接待来自未知土地和传统敌人的使节。在这个为期三天的节日里，人们会喝很多酒，正如俗话所说：\"我的敌人对我来说就像家人一样\"。如果你是一个新来的人，这段时间是一个极好的机会，让你与新的商业伙伴接触，或为一些努力获得财政支持。我写《沃特德普指南》的协议是在多年前一个温暖的索尔尼之夜签署的，所以谁知道你自己的主动性会把你带到哪里呢？",
	"Originally a celebration held only in Waterdeep, this holiday has since spread up and down the Sword Coast. It has received a recent boost in popularity from the custom started in Baldur's Gate of lighting celebratory smokepowder fireworks-all purchased from Felogyr's Fireworks of that city, and utilized only by the City Guard, of course. This nightlong festival honors the Lady of Joy with dances and balls throughout the city. Pink beverages, ranging from healthy juices to deadly strong intoxicants, are imbibed. The boom and crackle of smokepowder explosions go off all night long, so you might as well stay up with the locals and enjoy the show.": "这个节日最初只是在沃特迪普举行的庆祝活动，后来在剑海岸上下蔓延。最近，博德之门（Baldur's Gate）开始流行点燃庆祝烟火的习俗，所有的烟火都是从该城市的费洛吉尔烟火公司购买的，当然只有城市卫队才会使用。这个长达一夜的节日以整个城市的舞蹈和舞会来纪念欢乐女士。人们喝着粉红色的饮料，从健康的果汁到致命的烈性麻醉品，不一而足。烟火药爆炸的轰鸣声和噼啪声整晚都在响，所以你不妨和当地人一起熬夜，欣赏这场演出。",
	"Many small rituals are held throughout this day, dedicated to honoring the first Open Lord. The Lords of Waterdeep toast Ahghairon and the Watchful Order, and guildmasters toast the Lords in Ahghairon's name. Commoners leave violets (Ahghairon's favorite flower) around Ahghairon's Tower, on his statue in the City of the Dead, and atop the altars of the House of Wonder. Bards perform songs in honor of the wizard all over the city. The Open Lord visits taverns and inns throughout Waterdeep to wish the people well-giving short speeches, offering toasts to Ahghairon's memory, buying rounds of drinks, or paying for meals or accommodation. Needless to say, establishments of those sorts are generally full throughout the day.": "在这一天中会举行许多小型仪式，专门用来纪念第一位开放领主。沃特德普的领主们向阿海隆和守望团敬酒，公会会长们则以阿海隆的名义向领主们敬酒。普通人将紫罗兰（阿格海隆最喜欢的花）留在阿格海隆之塔周围，放在他在死亡之城的雕像上，以及奇迹之家祭坛的顶端。吟游诗人在城市各处表演歌曲以纪念这位巫师。开放领主拜访了整个沃特迪普的酒馆和旅店，向人们致以良好的祝愿--发表简短的演讲，为纪念阿格海隆而干杯，购买饮料，或支付餐费或住宿费。不用说，这类场所一般都是全天爆满。",
	"On this day, the City Guard, the City Navy, and the City Watch-all in glittering array-conduct parades, give demonstrations of martial skill, and stage mock battles. Those desiring to join their ranks are given a chance to demonstrate their prowess, usually with wooden practice weapons in contests against veteran soldiers. Makers and vendors of weapons sell their wares openly in the markets, experts who can hurl or juggle weapons show off their skills, and the wards compete in wrestling and boxing matches. The most anticipated part of the day is when horses are cleared from the Field of Triumph and the surrounding streets so that the Griffon Cavalry can perform aerial displays over the crowds in the stadium. Members of the Watchful Order present the cavalry with illusory foes to fight, allowing the griffon riders to engage in thrilling battles as the people watch.": "在这一天，城市卫队、城市海军和城市守卫--所有这些都是闪亮的阵列--进行巡游，展示武术技能，并进行模拟战斗。那些希望加入他们行列的人有机会展示他们的能力，通常是用木制的练习武器与老兵进行比赛。武器制造商和供应商在市场上公开出售他们的产品，能够投掷或变戏法的专家展示他们的技能，而被监护人则在摔跤和拳击比赛中竞争。这一天最令人期待的部分是将马匹从凯旋场和周围的街道上清理出来，以便狮鹫骑兵能够在体育场内的人群上空进行空中表演。警戒团的成员为骑兵们提供虚幻的敌人，让狮鹫骑手在人们的注视下进行惊心动魄的战斗。",
	"The imaginative inventions of the Gondar are revealed on this day and paraded through the city. These devices range from something as humble as new cabinet hinges to massive mechanical constructs that walk or roll about. Failure is the paramour of invention, though, meaning it is a rare year when there isn't some notable disruption of the celebration. The flying chair of Marchell was one such recent oddity-a device that worked marvelously on the way up but was incapable of descending. Marchell was rescued by the Griffon Cavalry, but his flying chair drifted away and was never seen again.": "在这一天，贡达人富有想象力的发明被展示出来，并在城市中游行。这些设备的范围很广，从新的橱柜铰链这样简陋的东西到可以行走或滚动的巨大机械结构。不过，失败是发明的姘头，这意味着很少有一年没有出现一些值得注意的破坏庆祝活动的情况。马切尔的飞椅就是这样一个最近出现的怪胎--一个在上升过程中工作得很好，但却无法下降的装置。马切尔被狮鹫骑兵队救了下来，但他的飞椅却飘走了，再也没有人看到。",
	"Stoneshar is an all-faiths day during which folk strive not to be idle. Even children at play are encouraged to dig holes, build sand castles, or construct crude models.": "Stoneshar是一个全信仰的日子，在这一天里，人们都努力不让自己闲着。即使是正在玩耍的儿童也被鼓励挖洞，建造沙堡，或建造粗糙的模型。",
	"Waterdavians consider Stoneshar the best day of the year to begin construction of a building, either by digging out a cellar or laying a foundation. The common wisdom is that folk who undertake new projects on Stoneshar can expect blessings upon their works in the coming year, whereas individuals who do nothing constructive on this day can expect all manner of misfortune to rain down on them in the year ahead.": "Waterdavians认为Stoneshar是一年中开始建造建筑物的最佳日子，无论是挖地窖还是打地基。普遍的看法是，在Stoneshar进行新项目的人可以期待他们的作品在来年得到祝福，而在这一天不做任何有建设性的事情的人可以期待在来年有各种不幸的事情发生。",
	"Swift on the heels of Stoneshar comes the Reign of Misrule. This day honors Beshaba, goddess of misfortune. People of the city are expected to break trust, belie oaths, and disobey the normal order-as long as no laws are actually broken and no rift is made that can't be later bridged. During the Reign of Misrule, nobles serve meals to their servants, children take control of schools, priests give worship to their god's foes, and any who wish to may participate in a guild's trade. Pranks are played by and on many, from simple tricks to those requiring elaborate planning. Sundown brings an end to the festivities, and most folk spend much of the night cleaning and reordering things for the following day. Many visitors decline to participate, but doing so often inspires misfortune rather than avoiding it. For fear of catching the bad luck of cynics, citizens do their best to avoid talking to anyone known to not have played along, or dealing with them in any way until Gods' Day.": "紧随斯通斯哈之后的是不幸的统治（Reign of Misrule）。这一天是为了纪念Beshaba，不幸的女神。城里的人们被期望打破信任，违背誓言，不服从正常的秩序--只要没有真正违反法律，也没有造成后来无法弥补的裂痕。在误治时期，贵族们为他们的仆人送饭，孩子们控制着学校，牧师们对他们的神的敌人进行崇拜，任何愿意参与的人都可以参加公会的贸易。许多人都在玩恶作剧，从简单的把戏到需要精心策划的恶作剧。日落时分，庆祝活动结束，大多数人在夜里打扫卫生，为第二天的工作重新安排事项。许多游客拒绝参加，但这样做往往会激发不幸，而不是避开它。由于害怕染上愤世嫉俗的坏运气，市民们尽最大努力避免与任何已知没有参与的人交谈，或以任何方式与他们打交道，直到诸神节。",
	"This holiday observes the anniversary of the end of the Godswar in 1358 DR, when the gods of Faerûn returned to the heavens. Private shrines are brought out into the open, and many people wear holy symbols of their favored deities. A Gods' Day tradition in Waterdeep strictly limits the use of magic, in remembrance of the wild magic wrought during the Time of Troubles. Though not outlawed fully, spellcasting is allowable only in self-defense or in cases of extreme need.": "这个节日是为了纪念公元1358年神战结束的周年纪念日，当时法鲁恩的诸神回到了天国。私人神龛被搬到户外，许多人都佩戴着他们所喜爱的神灵的神圣标志。沃特德普的诸神节传统严格限制魔法的使用，以纪念动乱时期的疯狂魔法。虽然没有完全被取缔，但只有在自卫或极端需要的情况下才允许使用法术。",
	"At night, this holiday becomes solemn and serious, as many Waterdavians offer prayers in thanks for the lives they have under their gods. The Griffon Cavalry sets up an immense bonfire at the peak of Mount Waterdeep, honoring the fallen and the risen gods Myrkul, Cyric, Kelemvor, Mystra, Helm, and Ao who appeared here. In thanks for their defense during Myrkul's invasion and the resulting fires that raged through the Southern, Dock, and Castle Wards, Gods' Day is also a semiofficial \"Be Kind to the Guard and Watch Day\" in Waterdeep. Feel free to participate by handing out small gifts and kind words, but be aware that any gift of greater value than a few nibs might be interpreted as a bribe.": "到了晚上，这个节日变得庄严而严肃，因为许多水底人为他们在神灵下的生活提供了祈祷，以示感谢。狮鹫骑兵在沃特德普山的山顶燃起了巨大的篝火，纪念在此出现的陨落和复活的神明米尔库尔、西瑞克、凯勒莫、米斯特拉、赫尔姆和阿奥。为了感谢他们在米尔库尔入侵期间的防御，以及由此产生的肆虐于南部、码头和城堡的大火，诸神之日也是沃特德普半官方的 \"善待守卫和观察日\"。你可以通过发放小礼物和善意的话语来参与，但要注意，任何比几个笔尖更有价值的礼物都可能被理解为贿赂。",
	"This holy day pays tribute to Leira and Mask. To placate those deities and ward away their attention, folk of all walks of life don masks and costumes (magical or mundane) to disguise themselves and play at being other than what they are. Commonly seen mask styles include the black mask symbol of Mask and the mirror face of the priests of Leira. But there are no bounds on the disguise you don, and the more elaborate and outlandish it is, the more celebrated the wearer.": "这个神圣的日子是向莱拉和面具致敬。为了安抚这些神灵，避开他们的注意，各行各业的人都戴上面具和服装（魔法的或世俗的）来伪装自己，扮演自己以外的角色。常见的面具样式包括象征面具的黑色面具和莱拉祭司的镜面。但是，你的伪装是没有界限的，而且越是精心设计和离奇，佩戴者就越是值得庆祝。",
	"The festivities begin in the evening, when people place candles in hollowed-out gourds or pumpkins carved with faces. Each pumpkin represents a person donning a mask, while the light inside represents the truth of the soul. For as long as the candle remains lit, lies told and embarrassing things done don't sully a person's reputation, so celebrations often descend briefly into anarchic hedonism.": "庆祝活动在晚上开始，人们将蜡烛放在挖空的葫芦或刻有脸孔的南瓜中。每个南瓜代表一个戴着面具的人，而里面的光代表灵魂的真相。只要蜡烛不灭，所讲的谎言和所做的尴尬事就不会玷污一个人的声誉，所以庆祝活动往往会短暂地陷入无政府的享乐主义。",
	"Misfortune is said to come to anyone who returns to their pumpkin after celebrating to find it unlit, so buy a candle of good quality and put your gourd beyond reach of the wind. Intentionally blowing out someone else's candle or smashing someone else's pumpkin is taboo, and risks the wrath of both gods-yet it does occur.": "据说任何在庆祝之后回到自己的南瓜旁发现它没有被点燃的人都会遭遇不幸，所以要买一支质量好的蜡烛，并把你的葫芦放在风的范围之外。故意吹灭别人的蜡烛或打碎别人的南瓜是禁忌，有可能引起两位神的愤怒--但这种情况确实存在。",
	"Tricks and pranks of all kinds are common on this night, and folk expect lies and foolishness. Pickpockets are rife on this day, so few carry much coin with them, having secreted it away somewhere the previous evening. Instead, people fill their pockets and belt pouches with candies. Traditionally, a pickpocket is meant to take the candy and leave a token in return (a tiny toy, a colorful paper folded into a shape, or the like), but this has changed over the years into adults exchanging candies among themselves and simply giving candy to children who ask for it.": "在这天晚上，各种诡计和恶作剧都很常见，人们期待着谎言和愚弄。扒手在这一天很猖獗，所以很少有人会带很多硬币，因为他们在前一天晚上就把硬币藏在某个地方了。相反，人们在口袋和腰包里装满糖果。传统上，扒手要拿走糖果，并留下一个信物作为回报（一个小玩具，一张折成形状的彩色纸，或类似的东西），但多年来，这种做法已经变成了成年人之间交换糖果，并简单地将糖果送给要求得到它的孩子。",
	"By custom, no deals are made nor contracts signed on Liar's Night, because no one trusts that parties will abide by them. Illusionists and stage magicians (whether through magical or practical abilities) make the rounds to entertain private parties (having been paid in advance the previous day) or to perform in public spaces, in the hopes that a good show will earn them a meal, and perhaps a place at a private party in the future.": "按照惯例，骗子之夜不做交易，也不签合同，因为没有人相信当事人会遵守合同。幻术师和舞台魔术师（不管是通过魔法还是实践能力）都会去招待私人聚会（前一天已经提前支付）或在公共场所表演，希望一场好的表演能为他们赢得一顿饭，也许在未来的私人聚会上有一席之地。",
	"On whatever night in Uktar the moon is fullest, Waterdavians celebrate Selûne's Hallowing. The goddess is the focus of worship throughout the full phase, of course, but the major ceremony on this night is a parade of worshipers leaving the House of the Moon at moonrise and moving down to the harbor, where the high priestess wields the Wand of the Four Moons in a ceremony blessing all navigators. This holy relic is said to be the mace wielded by Selûne in her first battle against Shar, and again in a fight with her sister during the Time of Troubles. It miraculously appeared in Waterdeep after the Godswar, and has since been the focus of many divine signs. You can view it in the House of the Moon at other times of the year, but only from a well-guarded distance.": "在乌克塔尔月亮最圆的任何一个夜晚，沃特达维亚人都会庆祝塞鲁恩的圣礼。当然，在整个满月阶段，女神都是崇拜的重点，但这天晚上的主要仪式是崇拜者在月出时离开月亮之家，游行到港口，在那里，大祭司在祝福所有航海者的仪式中挥舞四个月亮的魔杖。这个神圣的遗物据说是塞卢恩在与沙尔的第一场战斗中挥舞的法杖，以及在动乱时期与她妹妹的战斗中再次挥舞的法杖。它在神战后奇迹般地出现在沃特迪普，此后成为许多神迹的焦点。在一年中的其他时间，你可以在月亮之家看到它，但只能在一个很好的防护距离内。",
	"If you're lucky, you might see the Wand of the Four Moons weep. Droplets said to be the tears of Selûne manifest on the mace from time to time, and are collected by the priestesses for use in potions that can heal, cure lycanthropy, and be used as holy water.": "如果你幸运的话，你可能会看到 \"四个月亮的魔杖 \"流泪。据称是塞鲁恩的眼泪的水滴不时出现在魔杖上，并被女祭司收集起来，用于制作可以治疗、治愈狼人的药水，并作为圣水使用。",
	"Sometimes called \"The Small Feast,\" this day of residential feasting is held in celebration of the year's bounty. Small gifts (traditionally hand kegs of ale, jars of preserves, or smoked fish and meats) are exchanged among neighbors, and \"last letters\" are gathered for carriage by ship captains and caravan merchants-so called because they are the last to leave the city before travel becomes difficult. Of Waterdeep's many celebrations, this one is perhaps the most relaxed and relaxing. Plan to spend a little extra on good food and enjoy a meal with those nearest you, be they dearest hearts or the folk across the hall in the inn.": "有时也被称为 \"小宴\"，这一天的居民宴会是为了庆祝一年的丰收而举行的。邻居之间会交换小礼物（传统上是手摇啤酒桶、罐装蜜饯或熏鱼和肉），\"最后的信件 \"会被船长和商队商人收集起来运走--之所以这么叫是因为他们是旅行变得困难之前最后离开城市的人。在沃特德普的众多庆祝活动中，这个庆祝活动可能是最轻松和最惬意的。计划在美食上多花一点钱，和你最亲近的人一起享受美食，不管是最亲爱的人还是旅店对面的人。",
	"In honor of Malar, members of the City Guard leave the city in groups on this day to hunt down known threats to farmers and travelers, including brigands, {@creature wolf||wolves}, {@creature owlbear||owlbears}, {@creature ogre||ogres}, and trolls that haunt the roads and wilderness. These hunts typically last no longer than a tenday. During the same span of time, the City Watch engages in its own rigorous hunt for malefactors within the city walls. If you've any reason to doubt your standing in the eyes of the law, avoid Waterdeep for at least a tenday after Howldown.": "为了纪念马拉尔，城市卫队成员在这一天分批离开城市，去追捕已知的对农民和旅行者的威胁，包括强盗、{@creature wolf||wolves}、{@creature owlbear||owlbears}、{@creature ogre||ogres}，以及在道路和荒野上出没的巨魔。这些狩猎通常不超过一个工作日。在同一时间段内，城市守望者也会在城墙内对恶棍进行严格的追捕。如果你有任何理由怀疑自己在法律面前的地位，请在嚎叫之后的至少一个工作日内避开沃特迪普。",
	"With no real hunting to do of their own, the children of Waterdeep spend Howldown engaging in mock hunts of adults dressed up as monsters, and play at the killing of these predators.": "由于没有真正的狩猎活动，水底世界的孩子们在Howldown进行模拟狩猎，把成年人打扮成怪物，玩弄于股掌之间。",
	"When dusk comes on this day, folk go outside to locate particular stars that were lucky for their ancestors, or that were associated with their own births. They then attempt to stay up through the night, celebrating outside with bonfires, song, and warmed drinks. Cloudy nights often draw larger crowds than clear ones, since glimpsing your star through the haze is thought to be a blessing from Tymora. Inside buildings, service folk keep roaring fires and engage in making food to keep celebrants fed throughout the long night and into morning of the next day. If you have no particular star of your own, you'll find many vendors of star maps willing to divine which is yours-based upon your place and date of birth-and to point you in the right direction for a shard or two.": "当这一天的黄昏到来时，人们到外面去寻找那些对他们的祖先来说是幸运的，或者与他们自己的出生有关的特定星星。然后他们试图整夜不睡，在外面用篝火、歌曲和热饮来庆祝。多云的夜晚往往比晴朗的夜晚吸引更多的人群，因为透过雾霾瞥见你的星星被认为是来自泰莫拉的祝福。在建筑物内，服务人员会生起熊熊大火，并制作食物，让庆祝者在漫长的夜晚和第二天的早晨吃饱。如果你没有自己的特定星星，你会发现许多卖星图的人愿意根据你的地点和出生日期来占卜哪个是你的，并为你指出正确的方向以获得一两块碎片。",
	"Well, gentle readers, you've reached the end of my enchiridion. If you've yet to arrive in the city, its splendors await you.

	"The {@creature Black Viper|wdh} was a notorious burglar, pickpocket, mugger, and assassin who died a century ago, after a long and nefarious career. Esvele Rosznar, a brash young noble, has recently adopted the {@creature Black Viper|WDH}'s persona to lead a secret life of crime.

	"The Rosznar family was convicted of slave trading-highly illegal in Waterdeep-and banished over a hundred years ago, but has since returned. The Rosznars' inability to regain the respect they feel they deserve rankles them. The slave trade has continued in Amn and elsewhere, and it's not like other noble houses don't have skeletons in their closets. But just because of a little family squabble that went public, the Rosznar name has been said with a sneer for a century. As part of the family's constant effort to prove this conception wrong and win others' respect, Esvele has been brought up to be the most proper noble possible, partaking in lessons of etiquette, dance, and poise as befits someone of her station.": "罗斯纳家族曾因贩卖奴隶而被定罪--这在沃特迪普是非常非法的--一百多年前被放逐，但后来又回来了。罗斯纳家族无法重新获得他们认为自己应得的尊重，这让他们感到愤怒。奴隶贸易在安恩和其他地方一直在继续，而且其他贵族家族也不是没有人在他们的衣橱里藏着骷髅。但就因为一场公开的家族小争吵，罗斯纳这个名字在一个世纪以来一直被人嗤之以鼻。作为家族不断努力证明这种观念是错误的，并赢得别人的尊重的一部分，埃斯维尔一直被培养成最合适的贵族，参加礼仪、舞蹈以及与她的地位相称的姿态课程。",
	"In her younger days, Esvele openly rebelled, but that behavior led to locked doors at night and house guards watching her every move during the day.": "在她年轻的时候，埃斯韦尔公开反抗，但这种行为导致她在晚上被锁上了门，白天有房屋警卫看着她的一举一动。",
	"So she taught herself how to pick locks, pluck keys from belts and pouches, clamber up walls, and sneak past guards-playing the perfect daughter by day while cutting loose at night. To hide her identity from those she met, she wore a hood and mask, exchanging her fine clothes for the kind of practical clothing her parents would never let her wear.": "因此，她自学了如何开锁，从腰带和袋子里拔出钥匙，爬上墙，偷偷摸摸地躲过守卫--白天扮演一个完美的女儿，晚上则放纵自己。为了向她遇到的人隐藏自己的身份，她戴着头罩和面具，把她的漂亮衣服换成她父母不让她穿的那种实用衣服。",
	"One of the things Esvele has learned is to embrace the legend of the {@creature Black Viper|WDH}.
