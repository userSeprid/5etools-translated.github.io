	"Welcome to Restoring Harmony, the final chapter of a Dungeons & Dragons adventure series in collaboration with the tasty and colorful world of NERDS.": "欢迎来到《恢复和谐》，这是《龙与地下城》冒险系列的最后一章，与美味而多彩的NERDS世界合作。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition Basic Rules for D&D, which is available to download for free here.": "要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版《D&D基本规则》，可以在这里免费下载。",
	"Adventure Together takes approximately 60-90 minutes to play. Before you play this adventure, have your players level up their NERDS adventurers to level 3.": "一起冒险》大约需要60-90分钟的时间来玩。在你玩这个冒险之前，让你的玩家把他们的NERDS冒险家的等级提高到3级。",
	"The previous mini-adventures are:": "以前的小型冒险是。",
	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} the beholder and his hired muscle, {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} and {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "一直以来，嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}的看客和他的雇佣兵，{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}，对NERDS心爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，在获得了棱镜井之后，（2%）和（3%）已经开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑白的。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。",
	"But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。守望者协会知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但是一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Now that there are multiple characters in this adventure, there's less chance of a TPK (total party kill), and the game can continue even if one character is killed. However, in D&D, the possibility of killing player characters is an issue best dealt with up front by having a chat with your players. Some players love the tension of knowing that their characters could die, and they embrace the strategic challenge. Other players loathe the idea their character could die. Knowing what your players enjoy is the key to having a fun session of D&D.": "现在这个冒险中有多个角色，发生TPK（全军覆没）的机会就少了，即使有一个角色被杀，游戏也可以继续进行。然而，在D&D中，杀死玩家角色的可能性是一个最好的问题，可以通过与你的玩家进行交谈来预先处理。有些玩家喜欢知道他们的角色可能死亡的紧张感，他们接受这种战略挑战。其他玩家则厌恶他们的角色可能死亡的想法。了解你的玩家喜欢什么，是获得有趣的D&D会议的关键。",
	"For players who don't like the idea of their character dying—or who just enjoy roleplaying—it's good to always present options other than combat, such as making friends with the monster or tricking the monster. With any of the encounters in this adventure, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "对于那些不喜欢自己的角色死亡的玩家来说，或者只是喜欢角色扮演的玩家来说，最好总是提出战斗以外的选择，比如与怪物交朋友或者欺骗怪物。对于这次冒险中的任何一个遭遇，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗以外的选择。",
	"You may also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes for clever ideas, letting monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更加仁慈，允许聪明的想法自动成功，让怪物瞬间成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"After a meeting with Mr. Honeycutt, the adventurers all realize the stakes—Harmony and all of its colors are in their hands! Mr. Honeycutt gives them the Amulet of Harmony to help them find the location of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}. The amulet leads them to the winding passageways within Mystery Mountain. Ultimately, they have a showdown with the brutish {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} and his melancholy partner, {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}.": "在与霍尼卡特先生会面后，冒险家们都意识到了其中的利害关系--和谐及其所有的颜色都在他们手中！霍尼卡特先生给了他们一个和谐的护身符，以帮助他们找到（%0%）的位置。霍尼卡特先生给了他们和谐护身符，帮助他们找到{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的位置。护身符将他们引向神秘山内蜿蜒的通道。最终，他们与野蛮的（1%）和他忧郁的伙伴（2%）进行了决斗。",
	"The party must defeat {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} and help {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} find a home and friends. Then they can use the amulet to restore the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} to full power and head back to Harmony as heroes of the land!": "党必须打败（%0%），并帮助（%1%）找到家和朋友。然后，他们就可以用护身符将{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的力量恢复到全盛时期，并作为土地的英雄回到和谐世界!",
	"The intent of the final adventure is to feature all six NERDS and have them experience the power of collaboration. If there are fewer players at the table than there are NERDS characters, the missing characters can be NPCs run by you or some of the players.": "最后一次冒险的意图是让所有六个NERDS都出场，让他们体验合作的力量。如果桌子上的玩家少于NERDS的角色，缺少的角色可以是由你或一些玩家经营的NPC。",
	"Give the character sheets of all six NERDS to your players and let them familiarize themselves with their characters.": "把所有六个NERDS的角色表交给玩家，让他们熟悉自己的角色。",
	"All creatures or NPCs that are bolded have stat blocks, which are included at the end of the adventure along with any magic items the characters can earn.": "所有被加粗的生物或NPC都有状态块，这些状态块和人物可以获得的任何魔法物品一起包含在冒险结束时。",
	"Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "每当你们都准备好了，你们就可以开始治疗了。",
	"The city of Harmony is a vibrant metropolis that has been experiencing a strange case of \"color outages\" for weeks. Rumors fly around about what might be causing the problem and the citizens of Harmony are growing increasingly worried as the color vanishes from the environment.": "和谐市是一个充满活力的大都市，几周来一直经历着 \"颜色中断 \"的奇怪情况。关于什么原因可能导致这个问题的谣言满天飞，随着颜色从环境中消失，和谐城的市民越来越担心。",
	"Six daring NERDS have been hired by Mr. Honeycutt to help the secret order known as the Lorekeeper Society to retrieve six magic gemstones known as the Gems of Power. The NERDS are now gathered together at Mr. Honeycutt's secret hideout, hidden under the Sweet Spot candy store, to activate the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}.": "六个大胆的NERDS受雇于Honeycutt先生，帮助被称为Lorekeeper Society的秘密组织找回六颗被称为 \"力量宝石 \"的神奇宝石。NERDS现在聚集在Honeycutt先生的秘密藏身处，藏在Sweet Spot糖果店下面，以激活{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}。",
	"The heroes and Mr. Honeycutt are assembled underneath Mr. Honeycutt's candy shop, the Sweet Spot. After his job at the Library is done, Mr. Honeycutt opens the doors of his sweetshop to delight the populace with his tasty confections—but now his colorful sweets seem dull in the shop window as the world of Harmony fades to dismal gray.": "英雄们和Honeycutt先生在Honeycutt先生的糖果店 \"甜蜜点 \"下面集合。在图书馆的工作结束后，霍尼卡特先生打开了他的糖果店的大门，用他的美味糖果取悦民众--但现在他五颜六色的糖果在商店的橱窗里显得黯淡无光，因为和谐的世界渐渐变成了凄凉的灰色。",
	"Read or paraphrase the following:": "阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"You all have answered the summons of the Lorekeeper Society and are now underneath the Sweet Spot candy shop, in a small room where Mr. Honeycutt has his secret hideout. The delicious scents of fruit, vanilla, and chocolate mingle together with leather-bound books and cedarwood. You are all standing around a high table, lit by an oil lamp. The six Gems of Power are laid out on a velvet cloth, glittering in the lamplight. Mr. Honeycutt has a serious look on his face as he pulls out an ornately carved wood box, sets it on the table and says, \"In this box is the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}.\"": "你们都已经响应了守望者协会的召唤，现在在甜点糖果店的下面，在一个小房间里，哈尼卡特先生有他的秘密藏身处。水果、香草和巧克力的美味气味与皮革装订的书籍和雪松木混合在一起。你们都站在一张高桌子周围，由一盏油灯照亮。六颗权力宝石被摆放在天鹅绒布上，在灯下闪闪发光。哈尼卡特先生脸上带着严肃的表情，他拿出一个雕刻华丽的木盒，放在桌子上，说：\"这个盒子里是（%0%）。\"",
	"Mr. Honeycutt explains that he doesn't know what's going to happen when he opens the box and puts the gems in the amulet—all the old records have been lost or destroyed. He asks Yellow the Cleric and the Purple the Wizard if they have any ideas of how best to proceed with restoring this magic item. He also asks the group to discuss which of them will attune to the amulet and use its power.": "霍尼科特先生解释说，他不知道当他打开盒子并把宝石放进护身符时会发生什么--所有的旧记录都已丢失或被毁。他问牧师Yellow和巫师Purple，他们是否有任何关于如何最好地恢复这个魔法物品的想法。他还要求大家讨论他们中的哪一位将与护身符相适应并使用其力量。",
	"When everyone is ready, Mr. Honeycutt (or whoever volunteers) opens the box. Instantly, the Gems of Power all leap into their settings on the amulet, resizing themselves until they are each about the size of a thumbnail. The amulet softly glows.": "当所有人都准备好后，霍尼卡特先生（或任何自愿者）打开盒子。瞬间，力量宝石都跃入护身符上的设置，调整自己的大小，直到它们都有拇指甲那么大。护身符发出柔和的光芒。",
	"Mr. Honeycutt then explains that whoever attunes the amulet, must be the one to invoke the power of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}. To invoke the power of the well, the character attuned to the amulet must be within 10-feet of the well and say, \"I invoke the power of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} and restore the colors of Harmony for all.\"": "然后，Honeycutt先生解释说，无论谁调整了护身符，都必须是调用（%0%）的力量。要调用井的力量，与护身符相配的人物必须在井的10英尺范围内，并说：\"我调用{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的力量，为所有人恢复和谐的色彩。\"",
	"After one of the characters attunes the amulet, they begin to feel a pull, an urge to move in a certain direction. Honeycutt explains that this amulet knows the location of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} and will lead the character right to its location. When the party goes outside, they see Mystery Mountain in the distance and the character who is attuned to the amulet can sense that the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} is within the mountain. If the character tells Mr. Honeycutt this, he takes off his glasses and says, \"So, Mystery Mountain! I knew it!\"": "在其中一个角色调整了护身符后，他们开始感觉到一种拉力，一种向某个方向移动的冲动。霍尼卡特解释说，这个护身符知道{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}的位置，并会引导角色直接到达它的位置。当一行人走到外面时，他们会看到远处的神秘山，而与护身符相适应的人物可以感觉到（1%）就在山里。如果这个人物把这个消息告诉了Honeycutt先生，他就会摘下眼镜说：\"那么，神秘山! 我就知道！\"",
	"Mr. Honeycutt gives each character a {@item potion of healing} and wishes them all the best on their quest. He would come with them, but he is working with the Lorekeeper Society on a spell to help the citizens who are dealing with the increasing lack of color in the city.": "霍尼卡特先生给了每个角色一个{@item potion of healing}，并祝愿他们在探索过程中一切顺利。他本想和他们一起去，但他正在和洛尔守护者协会一起研究一个法术，以帮助那些正在处理城市中越来越缺乏色彩的市民。",
	"The trail to Mystery Mountain is a long hike up into the misty, tree-covered hills outside of Harmony. The {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} pulls its bearer ever closer to the steep granite sides of the mountain that looms above them.": "通往神秘山的小路是一条漫长的徒步旅行，进入和谐城外雾气缭绕、树木丛生的山丘。{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}拉着它的携带者越来越接近那座在他们上方隐约可见的陡峭的花岗岩山体。",
	"The journey can be uneventful, or you can introduce one or both of the following encounters.": "旅程可以是平淡无奇的，或者你可以引入以下一种或两种遭遇。",
	"The party hears a strange sound that Red the Ranger identifies as the hoot-roars of an owlbear. If they investigate, the party sees that a mother {@creature owlbear} is calling to her two cublets who have fallen into a crevasse. The owlbear has no interest in attacking the party, only rescuing her cubs.": "队伍听到了一种奇怪的声音，游侠Red认为这是猫头鹰熊的叫声。如果他们进行调查，就会发现一只母熊（%0%）正在呼唤它的两只掉进裂缝的幼崽。这只猫头鹰熊没有兴趣攻击他们，只是想救出她的幼崽。",
	"However, if the characters try to help, the protective mother owlbear attacks the party unless one of the characters succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check. On a failure, no one can approach the owlbear cublets without being attacked by the mother. Each character can only attempt the check once.": "然而，如果这些角色试图帮忙，保护性的猫头鹰母熊会攻击他们，除非其中一个角色在DC15智慧（（%0%））检查中成功。如果失败，没有人可以接近猫头鹰幼崽而不被母熊攻击。每个角色只能尝试检查一次。",
	"The crevasse is small, making the climb difficult, but a character who succeeds on a DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check can wriggle down and get the cublets back up to safety with their grateful mother.": "这条裂缝很小，爬起来很困难，但如果一个角色在DC14力量({@skill Athletics})检查中成功，就可以挣扎着爬下去，把小熊和它们感激的母亲一起带回安全地带。",
	"If your players are spoiling for a fight, you can have the party be ambushed by eight {@creature skeleton||skeletons} that erupt out of the ground as the characters trek up the mountainside.": "如果你的玩家渴望战斗，你可以让他们在人物跋涉到山坡上时，被八个（%0%）从地下爆发出来的伏击。",
	"The interior of Mystery Mountain is a series of roughly carved tunnels. They have the following properties unless otherwise noted:": "神秘山的内部是一系列粗雕细琢的隧道。除非另有说明，否则它们具有以下特性。",
	"The tunnels and caves contain no light sources.": "隧道和洞穴中没有光源。",
	"The passages are 10 feet wide and tall, with ceilings that are roughly 20 feet high.": "通道有10英尺宽和高，天花板大约有20英尺高。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the Mystery Mountain map:": "以下地点是以神秘山地图为关键。",
	"The entrance to Mystery Mountain is hidden behind the exposed roots of a tree that sits over the door. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) roll finds the door in under five minutes. On a failure, the party must search for half an hour before discovering the door and has a 50% chance of encountering six {@creature skeleton||skeletons} on patrol for {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}. Whoever is attuned to the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT} has advantage on the check to notice the door.": "神秘山的入口隐藏在一棵树的裸露根部后面，这棵树就在门的上方。一个角色如果在DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）卷中成功，可以在5分钟内找到这扇门。如果失败，队伍必须搜索半小时才能发现这扇门，并且有50%的机会遇到六个{@creature skeleton||skeletons}在巡逻的{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}。与{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}相适应的人在注意到这扇门的检查中具有优势。",
	"Behind the roots, the entrance is carved into the granite cliff. There are lightning bolts carved into the granite door, and it has a keyhole but no handle.": "在树根后面，入口被刻在花岗岩悬崖上。花岗岩门上刻有闪电，门上有一个钥匙孔，但没有把手。",
	"The key to the door is in {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s pocket, so the lock must be picked with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. On a failure, the character who attempted to pick the lock takes 6 ({@damage 1d12}) lightning damage and is pushed back 5 feet.": "门的钥匙在{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的口袋里，所以必须用DC15的灵巧({@skill Sleight of Hand})检查成功来撬锁。如果失败，试图撬锁的角色会受到6({@damage 1d12})的雷电伤害，并被推后5英尺。",
	"Once the door is open, the party can see a cobweb-filled tunnel leading into the darkness of Mystery Mountain.": "门一打开，一行人就能看到一条布满蜘蛛网的隧道，通向神秘山的黑暗。",
	"A noxious-smelling gas fills the tunnel ahead of this cave with hazy greenish smoke. The gas extinguishes any non-magical light. A creature that enters the gas must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage and become {@condition blinded} for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition blinded}. A {@condition blinded} creature can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the blindness on a success. If another creature makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Medicine}) check, the {@condition blinded} creature makes their next Constitution save with advantage.": "一种恶臭的气体使这个洞穴前方的隧道充满了朦胧的绿色烟雾。这种气体会熄灭任何非魔法的光线。进入该气体的生物必须进行DC13宪法救赎，否则会受到7({@damage 2d6})的中毒伤害，并在1分钟内变成{@condition blinded}。拯救成功后，生物会受到一半的伤害，并且不会变成{@condition blinded}。一个{@condition blinded}的生物可以在它的每个回合结束时做一个DC15的宪法救赎，如果成功则结束失明。如果另一个生物成功地进行了DC12智力（（%4%））检查，（%5%）的生物会在下一次宪法救赎中获得优势。",
	"The gas is coming from a 4-foot-square wooden box sitting on a table in the center of the room. The box has five wooden levers on its side. On the box is a brass plaque that says, \"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s Gaseous Box.\"": "气体来自一个4英尺见方的木箱，放在房间中央的桌子上。盒子的侧面有五个木制杠杆。盒子上有一个铜牌，上面写着：\"（%%）的气体盒子\"。",
	"If the correct lever is pulled, the gas stops coming from the box, and it takes about 5 minutes to dissipate from the area.": "如果拉动正确的杠杆，气体就会停止从盒子里出来，大约需要5分钟才能从这里消散。",
	"If an incorrect lever is pulled or the box takes more than 5 points of damage, it explodes. Each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 ({@damage 2d6}) piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.": "如果拉错了杆子或者盒子受到超过5点的伤害，它就会爆炸。15英尺范围内的每个生物都必须做一个DC12的灵巧救赎，救赎失败时受到7({@damage 2d6})的穿刺伤害，救赎成功时受到一半的伤害。",
	"If a character attempts to guess the correct lever, roll a {@dice d10}. On a 1 or 2, they guess correctly and the gas stops.": "如果一个角色试图猜出正确的杠杆，请掷出（%0%）。在1或2时，他们猜对了，气体就会停止。",
	"A character can also try to deduce which lever is the correct one by checking the wear and tear on the handles. If a player says that this is what their character is looking for, then have their character make a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check with advantage. On a success, they see the wear on the correct lever. On a failure, they can still guess, but the odds are in their favor, so a roll of 1–5 gives them the correct choice.": "角色也可以通过检查手柄的磨损情况来推断哪个杠杆是正确的。如果玩家说这就是他们的角色要找的东西，那么就让他们的角色做一个DC12智慧（（%0%））的检查，并取得优势。如果成功，他们就能看到正确杠杆上的磨损。失败时，他们仍然可以猜测，但机会对他们有利，所以掷出1-5的分数，他们就能做出正确的选择。",
	"In this room are ten {@creature skeleton||skeletons}, all in matching coveralls with a logo on the back that reads, \"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s Garden Care.\" The skeletons are standing around gardening equipment—two wheelbarrows, a scythe, rakes, hoes, a pickaxe, and some pruning shears.": "在这个房间里有十个{@creature skeleton||skeletons}，都穿着配套的工作服，背后有一个标志，上面写着\"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的花园护理\"。这些骷髅站在园艺设备周围--两辆手推车、一把镰刀、耙子、锄头、一把镐头和一些修枝剪。",
	"The skeletons are dormant until they are attacked or until something makes a noise to alert them. The party can sneak past or sneak up to the skeletons with a successful DC 13 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check.": "骷髅们一直处于休眠状态，直到它们被攻击或有东西发出声音提醒它们。只要成功地进行DC13团体灵巧（（%0%））检查，一行人就可以悄悄地经过或悄悄地接近这些骷髅。",
	"If the party attacks the dormant skeletons, the skeletons are surprised (see the rules for Surprise in the D&D Basic Rules) and the party has advantage on their attacks during the first round of combat.": "如果一方攻击休眠的骷髅，骷髅会受到惊吓（见《D&D基本规则》中的惊吓规则），并且一方在第一轮战斗中的攻击具有优势。",
	"Other than the gardening equipment, there's nothing of value in the room.": "除了园艺设备外，房间里没有任何有价值的东西。",
	"This long cavern runs perpendicular to the passageway. A 20-foot-wide chasm, whose bottom cannot be seen, lies in between the western and eastern passages. A door can be seen in the eastern passage.": "这条长长的洞穴与通道垂直而行。在西边和东边的通道之间有一条20英尺宽的鸿沟，其底部无法看到。在东边的通道里可以看到一扇门。",
	"There are a number of ways to cross the chasm—such as spells or grappling hooks—but however they get across, the characters must keep very quiet. Characters with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 12 or higher notice claw marks on the sides of the chasm walls.": "有很多方法可以穿越鸿沟--比如法术或抓钩--但无论如何穿越，角色必须保持非常安静。被动智慧（（%0%））得分在12分以上的角色会注意到鸿沟壁上的爪痕。",
	"If the characters make noise while crossing the chasm, they must succeed on a DC 10 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check or they alert five {@creature ghoul||ghouls} whose claws can be heard scratching up the chasm walls. The ghouls arrive within three turns.": "如果角色在穿越鸿沟时发出声音，他们必须在DC10团体灵巧（（%0%））检查中成功，否则就会惊动五只（%1%），可以听到它们的爪子在鸿沟壁上抓挠。食尸鬼会在三个回合内到达。",
	"If the ghouls are following the characters after they cross the chasm, they can flee through the door and bar it behind them.": "如果食尸鬼在越过鸿沟之后还跟着人物，他们可以从门里逃出来，并在身后把门堵住。",
	"As the DM, you can also describe a whole horde of ghouls clawing their way up the chasm—but only to generate tension. Keep reminding your players of the danger through the sound they make—clawing and hissing—as they come up the chasm. You could make it so that the ghouls arrive just as the party flees through the door and they can hear the scratching and shrieking as they lower the bolt to bar the door. If the party returns to the door later, the ghouls have gone back down into the chasm.": "作为管理人，你也可以描述一大群食尸鬼张牙舞爪地往上爬，但这只是为了制造紧张。通过它们发出的声音--爪子和嘶嘶声--不断提醒你的玩家危险的存在。你可以让食尸鬼在队伍逃出门外时到达，当他们放下门闩时可以听到抓挠和嘶吼声。如果一行人后来回到门前，食尸鬼已经回到了鸿沟里。",
	"If a character should be so unlucky as to fall into the chasm, you can have them grab a hold of a random root or ledge to save themselves from certain doom and let them climb out with the assistance of a rope. However, falling into the chasm alerts the ghouls (see \"Building Tension,\" above).": "如果一个角色很不幸地掉进了鸿沟，你可以让他们抓住一个随机的树根或壁架，使自己免于厄运，并让他们在绳子的帮助下爬出来。然而，落入鸿沟会惊动食尸鬼（见上文 \"建立紧张关系\"）。",
	"This room is occupied by {@creature Maude|NRH-AT}, a {@creature bugbear chief}, and her four {@creature goon|NRH-ASS|goons}, who are poking and prodding a dozen trembling {@creature flumph||flumphs}. The bugbear and the goons are all wearing \"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}'s Garden Care\" coveralls. There are crates with supplies and what looks like arcane lab equipment scattered about. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check can tell that this equipment is most likely used to siphon magical energy—possibly from the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}.": "这个房间里有（%0%）、一个（%1%）和她的四个（%2%），他们正在戳弄十几个颤抖的（%3%）。这只虫子和这群暴徒都穿着\"{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}的花园护理 \"工作服。周围散落着装着物资的箱子和看起来像奥秘的实验室设备。通过DC13智力（（%5%））检查成功的人物可以知道，这些设备很可能是用来吸取魔法能量的--可能是来自（%6%）。",

	"{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}, the bugbear chief, is charged with protecting the secret door to the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT} in area M6.

	"If the adventurers seem friendly or try to protect the flumphs, then one of the party members is contacted telepathically by the leader of the flumphs, GuBu, who reveals two things:": "如果冒险者看起来很友好，或者试图保护弗洛姆人，那么其中一名成员就会被弗洛姆人的领袖古布以心灵感应的方式联系上，古布会透露两件事。",
	"GuBu knows the location of the secret door in this room and will help the party as best they can.

	"GuBu has overheard the \"Gray Man\" talking to {@creature Maude|NRH-AT} about \"killing {@creature Emo|NRH-AT}.\" If asked about \"{@creature Emo|NRH-AT},\" GuBu responds that {@creature Emo|NRH-AT} is a \"sad ball\" and that all the flumphs feel sad for it and hope it will get better. GuBu wonders if the sad ball would one day like to join their cloister.": "GuBu偷听到 \"灰人 \"与{@creature Maude|NRH-AT}谈论 \"杀死{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}\"。如果被问及\"{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}\"，GuBu回答说{@creature Emo|NRH-AT}是一个 \"悲伤的球\"，所有Flumphs都为它感到悲伤，希望它能好起来。GuBu想知道这个悲伤的球是否有一天愿意加入他们的回廊。",
	"The Gray Man is scary, dangerous, and wants to \"destroy all the color.\" GuBu telepathically shudders at the thought.": "灰色人是可怕的、危险的，并想 \"摧毁所有的颜色\"。GuBu心灵感应地对这个想法感到震惊。",

The tubes are connected to a complex apparatus that is placed over the opening of the {@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}. The apparatus appears to be sucking colors from the well and feeding it into the spherical creature through the tubes connected to its eyestalks—although the apparatus looks like it isn't working very well, as colors are spraying and fizzing out into the room. The creature is weeping in frustration and desperately trying to figure out how to fix its apparatus.": "在{@item Prismatic Well|NRH-AT}旁边是一个看起来很压抑的球形生物，它的十个下垂的眼柄上挂着灵活的管子。这些管子与一个复杂的装置相连，这个装置被放置在（1%）的开口处。这个仪器似乎在从井里吸食颜色，并通过连接到它的眼梗的管子将其送入球形生物--尽管这个仪器看起来工作得不是很好，因为颜色正在向房间里喷洒和晕开。该生物正在沮丧地哭泣，并拼命想办法修复它的仪器。",

	"If {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} sees the {@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}, he knows that it's his ticket to a colorless world and does everything in his power to get it—whether it's offering the party 2000 gp or threatening to give them all a thrashing they won't soon forget. {@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT} is partial to the latter.": "如果{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}看到了{@item Amulet of Harmony|NRH-AT}，他知道这是他通往无色世界的门票，并尽其所能地得到它--无论是提供给聚会的2000金币，还是威胁要给他们所有人一个他们不会很快忘记的痛击。{@creature Mr. Greystone|NRH-AT}偏向于后者。",

	"If Furzle runs off during the encounter at the well, the characters may decide to track down the nothic to prevent it from causing more trouble. You can deal with this any way you'd like. One way is to have the party catch up with Furzle trying to cross the chasm in area M4. Although he has a treacherous streak, if treated with kindness, Furzle could make a great wizard's assistant.
