	"As the fourth and final year of the characters' academic career at Strixhaven dawns, the university faces a crisis. In this adventure, the characters come face-to-face with an awful truth: not only does {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel threaten the safety of everyone on campus, but the university's masters are powerless against the villain. It becomes clear that the characters must drop their studies and stop him at all costs.": "随着人物在Strixhaven学术生涯的第四年和最后一年的到来，大学面临着一场危机。在这次冒险中，人物面对着一个可怕的事实：不仅{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}Grenshel威胁着校园里每个人的安全，而且大学的主人也对这个恶棍无能为力。很明显，这些人物必须放弃他们的学业，不惜一切代价阻止他。",

	"If you're running this chapter's adventure as a standalone, you can summarize {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s schemes as they have unfolded over the past three years to establish him as a threat the characters must face. A former student who was expelled 200 years ago, he has artificially extended his life and seeks true immortality. He corrupted eldritch balm to cause magical mishaps, schemed to attack students at a Mage Tower game, and manipulated one of Lorehold's deans to harm students. Now his schemes threaten the entire campus.": "如果你把这一章的冒险作为一个独立的项目，你可以总结一下{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}在过去三年里所展开的计划，以确立他是人物必须面对的威胁。他是200年前被开除的学生，人为地延长了自己的生命，并寻求真正的永生。他腐蚀了长生不老药膏以造成魔法事故，在法师塔游戏中阴谋袭击学生，并操纵罗尔霍德的一位院长来伤害学生。现在他的计划威胁着整个校园。",

	"When the characters examine any of the crates except for the empty crate in {@book area {@dice D5}|SCC|14|D5.

	"The characters can deduce that this magical signature belongs to {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}, who must have contaminated all of these supplies. If the players don't figure it out on their own, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals that {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} has cloaked himself with magical protection, but only from something very specific. It's possible that he has protected himself from the spells of specific spellcasters, although it isn't clear yet who.": "角色们可以推断出这个魔法签名属于{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}，他肯定污染了所有这些物资。如果玩家没有自己想出来，成功通过DC15智力（（%%1%））检查，就会发现（%%2%）给自己披上了魔法保护，但只针对一些非常特殊的东西。他有可能保护自己不受特定施法者的法术伤害，尽管还不清楚是谁。",
	"The instructor has brought a number of {@item Spell Scroll||spell scrolls} of {@spell Tenser's floating disk} equal to twice the number of pairs of students.

	"Before it can be used to move cargo again, a ruin grinder needs to be recalibrated. A character within reach of a ruin grinder can use an action to recalibrate it by first succeeding on a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check and then expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher to reset the ruin grinder's arcane matrix. If the check fails, the ruin grinder shuts down for 24 hours. A recalibrated ruin grinder can carry up to 300 pounds, meaning it can carry two crates at a time to the map's northwest corner, if the characters wish.": "在它能再次被用来移动货物之前，废墟研磨机需要重新校准。一个在废墟研磨机范围内的角色可以使用一个行动来重新校准它，首先在DC13智力（（%0%））检查上取得成功，然后消耗一个1级或更高的法术槽来重置废墟研磨机的奥术矩阵。如果检定失败，废墟研磨机将关闭24小时。经过重新校准的废墟研磨机可以携带300磅的东西，这意味着如果角色愿意，它可以一次携带两个箱子到地图的西北角。",

	"A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check can ascertain that the orange glow around the crate is a bad sign, for it suggests the crate's contents might have been damaged in a dangerous way.

	"A character who realizes the crate's orange glow is a bad sign can gently shake the crate to rearrange its contents, lessening the explosion to 5 feet.
