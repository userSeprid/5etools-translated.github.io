	"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.": "欢迎来到{@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}。在这本书中，你会发现D&D历史上最致命的七个地牢，并为当前版本的游戏进行了更新。有些是承载了无数冒险者的经典之作，而有些则是较新的创作，大胆地在著名的D&D冒险圣殿中占据了一席之地。",
	"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast—and even some visiting from other D&D worlds—spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.": "正如这些地牢给D&D玩家留下的印象一样，关于其危险的故事也在D&D多元宇宙中传播。当辉煌之城沃特迪普的夜色渐浓，打哈欠之门酒馆的壁炉暗淡成深红色时，来自整个剑海岸的冒险者--甚至是一些来自其他D&D世界的来访者，都在传颂着关于丢失宝藏的故事和传闻。",
	"A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.": "一个来自遥远的寿氏帝国的流浪者说，在地牢的墙壁上雕刻着奇怪的、淫荡的魔鬼面孔，可以在瞬间吞噬一个探险者，不留下一个可怜的灵魂经过的痕迹。",
	"A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.": "一个身穿蓝色长袍、说话带着奇怪口音的秃头严厉的巫师讲述了一个巫师从一个不知名的深湖岸边的城市领走了三件强大的武器，他把这些武器带到了一座沉睡的火山，并让冒险家们敢于进入他的巢穴并找回这些武器。",
	"A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.": "一个独眼矮人讲述了一个坠入地底的城堡的故事，其废墟矗立在一个地下小树林之上，该小树林由一棵孕育邪恶的树主导。",
	"These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.": "这些只是从法鲁恩最远的地方和其他地方传遍剑海岸的几个故事。这些小细节随着故事的进行而改变。可怕的阿塞拉克之墓在每次讲述中都会将其位置从阴暗的沼泽地转移到炙热的沙漠，再转移到其他一些禁忌的气候。在每个版本的故事中，关键因素保持不变，为故事提供了一条真实的线索。",
	"The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.": "这些故事的种子现在就在你手中。D&D最致命的地牢现在是你的冒险武器库的一部分。尽情享受吧，并记得保留一些备用的角色表。",

	"These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as {@adventure Storm King's Thunder|skt}, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.": "这些冒险提供了远离你当前战役的完美副线任务。如果你运行已出版的D&D活动，如{@adventure Storm King's Thunder|skt}，这里介绍的更高级别的冒险是扩展活动的理想方式。",
	"{@adventure The Sunless Citadel|tftyp-tsc}, written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.": "{@adventure The Sunless Citadel|tftyp-tsc}，由Bruce R. Cordell编写，是D&D游戏第三版的第一个出版的冒险。它是为四到五个一级玩家角色的聚会而设计的。",

It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.": "自2000年出版以来，《无日城堡》一直被广泛认为是向新玩家介绍游戏的绝佳方式。对于那些希望首次成为地下城主的人来说，这也是一个很好的开始经验。",
	"{@adventure The Forge of Fury|tftyp-tfof}, written by Richard Baker, was published in 2000 shortly after The Sunless Citadel. Characters who succeeded in that mission and advanced to 3rd level were now ready to take on the challenges of a ruined dwarven fortress.": "{@adventure The Forge of Fury|tftyp-tfof}，由理查德-贝克编写，在《无日城堡》之后不久于2000年出版。成功完成该任务并升至3级的角色现在已经准备好接受废墟上的矮人堡垒的挑战。",

	"{@adventure The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan|tftyp-thsot}, written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title {@i Lost Tamoachan} at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.": "{@adventure The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan|tftyp-thsot}，由Harold Johnson和Jeff R.

	"Lawrence Schick, the author of {@adventure White Plume Mountain|tftyp-wpm}, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but {@i White Plume} became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.": "{@adventure White Plume Mountain|tftyp-wpm}的作者Lawrence Schick在2013年的汇编《Dungeons of Dread》中提到，他写这个冒险是为了说服Gary Gygax雇佣他做游戏设计师。他不仅得到了这份工作，而且(1%)在1979年首次出版时就立即成为了人们的最爱。",
	"The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.": "本书中的冒险版本是为一组8级的角色量身定做的。",
	"{@adventure Dead in Thay|tftyp-dit}, written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to {@i Tomb of Horrors}, {@i Ruins of Undermountain}, and other \"killer dungeons\" throughout the history of the game.": "{@adventure Dead in Thay|tftyp-dit}，由斯科特-菲茨杰拉德-格雷撰写，是在第五版D&D游戏处于测试阶段时创作的。它的原始形式被用作2014年春季的D&D邂逅季的故事。这个冒险的特点是一个巨大而致命的地牢，被称为 \"末日之门\"，它是对(1%)、(2%)和整个游戏历史上其他 \"杀手地牢 \"的致敬之作。",

	"The three linked adventures that make up {@adventure Against the Giants|tftyp-atg} were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "构成{@adventure Against the Giants|tftyp-atg}的三个链接的冒险故事是在1978年创作并最初发布的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写{@i Player's Handbook}。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"The compilation of {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King} was published in 1981 as {@i Against the Giants}.

	"Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the {@i Tomb of Horrors}.": "在D&D游戏的世界里还没有太多的东西，就有了（%0%）。",
	"The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of {@i Tomb of Horrors}, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.": "该冒险的第一个版本是在1970年代早期为Gary Gygax的个人活动精心设计的，并在1975年最初的起源游戏大会上作为官方龙与地下城活动的特色。作为高级D&D游戏的一部分，{@i Tomb of Horrors}的首次出版是在1978年。",
	"As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.": "作为一个由游戏创造者的邪恶思想所创造的角色和玩家的试验场，恐怖之墓在D&D最伟大的冒险史上是无与伦比的。只有高级别的角色才有机会活着回来，但每一个勇闯古墓的玩家都会有一生难忘的经历。",
	"To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition {@book Player's Handbook|phb}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|dmg}, and {@book Monster Manual|mm}. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.": "要运行这些冒险，你需要第五版的（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。在你和你的玩家坐下来之前，先把冒险的文字全部读一遍，也熟悉一下地图，也许可以把复杂的区域或人物一定会去的地方记下来，这样你就能在行动开始之前做好充分的准备。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|mm} contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in {@adventure appendix B|TftYP-ToH|3}. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|mm}包含本书中大多数怪物和NPC的状态块。当一个怪物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向怪物手册中该生物的状态块。新怪物的描述和状态块出现在（%2%）中。如果一个状态块在该附录中，冒险的文本会告诉你。",

	"While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign—over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest—they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.": "虽然这些冒险从来都不是为了组合成一个完整的战役--最新的和最老的相隔30多年--但它们被选来提供广泛的等级游戏。只要稍加努力，你就可以只用这本书开展一个完整的活动。",
	"Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.": "从《无日城堡》开始，引导你的玩家按照本书中的顺序完成冒险。每一个冒险都提供了足够的XP，在完成冒险后，角色应该有足够高的等级来进入下一个冒险。",
	"The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.": "Yawning Portal，或其他你自己发明的或来自其他D&D设定的酒馆，为活动提供了完美的框架装置。角色们听到了每个地牢的传闻，有足够的信息来引导他们进行下一次冒险。也许一个从即将到来的冒险中抽出的友好的NPC会到酒馆寻求帮助，或者一个角色的背景的某些元素会把他们推到正确的道路上。在任何情况下，这些地牢的设计都可以很容易地移植到任何活动环境中。",
	"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.": "在沃特迪普的喧嚣中，在大律师、贵族和使者们用言语和契约战斗的城堡区，矗立着一家与其他地方不太一样的旅馆。在没有城堡区或者甚至可以被认为是辉煌之城的祖先之前，有一个地牢，而在那个地牢里，打哈欠的门的故事开始了。",
	"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.": "在过去的岁月里，强大的巫师哈拉斯特在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔，并深入到最初由矮人和乌鸦建造的隧道中，寻找更强大的魔法力量。哈拉斯特和他的学徒们扩大了他们所发现的隧道，出于他们自己的原因在地表下挖出了新的巢穴。随着时间的推移，他们的挖掘工作逐渐发展成为今天被称为 \"地下山 \"的巨大迷宫，这是整个被遗忘之域中最大的地牢。哈拉斯特最终消失了，他的所有学徒也都消失了，但他建造的巨大建筑群至今仍在。",
	"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.": "无数年来，地下山的秘密一直被隐藏在地面世界。所有进入其大厅的人都没有回来。它作为死亡陷阱的名声越来越大，以至于在沃特迪普被判处死刑的罪犯被强行押入地牢，任其自生自灭。",
	"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.": "这一切都随着两个人的到来而改变，一个叫杜南的战士和一个叫米特的新教徒。这两个人是第一批从地下山回来的冒险家，满载着财富和魔法宝藏。米特用他的财富买了一座豪宅，而杜南则有不同的计划。杜南从冒险中退休，并购买了土地，那里有一口又深又宽的井，是地牢唯一已知的入口。围绕这口井，他建造了一个酒馆和旅店，以满足冒险者和那些寻求他们服务的人的需求，他把它称为打哈欠的入口。",
	"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.": "杜南在成功进入地下山时掠夺的一些魔法，使他的寿命甚至超过了精灵的寿命。几十年来，杜南把深入地下山的工作留给了年轻的人们。然而有一天，有东西吸引他回来了。等待他从地牢中凯旋的日子变成了几个月，然后是几年。近一个世纪以来，沃特德普的公民都认为他已经死了。但有一天晚上，一个声音从井里叫了起来。起初很少有人相信这可能是杜南，但和他一样长寿的人都证明了这一点。曙光之门已经落入他的祖先手中，但杜南带着足够的财富回来，让他们悄悄退休。杜南在酒吧后面找到了他习惯的位置，为自己的安全返回举杯，然后开始为顾客服务，就像他从未离开一样。",
	"Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.": "来自法鲁恩各地的冒险者，甚至是来自多元宇宙其他地方的冒险者，都会来拜访打哈欠的入口，交流关于地下山和其他地牢的知识。大多数来访者都满足于在壁炉旁交换故事，但有时一群人在贪婪、野心或绝望的驱使下，会支付进入的费用并下井。大多数人都没能活到回程，但有足够的人带着财富和冒险故事回来，引诱其他团体尝试他们的运气。",
	"The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.": "Yawning Portal并不是D&D传说中唯一著名的酒馆。在灰鹰的自由城，矗立着绿龙客栈，它是一些最成功的远征灰鹰堡和其他地方的起点。这个地方很拥挤，烟雾缭绕。顾客们用低沉的声音交谈，任何试图在没有明确的付款意向的情况下进行交谈的人都会受到冷遇。妄想症和怀疑在这里肆虐，这与一个自由的城市相称，它站在一个被魔鬼困扰的帝国、一个被邪恶的半神牢牢控制的广阔领域，以及一个分裂的、争吵的名义上致力于正义和福利的王国之间的交界处。在灰鹰这个疲惫不堪的世界里，利益和权力高于英雄主义。",
	"The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The \"well\" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.": "Yawning Portal的自来水室占满了建筑的第一层。直径40英尺的井提供了通往地下山的通道，占据了整个空间。这口 \"井 \"是哈拉斯特塔的全部遗迹，现在，没有了形成地下楼层的楼梯和地板，它就像一个开放的竖井一样下降了140英尺。据了解，搅屎棍、蜘蛛和更坏的东西都会从下面入侵打哈欠的门户。",
	"Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.": "酒馆二楼和三楼的阳台可以俯瞰水井，通过从酒水间升起的木质楼梯进入这两层。坐在阳台上的桌子旁的客人可以看到水井和下面的活动，视野极佳。",
	"Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to \"ride the rope\") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.": "那些想进入山下探险的人（或只是想 \"骑绳 \"的大胆游客）必须支付一块金子才能被放下去。回程也要付一块金子，事先用桶装好送上去。一旦支付了最初的费用，走几步楼梯就可以到达井口的腰部。悬挂在井中央的绳索被椽子上的横梁撬到了井口，当那些已经付款的人准备好了，他们就登上绳索，长途跋涉下去。",
	"A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.": "各种各样的奇珍异宝装饰着这个酒馆。传统上，冒险者如果从地下山找回了一件奇怪的遗物，就会把它送给杜南，作为他们成功的战利品。其他冒险者会留下这样的古玩来纪念他们对酒馆的访问，或者在与杜南打赌失败后放弃它们，杜南喜欢对进入地牢的冒险队伍的命运下注。偶尔，杜南看中的东西可以用来支付酒吧的帐单。",

	"On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.": "在安静的夜晚，\"打哈欠门户 \"的客人们聚集在自来水间的大壁炉旁，交换关于遥远地方、奇怪的怪物和宝贵的宝藏的故事。在比较繁忙的夜晚，这里就会变得喧闹而拥挤。阳台上挤满了商人和贵族，而一楼的桌子上则坐满了冒险家和他们的伙伴。几杯酒加上众人的鼓励，总能诱使一些人花钱到山下做一次短暂的旅行。大多数人都是先付钱，然后马上回来，不过也有几个雄心勃勃的人可能会临时进入地牢探险。这种准备不足的队伍很少有机会回来。",
	"Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.": "因特殊原因想进入暗山的团体一般都是在酒馆安静的时候来的。即使在这种时候，酒馆里仍然有一些窥探的目光，这些潜伏者将地下山的来往消息传递给镇塔林、黑暗教派、犯罪团伙和其他感兴趣的人。",
	"Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern).

	"Ages ago, a human wizard/cleric of surpassing evil took the steps necessary to preserve his life force beyond the centuries he had already lived, and this creature became the lich known as Acererak. Over the scores of years which followed, the lich dwelled with hordes of ghastly servants in the gloomy stone halls of the very hill where the tomb is.": "在很久以前，一个邪恶的人类巫师/牧师采取了必要的措施来保存他的生命力，超过了他已经活了几个世纪，这个生物成为了被称为阿克雷拉克的巫师。在随后的几十个年头里，巫师和成群的可怕的仆人居住在坟墓所在山丘的阴暗的石头大厅里。",
	"Eventually even the undead life force of Acererak began to wane, so for the next eight decades, the lich's servants labored to create the Tomb of Horrors. Then Acererak destroyed all his slaves and servitors, magically hid the entrance to his halls, and went to reside in his final haunt, while his soul roamed strange planes unknown to even the wisest of sages. If the characters gain access to the innermost part of the tomb where the lich's crypt lies, their actions along the way will have caused his soul to be called back to the Material Plane and alerted Acererak, now a {@creature demilich}, that interlopers have invaded his resting place.": "最终，即使是阿塞拉克的不死生命力也开始减弱，所以在接下来的八十年里，巫师的仆人们努力创造恐怖之墓。然后，阿塞拉克摧毁了他所有的奴隶和仆人，用魔法隐藏了他大厅的入口，并进入了他最后的栖息地，而他的灵魂则在甚至是最聪明的圣人都不知道的奇怪星球上游荡。如果人物能够进入陵墓的最里面，即巫师的墓室，那么他们在路上的行为将导致他的灵魂被召唤回物质界，并提醒现在是{@creature demilich}的阿塞拉克，入侵者已经侵入了他的安息之地。",
	"In the original {@i Tomb of Horrors}, Gary Gygax suggested six possible, far-flung locations for the adventure in the Greyhawk setting—proof in itself that the tomb is liable to turn up just about anywhere.

	"The tomb could be in the Serpent Hills or the Trielta Hills on Faerûn. It could be in the High Moor or amid the isles that make up the Korinn Archipelago in the Moonshaes.

	"As clever players will gather from the information in the \"{@adventure Legend of the Tomb|TftYP-ToH|1|Legend of the Tomb},\" this dungeon has more tricks and traps than it has monsters to fight.

	"As characters enter the various areas, read aloud appropriate sections of text, but never give any additional information that player characters would have no way of knowing, and avoid facial expressions or voice tones that might either give helpful hints or mislead players.

	"The characters have arrived at the site of the demilich's last haunt. Before them is a low, flat topped hill, about 200 yards wide, 300 yards long, and 60 feet high. Only ugly weeds, thorns, and briars grow upon the steep sides and bald top of the mound. There are black rocks upon the top of the hill, and if these are viewed from a height of about 200 feet or so above the mound, it will be seen that the whole is shaped like a human skull, with piles of rock appearing as eyeholes, a nose hole, and the jagged teeth of a grinning death's head.": "这些人物已经来到了demilich最后的出没地。他们面前是一座低矮的平顶山，大约200码宽，300码长，60英尺高。只有丑陋的杂草、荆棘和石楠生长在小丘的陡峭侧面和秃顶上。山顶上有黑色的岩石，如果从土丘上方约200英尺的高度看这些岩石，就会发现整个山丘的形状像一个人的头骨，岩石堆上出现了眼孔、鼻孔，以及一个咧嘴笑的死人头的锯齿。",
	"A thorough inspection and search of the entire area reveals only that the north side of the hill has a crumbling cliff of sand and gravel about 20 feet high in the middle of the whole. (This cliff face is represented by the northern edge of {@adventure map 7.1|TftYP-ToH|1|Map 7.1: Tomb of Horrors}.) A low stone ledge overhangs this eroded area, and shrubs and bushes obscure it from observation at a distance.": "对整个地区进行彻底的检查和搜索，只发现山丘的北侧有一个由沙石组成的摇摇欲坠的悬崖，整个悬崖高约20英尺。(这个悬崖面由（%0%）的北边代表）。一个低矮的石壁悬在这个被侵蚀的地方，灌木和树丛遮住了它，无法在远处观察。",
	"It takes 10 minutes for characters to search each 10-foot-wide space along the cliff face. This examination must be done from a distance, using a long spear or a 10-foot pole to poke into the sand and gravel, looking for an opening. Any prodding into the cliff face must be sufficiently high off the ground in order to collapse enough material to expose a portion of a tunnel entrance. Once an entrance is exposed, it takes about 1 hour for characters to thoroughly clear the passage that lies beyond, but a crawl space can be opened in 10 minutes.": "人物沿着悬崖面搜索每一个10英尺宽的空间需要10分钟。这项检查必须从远处进行，用一根长矛或10英尺长的杆子戳进沙子和砾石，寻找一个开口。对悬崖面的任何探查都必须离地面足够高，以便塌下足够的材料来暴露出隧道入口的一部分。一旦暴露出一个入口，人物需要大约1个小时才能彻底清除后面的通道，但一个爬行空间可以在10分钟内打开。",
	"Probing of the gravel and sand face can begin wherever the characters choose—east side, west side, middle, several locations at once or merely a single one at a time. Leave this strictly to the players to decide. The best manner to handle it is to ask where they will search, once they have determined that they will investigate the area and they have stated how it will be done and with what.

A character can use thieves' tools to keep the stones from shifting by taking 1 minute and succeeding on a DC 20 Dexterity check.

The block's movement can be stopped by using an iron bar or a similarly sturdy normal object, but only if the object is placed on the floor where it can be wedged into the space between the block and the floor. If the block moves far enough to prevent the characters from escaping, they have to devise a means to bypass it. It can't be moved or forced backward.": "如果有人在铺路石上移动，铺路石就会移位，一块10英尺厚的石块就会从东墙的中点出现，开始滑向走廊。让玩家掷出主动权。在每一次主动权的计算中，石块向西滑行6英寸，直到主动权计算1时，它完全挡住了走廊的通道。可以用铁棍或类似的坚固的普通物体来阻止木块的移动，但前提是该物体要放在地板上，可以楔入木块和地板之间的空间。如果木块移动的距离足以阻止人物逃跑，他们必须想出办法绕过它。它不能被移动，也不能被迫向后退。",

The opening is filled with opaque, bright orange vapors.": "椅子的雕刻和软垫都很好，但似乎并不引人注目。台子的两边是独立的大型黄铜烛台，每个烛台上有五根白蜡烛。南面墙上的每个角落都有一个大的白陶瓮，用黄铜和木头塞子盖住。靠近西墙的地板上横七竖八地躺着一具身穿黑色链甲的人类骨架，该骨架已严重生锈和损坏。这具骷髅伸出的手臂指向墙壁上的一个石拱门。拱门内充满了不透明的、明亮的橙色蒸汽。",
	"A casting of {@spell detect evil and good} or a paladin's use of Divine Sense identifies the chapel as a consecrated place. (What a puzzle! Could the demilich actually have been of good alignment?)": "施放{@spell detect evil and good}或圣骑士使用神力感应，可以确定这个小教堂是个神圣的地方。(真是个谜题！这个恶魔会不会真的是个好地方？）",
	"Simple examination indicates that all of the benches have hinged seats. If a character examines either of the pews in the front row before opening the lid, a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that the hinges on this pew are larger than the ones on the pews in the other rows.": "简单的检查表明，所有的长椅都有铰链式座椅。如果一个角色在打开盖子之前检查了前排的任何一个长椅，成功通过DC15智慧（（%0%））检查，就会发现这个长椅的铰链比其他几排的长椅的铰链要大。",
	"The hinges on the front pews are larger and stronger because they include rods that are connected to valves inside the pew. If the seat on either of the front pews is lifted up, a cloud of poison gas fills the whole room in 2 rounds. A character caught in the gas must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} for 48 hours.": "前排座椅的铰链更大更坚固，因为它们包括与座椅内的阀门相连的杆子。如果前排座椅中的任何一个被抬起来，一团毒气会在两回合内充满整个房间。陷入毒气中的角色必须在DC15宪法救赎中获得成功，否则将在48小时内变成（%0%）。",
	"If the hinges are noticed and then disassembled, requiring 1 minute and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools for each hinge, the trap can't trigger. A failed check results in no progress at the task, but if the check fails by 5 or more, the trap goes off explosively, blowing the lid open.": "如果铰链被注意到，然后被拆开，需要1分钟和使用盗贼的工具对每个铰链进行DC15的灵巧检查，陷阱就不能触发。检查失败会导致任务没有进展，但如果检查失败5次或以上，陷阱就会爆炸，把盖子炸开。",
	"The back pair of pews have 4,000 sp each hidden therein, the next pair have 3,000 ep each, and the pair closest to the trapped pews have 2,000 gp each.": "后面的一对马车中各藏有4000英镑，接下来的一对马车中各藏有3000英镑，而最靠近被困马车的一对马车中各藏有2000英镑。",
	"The centerpiece of the chapel is a block of strange material that glows with an inner light of opalescent blue. (If the altar is specifically targeted by a {@spell detect evil and good} spell, it registers very faintly as a desecrated object.) If the altar is touched by living matter, a {@spell lightning bolt} spell (save DC 15) will streak down the center aisle. After this bolt comes forth, the altar turns a fiery blue-red, and if it thereafter is touched by any object it will explode as a {@spell fireball} spell (save DC 15).": "礼拜堂的中心是一块奇怪的材料，散发着乳蓝色的内在光芒。 (如果祭坛被{@spell detect evil and good}的法术特别针对，它就会非常微弱地被记录为被亵渎的物体。) 如果祭坛被活物触及，一个{@spell lightning bolt}的法术(救赎DC15)将在中央的过道上划过。在这道闪电出现后，祭坛会变成炽热的蓝红色，如果此后它被任何物体触碰，它就会爆炸，成为一个{@spell fireball}的法术（保存DC15）。",
	"Just as in other locations around the tomb, the mists that obscure the archway can't be penetrated with any sort of vision or magic. (If a character moves close to the archway and asks about it, explain that none of the stones of the arch glow.) The skeleton, of course, misleads the party, for any character passing through the portal will enter a 10-foot-by-10-foot room where their sex and alignment are reversed by a powerful magic. Exiting the room and reentering the archway will restore original alignment, but also deals 3 ({@dice 1d6}) psychic damage. Going back a third time will reverse sex again, but the individual will be teleported in the manner of the archway in {@adventure area 10|TftYP-ToH|1|10. Great Hall of Spheres}. Only a {@spell wish} spell will restore both alignment and sex. If alignment is restored by entering the orange portal, a {@spell remove curse} or {@spell greater restoration} spell will then restore original sex.": "就像坟墓周围的其他地方一样，遮蔽拱门的迷雾是无法用任何视觉或魔法穿透的。(如果有角色靠近拱门并询问此事，请解释说拱门的石头都不会发光）。当然，这具骷髅误导了当事人，因为任何通过入口的角色都会进入一个10英尺×10英尺的房间，在那里他们的性别和排列方式都会被一个强大的魔法颠倒。退出房间并重新进入拱门会恢复原来的排列，但也会造成3（（%0%））的精神伤害。第三次回去将再次逆转性别，但个人将以拱门的方式被传送到（%1%）。只有{@spell wish}的法术才能同时恢复排列和性别。如果通过进入橙色传送门恢复了排列，那么一个{@spell remove curse}或{@spell greater restoration}的法术将恢复原来的性别。",
	"A character who inspects the eastern wall directly opposite the archway and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds a small slot with the letter O faintly traced above it. This is the location of a moving stone block described below.

	"As shown on the map, the stone that forms part of the eastern wall of the chapel is 2 feet wide, 4 feet high, and 10 feet thick in a wedge shape. It is impregnated with strong antimagic that prevents its detection or removal or its change to another form or substance. The wall slot (see above) is of sufficient size to accept a coin or a disc-shaped gem. It is also just right for the insertion of a magic ring of any sort. Only such an item will trigger the mechanism, which causes the block to sink slowly into the floor so as to allow entry into the passage beyond. The object deposited into the slot is forever lost, as the sinking stone crushes all to pieces. The gate opens easily from the other (east) side, and no special item is required to trigger its opening from that side.": "如地图所示，构成小教堂东墙一部分的石头，宽2英尺，高4英尺，厚10英尺，呈楔形。它被浸渍了强烈的反魔法，可以防止其被发现或移除，或改变成另一种形式或物质。墙上的槽（见上文）有足够的大小，可以接受一枚硬币或一个圆盘状的宝石。它也正好可以插入一个任何种类的魔法戒指。只有这样的物品才能触发机制，使木块慢慢沉入地板，从而允许进入后面的通道。放入槽中的物品将永远消失，因为下沉的石头会将所有物品压成碎片。大门很容易从另一边（东边）打开，从那一边打开也不需要特殊的物品来触发。",
	"Beyond the gate stone, the corridor widens to 10 feet and turns southward where steps lead down steeply to a corridor that goes west. Each of the three doors in the corridor opens easily if any pushing force is applied to it, and a creature that does so stumbles into the pit on the other side unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. If a door isn't violently pushed against, it can be opened safely by pulling it inward, and the party will have standard chances of falling in when the characters leading the way step on the pit cover.": "过了门石之后，走廊扩大到10英尺，并向南转弯，那里的台阶陡然向下，通向一条向西的走廊。走廊里的三扇门，如果施加任何推力，都能轻易打开，而这样做的生物会跌入另一边的坑里，除非它能成功地进行DC15的灵巧救赎。如果一扇门没有被猛烈地推开，它可以通过向内拉来安全地打开，而当带路的人物踩到坑盖时，一行人将有标准的机会掉进去。",
	"By the time the westernmost door and pit have been reached, the characters will certainly expect the pit, and will be likely to bypass and ignore it. This carelessness would prevent them from examining the pit from within. On the south wall of the pit is a wooden door painted to look like stone, which is easily discovered by anyone who looks at this wall while inside the pit or who makes a tactile investigation of the wall from outside the pit.": "当到达最西边的门和坑的时候，人物肯定会想到这个坑，而且很可能会绕过和忽略它。这种大意会使他们无法从内部检查这个坑。在坑的南面墙上有一扇木门，被漆成石头的样子，任何人在坑内看这面墙，或者从坑外对这面墙进行触觉调查，都很容易发现这一点。",
	"Beyond the painted door is a narrow passage that emerges at the top of a short flight of stairs leading down.": "彩绘门外是一条狭窄的通道，在通往下层的短程楼梯顶端出现。",

	"A character who listens with an ear to the door will hear far-off music and happy singing, obviously coming from the other side of the door.": "用耳朵听门的人物会听到遥远的音乐和快乐的歌声，显然是从门的另一边传来的。",
	"No amount of forcing or spells will open the door. The only way to continue northward is to use a {@spell disintegrate} spell on the door or physically destroy it (it has 100 hit points).": "无论怎样的强迫或法术都无法打开这扇门。继续向北走的唯一方法是对门使用{@spell disintegrate}的法术或用物理方法摧毁它（它有100点命中率）。",
	"If the characters destroy the door, read:": "如果人物破坏了门，请阅读。",
	"As the door falls away, you can hear sounds of confusion and distress coming from the north. A faint glow, like that of a small flame, shines in the distance. The walls of the passage ahead of you are of smooth white alabaster, and the floor is highly polished, smoke-gray marble.": "随着门的脱落，你可以听到来自北方的混乱和痛苦的声音。远处有微弱的光亮，就像小火苗一样，闪闪发光。你前面的通道的墙壁是光滑的白色雪花石，地板是高度抛光的烟灰色大理石。",
	"The destruction of the door triggered a {@spell minor illusion} spell that produced the noises of distress, which are designed to lure the characters onward.": "门的破坏触发了一个{@spell minor illusion}的咒语，产生了求救的声音，这是为了引诱人物继续前进。",
	"The tunnel floor is a counterweighted beam. Its overbalancing point is the third square north of the door. When one or more characters move there, the floor beyond the door will begin to tilt downward, with the north end slowly sinking. If this occurs, quickly state how the floor is beginning to slant, and have the characters roll initiative. On initiative count 10, all characters north of the door fall {@condition prone} and slide 10 feet to the north.": "隧道的地板是一个配重梁。它的平衡点是门北面的第三个方格。当一个或多个角色在那里移动时，门外的地板会开始向下倾斜，北端慢慢下沉。如果发生这种情况，迅速说明地板是如何开始倾斜的，并让角色们滚动主动权。在主动权计数为10时，门北面的所有角色都会跌落（%0%），并向北面滑行10英尺。",
	"A character can attempt to scramble back up the ramp to the south by making a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, or two successful checks if using the {@action Dash} action. Those who succeed still slide 10 feet north on initiative count 10 in each round, but they can also climb upward according to the normal rules for doing so. A character whose check fails by 5 or more slides an extra 5 feet to the north. Those who slide to the fourth square north of the door take 3 ({@dice 1d6}) fire damage, then 11 ({@dice 2d10}) fire damage in the fifth square. Characters who slide farther than that are plunged into a pit of molten lava which will absolutely snuff them out.": "一个角色可以通过成功地进行DC10力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查，或者如果使用{@action Dash}行动，则需要两次成功的检查，才能尝试从斜坡上爬回南方。成功的人仍然在每轮主动权计数10时向北滑行10英尺，但他们也可以按照正常的规则向上攀登。检查失败5次或以上的角色，会向北额外滑行5英尺。那些滑到门北面第四格的人受到3({@dice 1d6}的火焰伤害，然后在第五格受到11({@dice 2d10}的火焰伤害。滑得更远的角色会陷入一个熔岩坑中，这绝对会让他们窒息而死。",
	"This entrance to the remainder of the tomb is on the wall adjoining the stairway that leads down.

	"After the magic of the door is identified, a {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell remove curse} spell is needed to remove the guard that prevents the door from being opened. Once this is accomplished, the secret door can be opened easily from either side.": "在确定了门的魔力后，需要用{@spell dispel magic}或{@spell remove curse}的咒语来移除阻止门被打开的护卫。一旦做到这一点，密门就可以轻易地从任何一侧打开。",

Once the effect ends, the creature is immune to the gas for 1 hour.": "在这种情况下的生物（%0%）必须在它的每个回合中采取（%1%）的行动来回溯它的脚步，以最安全的路线离开坟墓的这个区域。该生物可以在它的每个回合结束时重复蓄力动作，如果蓄力成功，则结束对它的影响。一旦效果结束，该生物将在1小时内对气体免疫。",
	"Beyond the first 10 feet, the gas becomes thicker, and it irritates the eyes. The area is lightly obscured, so it requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice the south door that leads into area 18A.

	"Where these valves meet, at about waist height, is a cup-like depression, a hemispherical concavity with a central hole. The hole appears to fit the Second Key, but if it is inserted, the character so doing will take 5 ({@dice 1d10}) lightning damage. Anyone so foolish as to insert the First Key (from {@adventure area 19|TftYP-ToH|1|19. Laboratory and Mummy Preparation Room}) will take double that amount of damage.": "在这些阀门的交汇处，大约腰部的高度，是一个杯状的凹陷，一个半球形的凹陷，中间有一个孔。这个孔似乎适合第二把钥匙，但如果它被插入，这样做的人将受到5（（%0%））的雷电伤害。任何愚蠢到插入第一把钥匙的人（来自{@adventure area 19|TftYP-ToH|1|19. Laboratory and Mummy Preparation Room}）将受到两倍的伤害。",
	"The real key to these great gates is the scepter from {@adventure area 25|TftYP-ToH|1|25. Pillared Throne Room}. If the gold knob is inserted into the depression, the mithral doors will swing silently open. If the silver end of the scepter is touched to the hemispherical cup the holder of the instrument will be teleported instantly to be spat out of the devil's mouth at {@adventure area 6|TftYP-ToH|1|6. The Face of the Great Green Devil}, nude, while all non-living materials with the individual go to {@adventure area 33|TftYP-ToH|1|33.

	"If the door is attacked by force it will not budge, but if it is scratched or nicked it will turn red in that spot, and if it is cut by a sharp weapon it will begin to gush forth blood—the blood of all those who have died within the tomb! The red flow will cascade down the steps and fill the area to the top of the southernmost step in 6 rounds, and each round thereafter it will rise higher and encompass one more step. If unchecked, the flow of blood will fill the foyer to the ceiling in 20 rounds.": "如果这扇门被强行攻击，它不会动，但如果它被刮伤或划伤，它将在那个地方变成红色，如果它被锋利的武器切割，它将开始涌出血液--所有死在坟墓里的人的血液！红色的水流将沿着台阶流下，在6个回合内填满最南边的台阶。红色的血流会顺着台阶流下，并在6个回合内填满最南边的台阶，此后每回合都会上升，并包括一个更多的台阶。如果不加控制，血流将在20个回合内充满门厅至天花板。",
	"Fire of any sort, magical or otherwise, turns the blood to a poison gas, which is fatal, and all characters in the foyer area are dead, with no saving throw, while any in the 5-foot-wide passage to the throne room are slain unless they succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.": "任何形式的火，不管是魔法的还是其他的，都会使血液变成毒气，这是致命的，所有在门厅区域的角色都会死亡，没有救赎，而在通往王室的5英尺宽的通道上的角色都会被杀死，除非他们在DC17宪法救赎中取得成功。",
	"Casting one or more {@spell cure wounds} spells on the door in any combination that expends four spell slots (such as four 1st-level castings, two 2nd-level, or one 4th-level) will stanch the flow of blood, as will a {@spell heal} spell. If other magic is used against the blood, only the following spells will have any effect:": "对门施放一个或多个{@spell cure wounds}的法术，以任何组合消耗四个法术槽（如四个一级施法，两个二级施法，或一个四级施法），都会阻断血流，一个{@spell heal}的法术也是如此。如果对血流使用其他魔法，只有以下法术才有效果。",

The shade blesses the characters so that they benefit as if they had just finished a long rest.": "{@spell Raise dead}或{@spell resurrection}破坏所有的血，并使顶部的楼梯上出现一个阴影。阴影祝福人物，使他们受益，就像他们刚刚完成了一次长时间的休息。",
	"This imposing chamber has a silvered ceiling, just as the foyer has, so it is brightly illuminated by reflected light. The walls are of ivory with gold inlaid. The floor is polished agate. In each corner stands a statue of black iron, easily nine feet tall. That to the northeast stands with a saw-toothed two-handed sword raised to strike; that to the northwest a huge, spike-ended mace; to the southeast the sculpture holds a wickedly spiked morning star, and the one in the southwest has a voulge.": "这个气派的厅堂有一个银色的天花板，就像门厅一样，所以它被反射的光线照得很亮。墙壁是象牙色的，上面镶嵌着黄金。地板是抛光的玛瑙。每个角落都站着一个黑铁的雕像，很容易就有九英尺高。东北面的雕像站着一把锯齿状的双手剑，抬起来就要击打；西北面的雕像站着一把巨大的、带着尖刺的长矛；东南面的雕像拿着一颗邪恶的带刺晨星，西南面的雕像拿着一把伏尔加。",
	"Near the center of the room is a large bronze urn filigreed in gold. A thin stream of smoke issues from a tiny vent in its brass stopper. On the southern wall stands a granite sarcophagus that appears to be damaged. Flanking the sarcophagus are two large iron chests.": "靠近房间中央的地方有一个大的青铜瓮，上面镶有金丝。一股薄薄的烟雾从其铜制塞子上的一个小孔中喷出。在南面的墙上矗立着一具花岗岩石棺，似乎已经损坏。石棺的两侧是两个大铁箱。",
	"The room is lined with lead and has antimagic properties, so no spells will work within the room, and no magical properties of items of any sort will properly function except those that detect an aura of magic or a place of desecration.": "这个房间里有铅，具有反魔法的特性，所以在这个房间里，任何法术都不会起作用，任何种类的物品的魔法特性都不会正常发挥作用，除了那些能检测到魔法光环或亵渎之地的物品。",
	"Each statue has a magical aura, but they are merely hunks of metal; they do nothing. Each registers to the casting of {@spell detect evil and good} as a desecrated object, and the visage of each of these iron statues is most fearsome and terrifying.": "每个雕像都有一个神奇的光环，但它们只是一堆金属，它们什么也做不了。每一尊都会被登记为被亵渎的物品，而每一尊铁像的面容都是最可怕的，令人恐惧的。",
	"Moving a statue can be done, but it requires a combined Strength of 48. Moving the statue in the northwest corner reveals a ring pull in the western wall which will raise a small plug of stone and enable the party to enter a small chute which takes them into the corridor that goes west.": "移动雕像是可以做到的，但需要综合力量达到48。移动西北角的雕像可以看到西边墙上的一个环形拉环，这将使一个小石塞升起，并使一行人进入一个小滑道，进入通往西边的走廊。",
	"A character who examines the urn can use an action to pry loose the stopper. If the stopper is removed, an {@creature efreeti} will come forth.

If not, it will grant three wishes for the party and then depart.": "检查骨灰盒的人物可以使用一个动作来撬开塞子。如果瓶塞被移开，一个（%0%）会出来。如果骨灰盒被撞击、敲打、摇晃、翻倒或以其他方式粗暴地处理过，这个生物就会发怒并进行攻击。如果没有，它就会为当事人实现三个愿望，然后离开。",
	"Examining the lid of the sarcophagus reveals that glyphs spelling \"ACERERAK\" are inset on it in platinum. (The metal, worth 100 pp in total, can be pried out.) The end of the thing nearest the wall is stove in and shattered. Inside can be seen bits of a wooden inner shell, a few bones, destroyed jewelry (the stones pried out), torn bits of robes and windings, dust, and a broken {@item staff of the magi} (evident from the runes upon it). A shattered skull will roll out if the contents are moved around. (Why, the demilich has long been destroyed, but his magical traps somehow survived!)": "检查石棺的盖子，发现上面用铂金嵌着拼成的 \"ACERERAK \"的字样。(这些金属共值100pp，可以撬出来。)离墙最近的那一端被炉子砸了，碎了。里面可以看到木质内壳的碎片、一些骨头、被毁坏的珠宝（石头被撬出）、长袍和发条的碎片、灰尘，以及一个破碎的（%0%）（从上面的符文可以看出）。如果里面的东西被搬来搬去，一个破碎的头骨会滚出来。(为什么，这个恶魔早已被摧毁，但他的魔法陷阱却不知不觉地存活下来！）。",
	"Each of these massive boxes is embedded into the stone. Neither can possibly be moved, and both show marks of prying, battering, and similar treatment. Each chest is triple-locked, and each lock contains a poison needle trap (see \"{@trap Poison Needle||Sample Traps}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). If the trap is triggered by a failed check, it deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of purple worm poison (see \"{@book Sample Poisons|DMG|8|Sample Poisons}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).": "这些巨大的盒子都被嵌入石头中。这两个箱子都不可能被移动，而且都有被撬动、敲打和类似处理的痕迹。每个箱子都有三把锁，每个锁里都有一个毒针陷阱（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第五章的\"{@trap Poison Needle||Sample Traps}\"）。如果检查失败触发了这个陷阱，它会造成1次穿刺伤害，并提供一剂紫色蠕虫毒药（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第8章中的\"{@book Sample Poisons|DMG|8|Sample Poisons}\"）。",
	"Both chests have treasure, the true nature of which doesn't become apparent until the spoils are moved at least 13 miles away from the tomb.": "这两个箱子里都有宝藏，其真正的性质直到战利品被运到离墓穴至少13英里远的地方才变得明显。",
	"The eastern chest holds 10,000 gems, which will initially appear to be of not less than 50 gp value each. Each is actually a 1 gp piece of quartz. The other chest contains 10,000 copper pieces magicked to appear as platinum when they are first discovered.": "东边的箱子里有10,000颗宝石，最初看起来每颗宝石的价值不低于50GP。实际上每颗都是一块1GP的石英。另一个箱子里有10,000个铜块，当它们第一次被发现时，被施以魔法显示为铂金。",
	"Characters who traverse the east–west corridor have no chance of discovering the north–south route that adjoins it. The two doors to the north are magical, such that they don't exist except for characters who approach and open them from the north.": "穿越东西向走廊的角色没有机会发现与之相邻的南北向路线。北边的两扇门是有魔力的，所以除了从北边接近并打开的角色，它们是不存在的。",
	"The covered pit depicted on the map doesn't exist until someone opens either of the one-way doors or opens the door in the corridor while traveling east to west. When one of those events occurs, the covered pit comes into phase where shown. This pit is otherwise exactly the same as others in the place.": "在地图上所描述的有顶坑并不存在，直到有人在从东向西行进的过程中打开了任何一个单向的门或打开了走廊的门。当这些事件之一发生时，有盖的坑就会出现在图中的位置。除此之外，这个坑和其他地方的坑是完全一样的。",
	"The portal to the south can't be detected by any magical means, but a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check enables a character to notice that the wall at this location has a small opening that is metal-lined—obviously a keyhole!": "南边的入口无法用任何魔法手段探测到，但如果成功通过DC15智慧（（%0%））检查，角色就能注意到这个位置的墙上有一个金属衬里的小开口--显然是一个钥匙孔！这就是为什么我们要把它叫做 \"钥匙孔\"。",
	"Following this discovery, any attempt to force the door open by physical or magical means will be useless. But if the {@i First Key} (from {@adventure area 19|TftYP-ToH|1|19. Laboratory and Mummy Preparation Room}) is inserted in the hole and then removed, the door will sink into the floor, revealing itself to be a stone-sheathed adamantine slab of tremendous thickness. There can be no real doubt that the end of the adventure—one way or another—is near.": "在这个发现之后，任何试图用物理或魔法手段强行打开门的行为都将是无用的。但如果把{@i First Key}(来自{@adventure area 19|TftYP-ToH|1|19.

	"Beyond the door is a smallish, rectangular chamber with a ceiling that extends twenty-five feet overhead. There is a small depression a few inches deep and about two feet square in the center of the floor.": "门外是一个小型的、长方形的房间，天花板延伸到头顶25英尺。地板中央有一个几英寸深、约两英尺见方的小凹陷。",

	"The skull belongs to Acererak, the demilich who lies in wait for the characters. When they joined the halves of the First Key, that act called his soul back to the Material Plane, and their use of the Second Key to enter the vault alerted him that he must be prepared to do battle in order to survive yet more centuries.": "头骨属于Acererak，他是埋伏在这里等待人物的恶魔。当他们连接第一把钥匙的两半时，这一行为将他的灵魂唤回了物质世界，而他们使用第二把钥匙进入金库的行为提醒了他，他必须准备好战斗，以便在更多的世纪中生存。",
	"All that now remains of Acererak the lich are the dust of his bones. This bit is enough! If any of the treasure in the crypt is touched, the dust swirls into the air and forms a man-like shape. If this shape is ignored, it will dissipate in 3 rounds, for it can only advance and threaten, not harm. Any physical attack will give it 1 point of energy, however, and a damaging spell cast on it gives it a number of points of energy equal to the level of the spell slot expended (1 point for a cantrip). Each point of energy is equivalent to a hit point, and if 50 hit points are thus gained, the dust will form into a {@creature ghost} controlled by Acererak, and this thing will attack immediately. (The dust will seem to waver and fall back if it is struck by blow or spell, as if suffering actual damage, so formation of the ghost isn't too improbable.)": "巫师Acererak现在只剩下他的骨头的灰尘。这一点就足够了! 如果墓室中的任何宝物被触碰，灰尘就会在空中旋转并形成一个类似人的形状。如果这个形状被忽视，它将在3个回合内消散，因为它只能前进和威胁，不能伤害。然而，任何物理攻击都会给它带来1点能量，而对它施展的伤害性法术会给它带来与所消耗的法术槽等级相等的能量点数（咒语为1点）。每点能量相当于一个命中率，如果因此获得了50个命中率，尘埃将形成一个由Acererak控制的{@creature ghost}，这个东西将立即进行攻击。(如果尘埃被打击或咒语击中，它似乎会动摇并后退，就像遭受实际伤害一样，所以形成鬼魂并不是太不可能。)",
	"If any character is so foolish as to touch the skull of the demilich, a terrible thing occurs. Acererak rises into the air upon the touch, and it slowly scans the party prior to attacking. The {@creature demilich} has the Trap the Soul action and access to its lair actions, but not lair traits. It can tell which members of the party are the most powerful, and it uses Trap the Soul on them first.": "如果任何角色如此愚蠢地触碰了恶魔的头骨，就会发生一件可怕的事情。Acererak在触碰后升到空中，它在攻击前会慢慢地扫视整个队伍。它有困住灵魂的动作，并能使用它的巢穴动作，但没有巢穴特性。它能分辨出队伍中哪些成员是最强大的，并首先对他们使用 \"灵魂陷阱\"。",
	"There are two jewels set into the skull's eye sockets (50,000 gp rubies) and six pointed (marquis cut) diamonds set as teeth in the jaw (each diamond is worth 5,000 gp). If all these gems are filled with souls and the skull is still intact and still being opposed, it will pronounce a curse upon the remaining characters which will teleport them randomly in a 300-mile radius, each subjected to a {@spell bestow curse} spell (save DC 17) that lasts until dispelled. If the curse is removed, the character must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the character must permanently decrease one ability score by 2, or two ability scores by 1 each. This secondary effect is instantaneous and can't be dispelled.": "有两颗宝石镶嵌在头骨的眼窝里（50,000金币的红宝石），六颗尖头（侯爵式切割）的钻石作为牙齿镶嵌在下颚（每颗钻石价值5,000金币）。如果这些宝石都装满了灵魂，而头骨仍然完好无损，仍然被人反对，它就会对剩下的角色宣判一个诅咒，将他们随机传送到300英里范围内，每个人都会受到一个（%0%）的咒语（救赎DC17），持续到被驱散。如果诅咒被解除，角色必须做一个DC17的智慧拯救动作。如果救赎失败，该角色必须永久地将一项能力得分减少2分，或两项能力得分各减少1分。这个次要的效果是瞬间的，不能被驱散。",
