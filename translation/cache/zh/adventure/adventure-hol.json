	"\"The House of Lament\" is an adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who will advance to at least 3rd level by the adventure's conclusion.

	"Ages ago, the vicious warlord Dalk Dranzorg ravaged the countryside at the head of a bandit army. After conquering the lands of Count Cordon Silvra, he took the lord's fortress, Castle Laventz, as his own.": "几百年前，邪恶的军阀达克-德兰佐格率领一支强盗军队蹂躏了整个乡村。在征服了科顿-西尔维拉伯爵的土地后，他将领主的堡垒拉文茨城堡据为己有。",
	"Months later, the relentless knight Mara Silvra received word of her father's defeat. Calling in debts and intimidating mercenaries, Mara forged a small army during her grueling march home. Upon arriving, she expected to find her homeland's nobility ready to rise to her cause, but they'd been cowed and terrified by reports of Dranzorg entombing captives and rivals in his castle's walls. Calling them cowards, Mara drove her troops harshly on, suffering daily ambushes and desertions. When Castle Laventz finally came into view, Mara led less than a dozen irresolute knights. Shouting her frustrations into the night, Mara was answered by a voice from the shadows. This sinister force would give her the power to take back her home and rule her lands, but she would never leave Castle Laventz again. Without hesitation, Mara accepted the arrangement. In the same instant, Dranzorg's troops swept in and took Mara and her knights captive.": "几个月后，无情的骑士Mara Silvra收到了她父亲战败的消息。玛拉调用债务和令人生畏的雇佣兵，在艰难的回家途中组建了一支小型军队。抵达后，她期望发现她家乡的贵族们准备好为她的事业而奋斗，但他们被德兰佐格将俘虏和对手埋在他的城堡墙内的报告所吓倒和惊恐。玛拉说他们是懦夫，她严厉地驱赶着她的部队，每天都遭受伏击和逃亡。当拉文茨城堡最终进入视野时，马拉率领的骑士还不到十几个人。玛拉在夜里大喊她的挫败感，有一个声音从阴影中传来。这股邪恶的力量将给予她夺回家园和统治土地的力量，但她将永远不会再离开拉文茨城堡。毫不犹豫地，玛拉接受了这个安排。在同一时刻，德兰佐格的军队席卷而来，将马拉和她的骑士们俘虏了。",
	"Within the castle, Dranzorg showed Mara and her followers the hollow walls where they'd be buried alive. Mara's troops pleaded for their lives. Wickedly, the warlord promised to spare them if they watched their leader's entombment and spread the tale of her failure. As they agreed, Mara unleashed her rage with a supernatural, ear-bloodying scream. She slew Dranzorg barehanded and then, taking up his axe, felled the warlord's troops and her own traitorous followers.": "在城堡内，德兰佐格向玛拉和她的追随者展示了他们将被活埋的空心墙。玛拉的部队为他们的生命恳求。邪恶的是，军阀承诺如果他们看着他们的领袖被埋葬并传播她失败的故事，就会放过他们。当他们同意时，玛拉释放了她的愤怒，发出了超自然的、令人耳目一新的尖叫声。她赤手空拳杀死了德兰佐格，然后拿起他的斧头，杀死了军阀的部队和她自己的叛徒。",
	"Soon after, local nobles received invitations to come to Castle Laventz and celebrate Mara's victory. When each aristocrat arrived, though, they discovered they were the sole guests within a crimson-stained castle. Passing judgment on each noble for abandoning her family, Mara bricked them into her castle's walls. Rumors swiftly spread of Mara's vengeance and the castle whose walls cried. Mara was never seen again, and Castle Laventz came to be called the Castle of Lament.": "不久之后，当地的贵族们收到了邀请函，要他们到拉文茨城堡来庆祝马拉的胜利。然而，当每个贵族到达时，他们发现自己是这座染上红斑的城堡里唯一的客人。玛拉对每个抛弃家庭的贵族进行了审判，把他们塞进了她的城堡的墙壁。关于玛拉复仇的谣言迅速传开，城堡的城墙在哭泣。玛拉再也没有出现过，拉文茨城堡也被称为 \"悲哀城堡\"。",
	"Centuries passed, and Castle Laventz fell to ruins. Eventually, the successful merchant Loren Halvhrest purchased the land. By then, only one of Castle Laventz's towers remained. The frugal Halvhrest incorporated the tower into the construction of a lavish manor for his family. The Halvhrests lived peacefully in their new home for several years before mysteriously vanishing. Those who investigated found no trace of the family but were deeply unsettled by the house. Grim tales rapidly resurfaced, providing the roots for all manner of ghastly tales and a new name for the structure: the House of Lament.": "几个世纪过去了，拉文茨城堡沦为废墟。最终，成功的商人洛伦-哈尔弗雷斯特购买了这块土地。那时，拉文茨城堡的塔楼只剩下一座。节俭的Halvhrest将这座塔纳入到为他的家庭建造的豪华庄园中。Halvhrests在他们的新家平静地生活了几年，然后神秘地消失了。那些调查的人没有发现这个家庭的踪迹，但对这个房子深感不安。灰暗的故事迅速浮现，为各种可怕的故事提供了根基，并为该建筑起了一个新名字：悲哀之家。",
	"The following adventure requires the fifth edition D&D rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}).

	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这个冒险中发现的许多生物的统计数据。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，告诉你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中该生物的状态块。如果状态块出现在其他地方，冒险故事的文字会告诉你。",

	"The characters arrive at the House of Lament after a mysterious message leads them into the Mists. At the door, they meet investigators who invite them to participate in an exploration of the building. As the party initially surveys the house, it manifests subtle hauntings. The characters are then invited to participate in the first of several séances, allowing them to commune with the spirits of the house.": "在一条神秘的信息将他们带入迷雾之后，人物来到了哀伤之家。在门口，他们遇到了调查员，他们邀请他们参与对该建筑的探索。当一行人开始调查这所房子时，它表现出了微妙的鬼魂。然后，他们被邀请参加几个降神会中的第一个，使他们能够与房子的灵魂交流。",
	"Depending on the spirit summoned during the séance, the characters learn about one of the tragedies that transpired in the house. Additional séances and discoveries ultimately wake the collective spirits and sinister forces lurking in the manor, trapping the characters inside the house. Escape requires the party to defeat an ageless evil. If they don't, they'll become another group of lost spirits imprisoned within the House of Lament.": "根据降神会中被召唤的灵魂，人物会了解到房子里发生的其中一个悲剧。更多的通灵和发现最终唤醒了潜伏在庄园里的集体精神和邪恶力量，将人物困在房子里。逃脱需要当事人击败一个不朽的恶魔。如果他们不这样做，他们就会成为另一群被囚禁在哀伤之屋中的迷失的灵魂。",
	"The House of Lament is a catastrophically haunted structure. It doesn't rush to reveal its terrors, though. Rather, its history, threats, and phantasmal inhabitants reveal themselves gradually and in a variety of ways. Before leading your adventurers into the house, familiarize yourself with the varied ways the house's hauntings manifest.": "哀乐之家 \"是一个灾难性的闹鬼建筑。不过，它并不急于揭示其恐怖之处。相反，它的历史、威胁和幽灵般的居民会以各种方式逐渐显现出来。在带领你的冒险者进入这所房子之前，先熟悉一下这所房子闹鬼的各种表现形式。",
	"The House of Lament is both a domain and a Darklord, a collective of tortured spirits trapped within a single structure. The majority of these shades are nothing more than faint, rageful impressions, but a few powerful personalities remain. These remnants belonged to inhabitants of the house, desperate individuals like Mara Silvra and Dalk Dranzorg. Fractured and angry, the collective spirits within the house brood amid bitter dreams. Yet when strangers enter the domain, the spirits gradually wake, energizing the one instinct they share: to add to the number of souls bound within the house's walls.": "哀伤之屋既是一个领域，也是一个黑暗领主，是被困在一个结构中的受折磨的灵魂的集合体。这些黑影中的大多数不过是微弱的、粗暴的印象，但仍有少数强大的个性存在。这些残余属于房子里的居民，像马拉-西尔维拉和达克-德兰佐格这样绝望的人。分裂和愤怒，房子里的集体精神在痛苦的梦境中沉睡。然而，当陌生人进入这个领域时，这些灵魂逐渐醒来，激发了他们共同的本能：增加被束缚在房子墙壁内的灵魂数量。",
	"The House of Lament is capable of imposing itself over other lands and can appear in other Domains of Dread. A version of the house stands in western Borca (see {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}), and the structure can be accessed there no matter where else it appears. The house travels at the whims of the Dark Powers and might appear and linger for days or years before vanishing.": "哀伤之家能够将自己强加在其他土地上，并能出现在其他恐惧之域。这座房子的一个版本矗立在博尔卡西部（见{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}），无论它出现在哪里，都可以进入那里。这座房子随黑暗力量的变化而变化，在消失前可能会出现并徘徊数日或数年。",
	"When the House of Lament closes the borders of its domain, a powerful thunderstorm surrounds it, bringing with it strong wind and heavy precipitation (detailed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). Anyone who braves the violent storm discovers that the Mists surround the house in all directions. The Mists affect those who enter them as described in {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3|The Mists}.": "当哀伤之家关闭其领域的边界时，一场强大的雷暴环绕着它，带来了强风和强降水（详见（%0%））。任何冒着剧烈风暴的人都会发现，迷雾从四面八方围绕着房子。迷雾对进入其中的人产生影响，详见{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3|The Mists}。",
	"A mysterious malevolence lies beneath the House of Lament (see {@adventure area 31|HoL|0|31. Amber Cavity}). More a force of nature than an individual being, the Entity is a bodiless intellect that nudges those in the domain toward wickedness. As characters explore, use the Entity as a lurking manifestation of the Dark Powers, a vague glimpse of a terror even the house's spirits fear.": "在哀伤之家下面有一种神秘的恶意（见（%0%））。与其说实体是个体，不如说它是一种自然的力量，它是一种没有身体的智慧，它引导着这个领域的人走向邪恶。当人物探索时，将实体作为黑暗力量的潜伏表现，模糊地瞥见一个连房子的灵魂都害怕的恐怖。",
	"When the party enters the house, few menaces initially present themselves. As characters explore, though, spirits gradually stir to life, transforming the house into a supernatural deathtrap. The haunting within the house has two states:": "当一行人进入这所房子时，最初没有什么威胁出现。然而，随着人物的探索，精神逐渐活跃起来，将房子变成了一个超自然的死亡陷阱。房子里的鬼魂有两种状态。",
	"When living beings arrive at the house, the haunting is dormant. During this time, the unassuming structure seems typical of an abandoned house. Impressions of past events and subtle, ambient haunts transpire during this time (see \"Ambient Haunts\").": "当有生命的人来到这所房子时，闹鬼的现象就休眠了。在这段时间里，这个不起眼的结构似乎是一个典型的废弃房屋。在这段时间里，过去事件的印象和微妙的、环境性的闹鬼事件会发生（见 \"环境性闹鬼事件\"）。",
	"In the course of the adventure, the activities of the living alert the house's spirits. Once this occurs, the House of Lament closes the domain's borders, surrounds itself with the Mists, and conjures a powerful storm. Dangerous haunts occur throughout the house at this time.": "在冒险的过程中，活人的活动惊动了房子的灵魂。一旦发生这种情况，悲鸣之屋就会关闭领域的边界，用迷雾包围自己，并召唤出一场强大的风暴。在这个时候，整个房子里会出现危险的鬼魂。",
	"The house reveals its full haunting at a dramatic moment. The adventure notes events that wake the house, many surrounding the events of the third séance (see the following \"{@adventure Séances|HoL|0|Séances}\" section). Use ambient haunts and the {@book atmosphere-building tips|VRGR|4|Horror Atmosphere} from earlier in this chapter to drive the adventure toward a dramatic scene where it feels appropriate for the house to reveal its full malevolence.": "这所房子在一个戏剧性的时刻揭示了它的全部鬼魂。冒险记下了唤醒房子的事件，很多都是围绕着第三次降神会的事件（见下面的\"（%0%）\"部分）。利用环境中的鬼魂和本章前面的{@book atmosphere-building tips|VRGR|4|Horror Atmosphere}来推动冒险走向一个戏剧性的场景，在这个场景中，房子暴露出它全部的恶意是合适的。",
	"If characters prove especially persistent (or destructive), the house might wake earlier. If this occurs, the adventure's horror takes on a more in-your-face slasher quality, but there's nothing wrong with that—ditch the subtlety and go for wild shocks. Triggers that wake the house early include deliberate damage inflicted by its visitors and entering and then leaving {@adventure area 24|HoL|0|24. Children's Bedroom}.": "如果角色被证明特别顽固（或具有破坏性），房子可能会提前醒来。如果发生这种情况，冒险的恐怖就会呈现出更多当面的屠杀质量，但这并没有错--抛弃微妙的东西，追求疯狂的冲击。提前唤醒房子的触发因素包括访客故意造成的破坏以及进入后又离开（%0%）。",
	"After waking, the House of Lament will not become dormant again for several weeks.": "觉醒后，\"悲哀之家 \"在几周内不会再次休眠。",
	"Even while dormant, the house is haunted. During this time, the spirits of the house drift and sleepwalk through a structure that's changed radically over generations. Ambient haunts are glimpses of these phantasmal impressions. They're subtle and reveal themselves to only a single witness. They exist to help you develop the house's supernatural ambience and the spirits trapped within.": "即使在休眠状态下，这所房子也是闹鬼的。在这段时间里，房子的灵魂在经过几代人的努力而彻底改变的结构中漂移和梦游。周围的鬼魂是这些幻觉印象的一瞥。它们很微妙，只在一个人面前显露出来。它们的存在是为了帮助你开发房子的超自然氛围和被困在里面的精神。",
	"An ambient haunt is unsettling but can't harm characters. Use ambient haunts whenever you please to heighten the creepiness of a situation. Avoid overuse, however. If characters experience frequent haunts, the manifestations become mundane or ignorable.": "环境鬼魂让人不安，但不会伤害人物。只要你愿意，就可以使用周围的鬼魂，以增强某种情况的惊悚性。然而，要避免过度使用。如果角色经常经历鬼魂，这些表现就会变得平凡或无足轻重。",
	"Ambient haunts are fleeting visions that last scant seconds and that only one character ever sees. They appear when a character is alone or the last one to leave a room, or they are simply imperceptible to all but one character. They never manifest for the entire group. Haunts may favor appearing for certain characters, perhaps due to Dark Gifts or backgrounds individuals possess.": "周围的鬼魂是转瞬即逝的幻象，持续时间很短，只有一个角色看到。它们会在某个角色独自一人或最后一个离开房间的时候出现，或者除了一个角色之外，其他所有人都无法察觉它们。它们永远不会出现在整个团体中。闹鬼可能偏向于出现在某些角色身上，也许是由于个人拥有的黑暗天赋或背景。",

You may run more séances as you see fit.": "没有一个灵体立即说出他们的欲望。人物在灵体的房子里是陌生人，在死者接受闯入者之前，这些灵体试图通过至少三次互动来建立融洽的关系。下面几节描述的降神会概述了这些互动中所传达的信息。你可以在你认为合适的时候进行更多的降神会。",
	"Decide what questions a spirit will or won't answer. If a spirit chooses not to answer a question, they might affect the parlor's lighting or decorations in some ominous but noncommittal way. A character can ask another question if a spirit doesn't answer. Alternatively, if you're using a prop spirit board, don't move the planchette and see if the players unconsciously guide the planchette to a response.": "决定鬼魂会或不会回答什么问题。如果一个幽灵选择不回答问题，他们可能会以某种不祥但不承诺的方式影响客厅的照明或装饰。如果鬼魂不回答，角色可以再问一个问题。另外，如果你使用的是一个道具精神板，不要移动铅笔，看看玩家是否会不自觉地引导铅笔做出反应。",
	"The investigator running the séance explains that they plan to use the spirit board in {@adventure area 3|HoL|0|3. Parlor} to contact the spirits to learn why they linger here.

	"An investigator starts the final séance as they have previously. The same spirit answers this call, but its demeanor has changed.

Kitchen}中详述的闹鬼烟囱相连。任何通过DC14智力（（%%））检查成功的角色都知道这个事实，这可能有助于他们理解西奥多拉在降神会上提出的请求。拥有 \"石匠 \"特质的角色可以将其应用于这个检查。这块石头没有特殊的属性，但是在这里点燃蜡烛的角色可以满足西奥多拉的要求。",
	"The tower chamber is empty except for a suit of crimson ring mail strewn across the floor. It lies in the middle of a faded chalk drawing of the Mark of the Raven. Theodora Halvhrest made this mark to stifle the evil she felt in the tower and, particularly, around the armor.": "塔室是空的，只有一套深红色的环形邮件散落在地板上。它躺在一幅褪色的粉笔画中间，画的是乌鸦的标记。西奥多拉-哈尔弗雷斯特做了这个标记，以扼制她在塔中感受到的邪恶，尤其是在盔甲周围。",
	"This {@item ring mail|PHB} belonged to the knight Mara Silvra. The blood red suit is of an ancient style and bears the marks of repeated repairs.

	"Any character who sifts through the room's contents and succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds nothing special but notes the room's west wall is distinct from the other walls. A character can make a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check to discern the wall's nature. (A dwarf's Stonecunning trait proves useful here.)

	"The ancient wall here hides the buried ruins of Castle Laventz. While the house is dormant, this wall is impervious to harm.

	"This hollow isn't part of a larger construction, but rather a space between buried ruins. A rusted iron door is set into the wall of what used to be the ground floor of the tower. The iron door looks thoroughly rusted. As any character tries to open it, the door slams open.": "这个空洞并不是一个更大的建筑的一部分，而是埋在废墟之间的一个空间。一扇生锈的铁门被镶嵌在曾经是塔楼底层的墙上。这扇铁门看起来已经彻底生锈了。当任何角色试图打开它时，门就会砰然打开。",

Take these lives and release me!\"": "如果角色接近巨石，他们周围的空气会变得更冷。玛拉-西尔维拉（Mara Silvra）的灵魂（使用（%0%）状态块）渐渐出现在火山口上方的视野中，这是一个有着扭曲的、尖叫的特征的幽灵骑士。玛拉在攻击前大喊，试图与琥珀色巨石中的力量讨价还价。\"你这个肮脏的东西! 拿走这些生命并释放我！\"",
	"The amber monolith is a rough block of solid amber 8 feet tall, 5 feet wide, and 5 feet thick. Within drifts a smoky wisp, the last lingering vestige of a dead, hateful deity of any origin you choose. This vestige can't be harmed or controlled, and it is immune to all conditions. Any creature that touches the amber monolith forms a telepathic link with the vestige inside. The vestige tries to coax the creature into its service by offering it a Dark Gift (see {@book chapter 1|VRGR|1}).": "这块琥珀巨石是一块粗糙的实心琥珀，高8英尺，宽5英尺，厚5英尺。里面漂浮着一缕烟雾，那是一个死去的、可憎的神灵的最后遗迹，你可以选择任何来源。这个遗迹不能被伤害或控制，它对所有的条件都是免疫的。任何接触到琥珀巨石的生物都会与里面的遗迹形成心灵感应的联系。遗迹试图通过向生物提供黑暗礼物（见（%0%））来哄骗生物为其服务。",
