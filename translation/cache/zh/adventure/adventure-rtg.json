	"The stories say that at one time your people dominated everything south of the mountains; that you had the greatest, most advanced underground stronghold ever known to orc-kind. Then the cataclysm happened. You don't recall what it was, but it scattered the unified tribes to the four winds, and as you fought to survive, all that you once knew, all that you once had, was lost. Centuries have passed, and only a few of the tribes have survived and assembled under the banner of one cause!": "传说中，你们的族人曾一度主宰了山脉以南的一切；你们拥有兽人族有史以来最伟大、最先进的地下据点。然后大灾变发生了。你不记得那是什么，但它把统一的部落分散到了四面八方，当你为生存而战时，你曾经知道的一切，你曾经拥有的一切，都失去了。几个世纪过去了，只有少数部落幸存下来，并聚集在一个事业的旗帜下！这就是我们的目标。",
	"This adventure is essentially a dungeon crawl beneath the mountains west of Turmish. Ideally, characters will begin the adventure at 6th level and advance to 9th level by the end of adventure.

It's conceivable that they could return to a secure camp outside to take their rest each evening if they so choose.": "这个冒险基本上是在图尔米什以西的山脉下进行的地牢爬行。理想情况下，角色从6级开始冒险，在冒险结束时提升到9级。兽人英雄们可能需要很多天才能完全探索并清理出地下建筑群。可以想象的是，如果他们选择的话，可以在每天晚上回到外面的安全营地休息。",

	"Orcs believe that any seemingly unimportant discovery or event—a bear's claw marks on a tree, a flock of crows, or a sudden gust of wind—might be a communication from the gods.

	"Every group of orcs has particular superstitions and recognizes certain omens. These tenets vary from tribe to tribe, and are often based in events that the tribe has experienced. Each tribe detailed herein also has particular omens and superstitions to which they adhere.

	"The characters may be hard-pressed to fight here due to the number of foes. They should be encouraged to use the terrain to their advantage. If the characters are in view of the statue and use interesting tactics, consider granting them advantage on their attacks or saving throws as Ilneval shows favor on their efforts.": "由于敌人太多，人物在这里作战可能会很吃力。应该鼓励他们利用地形来发挥自己的优势。如果人物在雕像的视野中，并且使用了有趣的战术，可以考虑在他们的攻击或蓄力上给予他们优势，因为Ilneval对他们的努力表示青睐。",

One shows carvings of the orcs defeating a horde of ogres, one shows the orcs defeating a beholder, one shows an orc druid freezing dwarves in ice, and one shows an orc standing atop a pile of defeated wizards. If the characters remain here for more than a few moments, they hear curious scratching noises coming from inside the pillars.

	"This room once held services in respect of powerful orc warriors and leaders, whose bodies were sealed behind the walls upon their death. Unlike standard orcish funerary services, which often involve complete immolation or a traditional burial, these highly respected members of society were interred here so that their spirits would remain in the world for guidance and leadership. Now, however, two of the spirits have become {@creature wraith||wraiths} and the third is a {@creature banshee}; maddened by many years of silence, they have developed a hunger for life that far surpasses any desire for glory that they held in life—but should they be appeased, they may provide boons to those that come here.": "这个房间曾经为强大的兽人战士和领袖举行过仪式，他们的尸体在死后被封在墙后。与标准的兽人殡葬仪式不同的是，这些备受尊敬的社会成员被安葬在这里，以便他们的灵魂留在这个世界上，接受指导和领导。然而现在，其中两个灵魂已经变成了{@creature wraith||wraiths}，第三个是{@creature banshee}；由于多年的沉默，他们对生命的渴望已经远远超过了他们生前对荣耀的渴望--但如果他们被安抚，他们可能会给来到这里的人带来好处。",

She has become a banshee.": "尤特瑞尔带着她的熟练战士部族发动了一次又一次的突击行动。他们一次又一次地与精灵和人类发生冲突并将其歼灭，击退了那些侵占兽人圣地的人。她和她的部队会在整个战斗过程中发出可怕的原始尖叫声，在敌人中散播恐慌和不和谐。她已经成为一个女妖。",
	"In life, Klannk reputedly had an extreme desire to find and eliminate any wizards among the enemies' ranks.

	"If any of the characters carry a spellbook, a Book of Shadows, or a {@item spell scroll}, he attacks, hoping to steal the item. Torin fights until reduced to half his hit points, he gets the item he wants, or his shield guardian is destroyed, then flees. Otherwise, he tries to get the characters to battle the golems in area 72, tempting them with tales of treasure in the golem laboratory. He hopes the characters kill the golems or vice versa, then he can kill the weakened victor and claim the treasure in the room.": "如果任何一个角色携带法术书、阴影之书或（%0%），他就会攻击，希望能偷走物品。托林一直战斗到他的命中率降到一半，他得到了他想要的物品，或者他的盾牌守护者被摧毁，然后逃离。否则，他就试图让角色们与72号区域的巨魔作战，用巨魔实验室里的宝藏的故事来诱惑他们。他希望角色们能杀死格莱姆，或者反过来，然后他就能杀死虚弱的胜利者，夺取房间里的财宝。",

	"The two {@creature flesh golem||flesh golems} in this chamber are out of control after centuries of being cooped up. They attack any other creatures they notice, fighting until destroyed. After the flesh golems are destroyed, Torin and his shield guardian (see area 71) seize the moment to attack the characters or steal the spellbook in this room.": "这间屋子里的两个（%0%）在被关了几个世纪之后，已经失去了控制。它们攻击任何它们注意到的其他生物，一直战斗到被消灭。在肉甲虫被消灭后，托林和他的盾牌守护者（见第71区）会抓住时机攻击人物或偷取这个房间里的法术书。",
	"The only book on the shelf is a spellbook with the following spells: {@spell banishment}, {@spell cone of cold}, {@spell counterspell}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect thoughts}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell fly}, {@spell globe of invulnerability}, {@spell identify}, {@spell lightning bolt}, {@spell mage armor}, {@spell magic missile}, {@spell mind blank}, {@spell mirror image}, {@spell misty step}, {@spell scrying}, {@spell stoneskin}, {@spell teleport}, {@spell time stop}, and {@spell wall of force}.": "书架上唯一的书是一本法术书，里面有以下法术。{@spell banishment}, {@spell cone of cold}, {@spell counterspell}, {@spell detect magic}, {@spell detect thoughts}, {@spell fire shield}, {@spell fly}, {@spell globe of invulnerability}, {@spell identify}, {@spell lightning bolt}, {@spell mage armor}, {@spell magic missile}, {@spell mind blank}, {@spell mirror image}, {@spell misty step}, {@spell scrying}, {@spell stoneskin}, {@spell teleport}, {@spell time stop} 以及 {@spell wall of force}。",
	"As the characters enter this final area, they immediately come under the scrutiny of the {@creature balhannoth|MTF} (see appendix A) that's made its lair here. Native to the Shadowfell, the vicious, predatory balhannoth alters reality in its lair to make the place appear inviting to travelers. Once the orcs step inside, the balhannoth begins to weave its snare.": "当人物进入这个最后的区域时，他们立即受到了在这里筑巢的（%0%）（见附录A）的监视。邪恶的、掠夺性的balhannoth原产于Shadowfell，它改变了巢穴中的现实，使这个地方看起来对旅行者很有吸引力。一旦兽人走进去，巴尔汉诺斯就开始编织它的陷阱。",

	"This dungeon area is keyed to map 11.": "这个地牢区的钥匙是11号地图。",
	"All of the chambers throughout the area shown on map 11 are part of the balhannoth's lair.

The balhannoth then warps reality around it, remaking the environment so that it matches the appearance of the place the creature seeks.": "整个地图11所示区域的所有房间都是巴尔汉诺斯巢穴的一部分。多亏了一种有限的心灵感应，这种生物可以感知他人的欲望，并识别出他们希望这些欲望得到满足的地方的图像。然后，巴尔汉诺斯会扭曲它周围的现实，重塑环境，使之与该生物所寻求的地方的外观相匹配。",

Then it teleports away to feed on its victims.": "巴尔汉诺斯以恐惧和绝望为生，以其受害者经历的恐怖为乐。它通过使用扭曲现实的力量来掩盖自己的存在，直到它能抓住目标为止，从而恐吓它的猎物。然后，它传送走，以受害者为食。",
	"As you're preparing to play this adventure, you'll want to ask each of the players about their characters hopes and dreams for this expedition. This is also a good time to ask players about lines and veils as well. It's important to avoid personal triggers in an encounter like this. If they're uncomfortable speaking of these things in front of the group, provide them with a note card or other private means to communicate these with you. This should occur before they even begin wandering around the dungeon, and it can happen as part of a ‘sending-off' ritual held by the elders that set them on this task.": "当你准备进行这次冒险时，你要问每个玩家他们的角色对这次远征的希望和梦想。这也是询问玩家关于台词和面纱的一个好时机。在这样的遭遇中，避免个人的触发因素是很重要的。如果他们在小组面前谈论这些事情时感到不舒服，可以为他们提供一张便条卡或其他私人方式来与你交流。这应该在他们开始在地牢里游荡之前发生，而且可以作为让他们执行这项任务的长老们举行的 \"送行 \"仪式的一部分发生。",
	"Once the characters enter, it will be up to you to improvise the description of the areas as the balhannoth hunts them down and attempts to pick them off, one-by-one.

	"Once the orcs have cleared out the entire dungeon and destroyed the balhannoth, their combined tribes celebrate them as heroes. The new Overlox will enlist them as a group to participate as part of a special council in rebuilding and protecting their home. The new Overlox will ask the characters to donate all but 20 percent of any nonmagical treasure they might have discovered to help resupply, but they allow them to keep any magic items found.": "一旦兽人清理了整个地牢并摧毁了巴尔汉诺斯，他们的联合部落就会把他们当作英雄来庆祝。新的Overlox将征召他们作为一个团体，作为特别委员会的一部分参与重建和保护他们的家园。新的Overlox会要求这些角色捐出他们可能发现的任何非魔法宝物的20%，以帮助重新补给，但他们允许他们保留任何发现的魔法物品。",
	"Two {@creature galeb duhr} hide among the boulders, making the most of their False Appearance and {@sense tremorsense|MM}. Once the party is entirely within the chamber, they spring an attack. The galeb duhr can't be identified except by magical means, so the players will likely be surprised during the first round of combat.": "两个{@creature galeb duhr}藏在巨石中，充分利用他们的假相和{@sense tremorsense|MM}。一旦队伍完全进入密室，他们就会发动攻击。除非通过魔法手段，否则无法识别加勒布杜尔，所以在第一轮战斗中，玩家很可能会感到惊讶。"
