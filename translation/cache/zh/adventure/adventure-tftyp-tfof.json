	"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.": "欢迎来到{@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}。在这本书中，你会发现D&D历史上最致命的七个地牢，并为当前版本的游戏进行了更新。有些是承载了无数冒险者的经典之作，而有些则是较新的创作，大胆地在著名的D&D冒险圣殿中占据了一席之地。",
	"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.": "正如这些地牢给D&D玩家留下的印象一样，关于其危险的故事也在D&D多元宇宙中传播。当辉煌之城沃特迪普的夜色渐浓，打哈欠之门酒馆的壁炉暗淡成深红色时，来自整个剑海岸的冒险者--甚至是一些来自其他D&D世界的来访者，都在传颂着关于丢失宝藏的故事和传闻。",
	"A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.": "一个来自遥远的寿氏帝国的流浪者说，在地牢的墙壁上雕刻着奇怪的、淫荡的魔鬼面孔，可以在瞬间吞噬一个探险者，不留下一个可怜的灵魂经过的痕迹。",
	"A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.": "一个身穿蓝色长袍、说话带着奇怪口音的秃头严厉的巫师讲述了一个巫师从一个不知名的深湖岸边的城市领走了三件强大的武器，他把这些武器带到了一座沉睡的火山，并让冒险家们敢于进入他的巢穴，收回这些武器。",
	"A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.": "一个独眼矮人讲述了一个坠入地底的城堡的故事，其废墟矗立在一个地下小树林之上，该小树林由一棵孕育邪恶的树主导。",
	"These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.": "这些只是从法鲁恩最远的地方和其他地方传遍剑海岸的几个故事。这些小细节随着故事的进行而改变。可怕的阿塞拉克之墓在每次讲述中都会将其位置从阴暗的沼泽地转移到炙热的沙漠，再转移到其他一些禁忌的气候。在每个版本的故事中，关键因素保持不变，为故事提供了一条真实的线索。",
	"The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.": "这些故事的种子现在就在你手中。D&D最致命的地牢现在是你的冒险武器库的一部分。尽情享受吧，并记得保留一些备用的角色表。",
	"Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.": "来自哈欠门的故事》包含七个来自D&D历史上的冒险。",

	"These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as {@i Storm King's Thunder}, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.": "这些冒险提供了远离你当前战役的完美副线任务。如果你运行已出版的D&D活动，如{@i Storm King's Thunder}，这里介绍的更高级别的冒险是扩展活动的理想方式。",
	"{@i The Sunless Citadel,} written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.": "{@i The Sunless Citadel,}由Bruce R. Cordell编写，是D&D游戏第三版的第一个出版的冒险。它是为四个或五个一级玩家角色的聚会设计的。",
	"Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.": "自2000年出版以来，《无日城堡》一直被广泛认为是向新玩家介绍游戏的绝佳方式。对于那些希望首次成为地下城主的人来说，这也是一个很好的开始经验。",

Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level-seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.": "与前作一样，{@i The Forge of Fury}也是为人物在要塞中前进的过程中提供越来越强的威胁而量身定做的。那些活下来的人可望晋级到第五级--经验丰富的冒险家，准备为更大的荣耀和名声而奋斗。",
	"{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,} written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title {@i Lost Tamoachan} at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.": "{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,}由Harold Johnson和Jeff R.

	"Lawrence Schick, the author of {@i White Plume Mountain}, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but {@i White Plume} became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.": "{@i White Plume Mountain}的作者Lawrence Schick在2013年的汇编《Dungeons of Dread》中提到，他写这个冒险是为了说服Gary Gygax雇佣他做游戏设计师。他不仅得到了这份工作，而且(1%)在1979年首次出版时就立即成为了人们的最爱。",
	"The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.": "本书中的冒险版本是为一组8级的角色量身定做的。",
	"{@i Dead in Thay,} written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to {@i Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain}, and other \"killer dungeons\" throughout the history of the game.": "{@i Dead in Thay,}由斯科特-菲茨杰拉德-格雷撰写，是在第五版D&D游戏处于测试阶段时创作的。它的原始形式被用作2014年春季的D&D邂逅季的故事。这个冒险的特点是一个巨大而致命的地牢，被称为Doomvault，它是对(%%1%)以及游戏历史上其他 \"杀手地牢 \"的致敬。",
	"The version of {@i Dead in Thay} presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.": "这里介绍的{@i Dead in Thay}的版本是为了在家庭活动中使用而修改的。它是为9至11级的人物设计的。",
	"The three linked adventures that make up {@i Against the Giants} were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "构成{@i Against the Giants}的三个链接的冒险故事是在1978年创作并最初发布的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写{@i Player's Handbook}。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"The compilation of {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King} was published in 1981 as {@i Against the Giants}. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.": "{@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}和{@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}的汇编在1981年作为{@i Against the Giants}出版。这里介绍的版本是为11级的人物所设计的。",
	"Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the {@i Tomb of Horrors}.": "在D&D游戏的世界里还没有太多的东西，就有了（%0%）。",
	"The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of {@i Tomb of Horrors}, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.": "该冒险的第一个版本是在1970年代早期为Gary Gygax的个人活动精心设计的，并在1975年最初的起源游戏大会上作为官方龙与地下城活动的特色。作为高级D&D游戏的一部分，{@i Tomb of Horrors}的首次出版是在1978年。",
	"As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.": "作为一个由游戏创造者的邪恶思想所创造的角色和玩家的试验场，恐怖之墓在D&D最伟大的冒险史上是无与伦比的。只有高级别的角色才有机会活着回来，但每一个勇闯古墓的玩家都会有一生难忘的经历。",
	"To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition {@i Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide}, and {@i Monster Manual}. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.": "要运行这些冒险，你需要第五版（%0%）和（%1%）。在你和你的玩家坐下来之前，先把冒险的文字全部读一遍，也熟悉一下地图，也许可以把复杂的区域或人物一定会去的地方记下来，这样你就能在行动开始之前做好充分的准备。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@i Monster Manual} contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.": "{@i Monster Manual}包含本书中大多数怪物和NPC的状态块。当一个怪物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向怪物手册中该生物的状态块。新怪物的描述和状态块出现在附录B中。如果一个状态块在该附录中，冒险的文本会告诉你。",
	"Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the {@i Player's Handbook}. Magic items are described in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.": "书中提到的法术和非魔法物品或装备在（%0%）中描述。魔法物品在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中描述，除非冒险的文字指示你去看附录A中的物品描述。",
	"While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.": "虽然这些冒险从来都不是为了组合成一个完整的战役--最新的和最老的相隔30多年--但它们被选来提供广泛的等级游戏。只要稍加努力，你就可以只用这本书开展一个完整的活动。",
	"Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.": "从《无日城堡》开始，引导你的玩家按照本书中的顺序完成冒险。每一个冒险都提供了足够的XP，在完成冒险后，角色应该有足够高的等级来进入下一个冒险。",
	"The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.": "Yawning Portal，或其他你自己发明的或来自其他D&D设定的酒馆，为活动提供了完美的框架装置。角色们听到了每个地牢的传闻，有足够的信息来引导他们进行下一次冒险。也许一个从即将到来的冒险中抽出的友好的NPC会到酒馆寻求帮助，或者一个角色的背景的某些元素会把他们推到正确的道路上。在任何情况下，这些地牢的设计都可以很容易地移植到任何活动环境中。",
	"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.": "在沃特迪普的喧嚣中，在大律师、贵族和使者们用言语和契约战斗的城堡区，矗立着一家与其他地方不太一样的旅馆。在没有城堡区或者甚至可以被认为是辉煌之城的祖先之前，有一个地牢，而在那个地牢里，打哈欠的门的故事开始了。",
	"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.": "在过去的岁月里，强大的巫师哈拉斯特在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔楼，并深入到矮人和乌鸦最初建造的隧道中，寻找更强大的魔法力量。哈拉斯特和他的学徒们扩大了他们所发现的隧道，出于他们自己的原因在地表下挖出了新的巢穴。随着时间的推移，他们的挖掘工作逐渐发展成为今天被称为 \"地下山 \"的巨大迷宫，这是整个被遗忘之域中最大的地牢。哈拉斯特最终消失了，他的所有学徒也都消失了，但他建造的巨大建筑群至今仍在。",
	"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.": "无数年来，地下山的秘密一直被隐藏在地面世界。所有进入其大厅的人都没有回来。它作为死亡陷阱的名声越来越大，以至于在沃特迪普被判处死刑的罪犯被强行押入地牢，任其自生自灭。",
	"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.": "这一切都随着两个人的到来而改变，一个叫杜南的战士和一个叫米特的新教徒。这两个人是第一批从地下山回来的冒险家，满载着财富和魔法宝藏。米特用他的财富买了一座豪宅，而杜南则有不同的计划。杜南从冒险中退休，并购买了土地，那里有一口又深又宽的井，是地牢唯一已知的入口。围绕这口井，他建造了一个酒馆和旅店，以满足冒险者和那些寻求他们服务的人的需求，他把它称为打哈欠的入口。",
	"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.": "杜南在成功进入地下山时掠夺的一些魔法使他的寿命甚至超过了精灵的寿命。几十年来，杜南把深入地下山的工作留给了年轻的人们。然而有一天，有东西吸引他回来了。等待他从地牢中凯旋的日子变成了几个月，然后是几年。近一个世纪以来，沃特德普的公民都认为他已经死了。但有一天晚上，一个声音从井里叫了起来。起初很少有人相信这可能是杜南，但和他一样长寿的人都证明了这一点。曙光之门已经落入他的祖先手中，但杜南带着足够的财富回来，让他们悄悄退休。杜南在酒吧后面找到了他习惯的位置，为自己的安全返回举杯，然后开始为顾客服务，就像他从未离开一样。",
	"Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.": "来自法鲁恩各地的冒险者，甚至是来自多元宇宙其他地方的冒险者，都会来拜访打哈欠的入口，交流关于地下山和其他地牢的知识。大多数来访者都满足于在壁炉旁交换故事，但有时一群人在贪婪、野心或绝望的驱使下，会支付进入的费用并下井。大多数人都没能活到回程，但有足够的人带着财富和冒险故事回来，引诱其他团体尝试他们的运气。",
	"The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.": "Yawning Portal并不是D&D传说中唯一著名的酒馆。在灰鹰的自由城，矗立着绿龙客栈，它是一些最成功的远征灰鹰堡和其他地方的起点。这个地方很拥挤，烟雾缭绕。顾客们用低沉的声音交谈，任何试图在没有明确的付款意向的情况下进行交谈的人都会受到冷遇。妄想症和怀疑在这里肆虐，这与一个自由的城市相称，它站在一个被魔鬼困扰的帝国、一个被邪恶的半神牢牢控制的广阔领域，以及一个分裂的、争吵的、名义上致力于正义和福利的王国之间的交界处。在灰鹰这个疲惫不堪的世界里，利益和权力高于英雄主义。",
	"The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The \"well\" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.": "Yawning Portal的自来水室占满了建筑的第一层。直径40英尺的井提供了通往地下山的通道，占据了整个空间。这口 \"井 \"是哈拉斯特塔的全部遗迹，现在，没有了形成地下楼层的楼梯和地板，它就像一个开放的竖井一样下降了140英尺。据了解，搅屎棍、蜘蛛和更坏的东西都会从下面入侵打哈欠的门户。",
	"Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.": "酒馆二楼和三楼的阳台可以俯瞰水井，通过从酒水间升起的木质楼梯进入这两层。坐在阳台上的桌子旁的客人可以看到水井和下面的活动，视野极佳。",
	"Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to \"ride the rope\") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.": "那些想进入山下探险的人（或只是想 \"骑绳 \"的大胆游客）必须支付一块金子才能被放下去。回程也要付一块金子，事先用桶装好送上去。一旦支付了最初的费用，走几步楼梯就可以到达井口的腰部。悬挂在井中央的绳索被椽子上的横梁撬到了井口，当那些已经付款的人准备好了，他们就登上绳索，长途跋涉下去。",
	"A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.": "各种各样的奇珍异宝装饰着这个酒馆。传统上，冒险者如果从地下山找回了一件奇怪的遗物，就会把它送给杜南，作为他们成功的战利品。其他冒险者会留下这样的古玩来纪念他们对酒馆的访问，或者在与杜南打赌失败后放弃它们，杜南喜欢对进入地牢的冒险队伍的命运下注。偶尔，杜南看中的东西可以用来支付酒吧的帐单。",

	"On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.": "在安静的夜晚，\"打哈欠门户 \"的客人们聚集在自来水间的大壁炉旁，交换关于遥远地方、奇怪的怪物和宝贵的宝藏的故事。在比较繁忙的夜晚，这里就会变得喧闹而拥挤。阳台上挤满了商人和贵族，而一楼的桌子上则坐满了冒险家和他们的伙伴。几杯酒加上众人的鼓励，总能诱使一些人花钱到山下做一次短暂的旅行。大多数人都是先付钱，然后马上回来，不过也有几个雄心勃勃的人可能会临时进入地牢探险。这种准备不足的队伍很少有机会回来。",
	"Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.": "因特殊原因想进入暗山的团体一般都是在酒馆安静的时候来的。即使在这种时候，酒馆里仍有一些窥探的目光，这些潜伏者将地下山的来往消息传递给镇塔林、黑暗教派、犯罪团伙和其他感兴趣的人。",
	"Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern).

	"Four {@creature Stirge||stirges} are clinging to the chamber walls high overhead. They can see any light source that is brought into this chamber, but they are very hard to spot in turn, owing to the height of the ceiling.

	"The stream exits the south wall of the cavern through a passage only 3 feet high, half filled by water, which serves as an entrance to the troglodytes' lair (area 17).

	"To reach area 17 from this cave, a Medium or larger character must crouch down and then wade or crawl through the stream.

	"Floundering through the cold, swift stream, you emerge in a huge cavern. The ceiling must be thirty feet overhead, and the far end of the cave is lost in darkness.

	"Even characters who look closely at the roper can't tell that it's anything other than a stalagmite unless it moves. The roper is difficult to sneak up on. If a character manages to approach without alerting it, continue:": "即使是仔细观察绳索的人也无法看出它是一个石笋以外的东西，除非它移动。蟑螂是很难偷袭的。如果一个角色设法接近它而不惊动它，就继续。",

It pulls the fish toward the rock formation—and then, suddenly, a fang-filled maw gapes open in the stalagmite and devours the fish in one bite.": "一根绳索从石笋中延伸出来，将正在挣扎的洞穴鱼抓在手中。它把鱼拉向岩层--然后，突然，石笋上张开一张充满獠牙的大嘴，一口就把鱼吞了下去。",

	"The stream in {@adventure area 38|TftYP-TFoF|1|38. The Chasm} flows over the edge of the chasm and pours down into a turbulent pool.": "{@adventure area 38|TftYP-TFoF|1|38. The Chasm}的溪水流过鸿沟的边缘，倾泻到一个湍急的水池中。",
	"A thundering spray of water fills this chamber, pooling and flowing out to join a larger river to the north. The air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening. A broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool looks disturbed by tracks of some kind.": "一股雷鸣般的水柱充满了这个房间，汇集起来，流向北方的一条大河。空气是潮湿的，瀑布的轰鸣声震耳欲聋。一个宽阔的壁架向北朝河边走去，然后转向东边的视线之外。泥泞的池岸看起来被某种足迹干扰了。",
	"A character who makes a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check identifies the tracks as those of a Large reptilian creature with four feet and a long tail. The tracks lead away from the hard stone of the ledge to the north (where they can't be seen) and into the water.": "成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Survival})检查的角色可以识别出这些足迹是一种有四只脚和一条长尾巴的大型爬行动物。这些足迹从壁架的坚硬石头上向北走去（在那里看不到它们），并进入水中。",
	"Durgeddin's followers built two stone bridges when they started work on the escape route through this level. The chain ladder that drops from the north ledge of area 38 ends just above the ground in the area south of the western bridge.": "Durgeddin的追随者们在开始修建穿越本层的逃生路线时，建造了两座石桥。从38号区域的北面壁架上落下的链梯在西面桥南面的地面上结束。",
	"If the characters reached this area by using the chain ladder or otherwise descending through the chasm, read or paraphrase the following text. Adjust the information as needed if they arrive here by a different route.": "如果人物是通过链梯或其他方式通过鸿沟到达这个区域的，请阅读或转述以下文字。如果他们通过不同的路线到达这里，请根据需要调整信息。",
	"A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continues to the east.": "一条湍急的地下河在一座石桥下自东向西咆哮。链梯的底部靠近河的南岸。在桥的北侧，一个壁架继续向东。",
	"If the characters go north and cross the bridge, read:": "如果人物向北走，过了桥，就读。",
	"After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river.": "走了一小段路后，通往东边的壁架向南弯曲，第二座桥就在河上。",
	"The western bridge is safe, but the bridge to the east is not. It has settled considerably, some of its stone blocks leaning precariously. Also, the stone has a curiously pitted appearance (which was caused by Nightscale's acid breath). A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check can determine that the stone was affected by acid, although the source of the acid isn't apparent.": "西边的桥是安全的，但东边的桥却不是。它已经相当稳定，一些石块摇摇欲坠。而且，石头上有一个奇怪的坑洞（这是由夜叉的酸气造成的）。通过DC10智力({@skill Investigation}检查成功的人物可以确定石头受到了酸的影响，尽管酸的来源并不明显。",
	"The weakened bridge can't take much weight before it collapses. If more than one Small or larger creature is on the bridge at one time, or if a character in heavy armor steps onto it, the arch fails. Any creature on the span must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to catch itself on the ledge. On a failed save, a creature falls, takes 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage from falling timbers and stones, and is caught in the river's current (see \"{@adventure Fast-Flowing Water|TftYP-TFoF|1|Fast-Flowing Water}\" above).": "被削弱的桥在倒塌之前无法承受太多重量。如果同一时间有超过一个小型或大型生物在桥上，或者如果一个身穿重甲的角色踏上桥面，拱门就会失效。任何在桥上的生物都必须在DC10的灵巧救赎中成功，才能在桥架上抓住自己。如果救赎失败，生物就会坠落，受到7({@dice 2d6})来自坠落的木头和石头的重击伤害，并被卷入河水中（见上文\"{@adventure Fast-Flowing Water|TftYP-TFoF|1|Fast-Flowing Water}\"）。",
	"When the characters first approach the southeastern shore of the lake, Nightscale is dozing on her hoard on the island (area 53). The dragon is immediately alerted to their presence if the characters make noise, carry light sources, or trigger the collapse of the bridge. Otherwise, the characters don't draw the dragon's attention unless they move all the way to the ledge directly south of area 53.": "当人物第一次接近湖的东南岸时，夜叉正在岛上的囤积物上打瞌睡（区域53）。如果人物发出声音、携带光源或引发桥的坍塌，龙就会立即注意到他们的存在。否则，人物不会引起龙的注意，除非他们一直移动到53号区域正南方的壁架上。",
	"The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds southeast alongside a very large lake, apparently the source of the underground river. The cavern is quite large; the lake's far shore is lost in shadow, and the echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizable cave.": "破旧的桥通向另一个壁架，在一个非常大的湖边向东南方向蜿蜒，显然是地下河的来源。这个洞穴相当大；湖的远岸消失在阴影中，而水的回声似乎表明这是一个非常大的洞穴。",
	"When Nightscale becomes aware of intruders, the {@creature young black dragon} slips into the water, quietly swimming to a point near the three stepping stones shown on the map. Any character watching the lake can make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check contested by the dragon's Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. On a successful check, the character catches a glimpse of a serpentine form moving in the darkness.": "当夜叉意识到有入侵者时，{@creature young black dragon}就会溜进水里，悄悄地游到地图上显示的三个踏脚石附近。任何在湖边观察的人物都可以进行智慧（（%%1%））检查，并由龙的灵巧（（%%2%））检查来争夺。检查成功后，该角色会瞥见一条蛇形物体在黑暗中移动。",
	"The dragon takes full advantage of her aquatic environment and never offers an easy target to enemies. She begins combat at a range of 20 to 30 feet, raising only her head and part of her neck above the water (granting her three-quarters cover) and breathing acid. Then she submerges and waits for her breath weapon to recharge. Nightscale doesn't resort to melee combat unless she is confronted underwater. If the dragon is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, she tries to escape through the passage in {@adventure area 54|TftYP-TFoF|1|54. The Dragon's Passage}.": "这条龙充分利用她的水生环境，从不给敌人提供一个简单的目标。她在20至30英尺的范围内开始战斗，只把她的头和她的部分脖子举到水面上（给予她四分之三的掩护），并呼吸酸液。然后她潜入水中，等待她的呼吸武器充能。除非她在水下遭遇，否则Nightscale不会采用近战方式。如果龙被降低到40点或更少的命中率，她会试图通过{@adventure area 54|TftYP-TFoF|1|54. The Dragon's Passage}的通道逃跑。",
	"Nightscale isn't inclined to parley with the characters unless they surrender, give her all of their treasure, and throw their arms and armor in the lake. If the characters seriously injure her, Nightscale might bargain to buy time so she can later move her hoard. Only when she is near death does she abandon her treasure.": "Nightscale并不打算与这些人物谈判，除非他们投降，把他们所有的财宝给她，并把他们的武器和盔甲扔进湖里。如果这些人物严重伤害了她，Nightscale可能会讨价还价以争取时间，这样她就可以在以后转移她的囤积物。只有当她濒临死亡时，她才会放弃她的财宝。",
	"When the characters come into view of the island for the first time, read:": "当人物第一次进入岛屿的视野时，读。",
	"A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggesting the promise of treasure to be had.": "离岸不远处有一个三十或四十英尺宽的小岛。石笋刺向上方的天花板，黑暗的海水静静地拍打着它的海岸。它的表面有几个斑点即使在阴暗中也会闪闪发光，暗示着有可能得到宝藏。",
	"Nightscale keeps her treasure on the small island in the lake, and she spends most of her time resting here. If the characters have avoided attracting her attention so far and want to approach the island, they can do so quietly if every character's Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check meets or exceeds the dragon's passive Perception score.": "夜叉把她的财宝放在湖中的小岛上，她大部分时间都在这里休息。如果角色到目前为止都没有引起她的注意，并想接近这个岛，只要每个角色的灵巧（（%0%））检查符合或超过龙的被动感知分数，他们就可以悄悄地这样做。",
	"Nightscale has accumulated considerable wealth from her plunder of Khundrukar. Her hoard contains 6,200 sp, 1,430 gp, two garnets worth 20 gp each, a black pearl worth 50 gp, a {@item wand of magic missiles}, a {@item +2 greataxe} bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark, a {@item +1 shield}, a {@item potion of healing}, and a {@item potion of flying}.": "Nightscale从她对Khundrukar的掠夺中积累了大量的财富。她的囤积物里有6200英镑，1430金币，两颗各价值20金币的石榴石，一颗价值50金币的黑珍珠，一颗{@item wand of magic missiles}，一颗{@item +2 greataxe}带有Durgeddin的铁匠标记，一颗{@item +1 shield}，一颗{@item potion of healing}，和一颗{@item potion of flying}。",
	"Beneath the surface of a small pool is an underwater passage that links the Black Lake to the Dark Mere on the east side of the Stone Tooth. The submerged passage is about 700 feet long.": "在一个小水池的表面下是一条水下通道，它连接着黑湖和石牙东侧的黑暗沼泽。这条水下通道大约有700英尺长。",
	"The characters have overcome Khundrukar's dangerous inhabitants and looted the dragon's lair. What next?": "角色们已经克服了Khundrukar的危险居民，并洗劫了龙的巢穴。下一步是什么？",
	"If the characters return to Blasingdell, their fame as adventurers spreads. Townsfolk hail them on the street, and some might approach them with problems that can lead to further adventures. The characters can continue to use the town as a base of operations. Other developments depend on what got them here and how they leave.": "如果这些人物回到Blasingdell，他们作为冒险家的名声就会传开。镇民们在街上欢迎他们，有些人可能会向他们提出问题，从而导致进一步的冒险。角色们可以继续使用这个小镇作为行动基地。其他的发展取决于是什么让他们来到这里以及他们如何离开。",
	"While the characters are exploring the stronghold, they might find another map, perhaps on the body of an adventurer from the previous expedition, or in the library in {@adventure area 49|TftYP-TFoF|1|49. Idalla's Den}. It could lead to a different dungeon, a city in some land far away, or an as-yet-unknown location rumored to hide a fabulous treasure.": "当人物在探索据点时，他们可能会发现另一张地图，也许是在上一次探险的冒险家身上，或者在{@adventure area 49|TftYP-TFoF|1|49.

	"The characters can return to Blasingdell at any time to collect the bounty for orcs they kill or capture. If the characters eliminate all the orcs in the stronghold, the mayor honors them with a celebration attended by the eminent citizens of the town. The characters have established valuable contacts who can aid them in their later endeavors.": "角色们可以在任何时候回到布拉辛戴尔，领取他们杀死或捕获的兽人的赏金。如果角色们消灭了据点里的所有兽人，镇长就会为他们举行庆祝活动，镇上的知名人士都会参加。这些人物建立了宝贵的联系，可以在以后的工作中帮助他们。",
	"You can build an entire campaign around the duergar that occupy the Foundry. Perhaps they came here from a hidden city in even deeper caverns beneath the Sinkhole and the Black Lake. Your answers to the following questions form the basis for further adventures:": "你可以围绕占据铸造厂的杜尔加人建立一个完整的战役。也许他们是从天坑和黑湖下面更深的洞穴中的一个隐藏城市来到这里的。你对以下问题的回答构成了进一步冒险的基础。",
