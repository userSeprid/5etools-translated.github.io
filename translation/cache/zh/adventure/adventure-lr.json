	"The Sea of Fallen Stars connects the eastern and western sides of Faerûn. Many nations that border shorelines along its vast expanse also maintain major navies and trade fleets.

	"This is a story about what happens when a normally peaceful species is pushed to the point of open conflict. As elemental forces threaten the safety of the nearby locathah communities, heroes rise from among their number to strike back and defend their homes and families. {@i Locathah Rising} is a DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure designed for 9th-level characters. You can run this adventure for as few as three or as many as six players. Depending on your play style, this adventure may take several game sessions to complete, but by its conclusion the characters should advance to 10th level.": "这是一个关于当一个通常和平的物种被推到公开冲突的地步时会发生什么的故事。当元素的力量威胁到附近locathah社区的安全时，英雄们从他们中间崛起，进行反击，保卫他们的家园和家人。{@i Locathah Rising}是一个为9级人物设计的DUNGEONS & DRAGONS冒险。你可以为少至3名或多至6名玩家运行这个冒险。根据你的游戏风格，这个冒险可能需要几个游戏环节来完成，但在结束时，人物应该会提升到10级。",

Boxed text is most commonly used to describe locations or present bits of scripted dialogue.": "在不同的地方，冒险中出现了描述性的文字，这些文字是为了让玩家朗读或转述的。这种朗读的文字在像这样的方框中被抵消。盒子里的文字最常用于描述地点或呈现剧本中的对话片段。",

	"What they discover is a new risen node of elemental evil, pulsing with a power harvested by {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}, an interloping surface-dweller who has become a prophet of Umberlee, the Queen of the Depths herself.": "他们所发现的是一个新崛起的元素邪恶节点，它被{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}收获的力量所推动，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}是一个混迹于地表的人，已经成为Umberlee的先知，深渊女王本人。",
	"It's up to these normally quiet fish-folk to seal a rift Gar opened to draw power directly from the Elemental Plane of Water and put an end to his machinations.": "这就需要这些平时沉默寡言的鱼民来封住加尔打开的裂缝，直接从水元素界汲取力量，结束他的阴谋。",
	"A few years ago, four elemental prophets led their respective cults in a quasi-unified effort to rain unprecedented destruction down upon the Sword Coast.": "几年前，四位元素预言家带领他们各自的邪教组织进行了一次准统一的努力，将前所未有的破坏降临到剑海岸。",
	"{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} was one of these prophets. Dour and morose, Gar became the prophet of Olhydra, the elemental Princess of Evil Water, and the leader of the Crushing Wave cult. He was embittered by a life of suffering at the hands of others: pirates killed his family when he was young, he was forced into servitude aboard a merchant ship, and then another band of pirates left him to die on the open sea, where he lost his arm to a shark. Gar saw the elemental power of water as the only thing of value in his life and gathered others who felt similarly.": "{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}就是这些预言家之一。沉默寡言的加尔成为了邪恶水元素公主奥海德拉的先知，也是碎浪邪教的领袖。他因一生都在遭受他人的折磨而感到痛苦：海盗在他年幼时杀害了他的家人，他被迫在一艘商船上服役，然后另一伙海盗把他丢在公海上死去，在那里他被鲨鱼咬断了手臂。加尔将水的元素力量视为他生命中唯一有价值的东西，并聚集了有类似感觉的其他人。",
	"Gar wielded the elemental weapon Drown, a magical trident of great power, and his missing arm was replaced by an artificial limb in the shape of a crab's claw. As the leader of Olhydra's cult, he could channel her innate magic, which inspired awe and fear in the other Crushing Wave cultists.": "加尔挥舞着元素武器 \"淹没\"，这是一把具有巨大力量的神奇三叉戟，他缺失的手臂被一个螃蟹爪子形状的假肢所取代。作为奥海德拉邪教的领袖，他可以引导她与生俱来的魔力，这激发了其他碎浪派邪教徒的敬畏和恐惧。",
	"Fortunately for the denizens of the Sword Coast, heroes discovered the collective plots of the elemental prophets and put an end to their machinations, defeating each of them in turn, and sending each prophet back to the evil elemental being they revered and served.": "对剑海岸的居民来说，幸运的是，英雄们发现了元素先知的集体阴谋，并结束了他们的阴谋，依次打败了他们每个人，并把每个先知送回了他们所崇敬和服务的邪恶元素存在。",
	"On the Elemental Plane of Water, Gar raged in protest. Drown had been broken, and the Crushing Wave cult sundered. He faced Olhydra's displeasure, expecting to be destroyed by her wrath, and was astonished to awaken several years later, floating off the coast of Turmish in the Sea of Fallen Stars. He gripped a trident in one hand, though it was not Drown.": "在水元素位面，加尔愤怒地抗议着。淹没被打破了，破碎的波浪教派也被拆散了。他面对着奥海德拉的不满，期待着被她的愤怒所摧毁，并惊讶地在几年后醒来，漂浮在堕落星海中的图尔米什海岸边。他的一只手握着一把三叉戟，虽然那不是溺水。",
	"Gar discovered that the ancient weapon had been gifted to him by the sea goddess Umberlee who, in conjunction with Olhydra, managed to reinstate the prophet with power even more formidable than he previously enjoyed. The seas and the storms that raged above now heeded his commands, and—free of the original compact made with the other prophets—Gar could seek success unburdened by any past commitments.": "加尔发现，这把古老的武器是海神翁贝里赠送给他的，翁贝里与奥海德拉一起，设法让先知恢复了比他以前享有的更强大的力量。海洋和上面肆虐的风暴现在都听从他的命令，并且摆脱了与其他先知签订的原始契约，加尔可以不受过去任何承诺的影响而寻求成功。",
	"Gazing upon the trident, Gar looked for signs of the power that he felt surging within and was shocked when the trident spoke to him, \"I am WAVE, and we are ONE!\"": "凝视着三叉戟，加尔寻找着他感到内心涌动的力量的迹象，当三叉戟对他说话时，他感到很震惊：\"我是波浪，我们是一体的！\"",
	"With Wave in his possession, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} discovered and unlocked a node of elemental power deep beneath the waves, directly under the shipping lanes of those who transport themselves and other valuables across the Sea of Fallen Stars. There he opened a rift, drew on its power, and created a place where ships would be destroyed and dragged beneath the waves.": "有了 \"海浪\"，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}发现并解锁了海浪深处的一个元素力量节点，该节点直接位于那些将自己和其他贵重物品运过堕落星海的人的航道之下。在那里，他打开了一个裂缝，汲取了它的力量，并创造了一个地方，船只将被摧毁并被拖到海浪之下。",
	"As ship after ship has been destroyed by wind and wave, they have come to rest in close proximity to where Gar has encouraged the preternatural growth of the coral and other such sea life to create his new lair. From his aquatic home, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} foments his plans to seek out and destroy all who dare to cross these waters without paying the proper tribute to Umberlee and Olhydra.": "随着一艘又一艘的船被风和浪摧毁，它们在加尔鼓励珊瑚和其他此类海洋生物超自然生长以创造他的新巢穴的地方附近休息。在他的水生家园里，{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}酝酿着他的计划，寻找并摧毁所有敢于穿越这些水域而不向Umberlee和Olhydra支付适当贡品的人。",
	"Unfortunately for Gar, his newfound power has drawn the attention of wizards of both Turmish and Thay. More fortunately for Gar, these two great nations are so embroiled in their own conflict with one another that neither has the resources to devote to exploring this newly charted area of danger. Instead, their ships choose to chart a course around the area, avoiding it altogether for the time being.": "对加尔来说，不幸的是，他新发现的力量已经引起了图尔米什和泰伊两国巫师的注意。对加尔来说更幸运的是，这两个伟大的国家都深陷于他们自己的冲突之中，以至于他们都没有资源来探索这个新绘制的危险区域。相反，他们的船只选择绕过该地区的航线，暂时完全避开它。",
	"Who might stand against the might of the elemental prophet? Perhaps new heroes will come to surface and seek out the source of these calamities. Coming from a quiet race of fish-folk, the locathah are indeed alarmed at the violent turn the waves have taken so near their home. Even now, champions rise from their ranks to seek answers and make the Sea of Fallen Stars safe once more for their people. This adventure includes the use of locathah as a playable character race, presented here for your enjoyment.": "谁可能对抗元素先知的力量？也许新的英雄们会浮出水面，寻找这些灾难的源头。来自于一个安静的鱼民种族，Locathah人确实对海浪在他们的家园附近发生的剧烈变化感到震惊。即使是现在，他们中的冠军们也在寻找答案，并使堕落之星之海对他们的人民再次安全。这场冒险包括使用locathah作为可玩的角色种族，在这里为你提供享受。",
	"While it's clear that Olhydra is an evil entity, and Umberlee, while destructive, isn't always seen in an evil light, for the purpose of this adventure the character of the sea god Umberlee is biased toward her more evil aspect by the nature of her \"Chosen,\" {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}.": "虽然很明显，奥海德拉是一个邪恶的实体，而翁贝里虽然具有破坏性，但并不总是以邪恶的眼光来看待，为了这次冒险的目的，海神翁贝里的性格因其 \"神选者 \"的性质而偏向于她更邪恶的一面，（%0%）。",
	"Gar is most definitely evil, and his plans target other creatures and NPCs as victims in this scenario, despite the fact that they're also evil. Because of this, the NPCs who come to understand the threat that Gar poses to them and their interests see the characters as an opportunity to strike back at their diabolical host, and will cooperate to the best of their ability.": "加尔无疑是邪恶的，他的计划将其他生物和NPC作为这个场景的受害者，尽管他们也是邪恶的。正因为如此，那些了解到加尔对他们和他们的利益构成威胁的NPC将这些角色视为对他们邪恶的主人进行反击的机会，并会尽其所能进行合作。",
	"At the beginning of the adventure, set the scene by reading following boxed text aloud:": "在冒险开始时，通过大声朗读以下方框内的文字来设置场景。",
	"For the last few moon cycles, a war has waged among those who dwell above the waves. The lands called Turmish and Thay are at war. This conflict has become so violent and strange that it's even spread beneath the waves. Those from Thay summon foul undead beings to do their bidding, and even launched an assault on the sea elf city of Myth Nantar! Outrageous!": "在过去的几个月亮周期里，一场战争在那些居住在海浪之上的人之间展开了。被称为Turmish和Thay的土地正在交战。这场冲突已经变得如此暴力和奇怪，甚至蔓延到了海浪之下。那些来自泰伊的人召唤肮脏的不死生物来为他们服务，甚至对海精灵城市神话南塔发起了攻击！这让人难以置信。太离谱了!",
	"During these conflicts, each of you have assisted the Turmish in driving these foul undead creatures away, and in this endeavor you have experienced both glorious successes and dismal failures.": "在这些冲突中，你们每个人都协助图尔米什人赶走了这些肮脏的不死生物，在这一努力中，你们既经历了光荣的成功，也经历了惨痛的失败。",
	"Recently, the waters in a nearby area have grown swift and angry, and the skies above show no blue or beautiful bright light. Many ships from the surface have sunk in this 'darkening' and the coral has quickly grown to envelope the remains, so quickly as to no doubt be unnatural.": "最近，附近地区的水域变得湍急而愤怒，上方的天空没有显示出蓝色或美丽的亮光。许多来自海面的船只在这种 \"黑暗化 \"中沉没，珊瑚迅速生长，将遗体包裹起来，其速度之快，无疑是不自然的。",
	"The elders are worried, as the source of this strangeness remains unknown. The Turmish and Thayans are too busy with their conflicts to notice, and so it is up to you brave heroes to travel into the darkening and discover what evil has come to reside so near your shoals.": "长老们很担心，因为这种奇怪的东西的来源仍然不明。Turmish和Thayans正忙于他们的冲突而无暇顾及，因此，这就需要你们这些勇敢的英雄们前往黑暗中，发现什么邪恶的东西会在你们的海岸附近出现。",
	"Whether you're playing with the pregenerated characters or your players have created locathah heroes of their own (see \"{@adventure Appendix B: Locathah Characters|LR|3}\"), this is a great time for the players to introduce their characters and describe them to the group.

	"After swimming for half the day, you see the \"darkening\" up ahead. It's difficult to see anything clearly within its borders, though you can vaguely make out the outline of a mountain of sunken ships resting on the sea floor, grown over with coral. No other creatures can be seen within the darkness, and the silence here is broken only by the turbulence of the water around you.": "在游了半天之后，你看到了前面的 \"黑化\"。在它的边界内很难看清楚任何东西，尽管你可以隐约看出一座沉船山的轮廓，它停在海底，上面长满了珊瑚。黑暗中看不到其他生物，只有你周围的水的动荡打破了这里的寂静。",
	"A group consisting of two {@creature Sahuagin Blademaster|GoS|sahuagin blademasters}, two {@creature Sahuagin Deep Diver|GoS|sahuagin deep divers}, and a {@creature giant shark} are circling this area, giving the characters a wide berth.

	"If the characters manage to somehow spot the sahuagin party, who do their best to remain at least one hundred feet away from them, the sahuagin immediately attack. Otherwise, they follow and watch from a distance, allowing the characters to spring any potential traps or hazards.": "如果角色们设法发现了萨瓦金人的队伍，而萨瓦金人尽力与他们保持至少100英尺的距离，那么萨瓦金人就会立即发动攻击。否则，他们就会跟在后面，在远处观察，让角色们跳出任何潜在的陷阱或危险。",

	"The presence of {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} and the rift he opened (Umberlee's Maw) have created an area in the ocean that acts like a beacon for strong, irregular currents and bad weather. Underwater, the effect manifests as a general darkness in an oddly specific area, surrounding the coral mountain that encases the many sunken ships that recently met an untimely demise.": "{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}的存在和他打开的裂缝(Umberlee's Maw)在海洋中形成了一个区域，就像强烈的、不规则的海流和恶劣天气的灯塔。在水下，这种影响表现为一个奇怪的特定区域的普遍黑暗，围绕着珊瑚山，包裹着许多最近遭遇不幸的沉没的船只。",

	"The coral mountain, comprised of recently sunken ships covered by a crunchy coral shell, is referred to as Umberlee's Maw by {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}. Normally this would include his followers as well, but at the moment they consist of a pair of sea lions that are drawn to the divine power he possesses and the undead remains of those who lost their lives when their ships sunk.": "珊瑚山由最近沉没的船只组成，上面覆盖着松脆的珊瑚壳，被{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}称为Umberlee的巨口。通常这也包括他的追随者，但目前他们由一对被他所拥有的神力吸引的海狮和那些在船只沉没时失去生命的不死之身组成。",

This makes the fight in that area easier and may allow the characters to interrupt Gar in the actions described above.": "如果角色遇到肖拉并与奥海德拉的信徒结盟，肖拉就会从他的巢穴陪同他们到{@area area 13|041|x}，把两个{@creature Water Elemental Myrmidon|MTF|water elemental myrmidons}的人带上。这使得该地区的战斗更加容易，并可能让人物在上述行动中打断加尔。",
	"Otherwise, if Shoalar is dead or simply hasn't encountered the characters, neither he nor his elementals will be present at this fight.": "否则，如果肖拉已经死了或者根本没有遇到这些人物，那么他和他的元素都不会出现在这场战斗中。",
	"Whatever the opposition looks like, and regardless of which allies they bring with them, when the characters encounter {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} they're in for the fight of their lives.": "不管对手是什么样子，也不管他们带了哪些盟友，当人物遇到（%0%）时，他们就会有一场生命之战。",
	"Each round after the young kraken is slain, Gar can harvest five gallons of blood from the creature. It takes another two rounds for him to switch from a full bladder to an empty one, so for twenty bladders it will take Gar a total of 60 rounds (6 minutes) to complete his work with the kraken's corpse. He'll only need ten bladders of blood to animate the corpses present in the coral mountain, but he hopes to perform the ritual again at a later date.": "在年轻的克拉肯被杀后的每一回合，加尔都可以从这个生物身上收获五加仑的血。他还需要两轮时间才能从一个满的膀胱切换到一个空的膀胱，因此对于20个膀胱来说，加尔总共需要60轮（6分钟）才能完成他对克拉肯尸体的工作。他只需要10个血囊就能使珊瑚山中存在的尸体复活，但他希望在以后的日子里再次进行这个仪式。",
	"The state they find Gar in, as well as what resources he has to fight them with, depends largely on when the characters arrive and who their allies are (or were). In any case, it's safe to say that Gar will open combat with his Umberlee's Wake ability, catching as many characters and allies in its massive area as he can. In addition to the impressive assortment of powers and abilities listed in his stat block, Gar can employ lair actions (see the \"Lair Actions\" sidebar) while he's within the coral mountain.": "他们发现加尔处于什么状态，以及他有什么资源来对付他们，很大程度上取决于这些人物何时到达，以及他们的盟友是谁（或曾经是谁）。在任何情况下，可以肯定地说，加尔会以他的Umberlee's Wake能力开启战斗，在其巨大的区域内尽可能多地抓捕角色和盟友。除了他的状态块中列出的各种令人印象深刻的力量和能力外，加尔在珊瑚山中时还可以使用巢穴行动（见 \"巢穴行动 \"侧边栏）。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Gar can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.": "在主动权计数20（失去主动权的平局）时，（%0%）采取一个巢穴行动，以造成下列效果之一；加尔不能连续两轮使用同一效果。",
	"Gar may teleport anywhere within the coral mountain, bringing up to five willing creatures with him.": "加尔可以传送到珊瑚山的任何地方，最多可以带着五个愿意的生物一起传送。",
	"The coral in a 60-foot radius grows rapidly around creatures inside the coral mountain. Each creature must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or become {@condition restrained}. Restrained creatures can take an action on their turn to make a DC 18 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to free themselves. This effect lasts for 1 minute unless dispelled (it counts as a 6th level spell), and doesn't require Gar to maintain concentration. {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR} and any creatures he designates are immune to this effect.": "半径60英尺的珊瑚在珊瑚山内的生物周围迅速生长。每个生物都必须在DC18力量投掷中成功，否则就会变成（%0%）。被束缚的生物可以在他们的回合中采取行动，进行DC18力量（（%1%））或灵巧（（%2%））的检查，以释放自己。这个效果持续1分钟，除非被驱散（它算作6级法术），并且不需要加尔保持注意力。{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}和他指定的任何生物都对这个效果免疫。",
	"Up to five corpses that Gar can see within 60 feet rise up as {@creature Drowned Blade|GoS|drowned blades} and attack anyone Gar directs them to on his turn.": "加尔在60英尺范围内可以看到的最多五具尸体上升为（%0%），并在他的回合中攻击加尔指示的任何人。",
	"Win or lose, this is a tough encounter, one that the characters may very well be forced to flee from. If the characters do run from Gar, he completes the ritual to animate an army of the drowned, fortifies his position at the coral mountain further, and begins a campaign of terror across the coastal settlements of the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "无论输赢，这都是一场艰难的遭遇战，角色们很可能被迫逃离。如果角色们真的逃离了加尔，他就会完成仪式，使溺水者的军队复活，进一步巩固他在珊瑚山的位置，并开始在堕落之星之海的沿海定居点进行恐怖活动。",
	"Gar is aware of Thay's power with regards to the undead, so he isn't so foolish as to challenge them with this army. Though, he might be open to an alliance with the Red Wizards that could benefit them both.": "加尔知道泰伊在亡灵方面的力量，所以他还没有愚蠢到用这支军队来挑战他们。不过，他可能对与红袍巫师的联盟持开放态度，这对他们双方都有利。",
	"It is possible, however, to defeat {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|LR}. As noted in his stat block, when Gar drops to 0 hit points his body collapses into a pool of inky water that rapidly disperses. Except for Wave and his claw, anything he was wearing or carrying is left behind.": "然而，它有可能被打败（%0%）。正如他的状态块中所指出的，当加尔下降到0命中率时，他的身体会崩溃成一滩墨色的水，迅速消散。除了波浪和他的爪子之外，他所穿戴或携带的任何东西都会被遗弃。",
	"If this happens, the characters are victorious! They could, with no small amount of cleanup, to turn the coral mountain into a beautifully misshapen but habitable home for many locathah who have been displaced by recent attacks and other conflicts.": "如果这种情况发生了，人物就胜利了！他们可以通过不小的清理，把珊瑚山变成美丽的错落有致但适合居住的家园，让许多Locathah人在最近的攻击和其他冲突中流离失所。他们可以通过不小的清理工作，将珊瑚山变成一个美丽的错落有致但适合许多因最近的袭击和其他冲突而流离失所的locathah的家。",
	"Accomplishing this would not only cement the characters' status as heroes, but elevate them to a position of prestige as potential future leaders of the locathah tribes. The details of their acclaim are up to you, though it is entirely possible—likely even—that Gar will someday return to take his revenge.": "完成这个任务不仅可以巩固人物的英雄地位，还可以提升他们的声望，使他们成为locathah部落未来的潜在领袖。他们获得赞誉的细节由你决定，尽管加尔有一天会回来报仇，这是完全可能的，甚至是很可能的。",
	"This appendix details creatures that are encountered in this adventure.": "本附录详细介绍了本次冒险中遇到的生物。",
	"See the {@race Locathah|LR} entry for information on locathah characters.": "有关locathah字符的信息，请参阅{@race Locathah|LR}条目。",
	"Otherwise, the characters are {@quickref Surprise|PHB|3|0|surprised} as the sahuagin hatchling swarms attack when they enter the chamber.": "否则，人物在进入密室时，由于萨瓦金孵化群的攻击，会有（%0%）。"
