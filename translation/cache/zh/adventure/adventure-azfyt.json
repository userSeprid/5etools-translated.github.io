	"This adventure debuts as a part of the second Ravnica Weekend, a celebration of all things Ravnica.

	"Vezska, a member of the Golgari Swarm, came upon a discarded magic item on her travels throughout the Undercity of the Tenth District. She surreptitiously had the item identified as a {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}, an item allows the user to encode and store thought strands. As a findbroker, Vezska takes discarded items and resells them to surface dwellers. Once she determined what she had, Vezska put out to her network that she was in possession of the item and got a prospective client within hours.": "Vezska，Golgari Swarm的成员，在她穿越第十区的地下城市时，发现了一个被丢弃的魔法物品。她偷偷地把这个物品鉴定为{@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}，这个物品可以让使用者编码和储存思想链。作为一个找到的经纪人，Vezska将被丢弃的物品转卖给地面居民。一旦确定了她所拥有的东西，维兹卡就向她的网络发出她拥有该物品的消息，并在几小时内得到了一个潜在的客户。",
	"The client promised a handsome sum of zinos (gold pieces) to Vezska but had a catch–the vial had to be delivered to them with three specific thoughts already captured. Vezska accepted the deal, got the information from the client on the individuals and thoughts that needed capturing, and contacted the adventurers for help.": "客户承诺给Vezska一笔丰厚的Zinos（金币），但有一个条件--小瓶必须与已经捕获的三种特定思想一起交付给他们。维兹卡接受了这笔交易，从客户那里得到了关于需要捕捉的个人和思想的信息，并联系了冒险家寻求帮助。",

	"{@i A Zib for Your Thoughts} is a short Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six 2nd-level adventurers, playable in about two hours.

	"The adventure begins with the characters in a sewer tunnel below the streets where they've arranged a meeting with Vezska, a Golgari findbroker. She came into possession of a {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}, a magic item that allows the user to capture a few thoughts and store them for later access. A client approached her and wanted to purchase not only the vial, but specific thoughts to be placed in it. Vezska decided that it was best to outsource this sort of work and contacted the adventurers.": "冒险开始时，人物在街道下面的一个下水道隧道里，他们安排了与戈尔加里找到的经纪人维兹卡会面。她得到了一个{@item vial of thought capture|azfyt}，一个允许使用者捕捉一些想法并储存起来以便日后使用的魔法物品。一个客户找到她，不仅想购买这个小瓶，还想购买要放在里面的特定思想。维兹卡决定最好把这种工作外包出去，于是联系了冒险家。",
	"Vezska presents an errand list to the adventurers, which includes names of three individuals and the specific thoughts that they need to store within the vial.

	"The adventurers must visit three individuals and find a way to get the thoughts out of each one. Each individual has reasons for holding back their information, so the party must find a way to obtain the specific thoughts–through deception, negotiation, or coercion. Once they have all three thoughts, they can return to Vezska and collect their reward.": "冒险家们必须访问三个人，并想办法从每个人那里获得思想。每个人都有隐瞒信息的理由，所以他们必须找到一种方法来获得特定的思想--通过欺骗、谈判或胁迫。一旦他们得到了所有三种思想，他们就可以回到维兹卡，领取他们的奖励。",
	"It's not just that easy, though. The {@item vial of thought capture|azfyt} is a prized item among House Dimir, a guild that trades in knowledge and secrets.

	"This dark blue vial allows you to read another's surface thoughts and capture them as thought strands, storing the strands within the vial. As an action, you can activate the vial to target a creature you can see within 10 feet of you to learn its surface thoughts and pull the thoughts learned out of the creature's head as a tangible glowing string of energy known as a thought strand. The strands can be stored in the vial for up to 24 hours or until the vial reaches capacity, in which case the oldest strands dissipate. A creature affected by the vial knows that its thoughts are being probed.": "这个深蓝色的小瓶允许你读取他人的表面思想，并将它们捕捉为思想串，将这些思想串储存在小瓶中。作为一个行动，你可以激活这个小瓶，以你10英尺范围内可以看到的生物为目标，学习它的表面思想，并将学到的思想从生物的头脑中拉出来，成为一串有形的发光的能量，称为思想串。思想串可以在小瓶中储存24小时，或者直到小瓶达到容量，在这种情况下，最古老的思想串会消散。受小瓶影响的生物知道它的思想正在被探查。",

	"Once the characters have been suitably briefed and are ready to get started, Vezska reminds them that they have 24 hours to return with the vial and the required thought strands. If they don't succeed, they don't get paid. If they ask about keeping the vial, Vezska tells them that it's hers and taking from a findbroker is a good way to wind up as fertilizer.": "一旦人物得到适当的简报并准备好开始，Vezska提醒他们，他们有24小时的时间带着小瓶和所需的思想线回来。如果他们不成功，他们就没有报酬。如果他们问起保留小瓶的问题，维兹卡告诉他们，这是她的，从一个经纪人那里拿东西是一个很好的方式，可以作为肥料结束。",

	"If a character has an appropriate contact to press for information, they can reach out to that contact for assistance.

If the contact is not particularly suited to find the requested individual, the time it takes to find their location is doubled.": "如果一个角色有合适的联系人，可以向其逼问信息，他们可以向该联系人寻求帮助。安排与联系人会面需要一个小时，而联系人找到个人的工作和住所需要{@dice 1d6}小时。如果该联系人不是特别适合寻找被请求的个人，那么找到他们的位置所需的时间就会增加一倍。",
	"Characters can go to public gathering places to attempt to find out where the individuals are located. After {@dice 1d4} hours, a character sifting through many idle conversations makes a DC 10 Charisma check.

	"After the characters have used the vial to capture at least one thought strand, a silent magical alarm is sent to the former owner of the vial to inform them that it has been used by someone else.

	"The thought spy casts {@spell disguise self} to appear as an innocuous individual (a shopkeep, librarian, etc.) and walks up to the character with the vial and asks to accompany the disguised spy back to their place for help. The thought spy takes them to a nearby House Dimir safehouse (where the other spies are waiting) and attempts to obtain the item through a Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check, {@spell charm person} spell, or by force. If the retrieval team resorts to using force, a {@creature flying horror|ggr} arrives as backup after one round of combat.": "思想间谍施展{@spell disguise self}，显示为一个无害的人（店主、图书管理员等），走到拿着小瓶的角色面前，要求陪同伪装的间谍回到他们的地方寻求帮助。被认为是间谍的人将他们带到附近的迪米尔家族安全屋（其他间谍在那里等待），并试图通过灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查、{@spell charm person}法术或武力来获得物品。如果取回物品的队伍选择使用武力，那么在一轮战斗后会有一个{@creature flying horror|ggr}的人赶来作为后援。",
	"If the spies outnumber the group with the vial (such as if the party decides to split up), they might attempt to ambush them down an alley hidden from public view. The spies do not attack to kill, having orders only to obtain the item. Any character reduced to 0 hit points by their attacks is knocked {@condition unconscious} instead of dying.": "如果间谍的人数超过携带小瓶的队伍（比如队伍决定分头行动），他们可能会试图在一个隐蔽的小巷里伏击他们。间谍们的攻击不是为了杀人，他们的命令只是为了获得这个物品。任何被他们的攻击降低到0点的角色都会被击倒（%0%）而不是死亡。",

	"It's okay for this character to have this sort of conflict and possibly their own agenda, so long as it doesn't create too much tension within the rest of the party. Remind the player that there are many cells within the Dimir and they are operating in a relatively independent fashion. Some cells may be at odds with others, so it's not unreasonable to be keeping the operative from retrieving their lost vial.": "这个角色有这种冲突，可能还有自己的议程，只要不在党内其他成员中造成太多紧张就可以了。提醒玩家，迪米尔内部有许多细胞，它们以相对独立的方式运作。有些细胞可能会与其他细胞发生冲突，所以阻止行动者取回他们丢失的小瓶也不是没有道理的。",
	"In the end, the disposition of the vial after Vezska gives it to her client could serve as a fertile seed for another adventure for that character, amongst the many other secrets that this adventure presents": "最后，在Vezska将小瓶交给她的客户后，小瓶的处置可以作为该角色另一次冒险的肥沃种子，以及这次冒险所呈现的许多其他秘密。",
