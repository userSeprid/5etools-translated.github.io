	"At the conclusion of the duels but before the characters leave the Furygale Repository, one of their opponents collapses. A moment later, another opponent falls. In seconds, all the opponents but one have collapsed. Although there's no way for the characters to know this yet, the collapsed opponents have been rendered {@condition unconscious} by the curse from {@item Murgaxor's orb|SCC}.

	"The last opponent standing blames the characters for what has happened and attacks. On their first turn, the opponent casts a spell. This proves to be a terrible mistake, as the wild magic of the Furygale Repository surges, summoning an {@creature oni}. The oni appears near the entrance to the repository and does as it pleases. Without hesitating, it moves to attack the closest conscious student. After inadvertantly summoning the oni, the opponent tries to flee, leaving the characters to fight the oni by themselves.": "最后站着的对手将所发生的事情归咎于角色并进行攻击。在他们的第一个回合，对手施放了一个法术。这被证明是一个可怕的错误，因为怒风库的狂野魔法涌现，召唤出一个（%0%）。这只鬼兽出现在贮藏室的入口附近，为所欲为。毫不犹豫地，它移动到离它最近的有意识的学生身上进行攻击。在不经意间召唤出鬼兽后，对手试图逃跑，留下人物自己与鬼兽战斗。",
	"In the course of the ensuing battle, a character can try to convince the opponent that the characters weren't responsible for rendering the other students {@condition unconscious}, doing so with a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. On a success, the opponent believes, albeit grudgingly, that the characters aren't to blame for what happened. At that point, the opponent accepts blame for summoning the oni and helps the characters defeat it.": "在接下来的战斗过程中，一个角色可以尝试说服对手，让他相信角色对其他学生（%0%）没有责任，这样做需要成功进行DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果成功，对手就会相信，尽管是勉强地相信，这些角色不应该为所发生的事情负责。在这一点上，对手接受了召唤鬼兽的责任，并帮助角色打败了它。",

	"A character who casts {@spell detect magic} on the {@condition unconscious} students discovers an aura of enchantment magic surrounding each of them, along with some strange element they can't quite place.

	"Shaking or slapping the {@condition unconscious} opponents rouses them. When they come to, the students all have terrible headaches and recall vague but dreadful nightmares. They don't know what happened to them, but some are eager to go to the infirmary. They have no more desire to duel the characters and might even be visibly scared of them. They won't publicly accuse the characters of a crime, though, as doing so would mean openly admitting that they snuck into the Furygale Repository.": "摇晃或拍打{@condition unconscious}对手会唤醒他们。当他们醒来时，学生们都有可怕的头疼，并回忆起模糊但可怕的噩梦。他们不知道自己发生了什么，但有些人急于去医务室。他们没有了与这些人物决斗的欲望，甚至可能明显地害怕他们。不过他们不会公开指责这些人物的罪行，因为这样做就意味着公开承认他们潜入了福瑞格尔贮藏室。",
	"Should Strixhaven faculty members find out about the characters sneaking into the repository, the characters are warned that further rule-breaking will result in disciplinary consequences.": "如果Strixhaven的教职员工发现了这些角色潜入储藏室，他们会被警告，进一步违反规则将导致纪律后果。",
	"During this year at Strixhaven, the characters are enrolled together in Advanced Arcane History. The course is held in a lecture hall in the Biblioplex ({@adventure area B7|SCC-CK|0|B7.

	"\"A historian interrogates the stories we tell ourselves about the past, learning how true they are—or otherwise,\" lectures Dean Tullus. \"Only by understanding the truth of the past might we learn lessons applicable to our magic in the present. Take this, for example.\" The professor reveals a translucent orb. Within it a coil of green mist endlessly knots around itself. \"I unearthed this in the Fortress Badlands during my most recent expedition. Its creator and use remain uncertain. But by investigating the reason for its creation, we stand to learn more about those who made it and how their lessons might teach us more about our own magic.\"": "\"历史学家审视我们告诉自己的关于过去的故事，了解它们的真实性--或其他方面，\"图卢斯院长讲道。\"只有通过了解过去的真相，我们才可能学到适用于我们现在的魔法的教训。以这个为例。\" 教授展示了一个半透明的球体。在它里面，一卷绿色的雾气无休止地围绕着自己打结。\"我在最近的探险中在要塞荒地发掘了这个。它的创造者和用途仍然不确定。但通过调查它的创造原因，我们可以更多地了解制造它的人，以及他们的教训如何能让我们更多地了解我们自己的魔法。\"",
	"Dean Tullus eagerly takes questions on her lecture or the relic she exhibits, but she doesn't know much about it yet. She suspects it was used as a magical focus by an ancient wizard she has yet to identify. A character who subtly casts {@spell detect magic} in class learns the object exudes an aura of enchantment.": "Tullus院长热切地接受关于她的讲座或她所展示的遗物的问题，但她对它还不是很了解。她怀疑它是被一个她还没有确定的古代巫师用作魔法焦点。一个在课堂上巧妙地施展{@spell detect magic}的角色得知该物品散发着一种魔法的光环。",
	"The class ends with a reminder that the first Exam is only a few days away and that it will test students on their knowledge of historical relics and the relics' use in magic.": "课堂结束时提醒大家，离第一次考试只有几天了，它将测试学生对历史文物和文物在魔法中的用途的知识。",

	"To meet Dean Tullus's demand for historical authenticity, a character must research Strixhaven fashion through the centuries.

While Strixhaven experiences the occasional rare fatality among the student body, that year dozens of students perished. No available record notes how the students died.
