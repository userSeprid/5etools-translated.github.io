	"Restoring Harmony is a campaign that's divided into six 1st-level mini adventures for a solo player and one longer adventure for multiple players. Each mini adventure takes approximately 45 minutes to play and the final adventure takes approximately 60–90 minutes to play.": "恢复和谐》是一个活动，分为6个适合单人游戏的一级迷你冒险和一个适合多人游戏的较长的冒险。每个迷你冒险大约需要45分钟，最后的冒险大约需要60-90分钟。",

	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more. But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。传说守护者知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",
	"The Gems of Power were long ago hidden away for safekeeping in dungeons, forests, and towers. No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在单人游戏中，角色总是有可能死亡。在单个冒险者的情况下，这种死亡会导致游戏的结束；这对于一个下午的乐趣来说并不是最理想的。避免死亡的一个方法是让冒险者随时可以得到治疗。如果他们没有治疗，让角色找到躺在尘土飞扬的箱子里的奇数（%0%），或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果吃了它，就能让他们恢复到全额命中。",
	"In the case of an untimely death, you can have a helpful NPC (like {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}) save the day and revive them, or you can have them forego death saving throws and wake up as they're being dragged someplace unpleasant.": "在意外死亡的情况下，你可以让一个有帮助的NPC（比如（%0%））来拯救他们，让他们复活，或者你可以让他们放弃死亡储蓄，在他们被拖到某个不愉快的地方时醒过来。",

	"After hanging out in the marketplace, Pink meets {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}, who asks them to find and recover the Coral Gem in the abandoned mine under Candy Mountain. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} gives Pink two ways to get there (as the DM, you may find you like a particular path, so you can choose to have {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} give Pink only one option).": "在市场上闲逛后，粉红遇到了{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，他要求他们在糖果山下的废弃矿井中找到并收回珊瑚宝石。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}给了粉红两种方法去那里（作为管理人，你可能会发现你喜欢某条路，所以你可以选择让{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}只给粉红一个选择）。",
	"Path 1 is a long tunnel that has a nasty monster, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}, who tries to eat Pink. Path 2 is an infiltration over the wall, past guards and into the mine.": "路径1是一条长长的隧道，里面有一个讨厌的怪物，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}，它试图吃掉粉红。路径2是越过墙壁的渗透，经过守卫，进入矿井。",

	"The adventure begins in the vibrant and colorful city of Harmony where mysterious \"color outages\" are beginning to cause alarm. Being NERDS, the populace of Harmony has an optimistic outlook, and tries to carry on as best they can without being too worried, but the lack of color is concerning to even the most ebullient of NERDS.": "冒险开始于充满活力和色彩斑斓的和谐市，那里神秘的 \"颜色中断 \"开始引起恐慌。作为NERDS，和谐城的居民有一个乐观的前景，并试图在不太担心的情况下尽可能地继续下去，但色彩的缺乏甚至让最热情的NERDS也感到担忧。",
	"When your player is ready, read the following:": "当你的播放器准备好了，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The city of Harmony is a lively metropolitan center. Outdoor markets feature foods and wares from around the realms. A vast library offers citizens free access to tomes of knowledge while lively entertainment venues feed the soul of the city. For nature lovers, several parks and a surrounding forest provide simpler comforts.": "和谐市是一个热闹的大都市中心。户外市场上有来自世界各地的食品和商品。一个巨大的图书馆为市民提供了免费的知识书籍，而热闹的娱乐场所则为城市注入了灵魂。对于自然爱好者，几个公园和周围的森林提供了更简单的舒适。",
	"One thing unites the city: its vibrant color. The legend of Harmony's founding tells of a magical spark that ignited the lands in spellbinding hues. Nobody knows the origin of the spark, but many have sought its source in the hopes of discovering the extent of its power.": "有一件事将这个城市联系在一起：它的鲜艳色彩。和谐城成立的传说中，有一个神奇的火花将这片土地点燃，呈现出迷人的色彩。没有人知道这个火花的来源，但许多人都在寻找它的来源，希望能发现它的力量的范围。",

	"When Pink arrives at the market, read the following:": "当粉红色到达市场时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The sprawling central market of Harmony is a maze of shop stalls and a riot of sounds and sights. Face painters and s torytellers delight their audiences. Vendors sell all kinds of wares from lanterns to shoes to spell components. The scent of delicious treats wafts through the air.": "庞大的和谐中心市场是一个商店摊位的迷宫，也是一个声音和视觉的狂欢。画脸的人和讲故事的人让他们的听众感到高兴。小贩们出售各种商品，从灯笼、鞋子到法术组件。空气中飘荡着美味佳肴的香味。",
	"Allow a moment for your player to roleplay here, exploring the market and interacting with the vendors. Florists bemoan the faded color in their flowers, other merchants say color is a natural resource that's now running out, some even wonder if Harmony has been cursed.": "让你的玩家在这里进行角色扮演，探索市场并与小贩互动。花店老板哀叹他们的花的颜色已经褪去，其他商人说颜色是一种自然资源，现在已经用完了，有些人甚至怀疑和谐是否已经被诅咒了。",
	"Here are some other fun activities for Pink:": "这里有一些其他有趣的粉红色活动。",
	"A young NERD, who looks up to Pink, wants to be a great rogue someday. Pink can teach them how to do sleight of hand, pick a lock, put on a disguise to trick a vendor they know, or some other rogue skill like how to do a flip or walk a tightrope. All these skills are DC 10 Dexterity checks (with the corresponding skill like {@skill Acrobatics} or {@skill Sleight of Hand}) and, if successful, amaze the young NERD, increasing their admiration.": "一个仰慕粉红的年轻NERD，希望有一天能成为一个伟大的流氓。粉红可以教他们如何耍花招、开锁、乔装打扮以欺骗他们认识的小贩，或者其他一些流氓技能，比如如何翻跟头或走钢丝。所有这些技能都是DC 10的灵巧检查（相应的技能如{@skill Acrobatics}或{@skill Sleight of Hand}），如果成功，会让年轻的NERD感到惊讶，增加他们的敬佩。",
	"Rose, a merchant who Pink knows well, pulls Pink aside and points to a shady NERD who's stolen some of Rose's prized jollyberries. Rose asks if Pink could steal them back. To do this, Pink must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to sneak up on the thief and then a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to swipe back the jollyberries. A failure on any of these checks can result in the thief attempting to escape or, if cornered, to provoke a fight.": "粉红熟悉的商人罗斯把粉红拉到一边，指着一个阴暗的NERD说，他偷了罗斯一些珍贵的Jollyberries。萝丝问平克能不能把它们偷回来。要做到这一点，粉红必须成功地进行DC 12灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，以偷袭小偷，然后再成功地进行DC 12灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查，以偷回jollyberries。这些检查中的任何一项失败都会导致小偷试图逃跑，或者如果被逼到墙角，就会挑起一场战斗。",
	"Wererats and other good lycanthropes have long been members of the Lorekeeper Society. Being able to turn into an innocuous animal has allowed the Lorekeeper Society to remain secret for many centuries.": "长期以来，Wererats和其他优秀的狼人都是Lorekeeper协会的成员。能够变成一种无害的动物，使守望者协会在许多世纪以来一直保持秘密。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} is the current Magister of the Lorekeeper Society and being a wererat lets him to keep a secretive eye on all matters—big and small—within Harmony.": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}是现任的罗瑞金协会的法师，作为一个狼人，他可以秘密地关注和谐社会中的所有事情--无论大小。",

He then tells Pink the following:": "当他确定他们是独自一人时，{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}启动了他的{@item gem of seeing}。当他上下打量粉红时，他的眼镜会发出魔法的光芒。然后他告诉平克以下内容。",

	"Honeycutt goes on to explain that the Lorekeeper Society needs the Coral Gem recovered. The Society hid the gem for safekeeping centuries ago in the catacombs under Candy Mountain—a once bustling mine that's long since been abandoned—but now they need the gem back. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} won't go into details about why, only that the gem is needed to solve the mystery of the color outages.": "Honeycutt继续解释说，Lorekeeper协会需要找回珊瑚宝石。协会在几个世纪前将宝石藏在糖果山下的地下墓穴中保管--一个曾经繁华的矿场，现在早已被遗弃，但现在他们需要找回宝石。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}不会详细说明原因，只说需要这颗宝石来解开颜色缺失之谜。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} knows of two entrances to the catacombs and can point Pink in the direction to either path:": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}知道两个通往地下墓穴的入口，并能为平克指出通往任何一条道路的方向。",
	"Hidden behind a fake wall near the central marketplace is the entrance to a secret tunnel that leads all the way to the catacombs under Candy Mountain. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} says that while this path offers a secret way into the mine, it could be perilous as it's unknown how well the tunnel has held up over the years.": "在中央市场附近的一堵假墙后面，隐藏着一条秘密隧道的入口，它一直通往糖果山下的地下墓穴。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}说，虽然这条道路提供了进入矿井的秘密途径，但可能会有危险，因为不知道这条隧道多年来的保存情况如何。",
	"At the base of Candy Mountain is the entrance to the old, abandoned mine. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} says the entire complex is surrounded by a slippery stone wall and guarded by eerie, faceless guards.": "在糖果山的山脚下，是废弃的老矿场的入口。{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}说，整个建筑群被一堵滑溜溜的石墙所包围，并由阴森恐怖的无脸卫兵把守。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} assumes Pink will do the job out of civic duty, but if Pink asks for monetary compensation, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} hands Pink a pouch containing 20 gp.": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}认为粉红会出于公民责任而工作，但如果粉红要求金钱补偿，{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}会递给粉红一个装有20戈比的小包。",
	"Unless Pink has other questions, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} gives them a {@item potion of healing} and leaves Pink to choose their path.": "除非粉红有其他问题，否则{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}给他们一个{@item potion of healing}，让粉红选择自己的道路。",
	"Following {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}'s directions, Pink finds the dead-end alleyway. If Pink breaks through the fake wall, they see a dusty, stone staircase that descends 20 feet beneath the city, turning into a dark tunnel that leads east under Harmony. This tunnel is on average 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall and is roughly hewn from the dirt and rock. The tunnel eventually opens out into area C5a in Candy Mountain Mine (see below).": "按照（%0%）的指示，粉红找到了死胡同。如果粉红突破了假墙，他们就会看到一条尘土飞扬的石阶，在城市下面下降了20英尺，变成了一条黑暗的隧道，在和谐城下通往东方。这条隧道平均有10英尺宽，10英尺高，是由泥土和岩石粗略凿成的。这条隧道最终通向糖果山矿区的C5a区域（见下文）。",
	"As Pink goes deeper along the tunnel, they can see holes in the walls and ceiling. These holes are too small for Pink to crawl into, but big enough for something unpleasant to hide in.": "随着粉红沿着隧道的深入，他们可以看到墙壁和天花板上的洞。这些洞对粉红来说太小了，无法爬进去，但却足以让一些不愉快的东西躲进去。",
	"Ask your player if they're comfortable with scary situations. If not, feel free to make this tunnel a mildly spooky walk in the dark with no monsters or traps. If they enjoy a good scare, then proceed with the adventure as written.": "问问你的玩家，他们是否对可怕的情况感到舒服。如果不喜欢，可以让这条隧道成为一个没有怪物或陷阱的、温和的黑暗中的幽灵之旅。如果他们喜欢惊吓，那么就按规定进行冒险。",
	"The tunnel goes for several miles, so the trek is long, giving you ample opportunity to describe creepy moments when Pink might hear something like scraping, chittering, or scratching—most likely from within the holes dotted throughout the tunnel. When your player is sufficiently creeped out, read the following:": "这条隧道有几英里长，因此，你有足够的机会来描述令人毛骨悚然的时刻，这时粉红可能会听到一些声音，如刮擦声、鸣叫声或抓挠声--很可能是来自遍布整个隧道的洞。当你的玩家被吓得够呛的时候，请阅读下面的内容。",
	"Something pale and glistening darts past you, just beyond your torchlight, and dashes into a hole in the wall.": "一个苍白闪亮的东西从你身边飞驰而过，就在你的手电筒光线之外，冲进了墙上的一个洞。",
	"When your player is really freaked out, read this:": "当你的球员真的被吓坏了，请看这个。",
	"From up ahead (or is it coming from behind you?), you hear a rasping voice that says, \"Ooooh. It smells like fresh meat has come down into the darky-dark just for {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} to feast on.\"": "从前面（还是从你身后？），你听到一个粗哑的声音，说：\"哦哦。闻起来像是新鲜的肉下到了黑暗中，只是为了让（%0%）大快朵颐。\"",
	"{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} is a wretched, carnivorous creature with slimy, mottled green skin; spooky yellow eyes; long, hooked claws; and a mouth filled with needle-sharp fangs. {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} has lived here for decades, feasting on rats and other vermin.": "{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}是一种可恶的食肉动物，有着粘稠的、斑驳的绿色皮肤；诡异的黄色眼睛；长长的、带钩的爪子；嘴里长满了针状的尖牙。(1%）已经在这里生活了几十年，以老鼠和其他害虫为食。",
	"As with anything in Harmony, the chance for friendship is possible. If {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} is treated with exceptional kindness, offered food, and won over with a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, then a truce is possible and maybe even friendship. You can make this friendship automatic without the need for a roll, if you wish.": "就像在和谐中的任何事情一样，友谊的机会是可能的。如果{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}受到特别的善待，被提供食物，并通过成功的DC14魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查赢得了他，那么休战是可能的，甚至可能是友谊。如果你愿意，你可以让这种友谊自动产生，而不需要进行检定。",
	"If friendship isn't on the table, then {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} gives chase, hoping to flush Pink into a trap and gain the advantage for an easy meal.": "如果友谊不在桌上，那么{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}就会追赶，希望把粉红冲进陷阱，获得优势，轻松吃到大餐。",
	"There are two traps:": "有两个陷阱。",
	"While navigating the dark tunnel and being harassed by {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}, Pink must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or fall into the pit, taking 3 ({@damage 1d6}) piercing damage from the spikes. {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} knows exactly where this pit trap is (and can easily avoid it) and cheers gleefully if Pink falls in. But if Pink manages to avoid the pit, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}'s curses echo through the tunnel. If Pink falls in, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} waits for Pink to climb out and then attacks.": "在黑暗的隧道中航行并受到{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}的骚扰时，粉红必须成功地进行DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检查，否则就会掉进坑里，受到3({@damage 1d6}的尖刺伤害。{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}清楚地知道这个坑的位置（并且可以很容易地避开它），如果粉红掉进去，他会高兴地欢呼。但如果粉红设法避开了这个坑，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}的诅咒就会在隧道里回响。如果粉红掉进去了，{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}会等着粉红爬出来，然后攻击。",
	"Here, the ceiling has given away, resulting in a pile of loose boulders and treacherous footing that goes on for 50 feet. Treat the rubble as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Once Pink is halfway across, {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} attacks from a hole in the ceiling. {@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC} isn't affected by the {@quickref difficult terrain||3} and moves normally.": "在这里，天花板脱落了，形成了一堆松动的巨石和危险的脚步声，一直持续了50英尺。把这些碎石当作（%0%）。一旦平克走到一半，(1%)就会从天花板的一个洞里发动攻击。{@creature Slurmy|NRH-TCMC}不受{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的影响，正常移动。",
	"{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}'s directions help Pink find Candy Mountain without much trouble. Pink can either hike through the woods or follow the main road to the entrance of the abandoned mine set into the side of the mountain face.": "{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}的指示帮助粉红找到了糖果山，没有什么麻烦。粉红可以徒步穿过树林，或者沿着大路走到镶嵌在山壁一侧的废弃矿场的入口。",
	"The following locations are keyed to the Candy Mountain Mine map:": "以下地点是以糖果山矿区地图为关键。",
	"If Pink goes to the main entrance, read the following:": "如果平克去了正门，请阅读以下内容。",
	"An overgrown dirt road leads up to a rusty iron gate set into a stone wall. Two guards that look like armored, gray mannequins stand either side of the gate. They have no discernible features.": "一条杂草丛生的土路通向一扇镶在石墙上的生锈的铁门。两个看起来像装甲的灰色人体模型的守卫站在门的两边。他们没有明显的特征。",
	"Pink can use creative methods to get past the two {@creature guard||guards} at the gate. Here are a few ideas:": "粉红可以使用创造性的方法来越过门口的两个（%0%）。这里有几个想法。",
	"Pink can put on a disguise and try to deceive the guards. To pull it off Pink must make a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. If their disguise is especially creative, Pink has advantage on the roll.": "粉红可以乔装打扮，试图欺骗守卫。为了完成这个任务，粉红必须成功地进行DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查。如果他们的伪装特别有创意，粉红在检查中就有优势。",
	"Pink can create a diversion and then sneak past the guards. Pink must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If you feel the diversion is effective, then give Pink advantage on the roll.": "粉红可以制造一个声东击西的机会，然后偷偷溜过守卫。粉红必须成功地进行DC12灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查。如果你觉得声东击西是有效的，那么就给平克在掷骰子上的优势。",
	"Pink can wait for an empty wagon to come and pick up a delivery and either sneak onto the wagon or pretend to be the delivery driver.": "粉红可以等待一辆空的马车来取货，然后偷偷溜到马车上，或者假装是送货的司机。",
	"Pink can purposely get caught and taken inside.": "粉红色可以故意被抓住，并被带到里面。",
	"If Pink is caught, one guard detains them in a 10-foot-square holding pen adjacent to the underground entrance. Pink can pick their handcuffs with a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) once the coast is clear.": "如果粉红被抓，一个警卫会把他们拘留在地下入口附近的一个10英尺见方的拘留所。一旦安全，粉红可以用成功的DC12灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）摘下他们的手铐。",
	"Alternatively, Pink can enter the mine by sneaking over the perimeter wall:": "另外，粉红也可以通过潜入围墙进入矿井。",
	"Although it's old and neglected, the 20-foot-high stone wall surrounding the mine is still formidable. To scale the wall, Pink must succeed on two consecutive DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) checks. If the first check fails, Pink falls 10 feet and takes 3 ({@damage 1d6}) bludgeoning damage. If the second check fails, Pink falls 20 feet and takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "虽然它已经很旧了，而且被忽视了，但围绕着矿场的20英尺高的石墙仍然很坚固。要爬上这堵墙，粉红必须连续进行两次DC10力量（（%0%））的检查。如果第一次检定失败，粉红会跌落10英尺并受到3({@damage 1d6})的重击伤害。如果第二次检定失败，粉红将跌落20英尺并受到7({@damage 2d6}的重击伤害。",
	"If Pink has climbing gear, they gain advantage on the checks.": "如果Pink有攀爬装备，他们在检查中获得优势。",
	"Inside the main gate are many old, dilapidated buildings in various stages of disrepair and collapse. After a brief glance, Pink easily finds the entrance to the mine—a gate made of iron bars secured by a chain and padlock. Picking the lock quietly requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. On a failure, the door still opens, but the noise alerts the kobolds in area C5d and any nearby guards. Using thieves' tools grants Pink advantage on the roll.": "大门内有许多破旧的建筑，处于不同的失修和倒塌阶段。简单地看了一眼，平克很容易就找到了矿场的入口--一扇用铁链和挂锁锁住的铁栏杆制成的大门。悄悄地撬开锁需要成功地进行DC12灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查。如果失败，门还是会打开，但声音会惊动C5d区的哥布林和附近的守卫。使用盗贼的工具可以使粉红色的优势得到体现。",

	"A staircase carved from the stone descends into the dark. Footprints are visible in the dust and the cobwebs have been recently broken.": "一个由石头雕刻而成的楼梯下降到黑暗中。灰尘中可以看到脚印，蜘蛛网最近被打破。",

	"You see a roughly hewn 30-foot-square room that still has old, rusted picks, shovels, crowbars, a wheelbarrow, and a wooden mining cart in it. Everything is covered with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs. A sloped passage exits to the north. Footprints can be seen all over the floor but most head north.": "你看到一个粗糙的30英尺见方的房间，里面还有生锈的旧镐、铲子、撬棍、一辆手推车和一辆木制矿车。一切都覆盖着一层厚厚的灰尘和蜘蛛网。一条倾斜的通道向北出口。地板上到处都可以看到脚印，但大多数都是往北走。",
	"The wooden mining cart still is operational, but unless Pink oils its wheels before rolling it, the cart makes a terrible racket that alerts the kobolds in area C5d.": "木制采矿车仍然可以使用，但除非平克在滚动它之前给它的轮子上油，否则该车会发出可怕的喧闹声，惊动C5d区的哥布林。",
	"The passageways here are even more roughly hewn and are irregular in their height and width. Here and there along the tunnels are glittering bits of the delicious rock candy that was mined here in days past. In places are puddles of water that are 6 inches or more deep; more than enough to extinguish a dropped torch.": "这里的通道凿得更加粗糙，高度和宽度都不规则。沿着隧道，这里和那里都是过去在这里开采的美味岩糖的闪亮碎片。有些地方有6英寸或更深的水坑；足以熄灭掉落的火把。",
	"Unless the kobolds were alerted, as Pink descends into the mine, they can hear heated chatter coming from the tunnels, but because of the echoing, it isn't clear which ones.": "除非哥布林被惊动了，当平克下到矿井里时，他们可以听到从隧道里传来的激烈的交谈声，但由于有回声，并不清楚是哪一个。",

	"The room has nothing of value in it, but if Pink makes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, they discover a secret door (see \"Path 1: The Secret Tunnel,\" above) that looks like a boulder set in the wall. The secret door reveals a tunnel that leads all the way back to the city of Harmony.": "这个房间里没有任何有价值的东西，但如果平克成功地进行了DC12智慧({@skill Perception})检查，他们就会发现一个秘密的门（见上面的 \"路径1：秘密隧道\"），看起来像一块镶嵌在墙上的巨石。秘密门揭示了一条隧道，它一直通往和谐城。",
	"If the player chose Path 2 and didn't take Path 1, let them go about 100 feet into the tunnel before reminding them that this could be the second entrance to the mine that leads back to Harmony.

	"If eaten, the rock candy is sweet and delicious. If Pink wants to work for 5 minutes, a pouchful of rock candy worth 5 sp can be mined from the wall. If the kobolds are in area C5d, any noise here alerts them.": "如果吃了，冰糖是甜美可口的。如果平克想工作5分钟，可以从墙上开采出一袋价值5SP的冰糖。如果哥布林在C5d区，这里的任何声音都会提醒他们。",
	"There's nothing else of interest in the room.": "房间里没有其他感兴趣的东西。",
	"The shaft leading to this area has a trip wire strung across the floor at ankle height. A successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check is needed to find it. If the trip wire is triggered, a net filled with old cans falls on the intruders. Pink must make a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or get tangled in the net and be {@condition restrained}. Pink must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a success, Pink escapes from the trap.": "通往这个区域的竖井里有一根绊马索横跨地板，高度与脚踝相当。需要通过DC14智慧（（%0%））检查才能找到它。如果绊马索被触发，一个装满旧罐子的网就会落在入侵者身上。粉红必须成功地做一个DC14的灵巧救赎，否则就会被网缠住并被（%1%）。粉红必须在他们每个回合结束时重复这个蓄力动作。如果成功，粉红就能从陷阱中逃脱。",

	"Unless they were alerted previously, there are two {@creature kobold||kobolds}, Kribbitz and Zurff, in this room bickering over how to open a 6-foot-square, locked stone box they've unearthed from a cave-in on the northernmost wall. An {@condition unconscious} kobold, Nurzle, is lying on the floor with a needle in his neck. Kobolds are reptilian Humanoids who generally shy away from conflict unless cornered.": "除非他们之前被惊动了，否则在这个房间里有两个{@creature kobold||kobolds}，克里比兹和祖尔夫，正在为如何打开他们从最北边的墙壁上的洞穴中发掘出来的一个6英尺见方的带锁石盒而争吵。一个名叫努尔兹勒（Nurzle）的哥布林（1%）正躺在地板上，脖子上插着一根针。哥布林是爬行类人形动物，除非被逼到绝境，否则一般都会回避冲突。",
	"If Pink surprises the kobolds, they try to feel out Pink and see if they can get them to open the box. After which, the kobolds attempt to steal the gem and run.": "如果粉红让哥布林们感到惊讶，他们就会试图摸清粉红的底细，看看能否让他们打开盒子。之后，哥布林们试图偷取宝石并逃跑。",
	"If they were alerted earlier, the kobolds have hidden behind some old shelving under a canvas tarp with their {@condition unconscious} friend and are waiting to see if Pink can open the box.": "如果他们早些时候被惊动了，哥布林已经和他们的{@condition unconscious}朋友躲在一些旧架子的帆布篷下，等着看平克是否能打开盒子。",
	"The stone box weighs 3,000 lb. and is made of quartzite—a very hard type of stone. The box is covered with runes and glyphs. It has a keyhole and six buttons. The lock is trapped and requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to open. On a failure, a poison needle shoots out. Whoever is picking the lock must roll a {@dice d6}.

	"If Pink manages to unlock the box, then the kobolds dash out and try to steal the gem. If Pink is ready for them, the kobolds try to intimidate, barter with, or beg Pink to hand it over. Mr. Greystone has been quite clear what will happen to the kobolds if they fail, and it isn't pleasant in the slightest.": "如果平克成功地打开了盒子，那么哥布林就会冲出来，试图偷走宝石。如果粉红准备好了，哥布林们就会试图恐吓、讨价还价，或者乞求粉红把宝石交出来。格雷斯通先生已经很清楚，如果哥布林们失败了，他们会有什么后果，而且丝毫不令人愉快。",
	"If Pink wants to make friends with the kobolds, Pink must promise that they'll protect the kobolds against the wrath of Mr. Greystone and then make a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check.

	"If Pink carefully chips away at the rock for 20 minutes and makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity check, they can free a perfect dragon tooth from the stone. If the kobolds are still in area C5d, they're alerted by any attempts to chip free a fossil.": "如果平克小心翼翼地在岩石上凿了20分钟，并成功地进行了DC15灵巧检查，他们就可以从石头上解救出一颗完美的龙牙。如果哥布林还在C5d区，他们会被任何试图撬开化石的行为所惊动。",

If Pink hands over the Coral Gem, {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} breathes a sigh of relief and then shakes Pink's hand with vigor while thanking them profusely. {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} invites Red to join the Lorekeeper Society.
