	"One power-hungry wizard's search for an arcane and dangerous artifact has finally come to an end. He has found his prize. And so new troubles begin. With his newfound power, this villainous wizard promises to conjure castles for cold-hearted mercenaries and wayward armies who pledge fealty to him. These are the early days of a plan to wage war on the Sword Coast, and it falls to the characters to fight the wizard behind it before he musters an army around the artifact he pulled from the cyan depths of Highstar Lake.": "一位渴望权力的巫师对一件神秘而危险的文物的搜寻终于有了结果。他已经找到了他的奖品。于是，新的麻烦开始了。凭借他新发现的力量，这个邪恶的巫师承诺为冷酷无情的雇佣兵和向他宣誓效忠的落魄军队变出城堡。这是一个在剑海岸发动战争的早期计划，在他围绕着他从高星湖的青色深处取出的神器召集军队之前，人物要与背后的巫师战斗。",
	"This short Dungeons & Dragons® adventure is written to suit four to six characters of 10th level. With this text and the core D&D manuals, you have everything you need to play. You may find the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide of additional use for its coverage of the High Moors of Faerûn—the chilly, grassy highlands where this adventure is set.": "这个简短的龙与地下城®冒险故事是为四到六个10级的角色编写的。有了这个文本和核心D&D手册，你就拥有了游戏所需的一切。你可能会发现《剑海岸冒险者指南》对Faerûn的高沼泽地--这个冒险的背景是寒冷的、长满草的高地--有额外的用途。",
	"This adventure is written as the finale of a five-part series. If you have not made use of the prior adventures in this series, you'll find this scenario to be the start of something rather than the end. By the finale of this adventure, the characters may be in possession of a potent and dangerously tempting artifact. What will they do with it?": "这个冒险是作为一个五部曲系列的结尾写的。如果你没有使用这个系列中以前的冒险，你会发现这个场景是一些事情的开始而不是结束。在这个冒险的结尾，角色们可能拥有一个强大的、危险的、诱人的神器。他们会用它做什么呢？",
	"The villain of this adventure—a wizard called Tyreus, from the vast city-world of Ravnica—was the antagonist of previous adventures in this series. More about his history can be discovered in those adventures. If you prefer not to dwell on the past, or if you want to substitute another villain in for ours, you can adapt this adventure to refer to a power-hungry enemy of your own. The lure and power of the Stone of Creation could attract any number of villains.": "这个冒险中的反派--一个叫Tyreus的巫师，来自广阔的城市世界Ravnica--是这个系列以前冒险中的反面人物。更多关于他的历史可以在那些冒险中发现。如果你不想纠缠于过去，或者你想用另一个反派来代替我们的反派，你可以改编这个冒险来指代你自己的一个渴望权力的敌人。创造之石的诱惑和力量可以吸引任何数量的恶棍。",
	"This adventure might be the end of this series, but it needn't be the end of the tale. What happens next is in the hands of you and your players. Whether this is the end of Tyreus or the start of the characters' control of a powerful artifact, future adventures (and consequences from this series) await.": "这次冒险可能是这个系列的结束，但它不一定是故事的结束。接下来会发生什么是在你和你的玩家手中。无论这是提瑞斯的结束，还是角色们控制强大神器的开始，未来的冒险（和这个系列的后果）都在等待着。",
	"This adventure hinges on the players' choices and their characters' tactics. So much depends on the actions undertaken by the adventurers—they are the most crucial variable in this equation.": "这次冒险取决于玩家的选择和他们角色的战术。这在很大程度上取决于冒险者的行动--他们是这个方程式中最关键的变量。",
	"Once word reaches the adventurers that a nefarious, evil wizard is summoning callous and wicked mercenaries into the High Moors with a plan to build an army, their response dictates the flow of the adventure. Everything is underway at a conjured fortress on Highstar Lake, at the northern edge of the High Moors near Faerûn's Sword Coast. That location is the heart of this short adventure, for that is where the villain dwells. When the adventurers arrive at the peculiar fortress, they find the wizard making bargains with mercenary captains. These are the first days of a grand plan to lay claim to the High Moors and besiege the surrounding lands. If the adventurers want to quash these evil schemes now, they must deal with elementals, mercenaries, and the power-hungry wizard himself. And they must hurry.": "一旦有消息传到冒险者的耳朵里，一个邪恶的巫师正在召唤冷酷无情的雇佣兵进入高沼泽，计划建立一支军队，他们的反应决定了冒险的进程。一切都在高星湖（Highstar Lake）上的一个魔法堡垒中进行，它位于高沼泽的北部边缘，靠近法鲁恩的剑海岸。这个地方是这个简短冒险的核心，因为那里是恶棍居住的地方。当冒险者们到达这个奇特的堡垒时，他们发现巫师正在和雇佣兵队长们讨价还价。这些都是一个宏伟计划的第一天，这个计划的目的是向高等摩尔人提出要求并围攻周围的土地。如果冒险家们想现在就粉碎这些邪恶的计划，他们必须对付元素、雇佣兵和渴望权力的巫师本人。而且他们必须抓紧时间。",
	"Will the adventurers launch a direct assault on the magical castle or try something more subtle? Do they seek to slay the wizard or merely rob him of his powerful artifact? What fate awaits the Stone of Creation—and who, if anyone, ends up with it?": "冒险家们是直接攻击魔法城堡，还是尝试更微妙的方式？他们是要杀死巫师，还是仅仅抢走他的强大神器？等待创造之石的是什么命运--如果有的话，谁会最终得到它？",
	"Whether this adventure feels like a climactic final confrontation with Tyreus or the start of a new challenge (or both) depends a great deal on what adventures the players and their characters have undertaken before this one. The outcome of this short adventure series, and the fate of Tyreus, is in their hands.": "这次冒险感觉是与提瑞斯的最后对抗的高潮，还是新的挑战的开始（或者两者都是），在很大程度上取决于玩家和他们的角色在这次冒险之前进行了哪些冒险。这个简短的冒险系列的结果，以及Tyreus的命运，都在他们手中。",
	"The adventurers can become involved in this scenario in several ways, whether they're continuing along from previous scenarios or entering into the fray with this one.": "冒险家们可以通过多种方式参与到这个场景中来，不管他们是继续以前的场景，还是进入这个场景的战场。",
	"Adventurers already entwined in this adventure series might have ample reason to confront Tyreus by now. They can locate him either by searching the High Moors or by following leads in Secomber, as described in \"The Lure of Power.\" Depending on what allies the adventurers have made in previous adventures, any number of NPCs could seek out the characters to let them know about a mysterious new castle on the shore of Highstar Lake and the bluecoated wizard some call the Cobalt Mage.": "已经卷入这个冒险系列的冒险者现在可能已经有足够的理由去面对泰瑞丝了。他们可以通过搜索高等沼泽地或根据塞康伯的线索找到他，如 \"权力的诱惑 \"中所述。根据冒险者们在之前的冒险中所结交的盟友，任何数量的NPC都可以找到这些角色，让他们知道高星湖畔的一座神秘的新城堡和一个被称为钴法师的蓝衣巫师的事情。",
	"Otherwise, while passing through Secomber, the adventurers could encounter mercenaries headed for Highstar Lake. The mercenaries post bills looking for sword-arms to defend the Castle of the Cobalt Mage, whom they say can grow castles from the ground. Tyreus isn't afraid of drawing the adventurers to him—he wants to face them, defeat them, and move on with his plans for the Sword Coast.": "否则，在经过塞孔伯时，冒险者可能会遇到前往高星湖的雇佣兵。佣兵们贴出了寻找剑术武器以保卫钴法师的城堡，他们说钴法师能从地上长出城堡。泰瑞丝并不害怕把冒险者引向他，他想面对他们，打败他们，并继续他在剑海岸的计划。",
	"If the players' characters have not played prior adventures in this series, they may hear rumors of mercenary companies sending warriors into the High Moors, drawn by stories of a wizard mustering an army \"and paying in conjured castles.\" These mercenary platoons are stopping all along the route to gather resources and muster troublemakers on the way, giving the adventurers plenty of time to beat them to the fortress and learn more about Tyreus and the Stone of Creation there. The Cobalt Mage doesn't hide his ambitions for power anymore.": "如果玩家的角色没有玩过这个系列的以前的冒险，他们可能会听到雇佣兵公司派战士进入高摩尔的传闻，被一个巫师召集军队的故事所吸引，\"并以魔法城堡为代价\"。这些佣兵排在沿途都会停下来收集资源，并在路上召集捣乱分子，给了冒险者足够的时间把他们打到要塞，了解更多关于提瑞斯和那里的创造之石。钴法师不再掩饰他对权力的野心了。",
	"Don't let things stagnate at the fortress. If the adventurers give Tyreus and the mercenaries time to muster forces before they intervene, that decision has consequences. The number of mercenaries on site at the fortress grows over time. The mercenary leaders (and even the elementals) move on, leaving more numerous but less potent foes behind to serve Tyreus. And those departing leaders likely each has a keystone with them, which could change the choices the adventurers make if they come into possession of the Stone of Creation.": "不要让堡垒里的事情停滞不前。如果冒险家们在干预之前给提瑞斯和雇佣兵们时间集结力量，这个决定会带来后果。在要塞现场的雇佣兵的数量会随着时间的推移而增加。雇佣军首领（甚至是元素）继续前进，留下更多但不太强大的敌人来为泰勒斯服务。而这些离开的首领很可能每人都带着一块基石，如果冒险家们得到了创造之石，就会改变他们的选择。",
	"The adventure begins when the adventurers get close enough to Tyreus's fortress to scout the area. Exactly how close that is depends on the spells and other powers available to them. The fortress is easy to spot, located right on the shore in the southwest region of Highstar Lake. The fortress also has excellent sight lines to the surrounding countryside, with at least half a mile of open wetlands and grasslands in every direction offering minimal cover to approaching creatures.": "当冒险家们足够接近泰勒斯的堡垒以侦查该地区时，冒险就开始了。具体有多近，取决于他们可用的法术和其他力量。要塞很容易发现，就在高星湖西南地区的海岸边。要塞对周围的乡村也有很好的视线，每个方向至少有半英里的开阔湿地和草地，为接近的生物提供最小的掩护。",
	"In these early days of faction-forming and army-building, Tyreus's defenses are dangerous but full of holes. The fortress is staffed with dozens of unseen servants, conjured when the fortress was. They make poor defenders but can respond to trouble by ringing the wall-mounted bells meant to summon the servants. Meanwhile, some of the mercenaries present likely stand watch atop the walls and towers, looking out for approaching trouble. They are few in number but confident in their belief that any travelers in sight are potentially trouble.": "在这些早期的派系形成和军队建设中，提洛的防御是危险的，但充满了漏洞。堡垒里有几十个看不见的仆人，他们是在堡垒存在时被召唤出来的。他们是可怜的防御者，但可以通过摇动墙上的铃铛来应对麻烦，这些铃铛是用来召唤仆人的。同时，一些在场的雇佣兵可能会站在城墙和塔楼上放哨，留意即将到来的麻烦。他们人数不多，但自信地认为，任何看到的旅行者都可能是麻烦。",
	"Tyreus has used up a number of magical resources he once possessed to form tenuous bonds with a few elementals in the region. He tasked them with scouring the lakeshore for the Stone of Creation. When it was found, just offshore amid heaps of loose stones, Tyreus used a {@spell telekinesis} spell and the elementals' help to bring the Stone into his keep's cellar vault (area 8).": "泰勒斯用尽了他曾经拥有的一些魔法资源，与该地区的一些元素人形成了脆弱的联系。他责成他们在湖岸上搜寻创造之石。当它被发现时，就在近海的一堆松散的石头中，泰勒斯使用了一个{@spell telekinesis}的咒语和元素的帮助，把石头带进了他的堡垒的地窖金库（区域8）。",
	"A handful of ill-tempered elementals still roam the area. They are not loyal to Tyreus or the mercenaries, but they welcome opportunities to do battle with Tyreus's enemies—until they grow bored with Tyreus or find better allies, that is. Then they might turn on him and his mercenaries. It is often difficult to predict the whims of elementals.": "少数脾气不好的元素仍然在这个地区游荡。他们不忠于提瑞斯或雇佣兵，但他们欢迎与提瑞斯的敌人作战的机会--直到他们对提瑞斯感到厌烦或找到更好的盟友，就是这样。然后他们可能会反过来对付他和他的雇佣兵。通常很难预测元素的心血来潮。",
	"Two {@creature air elemental||air elementals}, two {@creature water elemental||water elementals}, and one {@creature earth elemental} roam the lakeshore's waters, stony edges, and skies near the fortress.": "两只{@creature air elemental||air elementals}、两只{@creature water elemental||water elementals}和一只{@creature earth elemental}在湖边的水域、石边和堡垒附近的天空游荡。",
	"The mercenaries on site have come to see about making a client of Tyreus. He has summoned them so that he can bribe each mercenary army with a keystone of creation. Tyreus has promised each mercenary leader a fortress in exchange for their service pacifying the High Moors and bringing Secomber into his control. Neither mercenary captain has agreed—yet—but both will if given time. None of the mercenaries trust Tyreus, but they believe he can be endured long enough to build up wealth and then possibly be usurped or defeated in a few years.": "现场的佣兵们都是来看看让提瑞斯成为客户的。他召集他们是为了用创造的基石来贿赂每个雇佣军。泰勒斯答应给每个佣兵队长一座堡垒，以换取他们平定高等摩尔人的服务，并将塞康伯纳入他的控制。两个雇佣兵队长都没有同意--但如果给他们时间，他们都会同意。没有一个雇佣兵信任泰勒斯，但他们相信可以忍受他足够长的时间来积累财富，然后可能在几年内被篡夺或打败。",
	"By day, the mercenaries train in the fortress's narrow yard or the surrounding fields. By night, they drink and tell stories, occasionally meeting and mingling with their counterparts. Most of them are eager to get their keystone and leave, but Tyreus is drawing their visit out until the mercenaries' reinforcements arrive to serve and defend Tyreus.": "白天，雇佣兵们在要塞的狭窄院子里或周围的田地里训练。到了晚上，他们喝酒、讲故事，偶尔与他们的同行会面、打交道。他们中的大多数人都急于得到他们的钥石并离开，但泰雷兹正在吸引他们的访问，直到佣兵们的援军到达，为泰雷兹服务和保卫。",
	"Each of the visiting, villainous cadres consists of five {@creature mercenary envoy|AitFR-FCD|mercenary envoys} (see appendix A) and a leader who together represent a larger group of soldiers of fortune. The larger groups these envoys represent are waiting elsewhere in the Realms for their envoys to return with keystones of their own.": "每个来访的反派骨干都由五个（%0%）（见附录A）和一个领袖组成，他们共同代表着一个更大的财富士兵团体。这些特使所代表的更大的团体正在王国的其他地方等待他们的特使带着他们自己的钥石回来。",
	"Founded and led by Audra Drakesblade (female half-elf, lawful evil, {@creature gladiator}) just ten years ago, the mercenaries of the Banner of Blades have a growing reputation in the Sword Coast. Some see them as troublemakers, others as troubleshooters, but they are undeniably effective. Supposedly trained and tested by battles throughout lands to the south, rumors claim they are an invading army in disguise. In truth, the Banner of Blades has attracted outcasts, survivors, and other remnants from broken armies—soldiers who crave regimented diligence and the capable leadership Audra provides. Soldiers of the Banner see themselves not as a single army of three-hundred mercenaries but as five- and ten-person squads with reinforcements throughout the Realms. They simply all fight under the same emblem: a green banner decorated with swords arrayed in diamond formation.": "由奥德拉-德拉克斯布莱德（Audra Drakesblade）（女性半精灵，合法邪恶，{@creature gladiator}）创立并领导的刀旗雇佣兵在剑海岸的声誉越来越高。有些人认为他们是麻烦制造者，有些人认为他们是麻烦处理者，但不可否认的是他们是有效的。据称，他们在南方各地的战斗中接受过训练和考验，有传言称他们是一支伪装的入侵军队。事实上，刀锋旗吸引了被遗弃者、幸存者和其他来自残破军队的残余人员--他们渴望有组织的勤奋和奥德拉提供的得力领导。刀锋旗的士兵们认为自己不是由三百名雇佣兵组成的单一军队，而是由五人和十人组成的小队，在整个王国中都有援军。他们只是在同一个徽章下作战：一面绿色的旗帜，上面装饰着以钻石阵型排列的剑。",
	"For decades, the Iron Lions have fancied themselves a secret menace. Most fighting folk of the Sword Coast have never heard of them, and the Lions like it that way—all warfare is based on deception—leaving the Lions to boast, brag, and lie in equal measure about battles they've won or survived. Today, the Iron Lions consist of a hundred or so seasoned soldiers in search of fortune. This is the smallest their makeshift army has ever been; these are lean times. Their current commander, Gollis \"Leonid\" Stamper (male human, neutral evil, {@creature gladiator}), is the grandson of the company's founder, Goran, but he didn't inherit his role. Gollis took leadership of the Lions two years ago by coaxing his commander into a duel and slaughtering him. The emblem of the Iron Lions is a simple iron-gray lion's head on a red flag.": "几十年来，铁狮军团一直自诩为一种秘密的威胁。剑海岸的大多数战斗人员从未听说过他们，而狮子们也喜欢这样--所有的战争都建立在欺骗的基础上--使得狮子们可以对他们赢得的或幸存的战斗进行吹嘘、夸耀和撒谎。今天，铁狮军团由一百多名寻找财富的经验丰富的士兵组成。这是他们的临时军队有史以来规模最小的一次；现在是瘦身时代。他们目前的指挥官，戈利斯-\"列昂尼德\"-斯坦普（男性人类，中立邪恶，（%0%）），是公司创始人戈兰的孙子，但他并没有继承他的角色。两年前，高利斯通过哄骗他的指挥官参加决斗并宰了他，从而取得了铁狮团的领导权。铁狮会的会徽是一面红旗上简单的铁灰色狮子头。",
	"If your campaign made use of the first adventure in this series, \"In Scarlet Flames,\" these mercenaries present an opportunity to involve some familiar NPCs. Presuming they survived previous adventures and are still in the mercenary business, Lothar Stoutsmark (male human, chaotic neutral, bandit captain) and his cohorts—Gordo, Vic, and Rora (all spies)—can also be in attendance at Tyreus's fortress. They camp in the lakeshore yard. Their history with the adventurers may create new opportunities or challenges for everyone involved.": "如果你的活动使用了本系列的第一个冒险，\"在猩红的火焰中\"，那么这些雇佣兵就提供了一个机会，让一些熟悉的NPC参与进来。假设他们在之前的冒险中幸存下来，并且仍在从事雇佣兵业务，那么洛萨-斯托斯马克（Lothar Stoutsmark，男性人类，混乱中立，强盗队长）和他的同伙--戈多、维克和罗拉（都是间谍）--也可以在泰勒斯的堡垒中出现。他们在湖边的院子里扎营。他们与冒险者的历史可能会给每个人带来新的机会或挑战。",
	"Every part of the fortress mimics some aspect of another castle, keep, or fort seen by Tyreus over the years. The result is a strange hodgepodge of architectural styles, from the mundane functionality of the central guard tower to the fanciful sweeping arches of the northern and southern walls. Those walls offer little protection against any kind of military attack or siege. Their purpose is to imitate the decorative walls of a large scholastic building Tyreus admired in Ravnica.": "堡垒的每个部分都模仿了多年来提洛斯看到的另一个城堡、守卫或堡垒的某些方面。其结果是一个奇怪的建筑风格大杂烩，从中央警卫塔的世俗功能到南北城墙的梦幻般的拱门。这些墙对任何形式的军事攻击或围攻都没有提供保护。它们的目的是模仿泰勒斯在拉夫尼卡欣赏的大型学术建筑的装饰墙。",
	"Tyreus doesn't care that so much of the structure serves little purpose as a fortress. Its job is to intrigue and entice, and it doesn't have to last long. He expects to revise or dispel the fortress anyway and conjure another fortress when the mood strikes him.": "泰勒斯并不在意这么多的结构作为堡垒没有什么作用。它的工作是吸引和引诱，而且不需要持续太久。他希望无论如何都能修改或驱散这个堡垒，并在心情好的时候变出另一个堡垒来。",
	"In the towers, rooms are 9 feet high with flat, stone ceilings. In his own keep, Tyreus conjured 10-foot ceilings with decorative timber rafters from which he could hang lanterns and other details he imagined into existence.": "在塔楼里，房间有9英尺高，平坦的石头天花板。在他自己的住所里，提洛斯幻化出10英尺高的天花板，上面有装饰性的木椽，他可以在上面悬挂灯笼和其他他想象出来的细节。",
	"Most doors here are conjured wood with iron hinges and fixtures. Each door is 7 feet tall and rounded at the top.": "这里的大多数门都是用铁铰链和固定装置组成的幻化木。每扇门都有7英尺高，顶部是圆形的。",
	"Much of the fortress allows ample natural light during the day, despite the security risks. The servants light conjured torches and candles all throughout the fortress around dusk, keeping things well lit. Guests are welcome to snuff out lights overnight as they see fit.": "尽管存在安全隐患，堡垒的大部分地方在白天都有充足的自然光。仆人们在黄昏时分点燃了整个堡垒的幻化出的火把和蜡烛，保持了良好的照明。欢迎客人在他们认为合适的情况下在夜间熄灭灯光。",
	"Most areas have stone floors without rugs or rushes to soften them. Tyreus didn't think to include such details outside of his own keep. Every floor of every tower features a simple handbell hung from the wall somewhere, allowing the place's servants to be summoned—or to raise an alarm.": "大多数地区都有石板地面，没有地毯或芦苇来软化它们。泰勒斯没有想到在他自己的堡垒之外包括这样的细节。每座塔的每一层都有一个简单的手铃，挂在墙上的某个地方，可以召唤这里的仆人--或者发出警报。",
	"Each key area of the fortress is described here, often with different floors grouped together by the tower or other structure they are part of.": "这里描述了要塞的每个关键区域，通常是将不同的楼层按其所属的塔楼或其他结构归为一组。",
	"It's an impressive wooden gate with ornate iron fixtures. The door itself is etched deep with depictions of a sprawling castle beneath a starry sky and a fiery meteor rocketing in from above. The castle is filled with armored soldiers, and atop its highest tower stands a male human figure in a long coat, either welcoming or summoning the meteor.": "这是一扇令人印象深刻的木门，带有华丽的铁制装置。大门本身深深地刻画着星空下庞大的城堡和一颗火热的流星从上方飞来。城堡里到处都是装甲士兵，在最高的塔楼上站着一个身穿长衣的男性人物，他要么在欢迎流星，要么在召唤流星。",
	"The gate is typically barred from the inside. The yard within the gated wall is a small patch of grass and a wide stretch of pebbly beach lining the cold shore of Highstar Lake. The fortress does little to disrupt the winds and chill coming off the lake. This yard's primary purpose is to provide a small patch of ground where supplicants can camp and petition Tyreus—or pledge fealty to him.": "大门通常从里面有栅栏。门墙内的院子是一小片草地和一片宽阔的卵石滩，衬着高星湖寒冷的湖岸。堡垒对扰乱从湖面上吹来的风和寒意没有什么作用。这个院子的主要目的是提供一小片土地，让祈求者可以在这里扎营，向泰勒斯请愿，或者向他宣誓效忠。",
	"The waters here hide or once hid the Stone of Creation.": "这里的水隐藏着或曾经隐藏着创造之石。",
	"This spare, simple tower feels new and somehow rote. It looks sturdy but bland, built without any adornment or decorations. It serves a purpose but has nothing to say.": "这座闲置的、简单的塔给人的感觉是新的，而且不知为何很生硬。它看起来很结实，但很平淡，没有任何装饰品或装饰物。它有一个目的，但没有什么可说的。",
	"Tyreus hardly gave this tower a second thought when he conjured the fortress. He imagined it as a place for half-real guards to look out over the lakeshore gate in an endless vigil—and that is all it is.": "泰勒斯在设计这个堡垒时，几乎没有考虑过这座塔。他把它想象成一个让半真实的守卫在湖边大门上无休止地守望的地方--这就是它的全部。",
	"Other than the stairs leading up to the rest of this tower, this chamber holds only a barrel for collecting rainwater. It has no arrow loops or other openings for looking outside the fortress.": "除了通往这座塔的其他部分的楼梯之外，这个密室只放了一个收集雨水的桶。它没有箭环或其他用于观察堡垒外部的开口。",
	"This spare, bare chamber squints out at the world through narrow arrow loops.": "这个空闲的、光秃秃的房间通过狭窄的箭环斜视着世界。",
	"The taller windows in this area allow views of the outside world. Doorways open onto the crenelated battlements atop the fortress walls here, too.": "这个区域较高的窗户可以看到外面的世界。这里的门洞也可以通往堡垒墙顶的石榴裙边。",
	"This level is little more than the stone ceiling of the level below, ringed by a crenelated wall to provide easy cover to guards overseeing the lakeshore gate or surrounding countryside.": "这一层只不过是下面一层的石质天花板，由石榴裙边的墙环抱着，为监督湖岸大门或周围乡村的卫兵提供方便的掩护。",
	"Another basic tower of solid construction. It smells like fresh mortar, lake water, and the body odors and boiled dinners of the mercenaries camped here.": "又是一座结构坚固的基本塔。它闻起来像新鲜的砂浆、湖水，以及在这里扎营的雇佣兵的体味和煮熟的晚餐。",
	"The mercenaries of the Iron Lion flag have made this tower their camp. They've made themselves comfortable but do not show much respect for the place.": "铁狮旗的雇佣兵们把这座塔作为他们的营地。他们把自己弄得很舒服，但对这个地方没有表现出多少尊重。",
	"Accessible primarily via the stairs from the second floor, this space is intended as a refuge for guests or a storage area for their supplies and equipment. A door, latched from the inside only, leads out to the lakeshore.": "这个空间主要是通过二楼的楼梯进入的，目的是为客人提供一个避难所，或者作为他们的用品和设备的储存区。有一扇门，只能从里面锁上，通向湖边。",
	"Stairs lead up from the lakeshore yard, hug the inner wall, and let out here on the second floor, which has been turned into a recreational area for mercenaries.": "楼梯从湖边的院子里引出，抱着内墙，在这里的二楼放出，这里已经变成了雇佣兵的休闲区。",
	"This floor now serves as the personal quarters and command post of the mercenary leader, Gollis (male human, neutral evil, {@creature gladiator}). He keeps the room a bit of a mess, anchored by a large table to which he has a map of the High Moors pinned down with daggers. Doors lead from this room to the central guard tower and the southern arched walkway.": "这层楼现在是佣兵首领戈利斯（男性人类，中立邪恶，（%0%））的个人住所和指挥所。他把房间弄得有点乱，用一张大桌子固定着，上面用匕首钉着一张高摩尔的地图。门从这个房间通向中央警卫塔和南部的拱形走道。",
	"Low battlement walls surround an empty roof overlooking the green hills of the High Moors and the steely waters of the lake.": "低矮的城墙围绕着一个空旷的屋顶，俯瞰着高摩尔的青山和湖水的冷峻。",
	"Another basic tower of solid construction. Aside from the smell of fresh mortar, the air tastes like cinnamon branches.": "又是一座结构牢固的基本塔。除了新鲜灰泥的味道，空气中还有肉桂枝的味道。",
	"Audra's mercenaries, under her Banner of Blades, reside here for now. They conduct an orderly, regimented existence here, using cinnamon branches and incense to add comfort without diminishing their military orderliness.": "奥德拉的雇佣兵，在她的 \"刀旗 \"下，暂时居住在这里。他们在这里有条不紊地生活着，用肉桂树枝和香来增加舒适度，而不减弱他们的军事秩序。",
	"Accessible primarily via the stairs from the second floor, this space is intended as a refuge for guests or a storage area for their supplies and equipment. Audra's mercenaries sleep here. A door, latched from the inside only, leads out to the lakeshore.": "主要通过二楼的楼梯进入，这个空间是作为客人的避难所或他们的用品和设备的储存区。奥德拉的雇佣兵睡在这里。有一扇门，只从里面锁上，通向湖岸。",
	"Stairs clinging to the inner wall of the fortress lead here from the yard below. This floor serves as the gathering area for mercenaries from Audra's company; they leave someone here most of the time to watch for trouble.": "紧贴堡垒内墙的楼梯从下面的院子通往这里。这层楼是奥德拉公司的雇佣兵的聚集区；他们大部分时间都在这里留人监视麻烦。",
	"Audra (female half-elf, lawful evil, {@creature gladiator}) claimed this floor for herself. She sleeps and reads here but meets with her people downstairs. This chamber is comfortable enough, with piles of furs as a bed and half a dozen history books stacked by a deep leather chair, where she studies and plans. This floor exits onto walkways leading toward the central guard tower and the northern arched walkway.": "奥德拉（女性半精灵，合法的邪恶，{@creature gladiator}）将这层楼据为己有。她在这里睡觉和阅读，但在楼下与她的人会面。这个房间足够舒适，有成堆的毛皮作为床，半打历史书堆放在一张深色皮椅旁，她在这里研究和计划。这层楼的出口是通往中央警卫塔和北部拱形走道的人行道。",
	"This crenelated roof is bare but offers a grand view of the surrounding highlands and the crisp waves of Highstar Lake.": "这个石榴裙顶虽然光秃秃的，但可以看到周围高地和高星湖清脆的波浪的宏伟景观。",
	"High winds whistle through this area. The glittering lake ebbs below.": "大风呼啸着穿过这个地区。闪亮的湖水在下面缓缓流淌。",
	"Up here, winds are often powerful enough to impose disadvantage on ranged attacks. The low guarding walls on each side of the walkway are only 3 feet tall, offering little protection for travelers along this path. (Tyreus wants people to feel precarious on their way to visit him.)": "在这里，风的威力往往足以对远程攻击造成不利影响。走道两边的低矮守卫墙只有3英尺高，为沿途的旅行者提供很少的保护。(泰勒斯希望人们在去拜访他的路上感到不安全）。",
	"This curious architectural feature appears to have been left unguarded. Much of the floor is made up of an iron grate, through which you can see the waves of the lake dozens of feet below.": "这个奇怪的建筑特征似乎没有人看守。地板的大部分是由一个铁栅栏构成的，透过铁栅栏可以看到几十英尺以下的湖水波浪。",
	"This hanging turret, like its counterpart, is meant to appear as an architectural flourish but is also part of Tyreus's defenses against intrusion by creatures on foot.": "这个悬挂式炮塔和它的对应物一样，是为了作为建筑上的一个亮点出现，但也是提洛斯防御步行生物入侵的一部分。",
	"This tower has no ground floor. It is part of the arched northern wall of the fortress, conjured into existence by Tyreus, and suspended above the lake. The bottom of this tower is about 20 feet above the water.": "这座塔没有底层。它是要塞的拱形北墙的一部分，由提洛斯幻化而成，悬浮在湖面上。这座塔的底部离水面约20英尺。",
	"This empty chamber is open to the lake below.": "这个空荡荡的房间向下面的湖泊开放。",
	"This area is an overlook and a checkpoint, designed by Tyreus to harm intruders and alert him of approaching threats. It has no ceiling and is open to the air, allowing air elementals to reach it with ease. The floor of this area includes a wide, metal grate that can be opened to create a pit into the lake below; the switch is by the doorway on the keep's side of the room.": "这个区域是一个俯瞰点和检查站，由泰瑞丝设计，用来伤害入侵者并提醒他威胁的临近。它没有天花板，向空气开放，允许空气元素轻松到达。这个区域的地板上有一个宽大的金属栅栏，可以打开，形成一个进入下面湖泊的坑；开关在房间的守卫一侧的门边。",
	"The third floor's eastern doorway is trapped with a glyph of warding's explosive runes and a linked glyph connected to an alarm glyph (DC 18 to detect both); the effect glyph for the alarm is in Tyreus's sanctum (area 10). The glyphs respond to any creature that does not say the password \"visionary\" before passing through the doorway. If {@creature Tyreus, Illusionist|AitFR-FCD|Tyreus} is alerted to an intruder, he prepares for combat as described in his entry in appendix A. For more about {@spell linked glyphs|AitFR-AVT}, see appendix B.": "三楼的东面门口有一个守护的爆炸性符文的石刻和一个与警报石刻相连的链接石刻（DC18可以检测到这两个石刻）；警报的效果石刻在泰勒斯的圣殿（10区）。这些石刻对任何在通过门口之前没有说出 \"异象 \"口令的生物都有反应。如果{@creature Tyreus, Illusionist|AitFR-FCD|Tyreus}被提醒有入侵者，他就会按照附录A中的条目准备战斗。关于（%%）的更多信息，请参见附录B。",
	"The unusual turret appears empty. Much of the floor is little more than an iron grate, with the lake's waves ebbing dozens of feet below.": "这座不寻常的炮台似乎是空的。地板的大部分只是一个铁栅栏，湖水的波浪在下面几十英尺处退去。",

A large landscape painting of the lake rests atop the heap.": "这个拱形的石室给人的感觉不像是一个地窖，而更像是一个金库，角落里不经意地堆放着装满硬币和珍贵金银器的木桶。一幅巨大的湖泊风景画就在这堆画的上方。",
	"The double doors in the eastern wall are blocked by the stone of the outer wall, which Tyreus can reshape using the keystone or other magical means when he likes. Tyreus intends this room to be storage for treasures and supplies collected from those paying tribute to him. Aside from a table and a scale for weighing treasure, the room contains treasures and traps.": "东墙的双门被外墙的石头挡住了，泰勒斯可以在他喜欢的时候用钥石或其他魔法手段重新塑造它。泰勒斯打算把这个房间用来存放从向他进贡的人那里收集的财物和用品。除了一张桌子和一个称量宝物的秤之外，房间里还有宝物和陷阱。",

	"Two magical glyphs are hidden in the floor in the center of this room (DC 18 to detect them both) and keyed to activate if anyone but Tyreus or the fortress's mystical servants touches the 10-foot area in the center of the room. The first is an alarm glyph from a linked glyph spell; its effect glyph is located in Tyreus's sanctum. The second glyph is a spell glyph that casts {@spell wall of force} to create a dome over intruders, theoretically trapping intruders and buying Tyreus or his minions time to arrive. The wall of force's dome covers a circle with a 10-foot radius out from the center of the room.": "两个神奇的石刻隐藏在这个房间中央的地板上（DC18可以探测到它们），如果除了Tyreus或堡垒的神秘仆人之外，任何人接触到房间中央的10英尺区域，都会被激活。第一个是一个来自链接字形法术的警报字形；其效果字形位于Tyreus的圣殿中。第二个石刻是一个法术石刻，它施展（%0%），在入侵者身上形成一个圆顶，理论上可以困住入侵者，为泰勒斯或他的爪牙争取时间到达。力量墙的穹顶覆盖了一个从房间中心向外10英尺半径的圆。",
	"A hoard of coins that Tyreus has looted over the years, now intended for current and future mercenaries, are kept in a pair of kegs here. One keg holds 7,090 gp in assorted coins, the other holds 7,120 gp worth of coins. Assorted art objects (worth 3,200 gp) sit in a heap in the northwest corner, capped by a landscape painting of Highstar Lake painted years ago by Saraque Skyhill (worth 800 gp).": "Tyreus多年来掠夺的大量硬币，现在是为现在和未来的雇佣兵准备的，被保存在这里的一对小桶中。一个桶里有7,090金币的各种硬币，另一个桶里有价值7,120金币的硬币。西北角的一堆艺术品（价值3,200金币）中，最上面是一幅多年前由Saraque Skyhill画的高星湖风景画（价值800金币）。",

	"This lavish room is softened by velvet curtains and colorful wall hangings, including what seems to be a banner ornately stitched with a golden letter T.

A portrait hangs above the fireplace, showing a kingly white human with an exquisitely trimmed white beard and a cobalt blue coat. He wears a silver crown.": "这个豪华的房间被天鹅绒窗帘和五颜六色的壁挂所软化，包括似乎是一个华丽地缝有金色字母T的旗帜。壁炉上方挂着一幅画像，画中是一个拥有精致修剪的白胡子和钴蓝色大衣的白种人国王。他戴着一顶银色的皇冠。",
	"Tyreus keeps a tidy but plush residence, with lush tapestries, soft rugs, velvet curtains, and a large round bed, all summoned into existence as part of the fortress. The portait over the fireplace is of Tyreus himself. It depicts him as he wishes to be in ten or twenty years. Nothing of actual value is here aside from a book of arcane history he stole from another wizard's library.": "泰勒斯保持着一个整洁而豪华的住所，有茂盛的挂毯、柔软的地毯、天鹅绒窗帘和一张大圆床，都是作为堡垒的一部分被召唤出来的。壁炉上方的画像是泰勒斯本人。它描绘了他希望在十年或二十年后的样子。除了他从另一个巫师的图书馆里偷来的一本奥术历史书外，这里没有任何实际价值的东西。",
	"Big, wooden tables with metal legs dominate the room. Each boasts complex collections of glass instruments and silvery lab equipment, for studying arcane things, perhaps, but the room is sparkling clean and has no smell.": "带有金属腿的大木桌占据了整个房间。每张桌子都拥有复杂的玻璃仪器和银色的实验室设备，也许是为了研究神秘的东西，但房间里闪闪发光，没有气味。",

One of them is a {@item spellbook|phb} containing the spells {@spell teleport}, {@spell teleportation circle}, {@spell stone shape}, {@spell stoneskin}, and {@spell wall of stone}.

	"A long dining table dominates the room, framed by a huge fireplace at one end. Above the fireplace, a taxidermy head of a blue dragon is frozen in mid-snarl; its eyes seem to be diamonds. The dark table is decorated with a cobalt-blue runner, and a sideboard gleams with golden cups on a golden tray, next to a decanter of darkred wine. The table is set with six low chairs and a single, high-backed chair at the head, near the fireplace.": "一张长长的餐桌在房间里占主导地位，一端被一个巨大的壁炉所包围。在壁炉上方，一个蓝龙的标本头被冻结在半空；它的眼睛似乎是钻石。深色的桌子上装饰着钴蓝色的跑马灯，边柜上的金色托盘上闪耀着金色的杯子，旁边是深红色的酒壶。桌子上摆放着六把低矮的椅子，头顶上有一把高背椅，靠近壁炉。",
	"Here Tyreus meets with the mercenary commanders and any other visitors he deigns to entertain—or impress.

	"This place is almost empty save for a shiny telescope and a small iron chest near a wide, open window looking west over the lake. A heavy, stone throne made of black slate marbled with gold and platinum stands in the center of the room. A circle of sigils is carved in the floor. Natural light filters in through high windows and airshafts in the ceiling. The ceiling itself is vaulted stone and timber rafters.": "这个地方几乎是空的，只有一个闪亮的望远镜和一个小铁箱，靠近一扇宽大的、敞开的窗户，向西望着湖面。房间中央矗立着一个沉重的石制宝座，由黑色石板制成，上面镶有黄金和铂金。地板上刻着一圈符咒。自然光通过高高的窗户和天花板上的气孔透射进来。天花板本身是拱形的石头和木制的椽子。",
	"Even Tyreus isn't sure what this room is for other than adding height to the keep and looking out at the stars of Faerûn. The circle of sigils is a place for Tyreus to cast {@spell teleport}ation circle and other spells but is not an active or permanent magical feature.": "即使是Tyreus也不确定这个房间是用来做什么的，除了增加堡垒的高度和眺望Faerûn的星星。符号圈是一个让泰勒斯施展{@spell teleport}信仰圈和其他法术的地方，但不是一个活跃或永久的魔法特征。",
	"The throne quietly serves two purposes: first, to aggrandize Tyreus, and second, to make visitors think he has mastered the Stone of Creation and made it his own. The throne, of course, is not magical at all—it is another conjured part of Tyreus's fantasy castle.": "王座悄悄地起到了两个作用：第一，使提瑞斯的地位得到提升；第二，使游客认为他已经掌握了创世之石并使之成为自己的东西。当然，这个宝座一点也不神奇--它是泰勒斯的幻想城堡中另一个幻化出来的部分。",
