	"You are about to embark on a great adventure that pits heroes against giants bent on reshaping the world. {@i Storm King's Thunder} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure for four to six player characters. You can start the adventure with 1st-level characters or 5th-level characters. Either way, the characters should reach at least 11th level by the adventure's conclusion. Because giants figure prominently in the story, at least one character should be able to speak and understand the Giant language.": "你即将踏上一场伟大的冒险，让英雄们对抗一心想要重塑世界的巨人。{@i Storm King's Thunder}是一个龙与地下城的冒险，适合四到六个玩家角色。你可以用1级的角色或5级的角色开始冒险。无论哪种方式，角色在冒险结束时都应该达到至少11级。因为巨人在故事中占有重要地位，所以至少有一个角色应该能够说并理解巨人的语言。",
	"The adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Savage Frontier, in the northwest corner of the continent of Faerûn. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.": "这场冒险发生在被遗忘的领域，特别是在法鲁恩大陆西北角的一个被称为野蛮人边境的地区。尽管如此，你可以通过改变不同地点和派别的名称，轻松地将这个冒险改编为你的家庭活动。",

	"The Savage Frontier (also known as the North) is a cold, rugged, sparsely populated land of snow-capped mountains, rocky hills, sprawling forests, and foggy vales. Isolated strongholds, ancient burial mounds, and the ruins of many forgotten empires dot this vast landscape. Bounded by the Sea of Swords to the west and the desert of Anauroch to the east, the Savage Frontier extends as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the town of Daggerford. Old roads stretch across this great expanse, linking the dwarven strongholds and mines in the mountains to the coastal settlements, frontier towns, and fortified outposts of humans and other folk. These roads are long, lonely, or poorly defended, making them dangerous to traverse. In fertile valleys, towns and cities have sprung up, separated by dozens if not hundreds of miles of untamed wilderness haunted by bandits, barbarians, and monsters.": "野蛮人边境（又称北方）是一片寒冷、崎岖、人烟稀少的土地，由雪山、岩石山、无垠的森林和多雾的山谷组成。孤立的堡垒、古老的坟冢和许多被遗忘的帝国的废墟点缀着这片广阔的土地。西边是剑海，东边是阿诺罗奇沙漠，野蛮人边境向北延伸到冰风谷，向南延伸到达格福特镇。古老的道路在这片广阔的土地上延伸，将山区的矮人据点和矿场与沿海的定居点、边境城镇以及人类和其他民族的坚固前哨连接起来。这些道路漫长、孤独，或者防守不力，使得它们在穿越时很危险。在肥沃的山谷中，城镇和城市如雨后春笋般涌现，它们之间隔着几十甚至几百英里的未开垦的荒野，那里有强盗、野蛮人和怪物出没。",
	"Evil dragons stirred into action by their dark queen, Tiamat, threatened the settlements of the Savage Frontier for a time. Ultimately, they were defeated and forced to withdraw to their lairs, while Tiamat was banished to the Nine Hells. Fear of the dragons' wrath has faded quickly with the coming of a new threat: giants. The peoples of the North are no strangers to giant incursions. Frost giants have long claimed the Spine of the World as their demesne, and hill giants are known to scrounge for food in the untamed hills. But now, in the past couple of months, giants of every kind have emerged from their strongholds in force to threaten civilization as never before—and not just frost giants and hill giants, but also stone giants, fire giants, and cloud giants. All of the giants are in an uproar. Reports of giant attacks throughout the North have reached the coastal cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep, stoking fears that the giants are waging war against humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk.": "被它们的黑暗女王提亚马特煽动起来的邪恶巨龙，曾一度威胁到野蛮边境的定居点。最终，它们被打败并被迫撤回它们的巢穴，而提亚马特被放逐到九层地狱。随着新威胁的到来，对龙的愤怒的恐惧迅速消退：巨人。北方的人民对巨人的入侵并不陌生。长期以来，冰霜巨人一直声称世界之脊是他们的领地，而山丘巨人也被称为在未被驯服的山丘上觅食。但现在，在过去的几个月里，各种类型的巨人都从他们的据点里出来，以前所未有的方式威胁着人类文明--不仅仅是冰霜巨人和山丘巨人，还有石巨人、火巨人和云巨人。所有的巨人都在骚动。关于整个北方的巨人攻击的报告已经传到了卢斯坎、永夜和水底的沿海城市，激起了人们对巨人正在对人类、矮人、精灵和其他小民发动战争的担忧。",
	"Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste system imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. The ordning determines where a giant stands among his or her ilk. Traditionally, storm giants have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic cloud giants, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning. Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. Fire giants rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas frost giants rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic stone giants, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the hill giants, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are dullards who live in fear of their more powerful giant cousins. In hill giant society, the biggest rule.": "巨人社会（比如说）在很大程度上是由秩序决定的，这是一个由他们的神明强加给巨人的种姓制度，其中最主要的是全能之父安南。等级制度决定了一个巨人在他或她的同族中的地位。传统上，风暴巨人一直站在阶级的顶端。他们高大而强大，努力阻止弱小的巨人种族掠夺小民的领域并引发冲突。最伟大的风暴巨人是强大的预言家，善于识别和解释宇宙的迹象和神圣的预兆。冷漠而贵族化的云巨人，比风暴巨人低一级，很少屈尊与低等巨人或小民打交道。奢侈的生活决定了他们的文化和他们在军团中的地位。在他们之下是暴虐的、好战的火巨人和无情的、掠夺性的冰霜巨人。火巨人以他们的锻造技术为标准，而冰霜巨人则以他们的武艺为标准。靠近底层的是排外的石巨人，他们大多生活在地下，把地面世界看作是一个梦境。他们对石头的雕琢程度决定了他们在同龄人中的地位。真正的巨人中最低级和最小的是山丘巨人，他们既贪吃又令人厌恶。山地巨人是呆子，他们生活在对他们更强大的巨人表亲的恐惧之中。在山地巨人社会中，最大的统治者。",
	"Dragons are the ancient enemies of giants. Thousands of years ago, the last great empire of giants—Ostoria—fell after a long and brutal conflict with dragons. Little of Ostoria remains in what is now called the Savage Frontier. The civilizations of small folk have taken over the land once ruled by giants. Although evil giants make occasional forays into territory settled by small folk, their ambitions have long been curtailed by their lack of cohesion and the imposition of good-aligned storm giants and cloud giants whose memories of ancient, glorious Ostoria have faded over time.": "龙是巨人的古老敌人。几千年前，巨人的最后一个大帝国--奥斯托利亚--在与龙的漫长而残酷的冲突后灭亡。在现在被称为 \"野蛮人边境 \"的地方，奥斯托里亚的遗迹很少。小民的文明已经占领了曾经被巨人统治的土地。虽然邪恶的巨人偶尔会闯入小民定居的领土，但他们的野心早已被他们缺乏凝聚力和善意的风暴巨人和云层巨人的强加限制了，他们对古代辉煌的奥斯托利亚的记忆已经随着时间的推移而淡化。",
	"The recent efforts by dragons to bring Tiamat into the world (as told in the adventures {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}) and the attempts by small folk to thwart them so upset the giant gods that Annam the All-Father shattered the ordning between the giants to break his \"children\" out of their complacency, pitting the six giant types against one another while keeping some semblance of order within each type. In so doing, Annam has spurred cloud, fire, frost, stone, and hill giants to challenge the established hierarchy and reforge their destiny. All the giants sensed the upheaval instantly, and now the giant types fiercely compete against one another, striving to create a new ordning through their deeds and accomplishments. These giants' calamitous endeavors have not only put the settlements of humans and other small folk in jeopardy but also attracted the attention of the giants' ancient enemies—the dragons—who will not abide the rise of another giant empire.": "最近，龙为将提亚马特带入世界所做的努力（如冒险故事{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}中所述），以及小人物为挫败他们所做的尝试，使巨神们非常不满，全能之父安纳姆打破了巨人们之间的秩序，使他的 \"孩子们 \"不再自满，让六种类型的巨人互相对立，同时保持每种类型中某种秩序的样子。这样一来，安南就刺激了云、火、霜、石和山丘巨人去挑战既定的等级制度，重新塑造他们的命运。所有的巨人都立刻感觉到了这种动荡，现在各类型的巨人都在激烈地相互竞争，力争通过他们的行为和成就创造一个新的秩序。这些巨人的灾难性努力不仅使人类和其他小民的定居点处于危险之中，而且还吸引了巨人的古老敌人--龙的注意，它们不会容忍另一个巨人帝国的崛起。",
	"Small folk can only speculate as to the cause of the giants' unrest. It remains to be seen whether the old ordning between the giant types will be restored, or whether a new hierarchy will replace the old one, knocking the storm giants from their lofty perch.": "小民们只能猜测巨人动荡的原因。巨人类型之间的旧秩序是否会恢复，或者新的等级制度是否会取代旧的等级制度，将风暴巨人从其崇高的位置上打下来，我们拭目以待。",
	"Prior to the shattering of the ordning, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} was arguably the most powerful of all storm giants. From Maelstrom, his citadel deep within the Trackless Sea, he presided over a court that included representatives of every race of giant, from mighty storm giants to lowly hill giants. He used the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}—a gift given to him by his wife—to keep the more unruly giants in line.": "在秩序破碎之前，（%0%）可以说是所有风暴巨人中最强大的。在无轨海深处的堡垒--漩涡中，他主持着一个包括各族巨人代表的法庭，从强大的风暴巨人到卑微的山丘巨人。他使用{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的力量--他妻子给他的礼物--来使更多不守规矩的巨人保持一致。",
	"For as long as Hekaton had reigned, fear of the king's wrath and respect for the ordning was enough to keep lesser giants from rising up against him. But in recent years, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} had become convinced that the age of the giants was past, as evidenced by the growing distance between the giants and their gods. Annam the All-Father didn't answer prayers, and his divine offspring—the lesser giant gods—were out of touch, constantly waging war against one another on the Outer Planes. Hekaton came to believe that the giants were no longer the rightful masters of the world.": "在赫卡顿统治的这么长时间里，对国王的愤怒的恐惧和对法令的尊重足以让较小的巨人不起来反抗他。但近年来，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}已经确信，巨人的时代已经过去了，巨人和他们的神之间的距离越来越远就是证明。全能之父安南（Annam the All-Father）不回应祈祷，他的神性后代--较小的巨神--失去了联系，不断地在外层星球上相互发动战争。赫卡顿开始相信，巨人不再是世界的合法主人了。",
	"Then, several months ago, Hekaton's fear became reality when the ordning was shattered. The king was profoundly shaken by the realization that storm giants might lose their apex status among giants. In the aftermath of the upheaval, he did his utmost to hold his court together, bullying weaker giants into submission.": "然后，几个月前，当法令被打破时，赫卡顿的恐惧成为现实。国王意识到风暴巨人可能会失去他们在巨人中的最高地位，因而受到了深深的震撼。在动荡之后，他尽最大努力来维持他的宫廷，欺负弱小的巨人，使他们屈服。",
	"Hekaton's wife, Queen Neri, was particularly fond of the small folk. She visited them often in the years before the ordning was sundered, rising up out of the sea to meet them on the shores of the Sword Coast. Neri continually urged her husband to respect the civilizations of the small folk and leave them alone, if he could not countenance forming alliances with them. Hekaton, inherently distrustful of the small folk, wanted nothing to do with them, but he respected his wife's desire to treat with them on occasion.": "赫卡顿的妻子，奈里女王，特别喜欢这些小民。在法令被废除之前的几年里，她经常拜访他们，从海中升起，在剑海岸边与他们会面。内里不断敦促她的丈夫尊重小民的文明，不要打扰他们，如果他不能忍受与他们结成联盟。赫卡顿本来就不信任小民，不想和他们有任何瓜葛，但他尊重他妻子的愿望，偶尔和他们交往。",
	"Neri continued to visit the small folk from time to time even after the upheaval—until the day came when she failed to return from one of her trips to the Sword Coast. Hekaton's younger brother, {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}, commander of the king's garrison, found Neri's corpse shortly thereafter on a small island where she had been known to meet with humans. It was clear that she had been killed by small folk, and Hekaton wept for days before threatening to unleash his vengeance on the unsuspecting coastal territories.": "即使在动乱之后，奈瑞仍然不时地拜访小民，直到有一天，她在一次去剑海岸的旅行中没有回来。赫卡顿的弟弟（%0%），国王的驻军指挥官，不久后在一个小岛上发现了奈瑞的尸体，据说她曾在那里与人类会面。很明显，她是被小民所杀，赫卡顿哭了好几天，然后威胁说要向毫无戒心的沿海地区展开复仇。",
	"Uthor couldn't calm his brother's rage, so he turned to Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT}, the king's youngest daughter, for help. {@creature Serissa|SKT}, who shared her mother's affection for small folk and who stood next in line to inherit the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}, urged her father to uncover the truth before lashing out at anyone he encountered. Hekaton was swayed by his daughter's levelheadedness and wisdom, and once his hurricane-like anger ran its course, he set out to learn how his wife met her end. Unfortunately for the king, he was blind to enemies not only in his court but also in his family.": "乌瑟尔无法平息他哥哥的怒火，于是他向国王的小女儿（%0%）公主寻求帮助。{@creature Serissa|SKT}和她母亲一样喜欢小市民，而且她是下一个继承{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的人，她敦促她的父亲在对遇到的任何人大发雷霆之前先找出真相。希卡顿被他女儿的冷静和智慧所动摇，一旦他的飓风般的愤怒过后，他就开始了解他的妻子是怎么死的。对国王来说，不幸的是，他不仅对宫廷中的敌人视而不见，而且对他的家人也是如此。",
	"The seeds of discontent in Hekaton's family were sown more than a year before the ordning was shattered, when the king divined that his two eldest daughters, {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT}, were unfit to rule, and saw signs that pointed to {@creature Serissa|SKT}, his youngest daughter, as his most worthy successor. {@creature Mirran|SKT} was tempestuous and prone to emotional outbursts, while {@creature Nym|SKT} was the opposite—as cold and unloving as the sea. While Hekaton adored them both, he doubted their ability to keep the lesser giants in line, so he named {@creature Serissa|SKT} as his heir apparent.": "希卡顿家族不满的种子在法令被打破的一年多前就已经播下了，当时国王预感到他的两个长女{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}不适合统治，并看到有迹象表明，他的小女儿{@creature Serissa|SKT}是他最值得的继承人。{@creature Mirran|SKT}脾气暴躁，容易情绪失控，而{@creature Nym|SKT}则相反，像大海一样冷酷无情。虽然海卡顿很喜欢他们两个，但他怀疑他们是否有能力让较小的巨人保持一致，所以他指定（%5%）为他的继承人。",
	"{@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} abided by his decision, but nevertheless their unhappiness was clear. Secretly, they blamed their mother for persuading their father to pass them over. Their blame was unfounded, in fact; Queen Neri had actually warned her husband against making any such pronouncement. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} seethed inside but were too terrified of their father to do anything, until a recent arrival to Maelstrom named {@creature Iymrith|SKT} wormed her way into Hekaton's court and goaded them into action.": "{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}遵守了他的决定，但尽管如此，他们的不快乐是显而易见的。他们暗地里责怪他们的母亲劝说他们的父亲放弃他们。事实上，他们的责备是毫无根据的；内里王后实际上已经警告过她的丈夫不要做出任何这样的宣告。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}内心愤怒，但对他们的父亲太害怕了，什么都不敢做，直到最近一个叫{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的人来到漩涡镇，蠕动着进入赫卡顿的宫廷，促使他们行动起来。",
	"The elder sisters, acting in accordance with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s counsel, are responsible for both Neri's death and Hekaton's disappearance. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} got their revenge against Neri by plotting—with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s help—to have her assassinated. Then they urged their father to hunt down the small folk who killed their mother and fed him false information on the whereabouts of the assassins, to throw the king off track and put him in peril.": "大姐们按照{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的建议行事，对奈里的死和赫卡顿的失踪都负有责任。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}通过谋划--在{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的帮助下--暗杀了奈里，为她报了仇。然后，他们怂恿他们的父亲追捕杀害他们母亲的小人物，并向他提供关于刺客下落的虚假信息，以使国王偏离轨道，使他处于危险之中。",
	"In the wake of Hekaton's disappearance, turmoil engulfed his court. After nearly a month of waiting for him to come back, {@creature Serissa|SKT} reluctantly claimed her father's throne at {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}'s urging.": "在赫卡顿失踪后，他的宫廷陷入了动荡之中。在等待他回来的近一个月后，{@creature Serissa|SKT}在{@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}的催促下，不情愿地认领了她父亲的王位。",
	"{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s eldest daughter, {@creature Mirran|SKT}, is a spoiled brat with the forcefulness and unpredictability of a typhoon. She covets the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT} and believes it rightfully belongs to her. She is angry with her parents for placing {@creature Serissa|SKT} next in the line of succession, and she has made her feelings plain. {@creature Mirran|SKT} believes she is destined to rule and has seen signs that reinforce her belief. Once she claims the throne, {@creature Mirran|SKT} expects all other giants to kneel before her. She plans to use her newfound power to resurrect the ancient empire of Ostoria, sweeping away the cities and kingdoms of the small folk.": "{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的长女{@creature Mirran|SKT}是个被宠坏的孩子，有着台风般的强势和不可预测。她觊觎{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的权力，认为它理应属于她。她对父母将{@creature Serissa|SKT}安排在继承人行列中感到愤怒，她已经把自己的感受说得很清楚。{@creature Mirran|SKT}认为她注定要统治，并看到了加强其信念的迹象。一旦她登上王位，{@creature Mirran|SKT}希望所有其他巨人都能在她面前下跪。她计划用她新发现的力量来复活古老的奥斯托利亚帝国，扫除小民的城市和王国。",
	"If {@creature Mirran|SKT} is the blustery gale of an ocean storm, then {@creature Nym|SKT} is the undercurrent. {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s middle child is cold and calculating. She has always felt neglected by her parents, in part because {@creature Mirran|SKT} was so demanding and {@creature Serissa|SKT} so young. In truth, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} and Queen Neri loved {@creature Nym|SKT} as much as they adored their other daughters, but they found her distant and difficult to please. {@creature Nym|SKT} wants {@creature Mirran|SKT} to seize the throne—and then, when {@creature Mirran|SKT} makes enemies at every turn and proves to everyone that she is unfit to rule, {@creature Nym|SKT} plans to supplant her. She has received omens that support her bid for power. Unlike her blustery older sister, {@creature Nym|SKT} is worried about the consequences of the dissolution of the ordning. Nonetheless, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has convinced her that she has an important destiny to fulfill, and that the gods will reward her if she brings about the return of Ostoria.": "如果{@creature Mirran|SKT}是海洋风暴的狂风，那么{@creature Nym|SKT}就是暗流。{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的中间孩子很冷漠，很有心计。她一直觉得自己被父母忽视了，部分原因是{@creature Mirran|SKT}要求太高，{@creature Serissa|SKT}太年轻。事实上，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}和内里王后对{@creature Nym|SKT}的爱和他们对其他女儿的爱一样多，但他们发现她很遥远，难以取悦。{@creature Nym|SKT}想让{@creature Mirran|SKT}夺取王位--然后，当{@creature Mirran|SKT}处处树敌，向所有人证明她不适合统治时，{@creature Nym|SKT}计划取代她。她已经收到了支持她争夺权力的预兆。与她那虚张声势的姐姐不同，{@creature Nym|SKT}担心法令解体的后果。尽管如此，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}已经说服了她，她有一个重要的命运要完成，如果她能使奥斯托利亚回归，诸神会奖励她。",
	"When {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} disappears, Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT} finds herself thrust into power. Unable to find her father and fearing that he might be dead, {@creature Serissa|SKT} can imagine her political influence evaporating quickly. Several giant lords previously under her father's thumb have abandoned her court and set out to impress the gods in ways that could all but destroy the civilizations of the small folk. {@creature Serissa|SKT} fears warfare among the six giant races as they strive to outdo one another, perhaps in the process reigniting the ancient conflict between giants and dragons. The princess-regent knows that her older sisters envy and despise her, but it has never occurred to her that they were involved in their mother's death or their father's kidnapping. Other than {@creature Iymrith|SKT} and her Uncle Uthor, there are few giants {@creature Serissa|SKT} feels she can trust.": "当{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}失踪后，公主{@creature Serissa|SKT}发现自己被推上了权力的舞台。由于无法找到她的父亲，又担心他可能已经死了，（%%2%）可以想象她的政治影响力会迅速消失。以前在她父亲手下的几个巨头领主已经放弃了她的宫廷，并开始以可能摧毁小民文明的方式来讨好诸神。{@creature Serissa|SKT}担心六个巨人种族之间会发生战争，因为他们会努力超越彼此，也许在这个过程中会重新引发巨人和龙之间的古老冲突。摄政王知道她的姐姐们羡慕和鄙视她，但她从未想过她们与母亲的死亡或父亲的绑架有关。除了{@creature Iymrith|SKT}和她的叔叔乌瑟尔之外，{@creature Serissa|SKT}觉得她可以信任的巨人不多。",
	"Hekaton left behind a piece of regalia called the {@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT}, a magic item that allows its owner to harness the powers of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}. In accordance with her father's wishes, {@creature Serissa|SKT} has claimed the scepter and the throne. Even with the throne's magic at her command, she feels adrift. {@creature Serissa|SKT} wants to reach out to the small folk for help in finding her father, because she knows that despite their size, they are capable of great feats of heroism. But {@creature Iymrith|SKT} and Uthor have advised {@creature Serissa|SKT} to steer clear of them.

As the characters leave the temple for the last time, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} appears and attacks them. {@creature Harshnag|SKT} holds the ancient blue dragon at bay while the adventurers escape with or without the aid of mysterious dragon cultists and an airship.": "在{@adventure chapter 4|SKT|4}中，{@creature Harshnag|SKT}带领人物来到世界之脊下的一座神庙，在那里他们咨询了一个神圣的神谕。神谕要求冒险者找回埋藏在散布在北方的乌斯加特祖坟下的一些丢失的遗物。如果冒险者完成了神谕的任务，它就会告诉他们必须做什么来结束巨人的威胁。当人物最后一次离开神庙时，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}出现并攻击他们。{@creature Harshnag|SKT}压制住了古老的蓝龙，而冒险者们则在神秘的龙族崇拜者和一艘飞艇的帮助下或不帮助下逃跑。",
	"Chapters 5 through 9 describe the lairs of five giant lords threatening the North. Players choose which giant lord they wish to confront. This villain has a {@item conch of teleportation|SKT} that the characters need to reach Maelstrom, a storm giant stronghold in the depths of the Trackless Sea. {@adventure Chapter 10|SKT|11} describes the politically charged court of the storm giants and the challenges faced by its current ruler, Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT}.": "第五章至第九章描述了威胁北方的五个巨人领主的巢穴。玩家选择他们希望对抗的巨人领主。这个反派有一个{@item conch of teleportation|SKT}，角色需要到达无轨海深处的风暴巨人据点--漩涡。{@adventure Chapter 10|SKT|11}描述了风暴巨人的政治宫廷以及其现任统治者--公主{@creature Serissa|SKT}所面临的挑战。",
	"If the characters earn {@creature Serissa|SKT}'s trust, she tasks them with finding her father, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}. The search for Hekaton is handled in {@adventure chapter 11|SKT|12}. Once freed from captivity, he joins forces with the party to slay the dragon {@creature Iymrith|SKT} in {@adventure chapter 12|SKT|13}. If Hekaton survives this final battle, he reclaims his throne. Otherwise, his daughter {@creature Serissa|SKT} becomes queen. In either event, the storm giants forge an alliance with the small folk against the enemies of giantkind: dragons. This act might be enough to restore the ordning as it was, or the future of the ordning might remain an open question in your campaign.": "如果人物获得了（%0%）的信任，她就会让他们去寻找她的父亲，（%1%）。寻找海卡顿的工作在（%2%）中进行。一旦从囚禁中解脱出来，他就会在{@adventure chapter 12|SKT|13}中与党派联合起来杀死龙{@creature Iymrith|SKT}。如果海卡顿在这场最后的战斗中幸存下来，他就能重新获得他的王位。否则，他的女儿（%5%）将成为女王。无论是哪种情况，风暴巨人都会与小民结成联盟，对抗巨人的敌人：龙。这一举动可能足以使军团恢复原状，或者军团的未来在你的战役中可能仍然是一个开放的问题。",

	"{@i Storm King's Thunder} is not a \"ticking clock\" adventure, meaning that the characters are under no pressure to end the giant threat quickly. The plots of the giant lords take months to unfold, giving the characters time to explore the North, travel from place to place, and entertain distractions.": "{@i Storm King's Thunder}不是一个 \"计时 \"的冒险，也就是说，人物没有压力要迅速结束巨人的威胁。巨人领主的阴谋需要几个月的时间来展开，让人物有时间去探索北方，从一个地方到另一个地方，以及娱乐分心。",
	"Some players might feel a sense of urgency and stick to the main story line as much as possible, missing out on many elements of the adventure. Others might be willing to follow loose threads and stray from the main story, hoping to take the adventure in interesting new directions. The adventure allows for a fair amount of wandering. If you begin to think the party has wandered too far away from the main plot, you can use {@creature Harshnag|SKT} (see {@area chapter 3|287|x}) to help steer characters back to the main story. You can also have the characters meet faction members (see the \"{@area Factions in the North|13c|x}\" section) who can provide a sense of growing urgency and point characters in the right direction.": "有些玩家可能会有一种紧迫感，尽可能地坚持故事主线，从而错过了许多冒险的元素。其他人可能愿意跟随松散的线索，偏离主要故事，希望把冒险带到有趣的新方向。这场冒险允许有相当数量的游荡。如果你开始认为队伍已经偏离了主要情节，你可以使用（%0%）（见（%1%））来帮助引导人物回到主要故事。你也可以让角色遇到派系成员（见\"{@area Factions in the North|13c|x} \"部分），他们可以提供一种日益增长的紧迫感，并为角色指出正确的方向。",
	"You can begin the adventure with 5th-level characters by skipping over{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1} and starting in one of the three locations described in {@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}. {@adventure appendix A|SKT|14} suggests ways in which you can transition characters from the D&D {@i Starter Set} adventure or one of several other D&D adventures to {@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2} of {@i Storm King's Thunder}.": "你可以跳过{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}，从{@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}中描述的三个地点中的一个开始冒险，用5级的角色开始。{@adventure appendix A|SKT|14}建议了一些方法，让你可以将角色从D&D{@i Starter Set}冒险或其他几个D&D冒险中的一个过渡到{@i Storm King's Thunder}的{@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}。",
	"Rather than have you track experience points, this adventure assumes that the characters gain levels by accomplishing certain goals. At the end of each chapter is a \"Character Advancement\" sidebar, which tells you the circumstances under which the characters advance in level. The adventure flowchart (figure 0.1) shows what level the characters are expected to be when they begin each chapter.

	"Of course, you can ignore these milestones and track XP as normal.": "当然，你可以忽略这些里程碑，像平常一样追踪XP。",
	"Many of the encounters in this adventure are deadly by design. They test the players' ability to make smart, informed decisions under pressure. A deadly encounter might be the only encounter the characters have on a given day (and assumes the party is at full strength), or it might be so overwhelming that the characters are expected to avoid combat at all costs.": "这场冒险中的许多遭遇都是致命的设计。它们考验的是玩家在压力下做出明智、明智决定的能力。一个致命的遭遇可能是角色们在某一天唯一的遭遇（并且假设队伍是全员的），或者它可能是如此的压倒性，以至于角色们要不惜一切代价避免战斗。",
	"A total-party kill (\"TPK\") need not herald the end of the campaign. Giants and other intelligent creatures are fond of taking prisoners. The first time a TPK occurs, you can have the characters miraculously awaken as prisoners with 1 hit point each. Give them every chance to escape their captors. If necessary, use NPCs such as {@creature Zephyros|SKT}, the cloud giant wizard in {@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}, to help them get out of tight spots. With luck, the players will take the hint and be wary of repeating the experience.": "一场全军覆没（\"TPK\"）并不一定预示着战役的结束。巨人和其他智慧生物都喜欢俘虏。第一次发生TPK时，你可以让角色奇迹般地醒来，成为每人只有1点生命值的囚犯。给他们一切机会来逃脱他们的俘虏。如果有必要，可以利用NPC，如{@creature Zephyros|SKT}，{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}中的云端巨型巫师，来帮助他们摆脱困境。运气好的话，玩家会接受暗示，并警惕重复这种经历。",
	"{@i Storm King's Thunder} contains a generous amount of treasure. This section provides guidance on how to handle certain kinds of treasure found in this adventure.": "{@i Storm King's Thunder}含有大量的财宝。本节就如何处理在这次冒险中发现的某些种类的宝藏提供指导。",
	"The number of coins in a creature's hoard is often represented as a die expression with a multiplier. For example, a giant might have {@dice 3d6 × 100} gp in a sack. To determine the number of coins in the sack, roll {@dice 3d6} and multiply the result by 100 to get a number between 300 and 1,800. Instead of rolling to determine the number of coins, you can pick an amount that falls within the specified range. If the characters have more loot than they known what to do with, take the minimum. If they seem light on treasure, take the average (in this case, 1,000 gp) or the maximum.": "一个生物的囤积物中的金币数量通常表示为带有乘数的模具表达。例如，一个巨人的袋子里可能有（%0%）金币。要确定麻袋中的硬币数量，需要掷出{@dice 3d6}，然后将结果乘以100，得到一个300到1800之间的数字。你可以在指定的范围内挑选一个数量，而不是通过滚动来确定金币的数量。如果人物的战利品比他们知道的要多，就取最小的。如果他们的财宝似乎不多，就取平均数（在本例中为1,000金币）或最大值。",
	"Sometimes a treasure hoard contains one or more magic items determined by rolling on the magic item treasure tables in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}. When determining a random magic item, roll a {@dice d100} (or have a player roll for you) and consult the specified table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}. If your players have a \"wish list\" of magic items, or you think a particular item might be useful to the party, you can forgo the roll and select an item from the table. For example, if the characters find a magic item tied to Magic Item Table B, and the party is light on water-breathing magic heading into {@adventure chapter 10|SKT|11}, you might decide that the item is a {@item potion of water breathing} or a {@item cloak of the manta ray}, both of which appear on Magic Item Table B in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Random Magic Items}.": "有时，一个宝藏包含一个或多个魔法物品，通过在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}第七章的魔法物品宝藏表上滚动来确定。当确定一个随机的魔法物品时，请掷出{@dice d100}（或让玩家为你掷出），并参考{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}中的指定表格。如果你的玩家有一个魔法物品的 \"愿望清单\"，或者你认为某个特定的物品可能对聚会有用，你可以放弃掷骰子，从表中选择一个物品。例如，如果人物找到了与魔法物品表B相关的魔法物品，而队伍在进入{@adventure chapter 10|SKT|11}时对喷水魔法的需求很低，你可以决定该物品是{@item potion of water breathing}或{@item cloak of the manta ray}，两者都出现在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Random Magic Items}的魔法物品表B中。",
	"Scattered throughout the adventure are art objects crafted to giant scale, including giant-sized pieces of jewelry, articles of clothing, and room decor. Although such art objects are often quite valuable, their size and weight make them difficult to transport. Characters must decide for themselves whether it's worth the trouble to carry these items. If the characters get greedy, use the variant encumbrance rules in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to track what they can reasonably carry.": "在整个冒险过程中，散布着按巨大比例制作的艺术品，包括巨大的珠宝、衣服和房间装饰。虽然这些艺术品通常都很有价值，但它们的尺寸和重量使它们难以运输。角色必须自己决定是否值得为搬运这些物品而烦恼。如果人物变得贪婪，可以使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的变体负担规则来追踪他们可以合理携带的东西。",

	"Two 30-foot-tall cylindrical stone towers flank each gate and watch over one of the trails that lead to and from the town. The trail from the North Gate travels two miles north to the village of Targos on the frozen shore of a lake called Maer Dualdon. The trail leading east, called the Eastway, stretches roughly thirteen miles to the town of Easthaven on the shore of Lac Dinneshere. The southwest route, known as the Caravan Trail, is called the Ten Trail where it passes through the Spine of the World. This trail is the safest way to the lands south of the mountains, but it is nigh impassable in the winter.": "两座30英尺高的圆柱形石塔位于每个门的两侧，看守着通往小镇的一条小路。从北门出来的小路向北走了两英里，到了位于一个叫Maer Dualdon的湖的冰岸上的Targos村。向东的小路被称为 \"东路\"，大约绵延13英里，到达位于Lac Dinneshere岸边的Easthaven镇。西南的路线被称为大篷车小道，在经过世界之脊的地方被称为十号小道。这条小路是通往山脉以南土地的最安全途径，但在冬天几乎无法通行。",
	"Under normal circumstances, the gates of Bryn Shander stand open, and the guards assigned to the gatehouses say and do nothing as people come and go. When Bryn Shander is threatened, however, the guards close and bar the gates, refusing to open them unless ordered to do so by the sheriff or the speaker. There are four guards at each gate at any given time. Another eight guards are on patrol, moving between the stone watchtowers along the wall. Most of the guards are human, with a sprinkling of shield dwarves, half-orcs, and other races.": "在正常情况下，布林山德的大门是敞开的，分配到门房的卫兵在人们来来往往的时候什么也不说，什么也不做。然而，当布林山德受到威胁时，卫兵们就会关闭大门并设置障碍，拒绝打开大门，除非有警长或发言人的命令。在任何时候，每个门都有四个警卫。另有八名卫兵在巡逻，在沿墙的石制瞭望塔之间移动。大多数守卫是人类，还有一些盾牌矮人、半兽人和其他种族。",
	"A sheriff's deputy named {@creature Augrek Brighthelm|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix D|SKT|17|Appendix D: Special NPCs}) often stands watch at the southwest gate. She delights in greeting first-time visitors to town. In fact, she has a well-rehearsed speech that makes some of the other guards at the gate roll their eyes: \"Well met, travelers! Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you'll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop of Firebeard's Firebrandy, sold only at Kelvin's Comfort, located on yer right as you enter the market square!\" (If the characters arrive at a different gate, you can relocate Augrek to that gate.)": "一位名叫{@creature Augrek Brighthelm|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix D|SKT|17|Appendix D: Special NPCs}）的警长的副手经常在西南门站岗。她以迎接第一次来镇上的游客为乐。事实上，她有一套精心排练的讲话，让门口的其他一些守卫翻白眼。\"很高兴见到你们，旅行者! 把你的手指和四肢包起来，免得奥里尔把它们咬下来！\"。注意你的脾气，你在这里会很受欢迎的! 带着货物来卖吗？市场就在前面。想喝杯热饮吗？请允许我推荐一滴火胡子的火烧酒，只在凯尔文的安乐窝出售，就在你进入市场广场的右边！\" (如果人物到达不同的门，你可以把奥格瑞克移到那个门。）",

Artus's immortality, it is said, comes from a magic ring—a ring that Sirac has never seen. Sirac's parents gave him up as a baby; he was raised in an orphanage and learned his survival skills as a teenager living on the streets of Suzail. He traveled west with a caravan to Baldur's Gate, then sailed up the Sword Coast to Neverwinter. He came to Icewind Dale three months ago to try his hand at knucklehead trout fishing, and ended up befriending Dellvon Ludwig. Sirac has since come to appreciate Torm's mantra, espousing courage and heroism above all.": "西拉克知道他是不朽的阿图斯-辛伯的儿子，因此带有辛伯的血统，但这对他来说并没有什么好处。据说，阿图斯的不死之身来自一枚魔戒--一枚西拉克从未见过的戒指。西拉克的父母在他还是个婴儿时就把他抛弃了；他在孤儿院长大，十几岁时在苏泽尔的街头学会了生存技能。他随一个商队向西走到博德之门，然后沿着剑海岸航行到永夜。三个月前，他来到冰风谷，想试试自己钓鳟鱼的手艺，结果结识了戴尔文-路德维格。此后，西拉克开始欣赏托尔姆的咒语，崇尚勇气和英雄主义高于一切。",
	"The Speaker's Palace is the private residence of the town speaker. The \"palace\" part of its name is an overstatement, compared to such buildings elsewhere in the world.

The one Ten-Towns specialty of note is a treacly mead from Good Mead, a neighboring settlement. Caravan masters and guards with plenty of coin often come here, as do visiting dwarves from Kelvin's Cairn. The proprietor of Kelvin's Comfort is Ogden Flamebeard (NG male shield dwarf {@creature commoner}), who has a temper as fiery as his signature drink—a Mirabarran rotgut he gets for cheap and rebottles as Flamebeard's Firebrandy (reselling it at a sizable markup).

His sister, Elza (NG female Illuskan human {@creature commoner}), runs the shop. Elza has expanded the business in recent years by offering a selection of adventuring supplies—rations, fur cloaks, leather gloves and boots, ice picks, snowshoes, and other survival gear. While a Blackiron weapon typically sells for half the price listed in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB|4}, Elza marks up other goods by 50 percent to keep the business profitable.

	"The Northlook is the inn most frequented by mercenaries and adventurers, and as such it's the rowdiest and most dangerous place to stay in Bryn Shander. At the same time, its taproom is the best place in all of Ten-Towns to get the latest news and rumors, including leads on profitable ventures. The proprietor, a retired sellsword who goes by the name Scramsax (N male Illuskan human {@creature veteran}), takes advantage of the high hopes and good fortunes of his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in town. (His prices for room and board are double those listed in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB|4}.) Scramsax often cuts a break for customers who are between jobs, allowing them to stay on credit and then presenting them with a bill inflated by interest charges after they earn their next payday.

	"One of the oldest inns in town, Geldenstag's Rest is run by Myrtle (LN female Illuskan human noncombatant), a gray-haired widow. Myrtle makes it her business to know everyone else's business, asking her guests a lot of questions about what they're up to each day. The inn's accommodations are lackluster—the small rooms are furnished with only a stool, a chamber pot, and two cots with dirty furs thrown over them. It might seem the kind of place that would attract lowlifes and troublemakers, but Myrtle's pestering tends to drive away people who have secrets to keep. The absence of that element from its clientele makes Geldenstag's Rest a popular destination for travelers who aren't looking for too much excitement during their stay in Bryn Shander.": "Geldenstag's Rest是镇上最古老的旅馆之一，由Myrtle（LN女性Illuskan人类非战斗人员）经营，她是一个灰头发的寡妇。桃金娘把了解别人的事当作自己的事，每天都会问客人很多问题，问他们在做什么。旅店的住宿条件很差--小房间里只有一张凳子、一个锅和两张扔在上面的脏毛皮的小床。它似乎是那种会吸引低等生物和麻烦制造者的地方，但默特尔的纠缠往往会赶走那些有秘密要保守的人。客人中没有这种因素，使得格登斯塔格的休息处成为那些在布林山德逗留期间不寻求太多刺激的旅行者的热门目的地。",

	"The outer wall is in need of repair in many places. Time and weather have eroded some of the mortar, creating ruts between the stones that can serve as handholds and footholds. Scaling the walls requires a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "外墙在许多地方都需要修理。时间和天气侵蚀了一些灰泥，在石头之间产生了一些可以作为手掌和脚掌的沟壑。攀登城墙需要成功地进行DC15强度（（%0%））检查。",
	"The entrance to Goldenfields is a large stone gatehouse set into the middle of the south wall. Beyond its gates, dirt roads crisscross the interior of the compound, providing passage between and through its fields and orchards. Roads also run along the inside of the wall, connecting the various watch posts. During the harvest season, wagons make their way between the fields, gathering food and grain and transporting it to cellars beneath the watch posts, where the food is kept under lock and key until caravans from Waterdeep and other settlements arrive to pick it up. In addition to the large grain fields, fruit orchards, and vegetable gardens, smaller gardens hug the outer walls. These gardens grow berries, rhubarb plants, and other such fare.": "金田园的入口是一个大的石头门楼，镶嵌在南墙的中间。在门外，土路纵横交错，为田地和果园之间提供通道。道路也沿着城墙内侧运行，连接各个观察站。在收获季节，马车在田地之间穿梭，收集食物和谷物，并将其运送到哨所下面的地窖里，在那里，食物被锁住，直到来自沃特迪普和其他定居点的商队来取走它们。除了大型粮田、果园和菜园之外，小型花园也紧紧围绕着外墙。这些花园种植浆果、大黄植物和其他类似的食物。",
	"Most of Goldenfields' workers live in a small town situated near the abbey, where the abbot hosts morning, noon, and evening prayer. North of town is an enormous inn called Northfurrow's End. Visitors planning to spend the night in Goldenfields are directed here.": "金地的大部分工人都住在位于修道院附近的一个小镇上，修道院院长在那里主持早、中、晚的祈祷。小镇北边有一个巨大的旅馆，叫Northfurrow's End。计划在Goldenfields过夜的游客被引导到这里。",

Above its tall, thick wooden doors are arrow slits that seem to peer down suspiciously on all visitors.": "Northfurrow小径在一座宏伟的石制门楼前结束，门楼上雕刻着一个身体丰满的女人（Chauntea的代表）抱着玉米棒的图像。这座门楼本身就是一座堡垒。在其高大厚实的木门上方，有一条箭缝，似乎在怀疑地俯视着所有游客。",
	"The gatehouse has an inner set and an outer set of double doors. When locked, these doors are too thick to be forced open using brute strength. They can be damaged and broken down, however.

The current castellan, a boorish twit named Hantanus Tarm (LN male Illuskan human {@creature noble}), is responsible for defending the gates but has no military experience. The gatehouse guards report to him, but his position is seen as mostly political and ceremonial, and he has no influence anywhere but at the gatehouse.

	"At more or less regular intervals around the perimeter of Goldenfields, the outer wall (which is 60 feet high on the outside and 20 feet high on the inside) widens to accommodate broad stone parapets with buildings atop them. Each parapet features a 30-foot-tall stone pagoda topped by a weather vane. A wooden statue of Chauntea stands in the middle of each pagoda, holding a large bronze gong and surrounded by cornucopias. Next to each pagoda are one or two stone outbuildings that serve as barracks. A 10-foot-wide, moss-covered stone staircase leads from the top of the parapet down to the compound. A set of locked, ironbound wooden doors at ground level provide access to storerooms and cellars located underneath each watch post.

	"The watch posts are crucial to the defense of Goldenfields. Stationed at each post are thirty {@creature Scout||scouts} (NG males and females of various races and ethnicities) two-thirds of whom are on duty at any given time.

	"The watch posts are far enough apart that shouts of alarm are ineffective. If a watch post needs to sound an alarm, a guard runs to the pagoda and strikes the gong with a heavy mallet. The pagodas are designed to amplify sound, allowing the ringing of each gong to be heard as far as two miles away. Any other watch posts within that range ring their gongs as well, putting more of the compound on alert.": "看守所相距甚远，喊叫报警是无效的。如果一个哨所需要发出警报，一名守卫就会跑到宝塔前，用一个沉重的木槌敲打锣鼓。宝塔的设计可以放大声音，使每面锣的响声在两英里外都能听到。在这个范围内的任何其他哨所也会敲响他们的锣，使更多的院落处于警戒状态。",
	"The watch posts were designed to warn Goldenfields of approaching armies and dragons. Even though the watch posts and the wall patrols provide a great measure of security, a small group of invaders could scale the outer wall and enter the compound undetected if they were lucky enough to avoid the notice of the guards.": "观察哨是为了警告金地的军队和龙的接近。尽管哨所和城墙巡逻提供了很大的安全保障，但如果一小群入侵者幸运地避开守卫的注意，他们可以翻越外墙，进入院落而不被发现。",

His assignment is to determine how easy it would be for the Black Network to gain control of Goldenfields, and report his findings to Nalaskur Thaelond in Bargewright Inn. Shalvus often leaves the livestock pens to hang around Northfurrow's End. He returns to the pens at night to check on the animals.": "新来的牧羊人之一，{@creature Shalvus Martholio|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix D|SKT|17|Appendix D: Special NPCs}），是一个Zhentarim的间谍--可以说是披着{@creature sheep|SKT}外衣的狼。他的任务是确定黑衣人网络有多容易获得对Goldenfields的控制，并将他的发现报告给Bargewright旅馆的Nalaskur Thaelond。沙尔沃斯经常离开牲畜圈，在诺斯福罗的尽头闲逛。他在晚上回到畜栏，查看动物的情况。",

Orderly rows of wooden longhouses, each one large enough to house a hundred people, face inward toward a central plaza, with the abbey of Chauntea off to the southeast. Each longhouse is a work of art, its beams sculpted with images of a particular animal, thereby differentiating it from its neighbors.

	"The largest and most elaborate building in Goldenfields is the abbey, Harvesthome, a centuries-old stone edifice whose outer walls have statues of Chauntea at every corner, her hands raised to the sky as though casting a spell to summon rain. Well-tended hedges surround the foundation, and a sun-shaped window of stained glass is set above the entrance and the steps leading up to it. Narrow windows of stained glass decorated with images of wheat, fruit, and vegetables light the pillared arcades within. Toward the back of the building, mounted between sturdy roof beams, is a large bronze bell that is rung fifteen minutes before prayers every morning, noon, and evening.": "金地最大、最精致的建筑是修道院，Harvesthome，这是一座有数百年历史的石头建筑，其外墙的每个角落都有Chauntea的雕像，她的双手举向天空，好像在施法召唤雨水。修剪整齐的树篱围绕着地基，在入口处和通往入口的台阶上有一扇彩色玻璃的太阳形窗户。狭窄的彩色玻璃窗上装饰着小麦、水果和蔬菜的图像，照亮了里面的柱廊。在建筑物的后面，在坚固的屋顶横梁之间，有一个大铜钟，每天早上、中午和晚上在祈祷前15分钟敲响。",
	"Wandering the abbey halls are two old {@creature Black Bear||black bears} named Darlow and Tilbee. A few months ago, they startled some workers in the south fields. No one could fathom how the two bears crept into the compound unseen, spurring rumors that they were gifts from the Earth Mother. Rather than drive them out, the workers sheltered and fed them. The bears eventually followed workers into the abbey. They try to mooch food from visitors while posing no danger to anyone.": "在修道院大厅里徘徊的是两个叫达洛和提尔比的老{@creature Black Bear||black bears}。几个月前，它们惊动了南边田地里的一些工人。没有人能够理解这两只熊是如何悄悄地进入院子的，这刺激了一些谣言，说它们是地球母亲的礼物。工人们没有把它们赶出去，而是为它们提供了住所和食物。这两只熊最终跟随工人进入修道院。它们试图从游客那里揩油，而对任何人都不构成危险。",
	"The Abbot of Goldenfields, Ellardin Darovik (NG male Damaran human {@creature priest}), is a worshiper of Chauntea and a member of the Emerald Enclave.

	"There are no guards in the abbey, just a handful of acolytes. One of them, {@creature Zi Liang|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix D|SKT|17|Appendix D: Special NPCs}), has scolded Father Darovik many times for putting the defense of Goldenfields in the hands of incompetent military leaders, which has made her somewhat unpopular.

	"Guh, the self-styled chief of the hill giants, has driven off her female rivals and conquered their husbands. Now, she tasks her mates with collecting food for her voracious appetite. Two of these big dummies, Lob and Ogg, wandered the hills and valleys south of Grudd Haug, the den of Guh's tribe. They eventually blundered into the Forlorn Hills and, a few weeks ago, stumbled upon a gang of bugbears and goblins. The goblinoids told Lob and Ogg about a large farm on the far side of the Dessarin River. It occurred to the hill giants that they should attack it. So, the giants waded across the river and hurled rocks at Goldenfields, pounding its outer wall and alarming its residents. Archers on the wall retaliated with a barrage of arrows. The giants and goblinoids withdrew to nurse their wounds, leaving Goldenfields' defenders to wonder when the next attack would come. The attack hasn't changed the mood among the residents, who place great stock in the strength of their outer defenses and militia.": "古赫，自称是山地巨人的首领，已经赶走了她的女性对手，征服了她们的丈夫。现在，她要求她的伙伴们为她贪婪的胃口收集食物。这些大笨蛋中的两个人，洛布和奥格，在古赫部落的巢穴--格鲁德豪格南部的山丘和山谷中徘徊。他们最终误入了荒凉山庄，并且在几周前，偶然发现了一帮虫人和地精。妖精们告诉洛布和奥格，在德萨林河的远处有一个大农场。山地巨人们想到，他们应该攻击它。于是，巨人们涉水过河，向金田镇投掷石块，猛击其外墙，惊动了居民。城墙上的弓箭手用一连串的箭矢进行反击。巨人和哥布林诺人撤走养伤，留下金地的守卫者想知道下一次攻击何时会到来。这次攻击并没有改变居民们的情绪，他们非常看重外围防御和民兵的力量。",
	"Lob and Ogg spent the next month lost in the hills, trying to find their way back to Grudd Haug. When they got there, they told Guh about the \"big farm.\" Guh dispatched a horde of hill giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins to pillage it. With Lob and Ogg leading the way, the horde got lost in the hills and blundered into a copper dragon's territory. Many giants, ogres, bugbears, and goblins died that day. The survivors fled, only to stumble into an Uthgardt barbarian ambush. At that point, it became clear to those who remained alive that Lob and Ogg were poor guides and detrimental to the success of the mission. The bugbears took over from there, leading the remnants of the horde to Goldenfields, with Lob and Ogg bringing up the rear and blaming one another for their misadventures.": "罗布和奥格在接下来的一个月里迷失在山里，试图找到回到格鲁德-豪格的路。当他们到达那里时，他们把 \"大农场 \"的事告诉了古赫。古赫派遣了一队山地巨人、食人魔、虫人和地精去掠夺它。在洛布和奥格的带领下，部落在山上迷了路，误入了铜龙的领地。许多巨人、食人魔、虫人和地精在那天死去。幸存者逃走了，但却跌入了乌斯加特野蛮人的伏击圈。这时，那些活着的人都清楚，洛布和奥格是糟糕的向导，不利于任务的成功。虫族从那里接管了任务，带领残余的部落前往金地，洛布和奥格在后面带路，并为他们的不幸遭遇相互指责。",

	"Not long after the initial attack on Goldenfields, the abbot received reports of giant sightings throughout the Dessarin Valley.

	"Each gang of monsters is a separate encounter. If the abbey's bell hasn't been rung by the time the second gang of goblinoids is defeated, the abbot rings it. (It takes time for the abbot to realize something is amiss and reach the bell in the dead of night.) The ringing bell can be heard for miles and puts all of Goldenfields' defenses on alert. The bell panics any ogres, bugbears, and goblins that are still inside the compound, and they flee back toward the wall.": "每一帮怪物都是一个独立的遭遇战。如果在击败第二伙妖精的时候，修道院的钟还没有被敲响，院长就会敲响它。(修道院院长需要时间来意识到事情的不对劲，并在夜深人静的时候去敲钟）。钟声可以传遍数英里，并使金地的所有防御系统进入戒备状态。钟声让还在院子里的食人魔、虫人和妖精们惊慌失措，他们纷纷向墙边逃去。",
	"During this time, inexplicably, Lob and Ogg decide to climb over the wall and enter the compound rather than flee, while the other four hill giants regroup with the ogres and goblins lurking outside Goldenfields. The giants leave behind their greatclubs, since they can't climb the walls with their clubs in hand. A handful of guards confront the two foolish giants, but they retreat once Lob and Ogg start breaking off and hurling wall battlements (treat as hurled rocks). The two giants eventually make their way toward the abbey (area G7).

The invaders close to within 120 feet of the wall and begin hurling rocks and goblins.": "在人物处理完城墙内的威胁后，镇民们从他们的长屋里走出来，开始在田野上搜寻流浪的威胁。参加搜索的人物发现了通往城墙的小路。这时，东边的天空已经亮了起来，足以显示出墙外有巨人、食人魔和地精的存在。入侵者靠近城墙120英尺以内，开始投掷石块和妖精。",
	"The six ogres that remain outside Goldenfields wear hobgoblin inventions called goblin huckers. Each of these contraptions is essentially a portable trebuchet strapped to a leather harness. The contraption rests on an ogre's back and shoulders, and despite its cumbersome appearance, it doesn't inhibit the wearer's mobility or fighting ability. It takes 10 minutes for someone else to attach or remove the elaborate harness, or {@dice 1d6} hours if an ogre attempts to do so unassisted. The contraption is built for ogres specifically.

	"The sling of the trebuchet is big enough to hurl a rock, a flaming cask of pitch, or a similarly sized projectile—but the contraption was designed to fling goblins. A goblin used as a projectile typically wears a spiked helmet, so that it deals piercing damage to the target on impact. The thirty goblins outside Goldenfields are equipped with helmets. A goblin rarely survives the experience of being hurled through the air in this fashion. The goblins here stand ready to be flung at enemies on the wall, while the ogres position themselves 300 feet away from their targets.": "投石机的吊索足够大，可以投掷石头、燃烧的沥青桶或类似大小的投射物，但这个装置是为了投掷妖精而设计的。被用作投射物的地精通常戴着一个带刺的头盔，这样它在撞击时就会对目标造成穿刺伤害。金田镇外的三十个妖精都配备了头盔。一个地精很少能在以这种方式被抛向空中的经历中幸存下来。这里的地精准备好被抛向墙上的敌人，而食人魔则在离目标300英尺的地方定位。",
	"The wearer of a goblin hucker launches its payload in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind cover. Loading the sling is an action that the contraption's wearer can't perform.

	"The monsters inside the compound are smart enough to realize that they can't survive in Goldenfields for long after an alarm has sounded. Those that escape rejoin their comrades waiting outside the wall. Lob and Ogg are the exceptions; more afraid of Guh than of the Goldenfields defenders, they hate the thought of returning to their chief without a mountain of food. But neither giant wants to die, and each surrenders if reduced to 15 hit points or fewer, falling to the ground and beginning to sob like a big baby.

	"Captured monsters that are left to the tender mercies of the Goldenfields defenders are put to death, by order of Captain Strog Thunderblade. The captain then takes credit for defeating the monstrous horde that attacked Goldenfields.

Between songs, Greenwhistle repeatedly assures the characters that {@creature Turlang|SKT} \"will be along any time now.\" The treant arrives on the third night after the characters arrive, in the company of a friend named Tharra Shyndle (NG female half-elf {@creature druid}), who is a member of the Emerald Enclave.": "当人物到达时，{@creature Turlang|SKT}并不在影顶大教堂，但一个名叫Greenwhistle的忧郁者{@creature satyr}向他们保证，那个树人 \"随时会出现\"。Greenwhistle很失望，因为一只干尸拒绝了他的追求，所以他坐在水池边，日夜用风笛吹奏悲伤的歌曲。在歌曲之间，吹笛人反复向人物保证，{@creature Turlang|SKT} \"现在随时会来\"。树人是在人物到达后的第三天晚上到达的，他的朋友叫塔拉-辛德尔（NG女半精灵（%3%）），是翡翠飞地的成员。",
	"The treant is initially indifferent toward the heroes and not of a mind to please. If one or more characters approach the treant in a nonthreatening manner and initiates a conversation, Tharra urges the treant not to lose its temper. The treant groans audibly and answers brusquely. It doesn't know {@creature Lifferlas|SKT} but remembers Aerglas fondly. The treant hasn't seen the druid in many years and doesn't know where Aerglas can be found.

If she's friendly toward the characters, she invites them to join her, saying she could use the company. If the characters accept the invitation, Tharra leads them to Everlund, then east to Jalanthar by way of the Rauvin Road.

If the characters show Cauldar the pendant, he understands that Zi has bequeathed her inheritance to them. He sends servants to the attic to retrieve an old wooden trunk and bring it to the characters, then unlocks it with a key and lets them claim the two magic items inside.

Should she need anything, all she must do is whisper his name (\"Keltar Dardragon\") into the ring, and he would appear and provide assistance. She never found the need to do so, but she offers the ring to the character she likes the most (as determined by you). The ring radiates evocation magic under the scrutiny of a {@i detect magic} spell.": "如果人物努力去了解Arleosa并透露他们是冒险家，Arleosa就会俏皮地回忆说，她在她的时代迷住了几个冒险家的崇拜者。Arleosa说，其中一个人对她非常着迷，他送给她一枚装饰着跳舞的仙女的木质戒指，并告诉她这代表着一种特殊的恩惠。如果她需要什么，她所要做的就是对着戒指轻声说出他的名字（\"凯尔塔-达德拉贡\"），他就会出现并提供帮助。她从未发现有这样的需要，但她把戒指提供给她最喜欢的角色（由你决定）。戒指在{@i detect magic}法术的监视下放射出唤醒魔法。",

The younger brothers return before dusk, but Rantharl is not with them, and Marthun has a laceration on his right shoulder that a successful DC 11 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check confirms is a rapier wound.": "由于附近没有其他定居点，人物可能会倾向于在白鹿客栈过夜，在那里他们遇到了三个来自永夜的中年兄弟（LE男性伊鲁斯坎人（%0%）），他们正在为狩猎做准备。他们的名字是Rantharl、Marthun和Lezryk Daerivoss，他们告诉角色们，他们来诺亚纳之城是为了狩猎山地巨人。这对兄弟不希望有人陪伴。他们悄悄地给自己的马装上马鞍，绑上长矛，在黎明时分骑马出门。弟弟们在黄昏前回来了，但兰瑟尔没有和他们在一起，而马瑟恩的右肩上有一道裂口，成功通过DC11智慧({@skill Medicine})检查后，确认是剑伤。",
	"If pressed, the brothers claim that a hill giant killed Rantharl. Marthun claims that he was struck by the giant's spiked greatclub and denies any assertion that his wound was caused by a rapier. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check confirms that Marthun and Lezryk are lying, though Marthun welcomes any healing that the characters can provide.": "如果被追问，兄弟俩声称是一个山丘巨人杀死了兰瑟尔。Marthun声称他是被巨人的带刺大棒击中的，并否认任何关于他的伤口是由剑锋造成的说法。成功通过DC15智慧({@skill Insight})检查后，确认Marthun和Lezryk在撒谎，不过Marthun欢迎这些人物提供的任何治疗。",
	"The brothers are playing a murderous game with their inheritances at stake. The agreement was simple: the brother who first deals the killing blow to a hill giant would gain the inheritances of the other two. Rantharl won the contest, but Marthun and Lezryk turned against him. A fight ensued, Marthun was wounded, and Rantharl died. With Rantharl gone and no clear winner, Marthun and Lezryk have agreed to track down another hill giant.": "这对兄弟正在玩一场谋杀游戏，他们的继承权岌岌可危。协议很简单：谁先给一个山丘巨人以致命一击，谁就能获得另外两个人的遗产。Rantharl赢得了比赛，但Marthun和Lezryk反过来反对他。随后发生了一场战斗，马瑟恩受伤了，兰瑟尔死了。随着兰瑟尔的离去，没有明显的赢家，马尔敦和勒兹里克同意追踪另一个山丘巨人。",
	"If the characters follow the brothers on their hunt and are spotted, the brothers attack them. If the characters do nothing, Marthun and Lezryk begin another hunt the following day, but they encounter no hill giants. Lezryk betrays and kills Marthun, then returns to the inn to rest before making the long trip back to Neverwinter to deliver the sad news of his brothers' untimely deaths at the hands of \"rampaging hill giants.\" Characters can blackmail Lezryk for a cut of the brothers' inheritance (worth 10,000 gp total), or deal with the treacherous cad in some other manner as they see fit.": "如果人物跟随兄弟俩打猎并被发现，兄弟俩会攻击他们。如果人物什么都不做，Marthun和Lezryk就会在第二天开始另一次狩猎，但他们没有遇到山地巨人。Lezryk背叛并杀死了Marthun，然后回到旅馆休息，然后长途跋涉回到Neverwinter，传达他的兄弟们不幸死于 \"狂暴的山地巨人 \"之手的消息。角色可以敲诈勒兹里克以获得兄弟们的遗产（总价值10,000金币），或者以他们认为合适的其他方式来对付这个阴险的家伙。",
	"In the aftermath of the battle, {@creature Urgala Meltimer|SKT|Urgala} relates to the characters that one of her former adventuring companions, a wealthy knight named Harthos Zymorven, had a {@item giant slayer greatsword}. (Change the weapon to a {@item giant slayer greataxe} if that would be more desirable to a party member.) The last time Urgala spoke with him, Harthos was living in Zymorven Hall, his ancestral keep on the Rauvin Road northwest of Silverymoon. Urgala thinks Harthos might be willing to part with the weapon if the characters mention her name to him and explain their reason for needing it.": "在战斗结束后，{@creature Urgala Meltimer|SKT|Urgala}对人物说，她以前的一个冒险伙伴，一个名叫Harthos Zymorven的富有的骑士，有一把{@item giant slayer greatsword}。(如果这对党员来说更可取的话，就把武器改成{@item giant slayer greataxe})。乌尔加拉最后一次与他交谈时，哈索斯正住在银月城西北的劳文路上的祖传堡垒--齐莫文厅。乌加拉认为，如果人物向他提及她的名字并解释他们需要它的原因，哈索斯可能愿意放弃这把武器。",
	"If the characters journey to Zymorven Hall, they find Lord Harthos Zymorven, but he is sad to report that his son Harthal has stolen the {@item giant slayer}. Harthal committed this act after Lord Zymorven disowned him for marrying a common thief from Yartar (whose name he doesn't recall). What Harthal did with the sword, Lord Zymorven can only imagine.": "如果人物前往Zymorven大厅，他们会找到Harthos Zymorven勋爵，但他很伤心地报告说，他的儿子Harthal偷了（%0%）。Harthal是在Zymorven领主不承认他娶了一个来自Yartar的普通盗贼（他不记得这个人的名字了）之后做出这个行为的。哈塔尔用这把剑做了什么，齐莫文大人只能想象。",
	"The characters can travel to Yartar and search for Harthal there. After a few polite inquiries, it becomes apparent that the local thieves' guild, the Hand of Yartar, might be their best hope of finding Harthal. A character can bribe a tavern server at the Wink and Kiss (5 gp is sufficient) to learn the identity and whereabouts of a known Hand of Yartar member. They're as common as rats. If the characters obtained a letter of recommendation from Tamalin Zoar (see the \"Calling Horns\" section in chapter 3), they can show it to the Hand of Yartar member, who promises to have the information they need in a few hours. Otherwise, the thief demands a 500 gp payment up front. When the thief returns {@dice 1d6} hours later, she tells the characters that Harthal was arrested and imprisoned for murdering a man, and the greatsword found its way into the hands of a corrupt watch captain named Tholzar Brenner (LE male Damaran human {@creature knight}).": "人物可以前往Yartar，在那里寻找Harthal。经过一些礼貌性的询问，很明显，当地的盗贼公会--雅尔塔之手，可能是他们找到Harthal的最好希望。一个角色可以贿赂Wink and Kiss酒馆的服务员（5戈比就够了），以了解一个已知的Yartar之手成员的身份和下落。他们就像老鼠一样常见。如果人物从塔玛琳-佐尔（Tamalin Zoar）那里获得了一封推荐信（见第三章的 \"召唤角 \"部分），他们可以向亚尔塔之手成员出示推荐信，后者承诺在几个小时内提供他们需要的信息。否则，盗贼会要求先支付500金币。当小偷在几个小时后回来时（%0%），她告诉角色们，哈塔尔因为谋杀了一个人而被捕入狱，而那把大剑则落入了一个名叫托尔扎尔-布伦纳（LE男性达马兰人（%1%））的腐败值班长手中。",
	"The characters can try to relieve Brenner of the weapon by force. The man has many enemies, so he usually travels with eight {@creature Guard||guards} (LE male and female humans of various ethnicities). He refuses to relinquish the weapon willingly. Under normal circumstances, the death or disappearance of a watch member would trigger an investigation, but in Captain Brenner's case, Waterbaron Nestra Ruthiol is happy to be rid of him and doesn't order one.": "人物可以尝试用武力解救布伦纳的武器。这个人有很多敌人，所以他通常和八个（%0%）（不同种族的LE男性和女性人类）同行。他拒绝心甘情愿地放弃武器。在正常情况下，一个值班成员的死亡或失踪会引发调查，但在布伦纳上尉的情况下，水霸内斯特拉-鲁提尔很高兴能摆脱他，没有下令调查。",
	"Any character who belongs to the Harpers or the Zhentarim can approach his or her faction for help. If the character succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, he or she locates a faction safe house and gains entry. A failed check can be rerolled after another day spent searching, until a check succeeds or the character gives up the search. Inside the safe house, the character meets a faction representative, who sets a few wheels in motion. A few hours later, the stolen weapon is delivered to the safe house.": "任何属于哈珀人或赞塔林人的角色都可以向他或她的派别寻求帮助。如果该角色在DC15智力（（%0%））检查中成功，他或她就能找到一个派别的安全屋并获得进入。如果检定失败，可以在另一天的搜索后重新进行检定，直到检定成功或角色放弃搜索。在安全屋里，角色遇到了一个派别的代表，他启动了几个轮子。几个小时后，被盗的武器被送到了安全屋。",
	"A character who belongs to the Lords' Alliance can petition the Waterbaron for help. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Deception} or {@skill Persuasion}) check to gain an audience. {@skill Deception} is appropriate if the character makes false claims to gain an audience; otherwise, use {@skill Persuasion}. A failed check can be rerolled the next day, but each failed check increases the DC by 1. If a character succeeds on this check, the Waterbaron wrests the sword from Captain Brenner's clutches and sees it delivered safely to that individual.": "属于领主联盟的角色可以向水霸王请求帮助。该角色必须在DC15的魅力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查中成功，才能获得听众。如果角色为了获得听众而进行虚假的宣称，那么使用{@skill Deception}是合适的；否则，使用{@skill Persuasion}。如果检定失败，可以在第二天重新进行检定，但每次检定失败都会使DC增加1。",

	"After his close call during the giants' attack, {@creature Othovir|SKT} expresses his gratitude to the characters by sharing a secret with them: he knows the location of a stash of magic items that the Margaster family, his kin, keeps locked away for emergencies. If the characters ask him how he came by this information, {@creature Othovir|SKT} tells them that he has a history with the Margaster family, which he despises for reasons he'd rather not discuss. The family owns a three-story tower in Silverymoon that has a detached carriage house on the property, and it is here that the characters must travel. He provides the following details:": "在巨人的攻击中险些丧命后，{@creature Othovir|SKT}为了表达他对人物的感激之情，与他们分享了一个秘密：他知道马加斯特家族（他的亲戚）为应急而藏匿的魔法物品的位置。如果角色们问他是如何得到这个信息的，(1%)会告诉他们，他和马加斯特家族有一段历史，由于他不愿意讨论的原因，他很鄙视这个家族。这个家族在Silverymoon拥有一座三层楼的塔楼，塔楼上有一个独立的马车房，而人物必须在这里旅行。他提供了以下细节。",
	"The carriage house is a 30-foot-square stone building with two floors. The windowless ground floor that holds the carriage has a big wooden sliding door in the front. The upper floor is an apartment with a floor made of wooden planks and a barred window set into each wall. An open wooden staircase in one corner of the building connects the floors.": "马车房是一个30英尺见方的石头建筑，有两层。放置马车的无窗底层，前面有一扇大的木制滑动门。上层是一个公寓，地板由木板铺成，每面墙上都有一个带栅栏的窗户。建筑物的一角有一个开放的木制楼梯，连接着两层楼。",

	"The Savage Frontier, or the North, is a harsh and untamed wilderness dotted with fortified settlements and the lairs of terrible monsters. In hundreds of bloodcurdling tales of danger and hardship, the North is portrayed as a vast, cold, and lawless domain that defies all attempts to civilize it. Grim dwarfholds, tribes of fierce barbarians, and half-legendary elf realms might stand for a short time, but none are destined to last. An orc horde or a flight of dragons could sweep them all away tomorrow, leaving nothing but mile upon unmapped mile of wilderness.": "野蛮的边疆，或者说北方，是一个严酷的、未被驯服的荒野，点缀着坚固的定居点和可怕怪物的巢穴。在数百个关于危险和困难的令人毛骨悚然的故事中，北方被描绘成一个广阔、寒冷和无法无天的领域，它藐视所有使其文明化的企图。严峻的矮人家庭、凶猛的野蛮人部落和半传奇的精灵王国可能会在短时间内屹立不倒，但没有一个是注定要持久的。兽人部落或龙的飞行可以在明天将它们全部扫除，只留下一英里又一英里的未开发的荒野。",
	"The Savage Frontier lies between the Sword Coast and the desert of Anauroch, extending as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the city of Waterdeep.

Here, too, can be found the wealth of history—the plunder of lost civilizations such as Illefarn and Eaerlann, the ancient kingdoms of the gold elves; Delzoun, a long-buried nation of dungeon-dwelling dwarves; and Netheril, a fallen empire of human spellcasters. Throughout the Savage Frontier lie the ruins and dungeons of these and other \"forgotten realms.\" Cities such as Waterdeep, Mirabar, and Neverwinter would like to claim this wealth and knowledge for themselves, but enforcing such claims is next to impossible. The cities have a hard enough time protecting their farmlands and roads from brigands and monsters.": "北方是一片拥有巨大矿产资源和看似无边的木材的土地。在这里也可以找到历史的财富--失落文明的掠夺，如金精灵的古老王国Illefarn和Eaerlann；地牢居住的矮人的长期埋藏的国家Delzoun；和人类法术师的堕落帝国Netheril。在整个野蛮边境，到处都是这些和其他 \"被遗忘的国度 \"的废墟和地牢。诸如沃特迪普（Waterdeep）、米拉巴尔（Mirabar）和永夜（Neverwinter）等城市都想把这些财富和知识据为己有，但强制执行这种要求几乎是不可能的。这些城市已经很难保护他们的农田和道路免受强盗和怪物的侵扰。",
	"Humans are the most widespread of the civilized races, but no unified human nation exists in the North—only individual cities, towns, villages, fiefdoms, farmsteads, fortresses, and outposts connected to one another by long, mostly unprotected rivers and roads. Human settlements rely on various industries for survival. For example, most of the humans of Ten-Towns and Port Llast are fishers, the humans of Mirabar and Leilon are primarily miners, and the humans who live in Beliard, Triboar, and other settlements of the central Dessarin Valley are mostly farmers. Coastal cities such as Waterdeep, Luskan, and Neverwinter—as well as riverside cities such as Yartar, Everlund, and Silverymoon—are home to human traders, shipbuilders, and artisans.": "人类是最广泛的文明种族，但在北方没有统一的人类国家，只有个别的城市、城镇、村庄、封地、农庄、堡垒和前哨，通过长长的、大部分没有保护的河流和道路相互连接。人类定居点依靠各种行业生存。例如，Ten-Towns和Port Llast的大部分人类是渔民，Mirabar和Leilon的人类主要是矿工，而居住在Beliard、Triboar和Dessarin山谷中部其他定居点的人类大多是农民。沿海城市如沃特迪普（Waterdeep）、卢斯坎（Luskan）和永夜（Neverwinter），以及河边城市如亚尔塔（Yartar）、埃弗伦（Everlund）和银月（Silverymoon）都是人类商人、造船师和工匠的家园。",
	"Although each city of the North enjoys and maintains its independence, all these communities are at risk of being overrun by the monstrous threats that live outside their walls. Fear of the wilderness and its many terrors led to the formation of the Lords' Alliance, a loose confederacy of human-dominated settlements built on mutually beneficial trade agreements and a willingness to seek out and destroy threats to civilization. Members of the Lords' Alliance include the cities of Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Mirabar, Yartar, and Silverymoon, as well as the towns of Amphail, Daggerford, and Longsaddle and the dwarfhold of Mithral Hall.

	"Within the settlements of the North, one can find humans, dwarves, elves, and other civilized races commingling more or less peacefully. Waterdeep, in particular, is a melting pot of races from all over Faerûn. Outside these communities, however, people have much less tolerance for other races, as folk tend to feel safer among their own kind. Small towns and villages dominated by humans tend to have few if any nonhumans, with most dwarves, elves, and halflings preferring to live in their own settlements, far from human-claimed lands. In generations past, most human settlers of the North were fair-haired and light-skinned. Since then, the riches and promise of the Savage Frontier have attracted distant foreigners, and several generations of cultural intermingling have given the humans of the North much more diversity in their appearance (see \"{@race human||Human Names and Ethnicities}\" in {@book chapter 2|PHB|1} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).": "在北方的定居点内，人们可以发现人类、矮人、精灵和其他文明种族或多或少地和平共处。尤其是水底城，是来自法鲁恩各地的种族的大熔炉。然而，在这些社区之外，人们对其他种族的容忍度要低得多，因为人们倾向于在自己的同类中感到更安全。由人类主导的小城镇和村庄往往很少有非人类，大多数矮人、精灵和半身人喜欢住在自己的定居点，远离人类的土地。在过去的几代人中，北方的大多数人类定居者都是白发和浅色皮肤。从那时起，野蛮边境的财富和前景吸引了遥远的外国人，几代人的文化交融使北方的人类在外表上更加多样化（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的\"{@race human||Human Names and Ethnicities}\"）。",

They refer to one of several tall, fair-haired, seagoing peoples that ply the cold northern waters and dwell on the islands of the west, including Tuern, Gundarlun, Ruathym, the Purple Rocks, and the Korinn Archipelago. Northfolk ancestors built small villages along the Sword Coast that have since become cities, including fabled Illusk (now Luskan), Eigersstor (now Neverwinter), and Nimoar's Hold (now Waterdeep). These early Northlanders farmed the rocky coastlines, fished coastal waters, and hunted seals and whales on the open sea. A few clans of Northlanders explored the monster-infested interior of the Savage Frontier, and they became the ancestors of the Uthgardt tribes and the present-day denizens of Icewind Dale.": "北方人、Northfolk和Northmen这三个词是可以互换的。他们指的是几个高大、白发的航海民族之一，他们在寒冷的北方水域航行，居住在西部的岛屿上，包括图恩、贡达伦、鲁阿西姆、紫岩和科林群岛。诺斯福克人的祖先在剑海岸建立了一些小村庄，这些村庄后来都变成了城市，包括传说中的伊鲁斯克（现在的卢斯坎）、艾格斯托尔（现在的永冬）和尼莫尔之城（现在的沃特迪普）。这些早期的北地人在岩石海岸线上耕种，在沿海水域捕鱼，并在公海上猎取海豹和鲸鱼。有几个北地人的部族探索了野蛮边境的怪物泛滥的内部，他们成为了乌斯加德部落和今天冰风谷居民的祖先。",
	"Northlanders farm, fish, and mine their rugged lands, then shrewdly trade their goods with foreign buyers. Many once-feared tribes have become merchants whose bartering skills are equal to or better than the warlike talents of their ancestors, such that many a Northlander merchant is wealthier than their raiding neighbors.": "北方人在他们崎岖的土地上耕种、捕鱼和采矿，然后精明地与外国买家交易他们的货物。许多曾经害怕的部落已经成为商人，他们的易货贸易技能等同于或优于他们祖先的好战才能，因此许多北地人的商人比他们的突袭邻居更富有。",
	"The frozen tundra of Icewind Dale is home to the nomadic Reghed barbarians. They are named after the Reghed Glacier that forms a towering ice wall along the eastern boundary of their domain. Markedly taller than most southerners, with some males approaching seven feet in height, Reghed barbarians have blue eyes and hair of blond, red, or light brown. Their skin is bronzed from the sun and cracked by the wind, giving their faces the look of tough leather set in an expressionless mask. They dress in leather and furs. At one time, scores of Reghed tribes roamed the frozen north. Now, due to wars with orcs and battles against their own kind, not to mention the encroachment of civilization, only four Reghed tribes remain. They follow herds of reindeer on the animals' annual migrations, moving southwest in the winter and northeast in the summer. The barbarians live in large, round tents made of deerskin and supported by beams of wood or whalebone.": "冰风谷的冰冻苔原是游牧的雷格德野蛮人的家园。他们因雷格德冰川而得名，该冰川在他们领地的东部边界形成一道高耸的冰墙。雷格德野蛮人明显比大多数南方人高，有些男性身高接近7英尺，他们有蓝色的眼睛和金色、红色或浅棕色的头发。他们的皮肤被太阳晒成古铜色，被风吹得干裂，使他们的脸看起来就像镶嵌在无表情面具中的坚硬皮革。他们穿着皮革和毛皮的衣服。曾几何时，几十个瑞格德部落在冰冷的北方游荡。现在，由于与兽人的战争和与同类的战斗，更不用说文明的侵袭，只剩下四个瑞格德部落。他们每年跟随驯鹿群迁徙，冬季向西南方向移动，夏季向东北方向移动。野蛮人住在用鹿皮制成的大圆帐篷里，由木头或鲸骨的横梁支撑。",
	"In the past, the Reghed tribes were known to raid Ten-Towns for supplies, but now the Tribe of the Elk is learning to live in peace with the more civilized people of Ten-Towns. The other three Reghed tribes—the Tribe of the Tiger, the Tribe of the Wolf, and the Tribe of the Bear—are more likely to attack one another than to threaten their more civilized neighbors, fighting over sustenance at the risk of their own extinction.": "在过去，Reghed部落以突袭Ten-Towns的物资而闻名，但现在麋鹿部落正在学习与Ten-Towns更文明的人们和平共处。其他三个雷格德部落--虎部落、狼部落和熊部落--更有可能相互攻击，而不是威胁他们更文明的邻居，他们为了生计而争斗，不惜自己灭亡。",
	"A single Reghed tribe is made up of small clans scattered throughout Icewind Dale, each with its own chieftain. The chieftains choose the most powerful among them to be their king or queen—the one around whom others rally in times of crisis. When a monarch dies, the tribe's chieftains gather to choose a new one. Disputes over who should be named king or queen are resolved through trials by nonlethal combat. Without a unifying leader, a Reghed tribe is more fractured and vulnerable to its enemies. Thus, chieftains are motivated to name one among them who rules above all. A chieftain who becomes king or queen wears that mantle for life.": "一个Reghed部落是由分散在冰风谷的小部族组成的，每个部族都有自己的酋长。酋长们选择其中最强大的人作为他们的国王或女王--在危机时刻，其他人都会团结在他周围。当君主去世时，部落的首领们会聚在一起选择新的君主。关于谁应该被任命为国王或王后的争议通过非致命战斗的审判来解决。如果没有一个统一的领袖，Reghed部落就会更加支离破碎，容易受到敌人的攻击。因此，酋长们都想在他们中间指定一个人统治所有的人。成为国王或王后的酋长会终身戴着这顶帽子。",

These tribes will also unite against white dragons and frost giants, since those creatures threaten Icewind Dale's food supply. The Tribe of the Wolf and its mad king, Isarr Kronenstrom, don't ally with the other tribes—they are so vicious and bloodthirsty as to be unapproachable. The kings and queens of the other tribes would see the Tribe of the Wolf obliterated, but the Wolf King and his followers are adept at avoiding the traps set for them by their rivals.": "雷格德野蛮人憎恨兽人，熊部落、麋鹿部落和虎部落将抛开部落间的争斗来消灭他们。这些部落还将联合起来对抗白龙和冰霜巨人，因为这些生物威胁着冰风谷的食物供应。狼部落及其疯狂的国王Isarr Kronenstrom不与其他部落结盟--他们是如此的凶恶和嗜血，以至于无法接近。其他部落的国王和女王希望看到狼部落被消灭，但狼王和他的追随者善于避开对手为他们设置的陷阱。",

For many years, the town stood abandoned because the protective magic around a wizard's tower called the House of Thalivar went awry, causing any who looked at it to be {@condition paralyzed}. The few travelers still taking the High Road and braving the expansion of the Mere of Dead Men had to travel for miles around Leilon or pass by it at night to avoid the tower's mysterious power.

Loudwater provides a welcome respite for weary caravan and riverboat drivers, not to mention adventurers. It lies on both sides of the Delimbiyr River, the two halves linked by an arching stone overpass built by dwarves to honor the elves. Ancient wards placed on the overpass to preserve it had an unintended magical side effect: river trout attempting to swim under the bridge are propelled over it instead, which is why locals refer to it as the Flying Fish Bridge. People crossing the bridge are occasionally struck by these fish, which deal no damage. Whenever a fish hits a traveler and flops onto the bridge, it's a local custom (and considered good luck) to toss the fish back into the river.": "随着泽尔布罗斯、奥尔巴和洛尔克成为废墟，劳德沃特是塞康伯以东德林拜尔谷地的最后一个文明堡垒。如果该镇有忧虑，它也不会表现出来。劳德沃特为疲惫的商队和河船司机提供了一个受欢迎的休息场所，更不用说冒险者了。它位于德林拜尔河的两岸，两半由矮人建造的拱形石桥连接，以纪念精灵。为了保护立交桥，古代的防护措施有一个意外的魔法副作用：试图从桥下游过的河鳟鱼被推到桥上，这就是为什么当地人把它称为飞鱼桥。过桥的人偶尔会被这些鱼撞到，但它们不会造成任何伤害。每当有鱼撞到旅行者并翻到桥上时，当地的习俗是把鱼扔回河里（被认为是好运气）。",
	"Once a home to elves, Loudwater is a human town today. Its grand wood-and-stone buildings are overgrown by vines and hung with flowering plants. Streets curl and meander. Huge, old trees line the riverbanks, and gardens and bowers are everywhere.

The river is unusually wide here, providing the town with space for a modest harbor.": "劳德沃特曾经是精灵的家园，今天是一个人类城镇。其宏伟的木石建筑被藤蔓所覆盖，挂满了花草。街道弯弯曲曲，蜿蜒曲折。河岸边有巨大的古树，花园和花圃随处可见。几年前，该镇用一堵墙取代了它的土城墙，但这堵墙在定居点内外的地基上都种着花。这里的河道异常宽阔，为该镇提供了一个适度的港口空间。",

The town's current high lord is Telbor Zazrek (N male Damaran human {@creature mage}), a retired adventurer and well-paid puppet of the Zhentarim who enjoys the power that has been handed to him. Through Zazrek, the Black Network maintains an invisible stranglehold on the town. All goods that aren't supplied by the Zhentarim are heavily taxed, and the cost of living in Loudwater is so high that all of its establishments are forced to charge exorbitant prices.": "大领主大厅是一座位于河流北侧的豪宅。该镇目前的大领主是泰尔伯-扎兹雷克（N位男性达马兰人（%0%）），他是一位退休的冒险家，也是振塔林的高薪傀儡，他享受着交到他手上的权力。通过扎兹雷克，黑网对该镇保持着一种无形的扼制。所有不是由Zhentarim提供的商品都被征收重税，Loudwater的生活成本非常高，所有的机构都被迫收取高昂的价格。",
	"Adding to Loudwater's problems are the stone giants of the Graypeak Mountains (see chapter 6, \"{@adventure Canyon of the Stone Giants|SKT|6}\"), who have begun laying waste to Llorkh, Orlbar, and the hamlets of Grayvale. Refugees are pouring into Loudwater, and those who can't afford to stay at the local inns are being herded like cows into warehouses overlooking the harbor. As if that weren't bad enough, stone giants have been seen spying on the town from afar, no doubt trying to determine its defensive capabilities. Since the Black Network keeps its forces well hidden in Loudwater and the town militia is a small force, Loudwater might seem like an easy target.": "让劳德沃特的问题雪上加霜的是灰峰山的石巨人（见第6章，\"{@adventure Canyon of the Stone Giants|SKT|6}\"），他们已经开始对Llorkh、Orlbar和Grayvale的村落进行破坏。难民们纷纷涌入劳德沃特，那些住不起当地旅馆的人就像牛一样被赶进了俯瞰港口的仓库。如果这还不够糟糕的话，有人看到石巨人从远处窥探该镇，无疑是想确定其防御能力。由于黑网在劳德沃特的势力隐藏得很好，而镇上的民兵又是一支小部队，劳德沃特似乎是一个容易的目标。",
	"The southern verge of the Lurkwood is safe enough to attract woodcutters, trappers, and hunters from Mirabar, Xantharl's Keep, and Longsaddle, but there's really no corner safe from the Uthgardt tribes that hunt here (primarily Black Raven and Thunderbeast barbarians). Goblinoids, wolves, and dire wolves also prowl these woods.": "卢克森林的南部边缘足够安全，吸引了来自米拉巴尔、桑塔尔堡和长鞍的伐木者、捕猎者和猎人，但实际上没有任何角落可以避开在此狩猎的乌斯加德特部落（主要是黑鸦和雷兽野蛮人）。哥布林人、狼和地狼也在这些森林里游荡。",

	"In reality, Luskan is anything but that. It's a dirty dive with filthy streets, squat buildings, ramshackle docks, creaky old longships, and crass pirates thinly disguised as sea traders. Rising above the fog and the stench is the Hosttower of the Arcane, home of a league of greedy, power-hungry wizards called the Arcane Brotherhood. Their ghastly tower branches into multiple thinner spires at the top. From a distance, the Hosttower might be mistaken for a giant, leafless tree. To those who have the misfortune of seeing it up close, it looks like a clawed hand bursting out of the ground, each of its fingers a tower with many peering windows.": "在现实中，卢斯坎并不是这样。它是一个肮脏的地方，有肮脏的街道、蹲踞的建筑、破旧的码头、吱吱作响的旧长船，以及伪装成海商的粗俗海盗。耸立在浓雾和恶臭之上的是奥术师的主塔，它是一个贪婪的、渴望权力的巫师联盟的家，被称为奥术师兄弟会。他们那座可怕的塔在顶端分成多个较细的尖塔。从远处看，Hosttower可能被误认为是一棵巨大的无叶树。对于那些不幸近距离看到它的人来说，它看起来就像一只张牙舞爪的手从地下迸发出来，它的每个手指都是一座带有许多窥视窗口的塔。",
	"Five High Captains rule the city. Each one is a glorified pirate lord who controls a fleet of longships. The five fleets serve many purposes: they defend Luskan against seafaring barbarians and other enemies, they conduct legitimate sea trade up and down the Sword Coast, and they raid and plunder the island kingdoms to the west (and the occasional settlement on the Sword Coast). The High Captains have no influence over the actions of the Arcane Brotherhood, nor is it apparent that the wizards have any allegiance to Luskan.": "五位高级船长统治着这座城市。每个人都是一个光荣的海盗领主，控制着一支长船舰队。这五支舰队有许多作用：他们保卫卢斯坎，抵御航海的野蛮人和其他敌人；他们在剑海岸上下进行合法的海上贸易；他们袭击和掠夺西部的岛屿王国（以及剑海岸上偶尔出现的定居点）。高级船长们对奥术师兄弟会的行动没有任何影响，也看不出巫师们对卢斯坎有任何效忠。",
	"Luskan's best-kept secret is that the High Captains are under the sway of Jarlaxle Baenre, the leader of a clandestine brotherhood of drow mercenaries and rogues called Bregan D'aerthe. Jarlaxle is a master schemer (and a master of disguise) who would like to bring Luskan into the Lords' Alliance, but the City of Sails has such an unsavory reputation and so little to offer that most alliance members won't allow it. That doesn't stop Jarlaxle from trying, especially now that the alliance has lost two members: Everlund and Sundabar.": "卢斯坎最不为人知的秘密是，高级船长们受贾拉索-贝恩雷（Jarlaxle Baenre）的控制，他是一个名为Bregan D'aerthe的鸦人雇佣兵和流氓的秘密兄弟会的领袖。贾拉索是个阴谋家（也是个伪装大师），他想把卢斯坎带入领主联盟，但风帆之城的名声太差，能提供的东西太少，大多数联盟成员都不允许它。这并不能阻止贾拉索的尝试，尤其是现在联盟已经失去了两个成员。埃弗伦德和桑达巴。",

The smoke billows out of a frost giant greatship (see the \"{@area Svardborg: General Features|350|x}\" sidebar in chapter 7, \"Berg of the Frost Giants\") that blew into port and rammed several longships, sinking them before a group of wizards emerged from the Hosttower of the Arcane and set the ship ablaze with a flurry of {@spell fireball} spells. The wizards have since returned to their monstrous tower, and the High Captains are waiting for the ship to stop burning before they board and search it.

He says the Hunt Lords are retired and don't wish to be disturbed, and he warns guests to stay in the lodge at night, claiming the land around Noanar's Hold is haunted by the spirits of dead hunters.": "村里曾经著名的狩猎小屋--白鹿客栈，矗立在低矮的石头小屋和马厩之中。这座摇摇欲坠的建筑内部维护得很好，在其他质朴的环境中提供了一点宏伟的感觉。旅店老板是一个彬彬有礼的小个子，名叫阿弗格-费罗伊（N男性崇丹人（%0%）），他有长期的看不见的仆人来帮助打扫。他有点妄想症，说起狩猎领主就像他们还活着一样，尽管他已经看到了相反的证据。他说狩猎领主已经退休了，不希望被打扰，他警告客人晚上要呆在旅馆里，声称诺亚尔之家周围的土地被死去的猎人的灵魂所困扰。",
	"Characters who seek an audience with the Hunt Lords must first speak to Amrath Mulnobar (NE male shield dwarf {@creature veteran}), the castellan of the Hunt Lords' keep. Amrath has served the Hunt Lords for more than two centuries, dating back to when they were still alive.

If the characters knock on these doors, Amrath arrives a minute later, opens an iron slit in the door at dwarf's-eye level, and demands to know what they want. The dwarf doesn't open the doors unless the characters are delivering new saddles for his masters' steeds (see the \"{@area Narth Tezrin's Quest|12c|x}\" section in chapter 2). Amrath allows the characters to place the saddles in the entrance foyer, then quickly tries to usher them out.": "这座城堡坐落在山顶上的老松树中，俯瞰着这个沉睡的村庄。这座建筑有三层，角落里有炮塔，屋顶上有垛口。其中一个炮台的屋顶已经坍塌，留下一个缺口，鸟类和其他生物可以通过这个缺口进入。所有的窗户都用砖头封住了，一楼厚重的橡木门从内部被封住。迫使它们打开需要成功地进行DC27力量检查。如果人物敲了这些门，阿姆拉斯会在一分钟后赶到，在矮人的视线范围内打开门上的一条铁缝，并要求知道他们想要什么。矮人不会开门，除非人物是为他的主人的骏马提供新的马鞍（见第二章的\"（%0%）\"部分）。阿姆拉斯允许角色们把马鞍放在入口处的门厅里，然后很快就想把他们赶出去。",
	"The Hunt Lords lurk in a dusty ground-floor banquet hall, slumped in chairs around a cobweb-draped dining table.

The upper tier is shaped like a sky pony (a pegasus), though the form of this feature is readily apparent only from the air. A round, 15-foot-diameter boulder planted firmly in the ground in the northeastern part of the area represents the eye of the sky pony. The boulder is covered with line engravings chiseled by an unknown hand, and it's this stone that the spirit mound's name refers to.

A {@spell detect magic} spell cast within range of the tree reveals an aura of necromancy magic emanating from underneath it. To reach the relic, characters must dig under the tree and hack away at its roots. This exercise takes a single character 40 hours to accomplish; multiple party members working together can reduce the amount of time accordingly. The buried relic is the skull of Gurt, Lord of the Pale Giants, a frost giant that Uthgar defeated in single combat at the site of Morgur's Mound. The skull weighs 100 pounds.

	"Halfway between Secomber and Loudwater, on the old Delimbiyr Road, are the charred wooden remains and the crumbled stone chimney of an inn that was burned down by brigands many years ago.

	"A female {@creature hill giant} named Moog has barricaded herself in this lonely tower so that she can wallow in self-pity undisturbed. {@creature Chief Guh|SKT} has taken Moog's husband, Hruk, as her own, leaving Moog with no one to abuse on a daily basis. Moog is singing a mournful tune, which is amplified by the acoustics of the tower.": "一个名叫莫格的女性（%0%）把自己关在这个孤独的塔里，以便她可以不受干扰地沉湎于自怜。{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}已经把莫格的丈夫赫鲁克占为己有，使莫格每天都没有人可以虐待。穆格在唱着哀怨的曲子，这曲子被塔的音响效果放大了。",
	"Moog sits on the upper level of the tower (area 2), her calves and bare feet dangling through a hole in the floor. From this position, she can see anyone that enters the tower through the front door, the hole in the upstairs wall, or the window above the doorway.

Her incessant singing is so loud that she can't hear anything but the loudest noises outside the tower.": "穆格坐在塔楼的上层（2区），她的小腿和赤脚从地板上的一个洞里垂下来。从这个位置，她可以看到任何通过前门、楼上墙上的洞或门口上方的窗户进入塔内的人。她背对着楼上朝东的窗户，看不到从那个方向走来的人。她不停地唱歌，声音很大，除了塔外最响亮的声音，她什么都听不到。",
	"The hawks circling above the tower are four {@creature Blood Hawk||blood hawks}. Any character who pays attention to the hawks can discern their crimson feathers with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or recall their aggressive nature with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check.

	"Moog has parked a large boulder in front of the doorway. A Small character can squeeze through a narrow opening to enter the tower. Otherwise, the boulder can be rolled aside with a successful DC 25 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. A stone staircase hugs the inside wall, spiraling upward in a clockwise direction and forming landings at various points. Situated next to each landing is a 9-foot-tall arrow slit that tapers to a width of 5 inches. Much of the tower floor and the staircase is strewn with rubble—stone from the crumbling walls and wood from the partially collapsed roof. The rubble counts as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "穆格在门口停放了一块大石块。一个小个子的角色可以挤过一个狭窄的开口进入塔内。否则，只要成功地进行DC25力量({@skill Athletics})检查，就可以将巨石滚到一边。一条石阶环绕着内墙，以顺时针方向螺旋式上升，并在不同的位置形成落脚点。在每个着陆点旁边都有一个9英尺高的箭形缝隙，其宽度逐渐变小，只有5英寸。塔楼的大部分地板和楼梯都散落着碎石--来自摇摇欲坠的墙壁的石头和来自部分坍塌的屋顶的木材。这些碎石算作（1%）。",
	"Any character who searches through the rubble finds a cracked floor tile with what appears to be a compartment underneath it. Years ago, a halfling adventurer named Keltar Dardragon buried a treasure chest under the floor here, and he never had a chance to reclaim it before he died. Moog hasn't noticed the chest, which is locked but in poor condition. A character can easily break or pick the lock (no ability check required). The chest holds 300 sp and two magic items, determined by rolling on {@table Magic Item Table B} in {@book chapter 7|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.": "任何在废墟中搜索的角色都会发现一块破裂的地砖，地砖下面似乎有一个隔间。几年前，一个叫凯尔塔-达德拉贡的半身人冒险家在这里的地板下埋了一个宝箱，他在死前一直没有机会去取回它。穆格没有注意到这个箱子，它是锁着的，但条件很差。一个角色可以轻易地打破或撬开锁（不需要检查能力）。箱子里有300英镑和两件魔法物品，通过在{@book chapter 7|DMG|-1}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中滚动来确定。",
	"Nothing of value is to be found on this level of the tower except a large sack lying on the floor. Determine its contents by rolling three times on the Items in a Giant's Bag table in the introduction.": "在塔的这一层没有任何有价值的东西，只有一个躺在地上的大麻袋。通过在介绍中的 \"巨人袋中的物品 \"表上滚动三次来确定其内容。",
	"Moog is here unless she has been lured elsewhere. If the characters wait her out, Moog gets hungry and stops her mournful singing after {@dice 2d20} minutes. The hungry giant leaps down to the ground floor, pushes the boulder aside, and exits the tower in search of food. If the characters hide and let her go, she returns to the tower {@dice 3d10} hours later with a squealing boar tucked under one arm.": "穆格在这里，除非她被引诱到其他地方。如果角色们等她出来，Moog就会饿，并在{@dice 2d20}分钟后停止她的悲鸣。这个饥饿的巨人跳下地面，把巨石推到一边，然后离开塔楼去寻找食物。如果人物躲起来让她走，她会在{@dice 3d10}小时后回到塔里，一只胳膊下夹着一只尖叫的野猪。",
	"Moog has had some bad experiences with small folk in the past. Her inclination is to attack if confronted. Her tower contains enough rubble that she won't run out of rocks to throw anytime soon. Any character who tries to allay Moog's concerns by speaking to her calmly and soothingly in Giant can make a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If Moog is also bribed with food or treasure, this check is made with advantage.": "穆格过去有一些与小人物打交道的糟糕经历。她的倾向是在面对面的情况下进行攻击。她的塔里有足够的碎石，她不会很快就没有石头可扔了。任何试图通过用巨人语平静地和她说话来消除穆格的担忧的人物，都可以进行DC12魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。如果穆格也被用食物或财宝贿赂，那么这个检查是有优势的。",
	"If the check succeeds, Moog stops attacking long enough to hear what the character has to say. She also reveals why she's so unhappy.

She also knows that Grudd Haug is full of orcs, goblins, hobgoblins, and ogres. Moog is more frightened of {@creature Chief Guh|SKT} than she is of the characters and won't voluntarily help them attack Grudd Haug. She prefers to remain a safe distance away from the hill giant den (at least half a mile), but characters can convince Moog to accompany them by claiming that they need her help to identify Hruk and rescue him from the hill giant chief. Even when coaxed into joining the assault on Grudd Haug, Moog won't attack other hill giants. If she comes across her husband, she grabs him by the hair and leads him far away from Grudd Haug.": "如果检查成功，穆格就会停止攻击足够长的时间来听这个人物说什么。她还会透露她为什么如此不开心。如果人物承诺让Moog与她的丈夫团聚，她会很高兴，并尽力帮助他们作为回报。Moog知道{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}住在哪里，可以带领大家找到Grudd Haug（见第五章，\"{@adventure Den of the Hill Giants|SKT|5}\"）。她还知道格鲁德豪格到处都是兽人、地精、霍布格林和食人魔。Moog对{@creature Chief Guh|SKT}比她对这些人物更害怕，不会主动帮助他们攻击Grudd Haug。她更愿意与山丘巨人的巢穴保持安全距离（至少半英里），但角色可以通过声称他们需要她的帮助来识别赫鲁克并从山丘巨人首领那里救出他来说服摩格与他们同行。即使被哄骗加入对格鲁德-豪格的攻击，摩格也不会攻击其他山地巨人。如果她遇到了她的丈夫，她会抓住他的头发，带他远离Grudd Haug。",
	"Moog is chaotic evil, and thus prone to abrupt mood swings. She loses patience with the characters and attacks them if they don't continually renew their promise to help her and give her food. Whenever Moog awakens after a long rest, she forgets who the characters are and attacks them, whereupon a character must repeat the Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to regain her trust.": "穆格是个混乱的恶魔，因此容易出现突然的情绪波动。她对人物失去了耐心，如果他们不不断地重新承诺帮助她并给她食物，她就会攻击他们。每当穆格在长时间的休息后醒来，她就会忘记角色是谁，并攻击他们，这时角色必须重复魅力（（%0%））检查以重新获得她的信任。",
	"Various special quests in chapter 2 can lead adventurers to Moongleam Tower in the city of Everlund.

Its resident archmage, Krowen Valharrow, is well aware of \"the giant problem.\" If the characters approach him, Krowen warns them that the giants' upheaval poses a grave threat to the balance of power in the North. He has it on good authority that the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Emerald Enclave, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Zhentarim are all taking steps to protect civilization against the giants' depredations. Krowen knows that giants and dragons have a long history of conflict, and he suspects that the dragons might somehow be responsible (directly or indirectly) for the giants' uprising.": "在本章前面的 \"Everlund \"部分，对Moongleam塔有更详细的描述。其常驻大法师克罗恩-瓦尔哈罗（Krowen Valharrow）对 \"巨人问题 \"非常了解。如果人物接近他，克洛温会警告他们，巨人的动荡对北方的权力平衡构成了严重威胁。他有充分的证据表明，哈珀人、领主联盟、翡翠飞地、高塔骑士团和赞塔林都在采取措施，保护文明免受巨人的掠夺。克劳恩知道巨人和龙的冲突由来已久，他怀疑龙可能要对巨人的起义负某种责任（直接或间接）。",
	"Krowen isn't very adventurous himself, but he's fond of adventurers and uses them to do his dirty work. If the characters explain that they're trying to thwart the giants, Krowen grants the party free access to a secret network of {@spell teleportation circle}s that he and his fellow Harper wizards use for travel. He also gives the characters a sheet of parchment that shows all six circles and their sigil addresses (show the players figure 3.1). The circles are located in Everlund, Loudwater, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Waterdeep, and Yartar. The specific locations of these circles are briefly described below, and a Harper spellcaster stands ready at each site to cast the {@spell teleportation circle} spell should the party require it.

He uses his cantrips to frighten away squatters and other unwanted intruders.": "哈珀夫妇在雅尔塔市中心购买了一栋即将被拆毁的别墅。在这栋破旧的建筑后面有一个40英尺见方的花园天井，由一堵8英尺高的常春藤覆盖的石墙围住。一个{@spell hallucinatory terrain}的咒语不仅掩盖了刻在天井中间的{@spell teleportation circle}，还掩盖了围绕着这个圆圈的破碎的长椅、杂草丛生的花坛和破碎的雕像。当{@spell hallucinatory terrain}咒语生效时，花园看起来就像它的全盛时期一样，花丛中和石凳上有嬉戏的干尸和萨提尔的雕像。一个名叫科尔巴兹（Kolbaz）的脾气暴躁的老哈珀（NG男性卡利希特人（%3%））住在别墅里，每天在高阳时更新（%4%）咒语（他准备了该咒语而不是（%5%））。他用他的咒语来吓走擅自闯入者和其他不受欢迎的入侵者。",
	"This encounter can occur anywhere in the North and is designed to lead characters toward chapter 4 of the adventure, \"The Chosen Path.\" After romping around the North for a while, the characters might reach a point where they can't decide where to go next. That's the best time to use this encounter.": "这个遭遇可以发生在北方的任何地方，目的是引导人物走向冒险的第四章 \"天选之路\"。在北境漫游了一段时间后，角色们可能会达到一个无法决定下一步去哪里的程度。这就是使用这个遭遇的最佳时机。",
	"Fate brings the characters into contact with {@creature Harshnag|SKT} the Grim, a legendary good-aligned frost giant. In taverns throughout the North, he is known as a monster to some and a hero to others. In Waterdeep, he's remembered as the largest member of Force Grey, a notoriously destructive adventuring company that came to the city's defense on more than one occasion. Believed to be hundreds of years old, {@creature Harshnag|SKT} wanders the wilderness with greataxe in hand, seeking to lay low his evil giant brethren.": "命运让人物接触到了{@creature Harshnag|SKT}狰狞，一个传说中的善良的冰霜巨人。在整个北方的酒馆里，他对一些人来说是怪物，对另一些人来说是英雄。在沃特迪普，他是灰色力量最大的成员，一个臭名昭著的破坏性冒险公司，不止一次来到城市的防御。他被认为已经有几百岁了，他手持大斧在荒野中游荡，试图压制住他邪恶的巨人兄弟们。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT}'s history isn't important to this adventure, and he doesn't like to talk about his past. What's important is that he knows that the ordning has been broken, that the storm giants no longer have the power to keep the smaller giants in check, and that {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} has gone missing. He aims to protect the North from the depredations of evil giants while seeking out adventurers who share this goal. By the time the characters meet him, he has already slaughtered a few giants.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}的历史对这次冒险并不重要，他也不喜欢谈论他的过去。重要的是，他知道法令已经被打破，风暴巨人不再有能力控制小巨人，而且(1%)已经失踪了。他的目标是保护北方不受邪恶巨人的蹂躏，同时寻找与他有共同目标的冒险者。当人物遇到他时，他已经屠杀了几个巨人。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT} looks like a typical frost giant except that he's clad in plate armor and wears the skull of a white dragon as a helm. His jagged axe also looks quite formidable. He's a giant of few words who prefers to let his actions do his talking. When he does speak outside of combat, he comes across as surprisingly calm and soft-spoken. While swinging his axe in battle, however, he bellows and laughs like a berserker. In the company of small adventurers, he tries not to dominate social situations or make too many decisions for them, because he knows how fragile and inflated their egos can be.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}看起来就像一个典型的冰霜巨人，除了他身穿板甲，戴着白龙的头骨作为头盔。他那把锯齿状的斧头看起来也很威武。他是一个少言寡语的巨人，更喜欢让他的行动来说话。当他在战斗之外说话时，他表现得出奇的平静和温和。然而，当他在战斗中挥动斧头时，他就像一个狂暴的战士一样，大吼大笑。在小型冒险家的陪伴下，他尽量不主导社交场合，也不为他们做太多的决定，因为他知道他们的自我意识是多么脆弱和膨胀。",
	"{@creature Harshnag|SKT} knows the North well and has no chance of becoming lost in its wilderness. He's sensitive to the fact that many small folk have a freshly rekindled fear of giants striding into their settlements. As a result, if the characters visit a settlement while {@creature Harshnag|SKT} is with them, he prefers to remain unseen on the outskirts. The exception is Waterdeep; he considers that city his home and has no qualms about entering it, gently brushing aside guards who stand in his way.": "{@creature Harshnag|SKT}非常了解北方，没有机会在其荒野中迷路。他很敏感地意识到，许多小市民对巨人大踏步进入他们的定居点有一种新的恐惧。因此，如果（1%）和他们在一起的时候，人物访问了一个定居点，他更愿意在郊区保持不被发现。沃特德普是个例外；他认为那座城市是他的家，并毫无顾忌地进入那里，轻轻地拂去挡在他面前的守卫。",

	"Guided by {@creature Harshnag|SKT} the frost giant, the adventurers travel to the Spine of the World, scaling icy mountains to reach a temple built by the giant lords of Ostoria.

The largest of them is an 80-foot-tall robed giant, his arms outstretched and his face hidden beneath a stony cowl, facing a glowing archway in the east wall. Kneeling in rows to each side of this statue are six statues half its size, each impressive in its own right and depicting a paragon of a type of giant: hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, and storm. These smaller statues face the bigger one in the room's center. In their outstretched arms, five of the giants hold weapons—gifts for their All-Father. Only the frost giant statue is unarmed.": "厚厚的冰霜附着在这个100英尺高的穹顶室的每个表面。七个巨大的雕像主宰了这个房间。其中最大的是一个80英尺高的长袍巨人，他伸出双臂，脸藏在石头罩子下面，面向东墙的一个发光拱门。在这座雕像的两边各跪着六座雕像，每座雕像都令人印象深刻，描绘了一种巨人的典型：山丘、石头、冰霜、火、云和风暴。这些较小的雕像面对着房间中央的大雕像。在他们伸出的手臂中，有五个巨人持有武器--送给他们的全能之父的礼物。只有冰霜巨人雕像是没有武器的。",

If a sconce is taken from its niche, it loses its magic forever.": "铁制的壁炉被固定在壁龛上，在{@spell detect magic}法术的监视下，放射出微弱的魔法光环。用明火触碰壁炉会使壁炉上方出现一个幽灵般的火焰。这种火焰像普通的火把一样散发着光和热，并且一直燃烧到窒息。如果灯笼被从它的壁龛中拿走，它就会永远失去它的魔力。",

	"Tying a rope to a harpoon, if desired, takes an action. In addition to dealing 16 ({@dice 3d10}) piercing damage on a hit, a harpoon impales its target. While impaled, the target can't take any action on its turn other than trying to free itself from the harpoon, which requires a successful DC 15 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the target takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) piercing damage as the harpoon is pulled free and is no longer impaled. If a harpoon is attached to the gun by a rope, a creature impaled on that harpoon can't move farther away from the gun or increase its altitude until it frees itself. A creature within reach of the gun's winch can use its action to reel in a harpooned creature, pulling it up to 20 feet closer to the gun.": "如果需要的话，把绳子绑在鱼叉上，需要一个动作。除了造成16({@dice 3d10})的穿刺伤害外，鱼叉还会刺穿目标。当被刺穿时，目标在它的回合中不能采取任何行动，除了试图从鱼叉中解脱，这需要成功地进行DC15力量检查。如果检定成功，目标在鱼叉被拉出时受到5({@dice 1d10})的穿刺伤害，并且不再被刺穿。如果鱼叉被绳子绑在枪上，被鱼叉刺中的生物不能远离枪或增加其高度，直到它释放自己。在枪的绞盘范围内的生物可以用它的行动来卷住被鱼叉夹住的生物，把它拉到离枪最多20英尺的地方。",
	"A wooden ballista is mounted on an iron swivel on the aft castle. It has a 90-degree arc of fire (side to side, and up and down). Behind it rests a crate that holds a dozen bolts. For ballista rules, see the \"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment}\" section in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master 's Guide|DMG}.": "一个木制弹弓安装在船尾城堡的一个铁质转轴上。它有一个90度的射击弧度（从一边到另一边，从上到下）。在它后面有一个箱子，里面放着一打螺栓。关于弹弓的规则，请参见《{@book Dungeon Master 's Guide|DMG}》第八章的\"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment} \"部分。",

Moving the Thrust lever to the left opens valves that allow wind from the elemental to spin the propeller. Moving the lever to the right closes the valves, and the propeller stops turning. Moving the Direction lever to the left or right causes the propeller to pivot in that direction, allowing the ship to turn while the propeller is operating. When the Direction lever is centered, the propeller moves the vessel straight ahead. Opening the hatch frees the elemental, whereupon it attacks any creature it sees.

The villages of Beliard, Womford, and Uluvin, as well as caravans traveling the Iron Road between Womford and Uluvin, are all within the hill giants' threat radius. Meanwhile, the female hill giants exiled by Guh have taken to the hills. They crave the return of their husbands, but they are neither strong enough nor shrewd enough to unseat Guh. They might be convinced to help adventurers overthrow her if it means they get to beat their husbands into submission once more. See the \"Old Tower\" section in chapter 3 for an example of a female hill giant outcast.": "到目前为止，山丘巨人的大部分活动都局限在离他们的巢穴最近的德萨林谷地区，但随着食物的匮乏，古赫的丈夫们不得不将他们的努力向外扩展。贝利亚德（Beliard）、沃姆福德（Womford）和乌鲁文（Uluvin）的村庄，以及在沃姆福德和乌鲁文之间的铁道上行驶的商队，都在山地巨人的威胁半径之内。与此同时，被古赫流放的女性山地巨人已经上山了。她们渴望丈夫的回归，但她们既不够强大也不够精明，无法推翻古赫。她们可能会被说服，帮助冒险者推翻她，如果这意味着她们可以再次将自己的丈夫打得落花流水。参见第三章中的 \"旧塔 \"部分，了解一个女性山丘巨人被抛弃的例子。",
	"The hill giants' den is called Grudd Haug, which means \"river mound\" in Giant. Resembling a beaver dam, it straddles a river. The lower level of the den is lodged between two rocky outcroppings and made of piled timber packed with clay and mud, with hollow cavities that resemble caves. Above this piled timber foundation is a mud steading (a house made to giant scale) with a log roof. The structure is an impressive feat of engineering, well beyond the ability of hill giants to fabricate on their own. In fact, Grudd Haug's design is the work of hobgoblin and goblin engineers, assembled with the might of hill giant and ogre laborers. East of the steading is a yard enclosed by a 20-foot-high palisade wall made of logs lashed together with thick twine.": "山地巨人的巢穴被称为Grudd Haug，在巨人语中意为 \"河丘\"。它像一个海狸坝，横跨在一条河上。洞穴的下层位于两块岩石之间，由堆积的木材和粘土及泥浆组成，有类似洞穴的空洞。在这个堆积的木材基础之上是一个带有原木屋顶的泥棚（按巨大比例制作的房屋）。这个结构是一个令人印象深刻的工程壮举，远远超出了山地巨人自己制造的能力。事实上，格鲁德-豪格的设计是地精和妖精工程师的作品，与山地巨人和食人魔工人的力量结合在一起。大棚东面是一个院子，由20英尺高的栅栏墙围起来，栅栏墙是用粗麻绳把原木绑在一起。",
	"The characters can travel to Grudd Haug (shown on map 5.1) on foot or horseback. They can also guide a raft upstream or downriver to the hill giant den. In either case, you can make the journey more interesting by adding one or more wilderness encounters appropriate for hill terrain (see the Random Wilderness Encounters table in chapter 3). If Moog the hill giant is with the party, see the \"{@area Old Tower|27a|x}\" section in chapter 3 for tips on how to roleplay her once she arrives at Grudd Haug.": "人物可以步行或骑马前往格鲁德豪格（如地图5.1所示）。他们也可以引导木筏逆流而上或顺流而下到山丘巨人的巢穴。无论哪种情况，你都可以通过增加一个或多个适合山地地形的荒野遭遇来使旅程更加有趣（见第3章的随机荒野遭遇表）。如果山丘巨人莫格和队伍在一起，请参阅第三章的\"{@area Old Tower|27a|x} \"部分，了解她到达格拉德豪格后如何进行角色扮演的技巧。",
	"If the characters have an airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), they can land it pretty much anywhere outside Grudd Haug. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot the airship if it approaches within 1 mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\"). If the characters use the airship's weaponry to attack Grudd Haug, the den's defenders are smart enough to take cover behind walls. Defenders armed with weapons that deal piercing damage target the balloon; those that hurl rocks and use weapons that deal bludgeoning damage target the crew.": "如果角色们有一艘飞艇（见第四章的 \"邪教的飞艇 \"部分），他们几乎可以在格鲁德-豪格以外的任何地方降落。如果飞艇接近据点1英里以内，锣鼓塔里的妖精（见 \"接近巢穴\"）就会发现它，并发出警报，使整个巢穴处于警戒状态（见 \"巢穴\"）。如果角色使用飞艇的武器装备来攻击格鲁德-豪格，巢穴的守卫者会很聪明地躲到墙后。装备有造成穿刺伤害的武器的防御者的目标是气球；那些投掷石块和使用造成击打伤害的武器的人的目标是船员。",
	"The characters might instead approach on a flying mount. They can obtain griffon mounts in Fireshear or hippogriff mounts in Hawk's Nest. Neither settlement is close to Grudd Haug, requiring the characters and their mounts to rest between flights. Characters mounted on hippogriffs can travel 54 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). Those mounted on griffons can travel 72 miles in the same amount of time. The hobgoblins in the gong tower (see \"Approaching the Den\") spot flying mounts that approach within a quarter mile of the stronghold and sound the alarm, putting the entire den on alert (see \"Denizens\").": "人物可能会骑着飞行坐骑接近。他们可以在Fireshear获得狮鹫坐骑，在Hawk's Nest获得河马坐骑。这两个定居点都不靠近格鲁德-豪格，需要人物和他们的坐骑在飞行之间休息。骑着河马的角色每天可以走54英里（三次3小时的飞行，中间休息1小时）。骑着狮鹫的人可以在同样的时间内行驶72英里。锣鼓塔中的妖精（见 \"接近巢穴\"）发现接近据点四分之一英里范围内的飞行坐骑，并发出警报，使整个巢穴处于警戒状态（见 \"居民\"）。",

He sent ships to attack sites along the Sword Coast, and during a raid on Port Llast, the giants captured a Zhentarim mage, Nilraun Dhaerlost. Nilraun was dragged before Storvald and came to realize that the frost giants were searching for the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA}. As the runes had foretold, Nilraun was also searching for the ring and knew about its recent history. He suggested the formation of an alliance between {@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT} and the Black Network, sweetening the deal by offering the frost giant jarl exactly what he needed: information on the ring's current wearer, Artus Cimber, and a drop of Cimber's blood (which the Black Network had in its possession). Nilraun is now waiting for the frost giants to track down the ring, so that he can steal it and claim it for himself. Storvald also wants the ring, and each villain is secretly plotting to betray the other once the ring is found.": "在夺回斯瓦德堡后，{@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT}用符文魔法来占卜如何最好地找到{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}--霜巨人称之为永不融化的冰。符文告诉斯托瓦尔德，在他对沿海社区进行了一系列的袭击后，帮助会来到他身边。他派船袭击了剑海岸的一些地方，在对拉斯维加斯港的一次袭击中，巨人俘虏了一位真塔里姆法师，尼劳恩-戴尔罗斯特。Nilraun被拉到了Storvald面前，并意识到冰霜巨人正在寻找{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}。正如符文所预言的那样，尼劳恩也在寻找戒指，并且知道它的近期历史。他建议{@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT}和黑网之间结成联盟，并向冰霜巨人伯爵提供了他所需要的甜头：关于戒指目前佩戴者阿图斯-辛伯的信息，以及一滴辛伯的血（黑网拥有该血）。Nilraun现在正等待着冰霜巨人追踪到戒指，这样他就可以偷到它并将其据为己有。斯托瓦尔德（Storvald）也想得到这枚戒指，每个坏蛋都在暗中策划，一旦找到戒指就背叛对方。",
	"Storvald used Artus Cimber's drop of blood in a rune magic ritual to turn a giant diamond into a {@i blod stone} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}). Unfortunately for the jarl, the item can't find Artus Cimber specifically; instead, it identifies the location of the nearest creature that has Artus's blood flowing through its veins. Artus has many living relatives, and a few of those reside in the North. The {@item blod stone|SKT} has pointed Storvald toward the town of Bryn Shander in Icewind Dale, where one of Artus's children dwells (see chapter 2). The jarl has sent a band of frost giants there to find Artus Cimber and obtain the ring.": "Storvald在一个符文魔法仪式中使用了Artus Cimber的一滴血，将一颗巨大的钻石变成了（%0%）（见（%1%））。不幸的是，这个东西无法具体找到阿图斯-辛伯；相反，它能识别最近的、血管里流淌着阿图斯血液的生物的位置。阿图斯有很多活着的亲戚，其中有几个居住在北方。{@item blod stone|SKT}将斯托瓦尔德指向了冰风谷的布林山德镇，那里住着阿图斯的一个孩子（见第二章）。爵爷已经派了一队冰霜巨人去那里寻找阿图斯-辛伯并获得戒指。",
	"The {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} is an elusive artifact, and neither it nor its bearer can be found in the course of this adventure. Characters who set out to find the ring for themselves will quickly hit one dead end after another. Even divination won't reveal the ring's current whereabouts. Over the years, various Harpers have dedicated resources toward finding Artus Cimber and the ring, to no avail. If the Harpers catch wind of the characters' attempts to locate Artus and the ring, they try to discourage any such pursuit. Artus Cimber and the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} have roles to play in another adventure.": "{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}是一件难以捉摸的神器，在这次冒险过程中，它和它的持有者都无法找到。着手寻找戒指的角色很快就会陷入一个又一个死胡同。即使是占卜，也不会显示出戒指目前的下落。多年来，不同的哈珀人都为寻找阿特斯-辛伯和戒指投入了大量的资源，但都没有结果。如果哈珀人得知人物试图寻找阿图斯和戒指的消息，他们会试图阻止任何这种追求。Artus Cimber和{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}在另一次冒险中发挥了作用。",
	"In the age when giants ruled the North, Svardborg was a remote village where frost giants came to hunt whales and giant walruses. It was abandoned after the empire of Ostoria fell and, over time, drifted northward and became entombed in ice. Today, Svardborg floats amid hundreds of other icebergs in the Sea of Moving Ice. Three of the lodges are still entombed in ice, while the others have been chipped out of the ice and rendered habitable. The expansion and contraction of the ice over the centuries damaged the lodges, and repairs to them are under way. {@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT} has sent ships to the mainland to gather the wood needed to make repairs.": "在巨人统治北方的时代，斯瓦德堡是一个偏远的村庄，冰霜巨人来到这里捕猎鲸鱼和巨型海象。奥斯托利亚帝国灭亡后，它被遗弃了，随着时间的推移，它向北漂移，并被冰雪所掩埋。今天，斯瓦尔德堡漂浮在移动冰海的数百个其他冰山中。其中三座冰山仍被埋在冰中，而其他的冰山则被从冰中凿出，变得可以居住。几个世纪以来，冰层的膨胀和收缩损坏了这些冰山，目前正在对它们进行修复。{@creature Jarl Storvald|SKT}已经派船去大陆收集修理所需的木材。",
	"The lodges are perched on sheer cliffs of ice that plunge 50 feet into the sea. The cliffs are only 10 feet high near the Drydock Lodge (area 3), where the giants have built a wooden pier for docking their punts.": "这些旅馆都坐落在陡峭的冰崖上，冰崖直插海中50英尺。在干船坞旅馆（3号区域）附近，悬崖只有10英尺高，巨人在那里建了一个木制码头，用于停靠他们的小船。",
	"A wide cleft in the iceberg offers access to Svardborg's hollow heart—a water-filled chamber open to the sky where the giants moor their greatships. Stretched across the passage is a gate in the form of a net of thick iron chains. The giants lower the chains into the water to let their ships pass through. A small vessel, such as a rowboat sized for humans, can slip through the net even while the gate is raised. Ships bigger than a rowboat are too large to pass through the gate when it is raised.": "冰山上的一条宽阔的裂缝提供了通往斯瓦尔德堡的空心的通道--一个向天空开放的充满水的房间，巨人在那里停泊他们的大船。横亘在通道上的是一扇由粗大的铁链组成的网状大门。巨人把铁链放进水里，让他们的船通过。一艘小船，如人类大小的划艇，即使在门升起时也能滑过网。比划艇大的船只太大，无法在大门升起时通过。",
	"Unless they have the means to get there by air, the characters must secure passage on a ship and travel across the Sea of Moving Ice to reach Svardborg (shown on maps 7.1 and 7.2).": "除非他们有办法乘飞机到达那里，否则人物必须确保乘船，穿越移动的冰海，到达斯瓦尔德堡（见地图7.1和7.2）。",

	"The coastal village of Fireshear is home to a griffon rider and trainer, Dasharra Keldabar. Characters seeking flying mounts in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, or Luskan are directed to Dasharra. They can pay her for griffon-riding lessons and then use the griffons to fly to Svardborg. When the characters are ready to leave, Dasharra leads the way on Screecher, her personal griffon mount. Dasharra's griffons fly at a speed of 8 miles per hour and can travel roughly 64 miles per day when flying against the wind. The flight to Svardborg takes five days, with strong, cold headwinds the entire way. Thanks to a stiff tailwind, the return trip is shorter, with the griffons able to cover roughly 80 miles a day. Dasharra expects characters to provide their own cold weather survival gear, supplies, and rations.": "沿海的Fireshear村是狮鹫骑手和训练师Dasharra Keldabar的家。在沃特迪普（Waterdeep）、永夜（Neverwinter）或卢斯坎（Luskan）寻找飞行坐骑的角色会被引导到达莎拉那里。他们可以向她支付狮鹫骑术课程的费用，然后用狮鹫飞往斯瓦德堡。当人物准备离开时，达莎拉骑着她的私人狮鹫坐骑尖叫者带路。达沙拉的狮鹫飞行速度为每小时8英里，逆风飞行时，每天大约可以飞行64英里。飞往斯瓦尔德堡需要五天时间，一路都是强劲而寒冷的逆风。由于有强劲的尾风，回程的时间更短，狮鹫一天大约能走80英里。达沙拉希望人物能够提供自己的寒冷天气生存装备、补给和口粮。",
	"When the group reaches Svardborg, Dasharra recommends that the characters land their griffons on the docks south of area 3 (see the \"Approaching Svardborg\" section for other possible places to land). Dasharra remains with the griffons while the characters explore the frost giant fortress, and the characters can count on her to stick around for the return trip.": "当队伍到达斯瓦德堡时，Dasharra建议角色们将他们的狮鹫降落在3号区域南部的码头上（关于其他可能的降落地点，见 \"接近斯瓦德堡 \"部分）。当角色们探索冰霜巨人堡垒时，达沙拉仍然和狮鹫在一起，角色们可以指望她在回程中坚持下去。",
	"Characters can secure flying mounts of a different sort at Hawk's Nest, where knights of the Order of the Gauntlet breed hippogriffs. The journey from Hawk's Nest to Svardborg is long. Flying west against headwinds, the hippogriffs can travel 45 miles per day (three 3-hour flights with 1-hour rests in between). An eastward journey benefits from tailwinds, allowing the hippogriffs to travel 60 miles per day.": "角色可以在鹰巢获得不同种类的飞行坐骑，高塔骑士团的骑士们在那里饲养河马犬。从鹰巢到斯瓦德堡的旅程很漫长。逆风向西飞行，河马每天可以行驶45英里（三次3小时的飞行，中间休息1小时）。向东的旅程则得益于尾风，使河马犬每天可以行驶60英里。",

For a bribe of no less than 1,500 gp (half up front, half upon safe return), a High Captain provides a longship with a crew of forty pirates (CN male and female Illuskan human {@creature Bandit||bandits}) and an arrogant but green captain, Vaalrik Redreef (CN male Illuskan human {@creature bandit captain}). Once Svardborg is sighted, the ship drops anchor behind a nearby iceberg. The characters can lower rowboats into the sea and use them to reach Svardborg in 30 minutes. Captain Redreef agrees to wait up to 24 hours before raising anchor and setting sail for Luskan. If Svardborg's warning horn (area 2C) is sounded, the inexperienced captain panics and abandons the party, ordering the crew to return home.": "人物可以接近城市的一个高级船长。为了得到不少于1500金币的贿赂（先付一半，安全返回后再付一半），高级船长提供了一艘长船，船上有40名海盗（伊鲁斯坎男性和女性人类（%0%））和一名傲慢但绿色的船长，瓦利克-雷德雷夫（伊鲁斯坎男性人类（%1%））。一旦看到斯瓦德堡，船就在附近的冰山后面抛锚。人物可以把划艇放进海里，用它们在30分钟内到达Svardborg。Redreef船长同意在起锚和启航前往Luskan之前最多等待24小时。如果斯瓦德堡的警告号角（2C区）响起，这个没有经验的船长就会惊慌失措，放弃聚会，命令船员回家。",
	"Characters who want to buy a ship can pay 10,000 gp for a leaky old longship that belongs to one of the High Captains. The characters must hire a crew of at least forty. A common sailor (use the {@creature commoner} statistics) costs 2 sp per day, while a skilled sailor (use the {@creature bandit} statistics) demands 2 gp per day. The characters can also try to hire a captain (use the {@creature bandit captain} statistics) who normally charges 10 gp per day. One of the characters can serve as captain to avoid this expense, but that leaves no one with command experience aboard the ship after the characters disembark.": "想买船的角色可以花10,000金币买一艘属于某个高级船长的漏水的旧长船。角色必须雇佣至少40名船员。一个普通的水手（使用{@creature commoner}的统计数据）每天需要2个sp，而一个熟练的水手（使用{@creature bandit}的统计数据）每天需要2gp。角色们也可以尝试雇佣一个船长（使用{@creature bandit captain}统计数据），他通常每天收取10金币。其中一个角色可以担任船长以避免这笔费用，但这样一来，在角色下船后，船上就没有人有指挥经验了。",
	"If one or more characters are members of the Lords' Alliance, they can arrange a brief meeting with Lord Dagult Neverember and try to convince him to sponsor a voyage to Svardborg. Neverember knows that the Sea of Moving Ice is patrolled by white dragons and seafaring barbarians, so a character must make a successful DC 17 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to convince him of the mission's importance. If he decides to help, Neverember arranges for a galley called the {@i Seabreaker} to transport the characters.": "如果一个或多个角色是领主联盟的成员，他们可以安排与Dagult Neverember领主进行简短的会面，并试图说服他赞助一次前往斯瓦德堡的航行。诺文伯知道移动的冰海有白龙和航海的野蛮人在巡逻，所以角色必须成功地进行DC17魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，以说服他相信这个任务的重要性。如果他决定帮忙，纽伦堡会安排一艘名为\"{@i Seabreaker} \"的船来运送人物。",

	"If one or more characters are members of the Harpers, they can arrange to meet with the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Lady Laeral Silverhand. During the meeting, Laeral explains that ships are hard to come by in Waterdeep these days; the City of Splendors is in the midst of building a new navy after its fleet was scuttled by Dagult Neverember. Saying it's the best she can do, Laeral offers to give the characters a damaged longship that was recently captured by privateers. What the adventurers choose to do with it is up to them. The ship has 150 hit points and is worth 5,000 gp in its present condition. (For rules on ship repair, see the \"{@book Owning a Ship|DMG|5|The Sea}\" section in chapter 5 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}.)

	"Zalto's followers are spread throughout the North, searching for pieces of an adamantine colossus called the Vonindod. The fire giant duke has also struck an alliance with the drow of House Xorlarrin: he promises to help them destroy their enemies if the drow help him steal Maegera, the fire primordial trapped within the underground dwarven city of Gauntlgrym. House Xorlarrin once held Gauntlgrym, but King Bruenor Battlehammer and his dwarves recently drove out the dark elves.

Zalto is feeling the pressure, given that his success hinges on his ability to reignite Ironslag's adamantine forge and his minions' ability to retrieve all the missing fragments of the Vonindod. Unfortunately for Zalto, those are the least of his problems.

	"Sansuri has little regard for \"puny folk\" and doesn't consider them a threat. How she reacts to the characters depends on the manner in which they approach her castle:": "Sansuri对 \"小人物 \"不屑一顾，不认为他们是威胁。她对这些人物的反应取决于他们接近她的城堡的方式。",

	"In a noncombat situation, Sansuri plays the part of the proud hostess but can't quite hide her impatience. She has no time to entertain unexpected visitors and would prefer to see them quickly on their way. If the characters ask to borrow or use her {@item conch of teleportation|SKT}, she demands to know why but ultimately refuses to help them, even if they offer to buy it or trade for it. Simply put, she doesn't trust \"puny folk\" and won't lower herself to negotiate with them, nor will she give them the means to reach Maelstrom.": "在非战斗情况下，Sansuri扮演着骄傲的女主人的角色，但却无法完全掩饰她的不耐烦。她没有时间招待不速之客，更愿意看到他们迅速上路。如果人物要求借用或使用她的（%0%），她要求知道原因，但最终拒绝帮助他们，即使他们提出购买或交易。简单地说，她不相信 \"小人物\"，不会放低身段与他们谈判，也不会给他们到达漩涡的方法。",
	"If the characters pry into her business, she tells them that she's conducting an extensive survey to update her maps of the lands below. If the characters ask about the dragon, Sansuri replies coldly, \"It's not your concern.\" Clever characters might claim to possess knowledge useful to Sansuri, such as the locations of ancient Ostorian way-markers that point the way to long-lost treasures. Sansuri regards any such claims with great suspicion, and ability checks made to deceive her have disadvantage.": "如果人物打听她的事情，她会告诉他们，她正在进行一项广泛的调查，以更新她对下面土地的地图。如果人物问起龙，Sansuri冷冷地回答说：\"这与你无关。\" 聪明的人物可能会声称拥有对Sansuri有用的知识，例如古代奥斯托里亚路标的位置，这些路标指出了通往失落已久的宝藏的道路。桑苏里以极大的怀疑来看待任何这样的说法，欺骗她的能力检查是不利的。",
	"Sansuri attacks characters who are clearly being disrespectful or deceptive. She also turns on those who seem intent on robbing her. If she loses more than half her hit points, Sansuri casts a {@spell fly} spell on herself, retreats to her tower (areas 31–33), and leaves the castle's other denizens to fend for themselves.

Sansuri was struck by the beauty and color of the noble creature, but rather than befriend Jakka, she locked him in a cage and imprisoned him for months while she used {@spell simulacrum} spells to create effigies of him out of ice and snow. (Sansuri's version of the spell allows her to have multiple simulacra of the same creature.) After creating a host of Jakka simulacra, she killed the original, then (in typical noble fashion) had his body stuffed and mounted above the fireplace in her lounge.": "几年前，一个名叫贾卡的受伤的阿拉科拉人降落在桑苏里的云端城堡上。桑苏里被这个高贵的生物的美丽和色彩所震撼，但她并没有和雅卡交朋友，而是把他关在笼子里，囚禁了几个月，同时她用{@spell simulacrum}法术用冰和雪制造他的肖像。 (桑苏里的法术版本允许她拥有同一生物的多个模拟物。) 在创造了一大批贾卡的模拟像之后，她杀死了原来的贾卡，然后（以典型的贵族方式）将他的尸体塞进了她的休息室的壁炉上面。",

	"The roof of the main keep has a lush green lawn surrounding a squat stone building (area 30). The soil beneath the grass is 2 feet deep. A three-story tower with a conical rooftop (areas 31–33) juts upward and outward from the southeastern part of the wall, rising another 120 feet into the air.

The inside wall of the room is painted with a lavish mural of a cloud giant city made up of dozens of joined cloud castles. The domed ceiling is made up of overlapping shells of thin, black metal with glowing shards of crystal set into star-shaped sockets. The crystals represent the stars in the night sky, and the overlapping shells magically reposition themselves so that the artificial sky inside the dome exactly matches the night sky wherever the castle happens to be.": "桑苏里对这座石头建筑的门施了一个{@spell arcane lock}的法术，这座建筑没有其他入口或窗户。在这个圆形房间的中间，漂浮在离地面10英尺高的地方是城堡的（%1%）（见（%2%）），桑苏里用它来控制林阿玛尔的行动。房间的内墙绘有一幅奢华的壁画，画的是由几十座连在一起的云端城堡组成的云端巨城。圆顶天花板是由重叠的黑色薄金属壳组成的，上面有发光的水晶碎片，镶嵌在星形的口袋里。这些水晶代表了夜空中的星星，重叠的外壳神奇地重新定位，使穹顶内的人造天空与城堡所在地的夜空完全一致。",

These nonmagical masks are sized and molded to fit Sansuri's face, and each captures a specific mood or emotion. No single artist crafted more than one mask for the countess, so each mask has a unique style. The masks rest atop narrow shelves set into the walls 10, 15, and 20 feet above the floor. A few shelves are empty, indicating that the countess has room to expand her collection.": "这个房间的墙上挂满了面具，总共有50个，每个价值250金币。这些非魔法面具的大小和形状适合桑苏里的脸，每个面具都捕捉到一种特定的情绪或情感。没有一个艺术家为伯爵夫人制作过不止一个面具，所以每个面具都有独特的风格。面具放在离地面10、15和20英尺高的墙上的狭窄架子上。有几个架子是空的，这表明伯爵夫人有空间来扩大她的收藏。",

This chest is a miniature replica of a much larger chest that Sansuri uses as the main component of a {@spell Leomund's secret chest} spell. By touching the replica, Sansuri can recall the larger chest (see \"Treasure\"), causing it to appear within 5 feet of her. No other creature can summon the full-sized chest in this manner, which means the characters must persuade Sansuri to summon it for them if they want to obtain its contents (see \"Development\").": "在床头板上隐藏着一个秘密的隔间，只要通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查就可以找到。里面有一个用金子和铂金丝制成的镶有宝石的小箱子。这个箱子是一个大得多的箱子的微型复制品，Sansuri用它作为一个{@spell Leomund's secret chest}法术的主要组成部分。通过触摸这个复制品，Sansuri可以召唤出更大的箱子（见 \"宝藏\"），使它出现在她5英尺范围内。没有其他生物能以这种方式召唤全尺寸的箱子，这意味着如果角色想获得箱子里的东西，必须说服Sansuri为他们召唤它（见 \"发展\"）。",

The ship's precise location changes from one hour to the next and is ultimately not important, nor is it imperative that the characters find the vessel quickly.": "{@i Morkoth}号正在无轨海中被称为紫色岩石的岛屿群周围航行。这艘船的准确位置每小时都在变化，最终并不重要，人物迅速找到这艘船也不是必须的。",
	"Chapter 3 describes random encounters you can use to spice up a sea voyage. To calculate how long it takes for the characters to find the {@i Morkoth}, ascertain the rough distance from the party's starting location to the Purple Rocks, then calculate the amount of time it would take the party's conveyance to travel that distance. Once the characters get within 100 miles of the Purple Rocks, they have a base 10 percent chance per day of locating the {@i Morkoth}. This chance assumes that the characters are traveling in one group or aboard multiple conveyances in fairly close formation. If multiple conveyances are searching for the {@i Morkoth} and they are so widespread as to be at least 30 miles apart, roll separately for each conveyance.": "第三章介绍了你可以用来为海上航行增添色彩的随机遭遇。要计算人物找到{@i Morkoth}所需的时间，先确定从队伍的出发地到紫岩的大致距离，然后计算队伍的交通工具行驶这一距离所需的时间。一旦人物进入紫岩的100英里范围内，他们每天就有10%的机会找到{@i Morkoth}。这个概率是假设角色们是在一个团体中旅行，或者是在相当紧密的队列中乘坐多辆交通工具。如果多个运输工具都在寻找{@i Morkoth}，而且它们的分布范围很广，至少相隔30英里，那么就为每个运输工具分别掷硬币。",
	"You can forgo precision and assume that the party spots the {@i Morkoth} {@dice 1d4 + 2} days after coming within 100 miles of the Purple Rocks.": "你可以放弃精确性，假设该党在来到紫岩山100英里范围内的{@i Morkoth}{@dice 1d4 + 2}天后发现了这个问题。",
	"Unless the characters have the ability to cast the teleport spell or similarly powerful magic, they must rely on more conventional means to reach the {@i Morkoth}. The Modes of Travel table shows the number of miles a given conveyance can travel in a day, provided it has sufficient crew aboard.": "除非人物有能力施展传送法术或类似的强大魔法，否则他们必须依靠更常规的方式来到达（%0%）。旅行方式表显示了一个特定的交通工具在一天内可以行驶的里程数，前提是它有足够的船员。",

	"To create a more realistic journey, you can use the Weather table in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|5|Weather} to determine the prevailing weather on a given day. If the results indicate strong wind and heavy rain, these weather conditions combine to create a storm that lasts for {@dice 1d6} hours. Once the storm has abated, the party's navigator must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to regain his or her bearings. Otherwise, the party is lost for 1 day, after which the check can be attempted again.": "为了创造一个更真实的旅程，你可以使用《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|5|Weather}》第五章的天气表来确定某一天的主要天气。如果结果显示有强风和大雨，这些天气条件结合起来就会形成一场持续{@dice 1d6}小时的风暴。一旦风暴减弱，队伍的领航员必须在DC15智慧（（%2%））检查中成功，以恢复他或她的方向。否则，队伍将迷失1天，之后可以再次尝试检查。",
	"If the characters have an airship (see the \"Airship of a Cult\" section in chapter 4), they can use it to search the Trackless Sea for the {@i Morkoth} while avoiding encounters with sea-bound creatures and vessels. Once the {@i Morkoth} is sighted, the characters can attack it from a distance or fly in close. The airship can't land on the {@i Morkoth}, but it can float in the water nearby or hover directly overhead, out of the line of fire of the {@i Morkoth}'s ship-mounted ballistae.": "如果人物有一艘飞艇（见第4章中的 \"邪教的飞艇 \"部分），他们可以用它在无轨海中搜索（%0%），同时避免与海上生物和船只相遇。一旦发现（1%），人物可以从远处攻击它，或者飞到近处。飞艇不能降落在{@i Morkoth}上，但它可以漂浮在附近的水面上，或者直接在头顶盘旋，避开{@i Morkoth}的舰载弹炮的火力范围。",
	"If the characters gained control of a cloud castle (such as the one in chapter 9), they can fly it over the Trackless Sea and use the castle's giant telescopes to search for the {@i Morkoth}. Weather conditions might hinder their search, but there is no chance of the castle's being blown off course by a storm.": "如果人物获得了对云雾城堡的控制权（比如第9章中的那座），他们可以驾驶云雾城堡飞越无轨海，并使用城堡的巨大望远镜来搜索（%0%）。天气状况可能会阻碍他们的搜索，但城堡没有被风暴吹偏的可能。",
	"Because the Trackless Sea is vast and its islands so distant, characters won't be able to reach the {@i Morkoth} on the backs of griffons, hippogriffs, or similar creatures, since the mounts have nowhere to land and rest when they tire. Dragons don't tire as easily and can transport characters overseas if they are sufficiently motivated. Dragons are also able to avoid and outpace storms. A friendly metallic dragon of the party's acquaintance might be persuaded to make the journey for a sizable donation to its trove. One rare magic item or 10,000 gp per passenger wouldn't be unreasonable.": "由于无轨之海非常广阔，其岛屿也非常遥远，人物无法骑着狮鹫、河马或类似的生物到达{@i Morkoth}，因为坐骑在疲劳时没有地方可以着陆和休息。龙不会那么容易疲劳，如果有足够的动力，它可以把人物运送到海外。龙也能避开和超越风暴。一条党派认识的友好的金属龙可能会被说服，为它的宝库提供一笔可观的捐款，以完成这次旅行。每位乘客一件稀有的魔法物品或10,000金币并不是不合理的。",
	"Characters can ply the Trackless Sea aboard a seafaring vessel. Since the islands of the Trackless Sea are home to predatory, seafaring barbarians, most ship captains are unwilling to risk their vessels and lives on a fool's errand, no matter how much the characters offer to pay. Another possibility exists for characters who are associated with the Harpers, the Order of the Gauntlet, the Emerald Enclave, the Lords' Alliance, or the Zhentarim. Members in good standing of any of those groups can contact their organizations and convince them that an expedition must be mounted to find the {@i Morkoth}, for the sake of all civilization. Roll {@dice 2d10} for each faction that the characters approach for assistance; the result is the number of days it takes for that faction to secure and provision a sailing ship.

Where the characters must go to board each vessel depends on the faction that provides the help.": "角色可以乘坐航海船在无轨海中航行。由于无轨海的岛屿是掠夺性的航海野蛮人的家园，大多数船长都不愿意让他们的船只和生命冒险去做傻事，无论角色提供多少报酬。另一种可能是与哈珀斯、高塔骑士团、翡翠飞地、领主联盟或赞塔林有关的人物。在这些组织中具有良好声誉的成员可以联系他们的组织，并说服他们为了所有的文明，必须进行一次远征来寻找（%0%）。为人物所接触到的每一个寻求援助的派别掷出{@dice 2d10}；结果是该派别获得和提供一艘帆船所需的天数。如果有必要绘制船只的甲板图，请使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|12}附录C中的船只样本。人物必须去哪里登上每艘船，取决于提供帮助的派别。",

	"Your long journey ends here, in the desert. A churning cauldron of black clouds fills the sky as thunder peals and lightning flashes.

Where cheers once rang out across a great city, now a solemn fortress stands before you, waiting for you to draw near.": "你的漫长旅程在这里结束，在沙漠中。汹涌的黑云大锅充斥着天空，雷声大作，电闪雷鸣。在冰冷的沙丘中，半埋着一个摇摇欲坠的圆形剧场，上面装饰着雕像，其中许多已经破碎，其余的被风沙磨得光滑。废墟之上矗立着两座大型风炮。欢呼声曾经响彻一座伟大的城市，现在一座庄严的堡垒矗立在你面前，等待着你靠近。",
	"The dry thunderstorm is the dragon's work—a regional effect (see the blue dragon entry in the Monster Manual) that stretches for 6 miles in every direction. The storm has no effect on the battle as it unfolds; it's simply a reflection of {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s mood.": "干燥的雷暴是龙的杰作--一种区域性的效应（见《怪物手册》中的蓝龙条目），它向各个方向延伸了6英里。暴风雨对战斗的展开没有影响，它只是反映了（%%）的心情。",
	"Storm giants who stride boldly toward the amphitheater with weapons in hand draw fire from the trebuchets (see area 1). The characters can let the storm giants bear the brunt of these attacks while they approach from another direction, or they can join the giants in their direct assault.

	"{@creature Iymrith|SKT} can use her lair actions within the amphitheater as well as in the dungeon underneath it. The dragon doesn't waste her lightning breath on storm giants; similarly, the storm giants know that their lightning strikes have no effect on {@creature Iymrith|SKT}. The giants didn't bring any rocks with them, but they can hurl chunks of sandstone torn from {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s own amphitheater.": "{@creature Iymrith|SKT}可以在圆形剧场内以及剧场下面的地牢中使用她的巢穴行动。龙不会把她的闪电气息浪费在风暴巨人身上；同样地，风暴巨人也知道他们的闪电攻击对{@creature Iymrith|SKT}没有影响。巨人没有带任何石头，但他们可以投掷从{@creature Iymrith|SKT}自己的圆形剧场撕下的大块沙石。",

A creature can trigger a collapse by dealing 10 damage or more to the ceiling with a single attack or spell effect. The collapse renders the passage impassable until the sand and stone are cleared away, which requires 250 hours of work. (Multiple creatures working together can reduce the amount of time accordingly.) Any creature in the marked section of tunnel when it collapses must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ({@dice 4d10}) bludgeoning damage from falling stone and is buried under stone and sand.

If the check succeeds, the creature can pull itself in one direction or the other at a rate of 1 foot for every 5 feet of movement spent. If that movement isn't enough to exit the collapsed area, the creature can repeat the check on its next turn. A creature standing at either end of the collapsed area can use its action to pull a buried creature out of the area, provided the buried creature is within reach (no ability check required).": "穴居生物（例如蓝龙）可以用它的穴居速度穿过塌陷区，在它身后的沙子填满时不会留下隧道。一个没有钻洞速度的被埋生物，可以在它的回合开始时，进行DC15力量（（%0%））的检查。如果检定成功，该生物可以以每5英尺移动1英尺的速度将自己拉向一个或另一个方向。如果这个动作不足以离开坍塌的区域，该生物可以在下一回合重复这个检定。站在坍塌区域两端的生物可以用它的行动将被埋葬的生物拉出该区域，只要被埋葬的生物在可及范围内（不需要能力检查）。",

	"Thirty {@creature Gargoyle||gargoyles} inhabit the amphitheater. Twenty-two of them are perched on stone plinths, waiting to swoop down and attack intruders. The eight remaining gargoyles operate the wooden trebuchets—four per weapon. Two gargoyles use their actions to load a trebuchet while another two use their actions to aim it. Once a trebuchet is loaded and aimed, one of the gargoyles uses its next action to fire the weapon. This routine allows a trebuchet to be loaded, aimed, and fired every other round.

Let them make the tough choices!": "角色的失败和误判可能会造成他们无法返回漩涡镇或没有什么理由返回的局面。例如，如果他们没能从克拉肯协会的魔掌中救出海卡顿，他们失去了{@item conch of teleportation|SKT}，人物可能会选择避免与风暴巨人进一步打交道，而把注意力放在其他地方。如果人物通过偷窃风暴巨人的东西或伤害王室成员而与（%1%）和乌瑟尔为敌，同样的发展也可能随之而来。尽管有风暴巨人的存在，但角色们可能会与（%%2%）有私人恩怨（比如说，想为（%%3%）报仇），一旦找到龙的巢穴，他们可能会决定自己去找龙。在这种情况下，你可以安排事件的时间，让风暴巨人在角色到达{@creature Iymrith|SKT}巢穴的同时到达，让角色有机会与巨人联手，调和过去的怨恨。相反，角色可能会选择避免与（%5%）的再次交锋，有效地跳过第12章，而将目光投向剩余的邪恶巨人领主。尽量不要强迫玩家角色走这条路或那条路。让他们做出艰难的选择吧!",
	"If the characters were unable to rescue the storm giant king, or if Hekaton didn't survive, {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT} vows to avenge her father's death, swearing that {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s deception will not go unpunished. She reaches out to the adventurers one more time, imploring them to join her as she confronts the dragon.": "如果角色们没能救出风暴巨人王，或者海卡顿没能活下来，{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT}发誓要为她的父亲报仇，发誓{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的欺骗行为不会不受惩罚。她再次向冒险者们伸出援手，恳求他们加入她的行列，与龙对峙。",
	"An ancient blue dragon is more than a match for a party of 10th-level adventurers, but the characters have storm giants watching their backs. Hekaton or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} also gives each character a {@item potion of giant size|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}) from the royal treasury, enabling them to face the dragon as true giants when the time comes. The storm giants describe the effect and duration of the potions, but they leave it to the characters to decide if and when to use them. The characters can quaff their potions before they enter {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s lair or wait until they are about to engage the dragon in battle. Conversely, one or more characters might prefer to use the potions only as a last resort.": "一条古老的蓝龙对10级的冒险者队伍来说是个不小的挑战，但这些角色有风暴巨人在背后看着。海卡顿或{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}还从皇家宝库中给了每个角色一个{@item potion of giant size|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}），使他们能够在时机成熟时作为真正的巨人面对巨龙。风暴巨人描述了药水的效果和持续时间，但他们让角色决定是否和何时使用它们。角色们可以在进入{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的巢穴之前喝下他们的药水，或者等到他们即将与龙交战的时候再喝。相反，一个或多个角色可能更愿意在最后关头才使用药水。",
	"Hekaton or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} also gives the party a {@item claw of the wyrm rune|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}) recovered from a shipwreck near Maelstrom. Like the potions, this item is a gift; the characters can do with it what they will.": "海卡顿或{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}也给党派一个{@item claw of the wyrm rune|SKT}(见{@adventure appendix B|SKT|15})从漩涡附近的沉船上找到的。和药水一样，这个物品也是一个礼物；人物可以随心所欲地使用它。",
	"The storm giants bear the burden of finding the dragon so that the characters can focus on preparing themselves for the final showdown. Hekaton and {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} know that blue dragons favor desert surroundings, and it doesn't take much research for them to discover that {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has a reputation in the North. The storm giants learn the following facts about their nemesis:": "风暴巨人承担了寻找龙的重任，这样人物就可以专注于为最后的决战做准备。赫卡顿和{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}知道蓝龙喜欢沙漠环境，他们不费吹灰之力就发现{@creature Iymrith|SKT}在北方很有名气。风暴巨人们了解到关于他们的克星的以下事实。",
	"Armed with this information, Hekaton (or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}) leaves {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT} in charge of Maelstrom and sets out with four storm giant bodyguards named {@creature Nimir|SKT}, {@creature Orlekto|SKT}, {@creature Shaldoor|SKT}, and {@creature Vaasha|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix D|SKT|17} for statistics) to confront {@creature Iymrith|SKT}. The characters are invited to join them. {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} has 330 hit points at full health but otherwise has the statistics of a typical storm giant. If {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} leads the attackers, see area 15 in chapter 10 for modifications to her statistics.": "掌握了这些信息后，海卡顿（或{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}）离开了{@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}负责的漩涡，带着四个名为{@creature Nimir|SKT}、{@creature Orlekto|SKT}、{@creature Shaldoor|SKT}和{@creature Vaasha|SKT}的风暴巨人保镖（统计数据见{@adventure appendix D|SKT|17}）出发去对抗{@creature Iymrith|SKT}。这些人物被邀请加入他们。{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}在全盛时期有330点命中率，但在其他方面具有典型风暴巨人的统计数据。如果{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}带领攻击者，请看第十章第15区对她的统计数据的修改。",
	"It's best if Hekaton (or {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}) remains an NPC under your control. You can have your players run the other storm giants if you prefer (and if they would enjoy doing so). Photocopy the storm giant stat blocks at the end of this chapter and distribute them among the players in your group. If your group includes more than four players, not every player will receive a storm giant NPC to play, and that's okay. Accompanying the giants' stat blocks are roleplaying notes that the players can use to portray the giants accurately. One of the giants ({@creature Orlekto|SKT}) has sinister ulterior motives that might come into play during the events of this chapter. If you have a player who's particularly good at roleplaying underhanded characters, consider giving {@creature Orlekto|SKT} to that player.": "如果海卡顿（或（%0%））仍然是你控制下的NPC，那就最好了。如果你愿意的话，你可以让你的玩家管理其他风暴巨人（如果他们喜欢这样做的话）。复印本章末尾的风暴巨人状态块，并在你的小组中的玩家中分发。如果你的小组包括四个以上的玩家，不是每个玩家都会收到一个风暴巨人NPC来扮演，这也没关系。伴随着巨人的状态块的是角色扮演的说明，玩家们可以用它来准确地描绘巨人的形象。其中一个巨人（{@creature Orlekto|SKT}）有着不可告人的动机，在本章的事件中可能会发挥作用。如果你有一个特别擅长扮演阴险角色的玩家，可以考虑把{@creature Orlekto|SKT}给这个玩家。",
	"The first sarcophagus contains four magic items. Roll on Magic Item Table F for each item. If {@creature Iymrith|SKT} stole the {@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT} (see {@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}) from {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}, it is inside this sarcophagus as well.": "第一个石棺里有四个魔法物品。为每件物品在魔法物品表F上滚动。如果{@creature Iymrith|SKT}从{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}那里偷了{@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT}（见{@adventure appendix B|SKT|15}），它也在这个石棺里。",
	"If {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} participated in the battle against {@creature Iymrith|SKT} in her father's place, she thanks them for their heroism and, like her father, looks forward to future cooperation between small folk and giants. {@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa} likewise has no qualms about letting the characters deal with the evil giant lords who still threaten the North. She is eager to return to Maelstrom and tell the tale of {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s defeat, knowing this will lure giants back to her court.": "如果{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}代替她父亲参加了对{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的战斗，她会感谢他们的英雄主义，并且像她父亲一样，期待着小民和巨人之间未来的合作。{@creature Princess Serissa|SKT|Serissa}同样也毫不犹豫地让人物去对付仍然威胁着北方的邪恶巨人领主。她渴望回到漩涡镇，讲述{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的失败故事，知道这将引诱巨人回到她的宫廷。"
