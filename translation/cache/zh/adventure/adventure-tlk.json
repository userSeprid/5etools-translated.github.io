	"to say this is a loosely constructed adventure may be an exaggeration of some degree. However, some patron saint of children requested a pdf of my adventure notes. So, here we are. I've use one version or another of this adventure to introduce people to the D&D experience as it has all the elements of a good game with very little ramp up time needed. The adventure structure is created in such a way to allow for as much or as little combat is desired. Encounters can be changed to suit a lvl1 campaign, and with a little imagination I imagine one could have fun altering it for a party in the high teens. Some nice paintings of Ancient Dragons and Neoliths may be in order.": "说这是一个结构松散的冒险，可能在某种程度上是夸大了。然而，一些儿童的守护神要求获得我的冒险笔记的PDF。所以，我们来了。我曾用这个冒险的一个或另一个版本来向人们介绍D&D的经验，因为它具有一个好游戏的所有元素，只需要很少的准备时间。这个冒险的结构是以这样一种方式创建的，即允许有或多或少的战斗需要。遇到的情况可以改变，以适应lvl1的活动，而且只要有一点想象力，我想就可以为十几岁的人改变它的乐趣。一些漂亮的古龙和新石器的绘画可能是有必要的。",
