	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这次冒险的主要内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named Severin Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.": "邪教的新领袖是一个名叫塞弗林-西拉金的卡利希特人，他认为真正的龙族知识和力量属于活龙，而不是不死之身。",
	"Severin's ambition amused Tiamat, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "塞弗林的野心让提亚马特很高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙形面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响它们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组合起来的面具，邪教可以将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After Severin (subtly guided by Tiamat) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, Severin became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在塞弗林（在提亚马特的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于在其秘密藏身之处寻找失落已久的龙面具。当他找到红色面具时，塞弗林成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人也很快跟上。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring Tiamat into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.": "迄今为止，神龙教一直对其将提亚马特引入世界的目标保密。许多人都知道该邪教在剑海岸的活动有所增加，尤其是在北部，但其复苏背后的原因却不得而知。",
	"Besides his cultists, Severin has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing Tiamat, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.": "除了他的崇拜者，塞弗林还与泰伊的红袍巫师的一个分裂派别结成联盟。这个小而隐秘的团体由一个名叫（%0%）的弃儿领导，阴谋将巫师萨斯-塔姆从他在红袍巫师的位置上赶下来。拉斯相信，作为释放提亚马特的交换条件，提亚马特会给予他所需的力量来推翻萨斯-谭。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, Severin initiates the second part of his plan to release Tiamat: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，塞弗林启动了他释放提亚马特计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力引起了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙和它的盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward. During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将这些人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅行中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim中获得了一些意想不到的盟友，这是一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私窝点被卸下，运往一个早已废弃的城堡。",
	"A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, {@creature Talis the White|HotDQ}, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.": "城堡下面的一个传送门连接到邪教最强大和最不满的成员之一（%0%）的据点，他既可以成为致命的敌人，也可以成为人物的重要合作者。不管有没有塔利斯的帮助，角色们都必须进入一个云端巨人放置在邪教手中的飞行城堡，并阻止它到达龙之井的目的地。",
	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"This adventure uses the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, completing certain events in the campaign causes the characters to level up. See \"{@area Advancement|028|x}\" later in this introduction.": "这个冒险使用了里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，完成战役中的某些事件会使角色的等级提高。见本介绍后面的\"（%0%）\"。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤着古老的魔法和一大批龙族盟友，龙之崇拜试图将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老、最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for Tiamat—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back Tiamat and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing Tiamat to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为提亚马特收集了一批囤积物，然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回提亚马特的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品来为仪式提供能量，通过这个仪式，龙面具将打开通往九层地狱的入口，使提亚马特能够前往物质世界。",
	"These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.": "这些计划继续推进，因为塔扬流亡者（%0%）和他的红袍巫师为邪教带来了召唤魔法的专业知识，准备了一个巨大的血祭来赋予仪式。然而，巫师和邪教徒之间的联盟是脆弱的，因为双方都不完全相信对方的承诺。",
	"This second volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons} assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What's unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.": "这部《%0%》的第二卷假定善盟冒险者的派别和剑海岸的人们都知道邪教所带来的威胁。不清楚的是如何处理它。根据角色的性质以及他们与各派别的关系，不同的团体可能会向英雄们推荐不同的行动方案。这就需要玩家想出他们要如何进行。",
	"At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see {@adventure chapter 9|RoT|1|Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep} for details).": "在这次冒险的开始，整个剑海岸的团体和派别的代表开会讨论他们对神龙教的关注，并制定了反对该教派的计划。冒险家们被召集到沃特迪普参加一个峰会，这个峰会将被称为沃特迪普议会（详见{@adventure chapter 9|RoT|1|Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep}）。",
	"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent Tiamat's return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力团体彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不同的、有分歧的团体锻造成一个协调的力量。只有所有派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止提亚马特的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}, and the chapters are numbered for ease of reference. You can even add more chapters of your own devising, or which expand on ideas the players generate.": "本书中的事件是按照逻辑顺序安排的，便于上演（%0%），各章都有编号，便于参考。你甚至可以添加你自己设计的更多章节，或者对玩家产生的想法进行扩展。",
	"The events of {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} lead directly into {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的事件直接导致了{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"The characters are invited by NPCs they know and trust to the first session of the Council of Waterdeep. (If you played {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} or {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} are likely candidates.)": "角色被他们认识和信任的NPC邀请参加水底议会的第一次会议。（如果你玩过（%0%），（%1%）或（%2%）可能是候选人。）",
	"The adventurers learn the location of one of the cult's highest-ranking leaders—Wyrmspeaker Varram. After discovering that Varram is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.": "冒险家们得知了邪教最高级别的领袖之一--巫师瓦拉姆的位置。在发现瓦拉姆被元老们囚禁在蛇山之后，冒险者们可以与元老们战斗，并通过谈判取得对该邪教者的监护权。",
	"Maccath the Crimson, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "深红的马卡思是奥术兄弟会的一名铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The Emerald Enclave requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest—a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker Neronvain, who has a surprising connection to the council.": "翡翠飞地要求冒险家们帮助他们调查迷雾森林中绿龙带领的邪教袭击事件的后果--绿龙可能被邪教的巫师之一控制。这项调查导致了一场与绿龙楚斯和巫师纳隆温的对决，后者与议会有着惊人的联系。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",
	"After a first attempt to assassinate the heroes failed, the Cult of the Dragon tries again. With a better idea of what they're up against, they have a better chance to succeed.": "在第一次试图暗杀英雄的行动失败后，神龙教再次尝试。由于对他们的对手有了更多的了解，他们的成功机会更大。",
	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to Severin's plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对塞弗林的计划至关重要的一个龙形面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring Tiamat to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their Red Wizard allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的仪式太过复杂，如果没有他们的红袍巫师盟友--都是泰安的流亡者，邪教的施法者们是无法完成的。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的情况时必须小心谨慎。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon now knows the adventurers' strengths and methods. If the characters don't take precautions to safeguard themselves, the cult stands a good chance of killing them all with a third attack.": "神龙教现在知道了冒险者们的实力和方法。如果人物不采取预防措施保护自己，邪教很有可能通过第三次攻击将他们全部杀死。",
	"At the final meeting of the council, the characters must work to unite the factions of the Sword Coast for the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon. Severin is ready to fulfill his plans, and the combined forces of the Sword Coast must strike now if the cult is to be stopped.": "在议会的最后一次会议上，角色们必须努力团结剑海岸的各个派别，与神龙教进行最后的战斗。塞弗林已经准备好实现他的计划，如果要阻止邪教，剑海岸的联合力量现在必须出击。",
	"At the Well of Dragons, a battle unfolds that will decide the fate of Faerûn. The factions of the Sword Coast fight alongside new and unexpected allies, facing off against the assembled might of the dragon cultists, flights of chromatic dragons, other monsters, and mercenaries.

	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} is an open-framework adventure designed for higher-level characters. As such, not all your game sessions need to stick to the main track of the adventure narrative. Additional events, rumors, and encounters can be used as needed or added as side treks or distractions. The following encounter seeds are meant to be used when you want to break up the narrative or if the players get off track.

	"The Cult of the Dragon expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute—and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply.

	"The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries.

Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" Severin's quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \"the Red Rage of Mintarn.\" The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.": "在提亚马特的启发下，塞弗林重新审视了萨姆斯特尔翻译的文本，发现了不同的解释，认为 \"除了破碎的王座，什么都不会留下，除了死者，没有统治者。龙将统治整个世界......\" 塞弗林对重塑邪教的追求使他找到了龙Hoondarrh，\"Mintarn的红色怒火\"。塞弗林不仅在这次遭遇中幸存下来，而且还与龙结为好友，这给流亡在九层地狱的提亚马特留下了深刻印象。作为奖励和进一步的测试，她允许塞弗林获得有关五龙面具存在的知识碎片。塞弗林带着这一点信息，做了很少有人能完成的事情，寻找并找到了所有五个面具。这项任务耗时多年才完成，它直接导致了法鲁恩现在面临的危机。",
	"Severin kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat's return.": "塞弗林为自己保留了红色面具。随着其他面具的发现，他把它们送给了他在神龙教中最亲密的盟友，赋予每个人以巫师的力量。利用龙面具的魔力，这个内部的巫师圈帮助塞弗林为提亚马特的回归做好准备。",
	"The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.": "神龙教的阴谋是秘密的，但它的存在却不是。剑海岸的大多数人都听说过这个邪教，但只知道其成员崇尚邪恶的龙。该邪教在主要城市招募新成员，消息很快就传开了。此外，许多邪教成员从事合法的商业活动，或被指派从事普通的学术研究。只有相对少数人充当小偷、刺客和间谍。",

Characters trying to pass as cultists might find this sign useful if they don't overdo it.": "崇拜者在公开场合避免穿这种服装，但知道如何寻找的人往往可以从人群中挑选出一个隐姓埋名的龙崇拜者。教徒们有时会用提亚马特的手势相互问候：伸出右手，手心向前，五指张开，模仿提亚马特的五个头。试图冒充邪教徒的角色可能会发现这个手势很有用，如果他们不做得太过分的话。",
	"Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for Tiamat. They look forward to the Dragon Queen's return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons—and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring Tiamat to Faerûn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells.": "邪教成员把龙当作强大的偶像和主人来敬仰，但他们的崇拜只保留给提亚马特。他们期待着龙后的回归，相信她会摧毁凡人的文明，迎来龙的辉煌统治--以及那些帮助实现龙族统治的人。到目前为止，致力于将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的复杂阴谋中，邪教组织已经找回了五个龙形面具，并收集了值得龙后使用的巨大财宝。现在剩下的就是在龙之井中建立她的神庙，牺牲数百名受害者，他们的灵魂将为一个古老的仪式提供动力，然后用这个仪式打开一个门户，让提亚马特从九层地狱中出现。",
	"The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for \"Wearers of Purple\"—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales.

The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult's resources.": "紫色穿戴者站在邪教人形等级制度的顶端，他们的话就是他们所指挥的城市、据点和巢穴中的邪教徒的法律。他们是邪教中唯一穿着紫色衣服的成员，而且大多数人都很自豪地炫耀这种颜色。紫色穿戴者有一种与龙交谈和谈判的亲和力--巫妖之语的天赋。数十名紫色穿戴者分布在整个神龙教中，他们都能调集教派的资源。",
	"Only Severin's inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority.

They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin's plots.": "这四位紫袍人是龙面具的守护者，也是塞弗林在召唤提亚马特的努力中最忠实的仆人。每位巫师都有一个龙形面具，除非在最糟糕的情况下，否则他们从不放弃，而且只有在塞弗林或龙族盟友的要求下才会放弃。内圈的成员都对一种特定颜色的色龙有亲和力。他们与这些颜色的龙打交道，以招募更多的龙加入这一事业，并策划邪教任务，推进塞弗林的阴谋。",

	"Under Severin's leadership, most cultists are devoted to Tiamat—but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult's new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that Severin is being played by the fiendish Tiamat. Notable among these members of the old guard are Naergoth Bladelord, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and Iskander, two high-ranking cultists in command of Xonthal's Tower.": "在塞弗林的领导下，大多数邪教成员都献身于提亚马特--但不是全部。一些守旧派不喜欢邪教的新方向，他们渴望既有的传统和龙卷风的崛起。德拉科利奇的忠实信徒们普遍认为塞弗林被邪恶的提亚马特所玩弄。这些守旧派成员中值得注意的是龙之井据点的前指挥官纳戈斯-布拉德洛德（Naergoth Bladelord），以及约根-帕尔（Jorgen Pawl）和伊斯坎德（Iskander），这两位高级邪教人员在松塔尔塔的指挥下。",
	"Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see cultists in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly.": "在大多数情况下，邪教徒是冒险者的合适敌人。他们在公共场合保持低调，所以角色们不太可能在沃特迪普或斯科努贝尔的街道上看到身着盛装的邪教分子。然而，随着他们的计划接近尾声，邪教徒们会变得更加大胆，并可能与冒险家们公开交锋。",
	"By the start of {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}, the effects of the cult's activities are visible across the Sword Coast. The scorched ruins of farming communities pillaged by cultists for Tiamat's hoard are a common enough occurrence that travelers know something is amiss.": "在{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}开始的时候，邪教活动的影响在整个剑海岸都是可见的。被邪教分子掠夺了蒂阿马特的囤积物的农业社区的焦土废墟是一种常见的现象，以至于旅行者知道有些事情是不对劲的。",

A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means.": "红袍巫师来自泰伊，在剑海岸以东两千多英里处。泰伊是一个遍布高耸高原的阴森恐怖的地区，由亡灵战士组成的军队防守，并由巫师萨斯-塔姆和他任命的祖尔基尔统治着八个魔法学校。泰伊的红袍巫师在整个法鲁恩都很有名，他们很容易被认出，因为他们穿着独特的深红色长袍，剃光的头上纹着神秘的符号。由于他们的邪恶名声，红袍巫师在许多地方都会被逮捕或当场杀死。出于这个原因，他们经常乔装打扮，隐身，或通过魔法手段出行。",
	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-谭质疑泰伊以外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",
	"One such Red Wizard exile is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}, an illusionist of great skill who long ago made the Sword Coast his home. Having a natural interest in dragons, it wasn't long before {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} came into contact with the Cult of the Dragon and Severin. The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells. {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} dreamed of an army that could confront and defeat Szass Tam. Out of mutual need, their alliance was born.": "其中一位红袍巫师流亡者是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}，他是一位技艺高超的幻术师，很久以前就以剑海岸为家。由于对龙有着天生的兴趣，不久后（1%）就接触到了龙和塞弗林的崇拜。这位年轻的、雄心勃勃的邪教领袖寻求强大的魔法，以找到散落的龙面具，并举行仪式，将蒂阿玛特从九层地狱召唤出来。{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}梦想着有一支能够对抗和击败萨斯-谭的军队。出于相互需要，他们的联盟诞生了。",
	"The secret cornerstone of this union is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s belief that once Tiamat returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak cultists. {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} hopes that Tiamat will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether Tiamat will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}相信一旦提亚马特回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些虔诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}希望提亚马特会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，赐予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在击败萨斯-塔姆后，{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的领袖。提亚玛特是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，都是未知数。",
	"Not all members of the Cult of the Dragon are happy about the Red Wizards' involvement in the cult's plans. Wyrmspeaker Varram foresees trouble in the cult joining forces with {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s splinter sect. He has warned Severin about the potential danger, to no avail.": "并非所有的神龙教成员都对红袍巫师参与该教派的计划感到高兴。Wyrmspeaker Varram预见到邪教与{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}的分裂教派联手会带来麻烦。他已经警告过塞弗林这个潜在的危险，但无济于事。",
	"Red Wizards can be encountered anywhere on the Sword Coast (use {@creature mage} stats if necessary), whether operating alongside cultists or on their own. They most often work alone, but two or three Red Wizards might join forces for an important assignment. In a public area where their appearance could put them at risk, Red Wizards favor deep hoods and scarves to hide their faces. Their undead {@creature wight} bodyguards are usually nearby—and often {@condition invisible}. Each Red Wizard specializes in a single school of magic, but all learn spells outside their specialty schools.": "红袍巫师可以在剑海岸的任何地方遇到（必要时使用{@creature mage}状态），无论是与邪教徒一起行动还是单独行动。他们最常单独行动，但两个或三个红袍巫师可能会联合起来执行一项重要的任务。在公共区域，他们的外表可能会使他们处于危险之中，红袍巫师喜欢用深色的头巾和围巾来掩盖他们的脸。他们的不死保镖（%1%）通常就在附近，而且经常（%2%）。每个红袍巫师都专攻一个魔法流派，但都会学习其专业流派以外的法术。",
	"Red Wizards don't share the cultists' fanaticism for Tiamat. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection—the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.": "红袍巫师并不认同邪教分子对提亚马特的狂热。对他们来说，将龙后带到这个世界上只是他们所谓的 \"泰雅复活 \"的一个阶段--摧毁萨斯坦并夺回泰伊的更大计划。他们容忍龙的崇拜者，但不承认他们是平等的。",
	"Not every Red Wizard on the Sword Coast is working for {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a Red Wizard in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the Red Wizard exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "剑海岸的每个红袍巫师并非都在为{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}或神龙教工作。有些人追求自己的利益，而有些人则是萨斯-谭的间谍。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己与他们通常不会信任的角色结成了不安的联盟，因为要消灭一个为邪教服务的红袍巫师，最简单和最肯定的方法就是将该巫师的位置出卖给萨斯-谭的代理人。然而，那些与萨斯-谭的仆人和他对红袍巫师流亡者的偏执仇杀走得太近的人物，可能会发现自己受到泰安人的摆布。这种可能性将在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到更充分的探讨。",
	"Tiamat has long threatened Faerûn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don't know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, Tiamat cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world.": "Tiamat长期以来一直威胁着Faerûn，经常出现在Chessenta和Unther等地，驱使凡人去崇拜她的可怕力量。虽然凡人不知道，但 \"毁灭 \"和 \"动乱时代 \"的结束也结束了诸神的这种直接插手。没有强大的魔法和凡人的帮助，提亚马特无法从她在阿弗纳斯的家进入这个世界。",
	"Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus's basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies.": "阿弗纳斯是一片巨石遍布的荒芜之地，火红的彗星划过天空，恶魔贵族们在凄凉的铁堡垒中进行统治。冥河在阿弗纳斯的玄武岩悬崖上锯出一条锯齿状的路线，蜿蜒穿过灰暗的平原，最终穿过一个大坑坠入下面八层地狱。阿弗纳斯的所有河流都汇入冥河，每条河流都在滚滚的苍蝇云下流淌着红色的血液。",
	"Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of Tiamat—a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of Tiamat to the world as a way to be rid of her.": "阿斯莫德最近恢复了堕落天使扎里尔作为阿弗纳斯大公夫人的地位，推翻了先前允许一个名为贝尔的坑道恶魔夺取王位的决定。当扎丽尔从她的权力所在地流亡时，她受到了提亚马特的摆布--这是令她至今感到不安的命运。尽管她拥有九层地狱第一层统治者的权力，但扎瑞尔无法杀死龙神，她认为将提亚马特召唤到这个世界是摆脱她的一种方式。",
	"Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free Tiamat, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants Tiamat out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.": "扎丽尔已经指示她的凡人特工协助那些寻求释放提亚马特的人，她的力量使红袍巫师更容易召唤魔鬼，使龙之崇拜找到更多的信徒。然而，就像扎里尔希望提亚马特离开一样，其他魔鬼也很乐意看到龙后留在阿弗纳斯。其中最重要的是被废黜的地狱魔王贝尔和仍然忠于他的魔鬼。",
	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing Tiamat into the world is a massive undertaking, and Severin has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼毫无关系。然而，将提亚马特释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，塞弗林已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。尽管他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面都很有经验，但这样做从来都不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils aren't numerous in {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，魔鬼的数量并不多（%0%），但是他们在冒险的其他地方的出现（包括额外的遭遇 \"魔鬼的要求\"）应该让细心的玩家对魔鬼和龙之间的联系感到好奇。魔鬼是最高的操纵者，如果角色有机会与不为邪教工作的魔鬼交谈，不要害怕向他们提供邪恶的帮助。这样的提议应该让所有的角色--不仅仅是那些有良好关系的角色--陷入困境。与魔鬼讨价还价是一个愚蠢的游戏，但是如果替代方案是世界末日，这可能是冒险家们的唯一选择。",
	"Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them.": "冒险中的魔鬼应该总是比冒险者领先一步。那些喜欢冲锋陷阵，稍后再决定策略的角色会发现，他们的恶魔般的敌人有着完善的计划。如果角色提前两步计划，魔鬼们就会超前一步。凡人所做的任何事情都不应该让他们吃惊。",
	"Severin and his supporters intend to use the ancient draconic artifact known as the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} to rally the chromatic dragons to Tiamat's cause. However, chromatic dragons are notoriously arrogant, territorial, greedy, and suspicious of any creatures begging favors—especially if those creatures might be a threat. Getting dragons to cooperate is a monumental task, even when bringing the Queen of Dragons into the world is the ultimate goal.": "塞弗林和他的支持者们打算利用被称为\"%0%\"的古代龙族神器来召集色龙为提亚马特的事业服务。然而，色龙是出了名的傲慢、领地、贪婪，而且对任何乞求恩惠的生物都持怀疑态度--特别是当这些生物可能是一种威胁时。让龙合作是一项艰巨的任务，即使把龙后带入世界是最终目标。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",
	"The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of Tyranny of Dragons: {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons—a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faerûn.": "色素龙的力量是贯穿《龙的暴政》各个方面的一个主题。{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. 随着冒险事件的展开，越来越多的龙对{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}隆隆的呻吟声做出反应，并前往龙之井--这种迁移激发了整个法鲁恩人们的警觉和恐慌。",
	"Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road.": "应该很少让角色和玩家忘记恶龙在移动。只要冒险者在外面，他们就可能看到一条龙在远处的上空飞翔。白天，龙的影子可能会落在冒险者的身上，晚上，黑暗的龙翼可能会瞬间遮住月亮。当人物到达一个定居点时，他们应该听到关于龙的踪迹和攻击的故事。当他们旅行时，烧毁的小村庄和被拆毁的商队会在路上出现。",
	"Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faerûn and the Dungeons & Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",
	"Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can't do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out.": "能够应对这次冒险的挑战的角色等级足够高，当这些盟友倒在龙人的敌人面前时，他们可以让盟友从死里复活。如果角色自己不能这样做，他们在高塔骑士团或哈珀斯的盟友应该会愿意帮忙。",
	"With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don't sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause—Tiamat included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when Tiamat can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells.": "有着一千年甚至更久的寿命，色龙对在与普通人类的战斗中死去没有兴趣，它们不会为任何事业高尚地牺牲自己--包括Tiamat。陷入败局的龙会采取任何逃避的方式，最常见的是简单地腾空而去。然而，在龙之井的最后决战中，这种情况发生了变化，人们可以看到提亚马特在九层地狱的门户中张牙舞爪。",
	"If the characters claimed Skyreach Castle in {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, they might well hear from a frost giant diplomat who shows up to reclaim it as property of the giants who built it. A frost giant named Harshnag lives on Mount Sar north of Waterdeep, and he is sometimes called upon when the Sword Coast faces dire threats. The player characters could fly the citadel to him or—in a more dramatic interlude—he might come to a council meeting and demand the citadel's return on behalf of his kin so that he might rally them against their ancient foes.": "如果人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中宣称拥有Skyreach城堡，他们很可能会听到一个冰霜巨人外交官出现，将其作为建造它的巨人的财产收回。一个名叫哈什纳格（Harshnag）的冰霜巨人住在沃特迪普北部的萨尔山上，当剑海岸面临可怕的威胁时，他有时会被召唤。玩家角色可以把城堡飞给他，或者在一个更戏剧性的插曲中，他可能会来参加议会会议，代表他的亲属要求归还城堡，这样他就可以召集他们来对抗他们古老的敌人。",
	"If the player characters did not claim the citadel (or crashed it), this option is not available to them.": "如果玩家角色没有认领城堡（或将其撞毁），他们就不能使用这个选项。",
	"Giants are unlikely to appear side by side with dragons anywhere before the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. However, characters who gain any insight into the giants' alliance with the dragons should understand its apocalyptic significance.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，巨人不太可能在任何地方与龙并肩出现。然而，对巨人与龙的联盟有任何了解的角色都应该理解其世界末日的意义。",
	"Several powerful organizations battle the Cult of the Dragon even as the party does. The characters are key players in the drama, but everyone in Faerûn has a stake in the outcome of the battle against Tiamat and her allies.

	"The secret society known as the Harpers has been disbanded and rebuilt several times over its long history. The latest incarnation of the group retains its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Harpers try to keep out of the public eye, preferring secrecy to fame and using knowledge to win the day over brute force. However, as the Cult of the Dragon grows more brazen and destructive, the Harpers are forced to act more openly in their opposition.": "被称为哈珀斯的秘密组织在其漫长的历史中已经被解散和重建了好几次。该组织的最新化身仍然专注于收集信息，密切关注法鲁恩的权力平衡，并以安静、不引人注意的方式促进公平和平等。哈珀斯试图远离公众的视线，宁可选择保密也不选择出名，并利用知识来赢得胜利，而不是用蛮力。然而，随着神龙教越来越肆无忌惮和具有破坏性，哈珀人被迫采取更公开的反对行动。",

Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order's sight.": "正如善行必须在光明中进行，让所有人都能看到一样，邪恶也必须回避，并处处与之斗争。秩序的成员可以被英雄和正义的行为所征服，但他们会反对与邪恶合作或容忍邪恶的角色。骑士团最容易被那些表现出英雄主义和神圣天意的行为所动摇--例如，联合金属龙来对抗提亚马特的孩子。杀死一个讲巫术的人也会给党带来好处，而捕获并将这样的恶棍绳之以法会让他们在教团的眼中地位更高。",

	"The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance. Members of the enclave live in the wilderness or in small communities, and the order has almost no representatives in towns and cities. They are not opposed to civilization, however. Rather, they seek to prevent civilization and wilderness from harming one another. Those who serve the Emerald Enclave are masters of survival and living off the land, of navigating through the wilderness, and of reading the signs that indicate approaching weather, the passage of creatures, and the general weal of the natural world.": "绿宝石飞地致力于维护自然秩序的平衡，打击威胁这种平衡的力量。飞地的成员生活在荒野或小型社区，该组织在城镇几乎没有代表。然而，他们并不反对文明。相反，他们寻求防止文明和荒野相互伤害。那些为绿宝石飞地服务的人是生存和靠土地生活的大师，是在荒野中航行的大师，是读懂预示着天气临近、生物通过以及自然界总体利益的迹象的大师。",

	"There is no question that Tiamat must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil.

He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however.": "毫无疑问，提亚马特必须被阻止，但翡翠飞地希望看到世界恢复秩序。这有时意味着在善与恶的斗争中采取中间立场。德兰敏锐地意识到伴随着龙神教最近的活动而产生的破坏。他知道该邪教必须被摧毁，因为它破坏了自然界的平衡，而且他知道许多支持该邪教的龙会在结束前死去。然而，他宁愿不做无谓的杀戮。",

	"Because the Lords' Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction.

	"Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.": "Laeral Silverhand为谈判带来了几个世纪的领导经验和令人印象深刻的声誉。作为一个完美的外交家，她可以轻松地挥舞话语，使人受伤或舒缓。作为沃特德普的开放领主，她在所有的代表中都有很大的影响力，除了达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember），他认为是她策划了将他从开放领主的位置上撤下来。",
	"Laeral's primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council's discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords' Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning Tiamat does she change her mind. However, she doesn't trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.": "拉伊尔的首要关注点是让所有各方都在谈判桌上，并确保每个理事会的讨论都能产生具体的行动。然而，她对派遣军队参加战斗持谨慎态度。她对战争的恐怖并不陌生，她敏锐地意识到，领主联盟所代表的土地需要他们的士兵来保护自己的人民。只有在确信神龙教有可能成功召唤提亚马特时，她才改变主意。然而，她并不信任冒险者的领导权，除非他们在战场上和谈判桌上的事迹让她印象深刻。",
	"If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions.

	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep.

Like {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism.

Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"Sir Isteval has much in common with {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士与高塔骑士团的（%0%）有很多共同点。两人在所有事情上都是潜在的盟友，这让其他一些领主联盟的成员感到担忧。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see Tiamat ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到提亚马特登基是两件事。镇塔林对龙女王的回归对他们的计划意味着什么不抱幻想。想要从阴影中为自己秘密统治世界，黑网的领导人并不希望成为某个小神和她的龙族同伙的代理人和跑腿者。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker Varram to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in Varram's portion of the \"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\" chapter.": "至少有一个黑网的任务是不计报酬地执行的。在镇塔林以外的人不知情的情况下，他们的一名特工潜入了邪教，并接近了Wyrmspeaker Varram，偷走了{@i White Dragon Mask}。这次偷窃引发了一连串的事件，在瓦拉姆的\"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"章节中达到高潮。",
	"Black Network agents are useful NPCs that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome {@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.": "黑网特工是有用的NPC，你可以在冒险过程中的适当时候介绍他们。玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的角色已经见过黑网的一个成员--女地精（%1%）。如果角色需要他们无法通过其他方式获得的信息或装备，寻找或被一个Zhentarim特工接近是你提供信息的一个简单方法。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",

However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.": "里安是根塔林的成员，也是黑网在第三届沃特德普议会中的特使。她作为纽文伯领主的特别顾问坐在会议桌前，她与根塔林的关系不会被提及。然而，如果角色们质疑里安的存在，她和纽文伯领主都不会试图否认或隐瞒这种关系。",
	"The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council's strategic resources. Rian doesn't have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.": "黑网支持任何增加击败邪教的可能性的计划。任何和所有的联盟都没有问题，任何能增加理事会战略资源的结果也是如此。里安对道德没有任何特别的兴趣，黑暗行为对她对党的态度没有任何影响。但她不赞成活捉任何讲巫术的人，因为她害怕这种危险人物的力量，并对试图策反或审讯他们的成功率表示怀疑。她倾向于谨慎地处决，用适当的仪式审问尸体，并销毁尸体以防止复活。",
	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim's loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.": "黑网在最后的议会上作出承诺之前，一直没有作出承诺。如果队伍赢得了赞塔林的尊重，他们只需付出象征性的代价就能提供服务。然而，这样的行动几乎肯定会使大多数其他派系与冒险者疏远。与其他派别不同的是，不管他们对角色的尊重程度如何，如果党派能够谈判出由其他派别支付的条件，那么就可以买到Zhentarim的忠诚度。",
	"The good dragons of Faerûn hear the {@i Draakhorn's} call and know what it portends.

	"The metallic dragons will strike against the cultists at the Well of Dragons, but they are much more effective if their attacks are coordinated as part of the overall plan of battle.

Even when good giants see the need and wisdom in joining forces with lesser folk, they often resist the idea out of pride until someone or something can command their respect.": "虽然很多巨人都投靠了龙之教，但大多数人对古代龙-巨人战争的记忆是痛苦和仇恨的。关于仇杀、流血和死亡的故事加剧了巨人对龙的仇恨，但巨人种族是他们自己的主人。因此，他们不轻易与小种族合作。即使善良的巨人看到了与小民族联合的必要性和智慧，他们也常常出于骄傲而抵制这种想法，直到有人或事能得到他们的尊重。",
	"Engaging the giants in an alliance against the Cult of the Dragon can be handled by NPCs (most likely by members of the Harpers or the Emerald Enclave). If the characters completed {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} in possession of Skyreach Castle, offering to return it to the giants (either behind the scenes or in a side trek chapter of your own creation) is sure to guarantee their support of the factions against the Cult of the Dragon.

The raiders haven't set up an effective cordon around the keep, so it's still possible to move through the front gate—but not for long.": "除非有角色介入，否则哥布林会认为这些角色是邪教分子而不理会他们。假设角色介入并救出了那家人，利南解释说他们必须去守卫（在1号区域）；那是格林斯特唯一安全的地方。袭击者还没有在堡垒周围设置有效的警戒线，所以仍有可能通过前门移动，但时间不会很长。",
	"To reach the keep, the characters must make it past three groups of raiders. A group consists of {@dice 1d6} {@creature Kobold||kobolds} and {@dice 1d4} {@creature Cultist||cultists}. If the group contains six kobolds, one is a {@creature Winged Kobold||winged kobold (urd)}.": "为了到达守卫，人物必须穿过三组突袭者。一组由（%0%）（%1%）和（%2%）（%3%）组成。如果这群人中有六个哥布林，其中一个就是（%4%）。",
	"Characters can fight these enemies, sneak past them, retreat to avoid them entirely, or try something clever such as bluffing. If they fight, run the combat normally. When enemies must make a check to notice sneaking or bluffing, make a check with advantage for the group.": "角色可以与这些敌人战斗，偷偷溜过去，撤退以完全避开他们，或者尝试一些巧妙的方法，如虚张声势。如果他们战斗，则正常进行战斗。当敌人必须进行检查以注意到潜行或虚张声势时，请进行检查，并对团体有利。",
	"Each time the characters retreat from an enemy group to avoid it, they run into {@dice 1d6} more townsfolk who are trying to reach the keep. For every four additional townsfolk in tow, the group must move past one more enemy group to reach the keep.": "每当人物从一个敌群中撤退以避开它时，他们就会遇到{@dice 1d6}更多的镇民，他们正试图到达堡垒。每多拖四个老乡，队伍就必须多经过一个敌方队伍才能到达堡垒。",
	"At the keep, the characters are the last group through the gate before it is closed and barred. After characters enter the keep, raiders encircle it in increasing numbers.": "在堡垒里，人物是最后一批通过大门的人，然后大门就被关闭了，并设有栅栏。在人物进入堡垒后，突袭者以越来越多的数量包围了它。",
	"Besides earning experience points (XP) for raiders fought on the way to the keep, characters earn a bonus of 50 XP per nonplayer character (NPC) brought alive into the keep. Divide this bonus equally among the party members. Alternatively, if you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 2nd level once they arrive at the keep.": "除了在前往堡垒的路上与突袭者作战可以获得经验值（XP）之外，角色们还可以为每个被活捉的非玩家角色（NPC）获得50XP的奖励。把这个奖励平均分配给党员。或者，如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，那么角色一旦到达堡垒就会达到2级。",
	"Events in Greenest are divided into missions. Missions don't need to involve combat, but most do.": "在《最绿》中，事件被分为任务。任务不需要涉及战斗，但大多数都涉及。",
	"The characters reach the town at sundown, or about 9 p.m. The sun comes up again at 6 a.m. the next morning, but the last of the raiders are gone by 4 a.m.": "角色们在日落时分，也就是晚上9点左右到达小镇。第二天早上6点，太阳再次升起，但最后一批突袭者在凌晨4点前就走了。",
	"For time-keeping purposes, assume that each mission takes an hour. Time during the hour that isn't spent fighting or slipping through town is spent tending gear, bandaging minor wounds, patrolling the keep's walls, briefing Nighthill on the situation, and other mundane tasks. If characters take a short rest, they can't undertake any other mission that hour.": "为了记录时间，假设每次任务需要一个小时。在这一小时内，如果不是用于战斗或溜过城镇，就会用于照料装备、包扎小伤口、在堡垒的墙壁上巡逻、向奈特希尔介绍情况，以及其他平凡的任务。如果角色进行短暂的休息，他们就不能在那一小时内承担任何其他任务。",
	"If players need guidance, Governor Nighthill can give the characters a quick briefing on the tactical situation. The raiders have isolated the keep from the town with encircling groups of guards, but they haven't organized an attack. Nighthill thinks the raiders don't intend to attack the keep; they seem interested only in loot. The real danger is to the town and to those people who didn't make it into the keep before it was cut off. Nighthill wants the characters to slip back into the town and help people who are cut off or harass the raiders. A stealthy group can make it out of the keep and back in again without drawing the raiders' attention.": "如果玩家需要指导，奈特希尔总督可以给人物快速介绍一下战术情况。袭击者已经用包围的卫兵群将堡垒与城镇隔离开来，但他们还没有组织进攻。Nighthill认为突袭者并不打算攻击堡垒；他们似乎只对战利品感兴趣。真正的危险是对镇子和那些在被切断之前没能进入堡垒的人。Nighthill希望角色们能溜回镇上，帮助那些被切断的人或骚扰突袭者。一个隐蔽的团队可以在不引起突袭者注意的情况下，走出堡垒并再次返回。",
	"A narrow tunnel runs from the cellar beneath the keep to the bank of the stream (area 2). The tunnel is wide enough to allow warriors to pass through it in single file. In the keep, the tunnel is sealed with a locked ironbound door, and the stream exit is covered with a locked iron grate made to look like a sewer outlet. The tunnel's main function was as a secret means of collecting water from the stream during a siege, but it can double as a sally port. Since the keep has never been besieged, the old tunnel has never been used. Barrels and crates are piled in front of the door. The keys for the locks are on the ring that Escobert carries with him everywhere.": "一条狭窄的隧道从堡垒下面的地窖一直延伸到溪流的岸边（2区）。这条隧道足够宽，可以让战士们单枪匹马地通过。在堡垒里，隧道被一扇上了锁的铁门封住，而溪流的出口则被一个上了锁的铁栅栏覆盖，看起来就像一个下水道的出口。这条隧道的主要功能是在围攻期间从溪流中收集水的秘密手段，但它也可以作为集水口。由于该堡垒从未被围攻过，所以这条老隧道也从未被使用过。桶和板条箱堆在门前。锁的钥匙在埃斯科贝特随处携带的戒指上。",
	"At some point, Escobert recommends the tunnel as a means of sneaking townsfolk into the keep without running the gauntlet of attackers watching the gates.": "在某种程度上，埃斯科贝特建议将隧道作为一种手段，让镇民们偷偷进入堡垒，而不需要跑到看守大门的攻击者面前。",
	"Characters can clear the cellar door with a few minutes' work. The lock is stiff but opens with the key; without the key, the character can open the lock with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB}.

The rats attack when disturbed, and the surviving rats flee when half their number die.": "角色可以通过几分钟的努力来清理地窖的门。锁是僵硬的，但用钥匙可以打开；如果没有钥匙，角色可以通过成功的DC10灵巧检查和一套（%0%）来打开锁。这条废弃的隧道被网堵住了，但其他方面都很清楚。在溪流尽头的几码内，有一个由两只（1%）组成的巢穴。老鼠在受到干扰时就会攻击，而幸存的老鼠在死了一半后就会逃走。",
	"Years of exposure and neglect have corroded the lock on the exit grate. Even with the key, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check is needed to open the lock. Without the key, the DC increases to 20. If the roll misses by 5 or more, the key or {@item thieves' tools|PHB} break off in the lock so that unlocking it becomes impossible. Then only a successful DC 15 Strength check can force the grate open.": "多年的暴露和忽视使出口栅栏上的锁被腐蚀了。即使有钥匙，要打开这把锁也需要成功的DC10灵巧检查。如果没有钥匙，DC会增加到20。如果检查结果差5分或更多，钥匙或{@item thieves' tools|PHB}在锁中断裂，这样就无法开锁了。然后，只有成功地进行DC15力量检查才能强行打开栅栏。",
	"A group of cultists is searching the stream banks for hiding townsfolk when the characters emerge from the tunnel. If characters open the lock with the key or with {@item thieves' tools|PHB}, the first one to exit notices the raiders approaching without being spotted in return; the characters can keep out of sight in the tunnel or try to ambush the raiders after they pass. If the check fails, the raiders spot the character; roll initiative and proceed with combat. If the grate had to be broken open with a Strength check, the raiders hear the noise and find cover; they wait for the characters to exit the tunnel, then gain a surprise round. The raiders' group consists of two {@creature Cultist||cultists} and six {@creature Kobold||kobolds}. If any cultists are still alive at the beginning of the fourth round of the fight, one of them runs to fetch help. Ten minutes later, two {@creature Cultist||cultists}, ten {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and one {@creature ambush drake|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) arrive to guard the tunnel.": "当人物从隧道中走出来时，一群邪教徒正在河岸上搜寻躲藏的镇民。如果角色用钥匙或用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}打开锁，第一个出来的人就会注意到突袭者正在接近而不被发现；角色可以在隧道里保持不被发现，或者在突袭者通过后尝试伏击他们。如果检查失败，突袭者就会发现该角色；滚动主动权并进行战斗。如果必须用力量检查打开栅栏，突袭者会听到声音并找到掩体；他们等待角色离开隧道，然后获得一个突袭回合。突击队员的队伍由两个（1%）和六个（2%）组成。如果在第四轮战斗开始时有邪教徒还活着，其中一个人就会跑去求救。十分钟后，两个（%3%）、十个（%4%）和一个（%5%）（见（%6%））来到这里，守住通道。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. Aside from that, the chief reward for this mission is the tunnel itself. As long as it remains secret, characters can use it to enter and exit the keep safely.

	"The keep has a sally port along the west wall for counterattacking foes who bring a battering ram against the gates. During the night while characters are in the keep, raiders approach the old gate, force it open, and rush through. Escobert discovers them and races into the courtyard to sound the alarm ahead of the infiltrators.": "堡垒的西墙有一个紧急通道，用于反击那些用撞锤撞门的敌人。夜里，当人物在堡垒中时，突袭者接近老门，强行打开，然后冲了进去。埃斯科贝尔发现了他们，并跑到院子里，在潜入者面前拉响了警报。",
	"Enough defenders are available to deal with the immediate threat from raiders loose in the keep, since it's more a probe that got out of hand rather than a full-scale assault. Escobert is most concerned about resealing the sally port, and he seeks out the characters for that job.": "有足够的守卫者来处理来自守卫中松散的袭击者的直接威胁，因为这更像是一次失控的探测，而不是一次全面的攻击。埃斯科贝特最关心的是重新密封集散港，他找来了负责这项工作的人物。",
	"To secure the sally port, characters must battle through two groups of foes. The first fight occurs against three {@creature Acolyte||acolytes}, three {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and one {@creature ambush drake|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}), which are guarding the sally port's 10-foot-by-20-foot ready room against exactly this type of counterattack. After characters seize the room, they discover that the door is heavily damaged. The fastest repair is with five castings of {@spell mending} (taking five minutes). If none of the characters can do this, an NPC in the keep knows the cantrip. Someone must find and fetch her to the ready room.": "为了确保集结港的安全，角色必须与两组敌人作战。第一场战斗的对手是三个（%0%）、三个（%1%）和一个（%2%）（见（%3%）），他们守卫着传送门的10英尺×20英尺的准备室，正是为了防止这种类型的反攻。角色占领房间后，发现门被严重损坏。最快的修复方法是施放五次{@spell mending}(需要5分钟)。如果没有一个角色能做到这一点，那么堡垒里的一个NPC知道这个咒语。必须有人找到并把她带到准备室。",
	"Before the door can be repaired, a second group of raiders consisting of two {@creature Guard||guards}, three {@creature Cultist||cultists}, and three {@creature Kobold||kobolds} attacks.

	"Award standard XP for defeated foes.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。",
	"The {@creature adult blue dragon} Lennithon accompanied this raid but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn't consider this to be its fight, and it isn't keen on tangling with adventurers for another's benefit.": "Lennithon{@creature adult blue dragon}伴随着这次突袭，但并不是一个热情的参与者。它的主要贡献是其可怕的存在，但随着夜幕的降临和守卫者克服恐惧，这一点变得不那么有效。午夜前不久，巨龙对城堡发起了最后的攻击。{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}下令进攻，他知道当时冒险者们都在堡垒里。伦尼森不认为这是它的战斗，它不热衷于为了别人的利益与冒险者纠缠。",
	"During this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon's Frightful Presence from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn't target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills {@dice 1d4} NPC defenders and injures {@dice 1d6} more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs' attacks are ineffective against Lennithon.

Inside, the main floor is dominated by a massive stone grinding wheel driven by a water wheel in the stream. The mill was operating late when the raid began and the millers fled without disengaging the wheel, so it still turns noisily. The upper half of the barn is a loft where milled flour is stored. The loft can be reached by wooden stairs along the east wall or by using the ropes and pulleys that hoist bags of flour up and down through large openings in the loft floor.": "磨坊是一个简单的长方形谷仓，大约40英尺长，20英尺宽，有一个附属的外部办公室。建筑物远离河流的长边有谷仓门和一个两扇门，两面短墙有窗户。所有这些开口都是封闭的，但没有一个是锁着或闩着的。在里面，主楼的主体是一个巨大的石磨，由溪流中的水轮驱动。袭击开始时，磨坊正在晚间运作，磨坊主没有解除水轮就逃走了，所以它仍然在嘈杂地转动。谷仓的上半部分是一个阁楼，存放着磨好的面粉。阁楼可以通过沿东墙的木质楼梯到达，或者利用绳索和滑轮将一袋袋面粉从阁楼地板上的大开口处吊上去和吊下来。",
	"The ambushers are waiting in the loft for heroes to enter the mill. When the heroes are inside, the guards launch a volley of spears from above, then leap down to fight hand-to-hand.

	"Group B consists of three {@creature Cultist||cultists}, ten {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and two {@creature Ambush Drake|HotDQ|ambush drakes} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) strung out in a mob that stretches 50 feet. This procession with leaping and whirling kobolds completes one circuit around the temple approximately every eight minutes (two minutes per side).": "B组由三只（%0%）、十只（%1%）和两只（%2%）（见（%3%））串成的暴徒队伍，绵延50英尺。这个带着跳跃和旋转的哥布林的队伍大约每八分钟绕着神庙完成一圈（每边两分钟）。",
	"Group C consists of four {@creature Cultist||cultists} and four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} clustered tightly around the temple's back door. Their meager fire produces little flame, instead creating prodigious clouds of thick smoke that engulf the back of the temple and blanket the surrounding 30 feet of ground. Everything in the smoke is lightly obscured, and objects or creatures that are seen through more than 15 feet of smoke are heavily obscured. Characters can sneak up on these raiders and gain a surprise round against them, as long as they avoid Group B in the process.": "C组由四个{@creature Cultist||cultists}和四个{@creature Kobold||kobolds}组成，紧紧地簇拥着寺庙的后门。他们微薄的火力几乎没有产生什么火焰，反而产生了巨大的浓烟云，吞没了寺庙的后面，并覆盖了周围30英尺的地面。烟雾中的一切都被轻度遮蔽，而透过15英尺以上的烟雾看到的物体或生物则被严重遮蔽。只要在这个过程中避开B组，角色就可以偷袭这些突袭者，并获得一个对他们的突袭回合。",
	"The heroes' best shot at rescuing the townsfolk is to overpower Group C and take control of the back door. In the temple, they can arrange a distraction to keep Groups A and B occupied at the front while the citizens of Greenest slip out the back and race for the keep or for the old tunnel—if characters have opened it already. That's only one possibility; clever players can come up with different solutions.": "英雄们营救镇民的最好办法是制服C组并控制后门。在神庙里，他们可以安排分散注意力，让A组和B组占据前门，而Greenest的市民则从后门溜走，争先恐后地去找堡垒或旧隧道--如果角色已经打开了它。这只是一种可能性；聪明的玩家可以想出不同的解决方案。",
	"The townsfolk in the temple are near panic, however, and they won't take orders from strangers unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Otherwise, characters need to locate the priest of Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon, a level-headed half-elf. He's easy to spot, being the only calm person they can find in the temple, and he is elated to see them. He looks to the characters for a plan.": "然而，神庙里的镇民近乎恐慌，他们不会接受陌生人的命令，除非有人成功地进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。否则，人物需要找到Chauntea的牧师，Eadyan Falconmoon，一个平头的半精灵。他很容易被发现，是他们在神庙中唯一能找到的平静的人，他看到他们时很高兴。他向这些人物询问了一个计划。",
	"Time is pressing. While characters are inside the temple, remind them of the booming blows of the battering ram against the front doors and the frightened townsfolk. How much time you allow before the doors burst open depends on your group. What's important is that players feel pressed. To create a sense of pressure, give the front doors 30 hit points and let each thud of the battering ram deal {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage. When the doors reach 20 hit points, they have cracks large enough to see through. At 10 hit points, the doors sag in their hinges. At 5, they could collapse at the next impact. How frequently you roll the die is up to you! One roll every 15–20 seconds is a good target for an average group. Be flexible, judge the players' level of tension, and don't let anyone relax.": "时间紧迫。当人物在神庙里时，提醒他们注意撞锤对前门的轰鸣声和受惊吓的镇民。在门突然打开之前，你允许多少时间取决于你的团队。重要的是，玩家要感到有压力。为了创造一种压力感，给前门30点命中率，让撞锤的每一次撞击都造成{@dice 1d6}重击伤害。当门的命中率达到20时，它们的裂缝大到可以看穿。在10点的时候，门的铰链会下垂。在5点时，它们可能在下一次撞击中倒塌。掷骰子的频率由你决定。每15-20秒掷一次骰子对于一个普通小组来说是个好的目标。要有灵活性，判断玩家的紧张程度，不要让任何人放松。",
	"If the doors burst open before the temple is evacuated, this scene turns into an ugly melee against Group A. The kobolds in that group prefer to attack unarmed villagers instead of lethal adventurers. Each kobold automatically kills one villager each round unless characters attack the kobolds, cut them off from their victims, or interfere some other way. If townsfolk have already evacuated the temple through the back door, or that process is well along before the front doors split apart under the ram, then characters can conduct a fighting withdrawal through the temple. After everyone gets into the smoke outside, they can close and brace the back door, then sprint for the keep or the tunnel in the stream bank with enough of a head start to get away safely.": "如果在寺庙被疏散之前大门突然打开，这个场景就会变成一场针对A组的丑陋混战。每个哥布林每回合自动杀死一个村民，除非角色攻击哥布林，切断他们与受害者的联系，或以其他方式进行干扰。如果村民们已经从后门撤离了寺庙，或者在前门被撞开之前，这个过程就已经开始了，那么角色们就可以通过寺庙进行战斗性撤退。在每个人都进入外面的烟雾中后，他们可以关闭并加固后门，然后冲刺到堡垒或河岸上的隧道，并有足够的先机来安全离开。",

Although it is shaped roughly like a human, it is at least seven feet tall, its skin is covered in blue scales, its fingers bear wicked claws, and its face has the muzzle and reptilian eyes of a dragon. The creature stops about eighty yards from the main gate of the keep and scans the walls. A line of kobolds fans out behind it. With their spears, they prod four human prisoners into the dim light. You can make out a woman, a teenage boy in a blood-soaked tunic, and two children. Then the half-dragon creature hails the keep.": "从黑暗中，一个生物大步走进堡垒周围垂死的火光中。虽然它的形状大致像人，但它至少有七英尺高，皮肤上覆盖着蓝色的鳞片，手指上有邪恶的爪子，脸上有龙的嘴和爬行动物的眼睛。这个生物在离守卫的大门大约八十码的地方停下来，扫视着墙壁。一排哥布林在它身后排开。他们用长矛把四个人类囚犯推到昏暗的光线中。你可以看清一个女人、一个穿着被血浸透的外衣的十几岁男孩和两个孩子。然后那个半龙人呼唤着守卫。",

	"Cyanwrath is pleased to see a champion step forward. He agrees to these terms for the combat: The three children will be set loose immediately, but his kobolds will continue to stand guard over the woman, and they will kill her if anyone interferes in the fight—for example, if archers in the keep let fly at him. Regardless of who wins, the woman will be released when the fight is over; and the victor will be the last one standing.": "西恩沃斯很高兴看到一个冠军站出来。他同意了这些战斗条款：三个孩子将被立即释放，但他的哥布林将继续守卫这个女人，如果有人干扰战斗，他们将杀死她--例如，如果守卫中的弓箭手向他放箭。无论谁赢了，战斗结束后，这个女人将被释放；胜利者将是最后站立的人。",
	"Governor Nighthill holds his troops in the keep during the combat. Adventurers can go out if they want, but the half-dragon insists that they keep their distance and stay between him and the fortress. If characters try to surround him or to edge into position for an ambush, he warns them that his kobolds won't hesitate to kill the hostages if they see signs of treachery. The half-dragon is evil, but he has a deep sense of honor about one-on-one combat. He doesn't intend any shenanigans, and he won't allow any from his kobolds.": "在战斗期间，奈特希尔总督把他的部队留在堡垒里。如果冒险者愿意，他们可以出去，但半龙人坚持要求他们保持距离，留在他和堡垒之间。如果角色们试图包围他或进入伏击位置，他警告他们，如果他的哥布林看到背叛的迹象，他们会毫不犹豫地杀死人质的。半龙人是邪恶的，但他对一对一的战斗有一种深深的荣誉感。他不打算做任何恶作剧，他也不允许他的哥布林做任何恶作剧。",
	"Cyanwrath is the likely winner of this match, whether he's fighting Sergeant Markguth or a character. When his foe drops, he strikes one more time; the last blow kills Markguth or inflicts one death roll failure on a character.

If by some mischance Cyanwrath is killed or captured, his place in the dragon hatchery ({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3}) is taken by another half-dragon.": "Cyanwrath可能是这场比赛的赢家，无论他是与Markguth中士还是一个角色作战。当他的敌人倒下时，他再打一次；最后一击杀死马克古斯或对一个角色造成一次死亡卷轴失败。如果Cyanwrath在战斗中失败了，哥布林们会立即跳进去保护他的尸体并把它运走。(Cyanwrath会从他的伤口中恢复过来，并在以后再次遇到。)如果因为某种不幸，Cyanwrath被杀或被抓，他在龙族孵化场的位置({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3})会被另一个半龙族取代。",

	"It's assumed that when characters first see the fighting in Greenest, they will rush to its defense. If they don't, and they're traveling with others, then the NPCs they're traveling with suggest that an immediate attack might turn the tide or at least save many lives. If characters still sit out this fight, they see about half of the attackers leave around midnight, with the rest retiring in small groups over the next few hours. When the sun comes up, even a quick inspection shows that over half of the buildings are heavily damaged and much of the town's wealth was carried away. Hundreds of injured people are crowded into the keep or are found hiding in cellars, but most of them will survive.": "我们假定，当人物第一次看到Greenest的战斗时，他们会赶去保卫它。如果他们不这样做，而他们又和其他人一起旅行，那么和他们一起旅行的NPC就会建议立即进攻，这可能会扭转局势，或者至少能挽救许多人的生命。如果人物仍旧坐视这场战斗，他们会看到大约一半的攻击者在午夜时分离开，剩下的人在接下来的几个小时里分批撤退。当太阳升起时，即使是快速检查也会发现，超过一半的建筑物被严重损坏，镇上的许多财富被带走了。数以百计的伤员被挤进守卫所，或被发现躲在地窖里，但他们中的大多数人都能活下来。",
	"In the warm light of day, Governor Nighthill and other leaders want to know who was behind the attack on Greenest, and why the town was a target.

	"Governor Nighthill approaches the characters with a proposal: If they locate the raiders' camp and find out certain information, he offers to pay them 250 gp apiece. He wants to know where the camp is sited, how many raiders are there, who their leaders are, what's motivating these attacks, and where they plan to strike next. If characters recover valuables that were stolen from the town, he would like them returned, but he does his best to arrange a reward from what's left of the town treasury. Recovering treasure, however, is a lesser goal when compared to the other objectives he brings up.": "奈特希尔总督向这些人物提出了一个建议。如果他们找到突袭者的营地并找出某些信息，他愿意支付他们每人250金币。他想知道营地的位置，那里有多少掠夺者，他们的首领是谁，是什么促使了这些袭击，以及他们计划在哪里进行下一次袭击。如果人物找回了从镇上偷来的贵重物品，他希望这些物品能被归还，但他会尽力从镇上国库剩下的钱中安排奖励。然而，与他提出的其他目标相比，追回财宝是一个较小的目标。",

	"The raiders' path is easy to follow across the rolling grassland of the Greenfields. A wide swath of grass is trampled down, but it's impossible to determine the raiders' numbers precisely. The path only confirms what characters already know: there were a lot of them, and they were a mix of humans, kobolds, and trained reptiles. One bit of information can be gleaned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check: Many of the beasts' footprints are deeper on the retreat than they were on the approach march. They were weighed down with loot on the homeward-bound trip, but let players reach that conclusion on their own. It's not possible to tell from the confusing jumble of prints whether any specific footprints are those of prisoners.": "突击队员的道路在绿地的连绵不断的草地上很容易追踪。大片的草地被践踏，但不可能精确地确定突袭者的数量。这条路只是证实了人物已经知道的事情：他们有很多人，而且是人类、哥布林和受过训练的爬行动物的混合体。通过成功的DC15智慧（（%0%））检查，可以收集到一点信息。许多野兽的脚印在撤退时比在接近行军时更深。它们在归途中被战利品所拖累，但让玩家自己来得出这个结论。从混乱的脚印中无法判断是否有具体的脚印是囚犯的。",
	"The trail leads south about twelve miles, to a more rugged region where steep-sided, rocky plateaus replace the gently rolling hills. The land between the plateaus is largely flat, broken only by outcroppings and wandering streams in steep-sided gullies. The plateaus jut fifty to one hundred feet above their surroundings and are difficult to climb except where rock falls and subsidence created natural ramps. The crumbling sides of the plateaus are dotted with caves and tumbled boulder fields.": "这条小路向南走了大约12英里，来到一个更加崎岖的地区，这里陡峭的岩石高原取代了平缓的丘陵。高原之间的土地大体上是平坦的，只被陡峭的沟壑中的突起物和游荡的溪流所打破。高原比周围的环境高出50至100英尺，除了岩石坠落和沉降造成的天然坡道外，很难攀登。高原摇摇欲坠的两侧点缀着洞穴和翻滚的巨石场。",
	"Characters can have two encounters during this trip. The first is with a group of raiders who have straggled behind the main body. They are disorganized and quarrelsome, and they should be easy prey for alert adventurers. The second group is an organized rearguard watching specifically for pursuers from the town. They present a much graver threat.": "角色在这次旅行中可以有两次遭遇。第一次是与一群散落在大部队后面的突击队员相遇。他们没有组织，爱吵架，对于警觉的冒险者来说，他们应该是很容易的猎物。第二组是有组织的后卫，专门监视来自镇上的追兵。他们带来的威胁要严重得多。",

	"By observing for a few minutes, characters can discern that there are four human {@creature Cultist||cultists} and eight {@creature Kobold||kobolds} in the group. The kobolds and humans distrust each other, and although the cultists act as if they're the bosses, their leadership amounts to nothing more than ineffectual bullying. The humans' weapons are stacked against a rock, out of easy reach. The kobolds have their weapons on their belts.": "通过几分钟的观察，人物可以发现这群人中有四个人类（%0%）和八个（%1%）。哥布林人和人类彼此不信任，虽然邪教徒表现得好像他们是老大，但他们的领导力不过是无效的欺凌。人类的武器被堆放在岩石上，不容易拿到。哥布林人把他们的武器放在腰带上。",

	"If characters attack, then unless they give away their presence on purpose (by hailing the camp, for example), they gain a surprise round. The humans spend their first turns retrieving their weapons and shields. The kobolds drop their food and scatter, then regroup and counterattack on round four, using their slings as much as possible. They stick around and fight only as long as any of their human allies are still fighting. As soon as the humans are all defeated, the remaining kobolds slink away into the hills and aren't seen again.": "如果角色发动攻击，那么除非他们故意暴露自己的存在（例如呼唤营地），否则他们将获得一个突击回合。人类在第一轮中收回他们的武器和盾牌。哥布林扔掉食物，一哄而散，然后在第四回合重新集结并反击，尽可能地使用他们的弹弓。只要他们的人类盟友还在战斗，他们就会坚持战斗。一旦人类被打败，剩下的哥布林就会溜进山里，再也看不到了。",

They don't know how strong the rearguard will be, but they expect it is sited about a mile ahead where the path passes between rocky bluffs. They also can describe the raiders' camp and its location, plus they know some prisoners were taken from the town but not how many or whether they include a half-elf monk.

	"If the characters learn of the camp location and probable site of the rearguard from the stragglers, they can use that information to bypass this encounter entirely.

The best result for the characters is if the outpost checks in at the correct time with an \"all clear.\"": "如果角色们从散兵游勇那里得知了营地的位置和后卫的可能位置，他们就可以利用这些信息完全绕过这场遭遇战。事实上，这将是明智之举，因为这样可以避免一场破坏性的战斗，而且如果后卫被消灭了，邪教的领导人会想知道为什么他们从来没有回来报告。对人物来说，最好的结果是，前哨在正确的时间报到，\"一切正常\"。",
	"The rearguard consists of one {@creature veteran}, six {@creature Cultist||cultists}, and two {@creature Acolyte||acolytes}. The guard and cultists have spears for both ranged and melee combat. They are positioned in an area where the trail winds through a gap between two outcrops. The ambushers are hidden in the rocks, 12 to 15 feet above ground level.

	"If players state that they're watching for potential ambush spots, give them advantage when making these checks.": "如果玩家表示他们正在观察潜在的伏击点，那么在进行这些检查时，要给他们以优势。",
	"The rearguard has a twofold mission. It must stop any small party of intruders coming up the trail, or harass and delay a larger group while sending word to the camp that trouble approaches. The veteran decides that he has enough of an advantage against a party of five or six adventurers to deal with the problem on the spot, provided he doesn't weaken his force by sending a runner to {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}. If the adventuring group contains seven or more characters, you can either have the veteran harass the enemy and dispatch a runner to the camp, or you can add cultists until they outnumber the characters by two or three, then let the cultists make a stand.": "后卫有两方面的任务。它必须阻止任何小规模的入侵者走上山路，或者骚扰和拖延更大的队伍，同时向营地发出消息说麻烦正在靠近。老手决定，只要他不派跑腿的人去（%0%），他对五六个冒险者的队伍有足够的优势，可以当场处理问题。如果冒险团包含七个或更多的角色，你可以让老兵骚扰敌人，并派遣一个跑腿的人去营地，或者你可以增加邪教徒，直到他们的人数超过角色的两个或三个，然后让邪教徒们做出一个立场。",
	"If characters walk into the trap, the cultists tumble boulders onto them. Each character must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take {@dice 2d12} bludgeoning damage from falling rocks (half as much damage on a successful save). The boulder attack constitutes the cultists' surprise round. After that, they use ranged attacks until they are out of ammunition or the heroes force them into melee. Because they are positioned in the rocks above the characters, the cultists have three-quarters cover against attacks from below (+5 bonus to AC). To reach the foes, characters must scramble up the rocks.

	"These raiders are distinctly different from the earlier stragglers. All are dressed in similar (but not identical) black leather tunics with flared, black mantles. These are dedicated cultists. If captured, nothing less than a successful DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check can pry any information from them. Even with that, all they reveal is that they are initiates in the Cult of the Dragon, the names of their leaders ({@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}), and that the raid on Greenest was to collect treasure for dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} outranks the other leaders.": "这些突击队员与先前的散兵游勇明显不同。所有的人都穿着类似（但不完全相同）的黑色皮革外衣，披着黑色的斗篷。这些人是专门的邪教徒。如果被俘，除非成功地进行DC20魅力（（%0%））检查，否则无法从他们那里撬出任何信息。即使如此，他们也只能透露出他们是龙之崇拜的入门者，他们的领袖的名字（（%%1%）、（%%2%）和（%%3%）），以及对格林斯特的袭击是为了给龙收集宝藏。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的地位高于其他领导人。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. The cultists have no treasure, but their Cult of the Dragon outfits and weapons could be invaluable when characters try to get into the raiders' camp.": "为被击败的敌人奖励标准XP。邪教徒没有财宝，但是当人物试图进入突袭者的营地时，他们的神龙教服装和武器可能是无价之宝。",
	"The cultists have set up their camp in the hollow of a rocky plateau that's shaped roughly like a horseshoe. The lower portion of the plateau rises gently from the surrounding land, but it quickly steepens and ascends to a height of 150 feet above the landscape.

	"The cultists have built two guard towers at the camp, one at the entrance to the hollow and one atop the plateau. These towers are 20 feet high and made from rough timbers lashed together with rope. They are large enough for a few lookouts. The tower at the mouth of the hollow is manned by kobolds, while warriors man the one above. The guards have horns to blow when they must sound an alarm.": "邪教分子在营地建造了两座守卫塔，一座在空地的入口处，一座在高原之上。这些塔楼有20英尺高，由粗糙的木头用绳子捆绑而成。它们足够大，可供几名瞭望员使用。洞口的塔由哥布林看守，而上面的塔则由战士看守。守卫有喇叭，当他们必须发出警报时可以吹响。",
	"The cultists' prisoners are kept at area 1. Currently, only eight prisoners are in the camp, not counting Leosin. During the day, they are put to work under guard by four {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). At night, they are shackled to a post in their hut to prevent escape. The shackles are secured by a single chain and lock that can be opened with a key carried by one of the guards or with thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. The chain can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Five of the prisoners are from Greenest, and the other three are from earlier raids against hamlets and small farming villages to the south and east. There were more prisoners at one time, but many have died from overwork and mistreatment.

	"The sides of the plateau rise sharply, while the floor of the hollow slopes up gradually toward the east. A long ladder is lashed to the cliff so guards can reach the upper guard tower.": "高地的两侧急剧上升，而空洞的地面则逐渐向东倾斜。一条长梯被绑在悬崖上，以便守卫可以到达上面的警卫塔。",
	"The cliffs have handholds and footholds for climbing, so no die roll is needed under normal circumstances. If characters are in a hurry, a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check is needed to make the climb without falling. If characters are concerned about keeping quiet, then a successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check ensures that no rocks break loose and rattle down.": "悬崖上有用于攀爬的手掌和脚掌，所以在正常情况下不需要掷骰子。如果人物很匆忙，则需要成功地进行DC 10力量（（%0%））检查，以便在攀登过程中不掉下去。如果人物担心保持安静，那么需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，以确保没有岩石松动和响声。",
	"The raiders live in circular huts made from closely spaced wooden or bone poles covered in hide, mud, and sod. Huts vary in diameter from 10 feet to 25 feet, and in height from 5 feet to 10 feet. (Symbols on the map represent clusters of tents.) Those in the mouth of the hollow (level 1 on the map) are crudely built and decorated with animal skulls. These are occupied by kobolds. Cultists occupy the huts on level 2, which are sturdier, cleaner, and decorated with painted designs representing dragons. A few tents on level 2 are set aside for prisoners.": "袭击者住在圆形的小屋中，这些小屋由密密麻麻的木杆或骨杆制成，上面覆盖着兽皮、泥土和草皮。小屋的直径从10英尺到25英尺不等，高度从5英尺到10英尺。(地图上的符号代表帐篷群。）那些位于空洞口的帐篷（地图上的第一层）建造得很简陋，用动物头骨装饰。这些帐篷是由哥布林占据的。崇拜者占据了第二层的小屋，这些小屋更坚固，更干净，并装饰有代表龙的绘画图案。第二层的几个帐篷是为囚犯准备的。",

	"For the first day following the raid, the cultists are both elated with the outcome and exhausted. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} doesn't expect a serious challenge from the town, and slower members of the raiding party and walking wounded straggle into camp all through the day after the raid. The situation at the camp is confused and security is lax. Most of these raiders are mercenaries and bandits, and not even the dedicated cultists wear recognizable uniforms on raids. No one challenges latecomers for passwords or security signals. Put simply, the raiders are confident that no enemies followed them this far. Characters can walk straight into the camp without having their identities seriously challenged. In fact, the bolder they are, the more likely they are to blend right in.": "在突袭后的第一天，邪教徒们既对结果感到欣喜，又感到疲惫。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}没有想到镇上会有严重的挑战，突击队中速度较慢的成员和行走的伤员在突击后的一天里都在大摇大摆地进入营地。营地的情况很混乱，安全也很松懈。这些突袭者大多是雇佣兵和强盗，甚至连专职的邪教人员在突袭时也不穿可识别的制服。没有人向迟到的人挑战密码或安全信号。简单地说，突击队员们确信没有敌人跟到这么远。角色可以直接走进营地，而不会受到身份的严重质疑。事实上，他们越是大胆，就越有可能直接混进去。",
	"Players may be tempted to have characters seek cover and observe during the day and not attempt to enter the camp until nightfall. This can work, too, but sneaking around in the dark is more likely to attract suspicion than simply walking in as if they belong in the camp.": "玩家可能会想让角色在白天寻找掩护和观察，直到夜幕降临才试图进入营地。这也是可行的，但在黑暗中偷偷摸摸地走，比简单地走进去，好像他们属于这个营地，更容易引起怀疑。",
	"The chief risk is that someone might recognize the characters from the fighting at Greenest. Have each character make a DC 5 Charisma check. Success means no one remembers the character's face, but failure means that at some time (not necessarily immediately, but when recognition would be the most dramatic), someone in the camp recognizes the character. If characters are wearing Cult of the Dragon regalia taken from the rearguard, the characters have disadvantage on this roll because no one returning to camp at this time should be in uniform. The character who faced Cyanwrath one-on-one, however, has a -4 penalty to the roll. If that character ever comes face-to-face with the half-dragon, recognition is automatic.": "主要的风险是，有人可能会从Greenest的战斗中认出这些人物。让每个角色做一个DC 5的魅力检查。成功意味着没有人记得这个角色的脸，但失败意味着在某个时候（不一定是立即，但在认出的时候是最有戏剧性的），营地里有人认出了这个角色。如果角色穿着从后卫那里取来的神龙教的服装，那么角色在这个卷轴上有劣势，因为此时返回营地的人不应该穿着制服。然而，一对一面对Cyanwrath的角色，在这个卷子上有一个-4的惩罚。如果该角色与半龙人面对面，就会自动被认出。",
	"As the day wears on and the commotion winds down, the camp becomes calmer and better organized. Guards resume their normal routines. If characters haven't entered the camp before sundown of the first day, they find it more difficult, since there's very little traffic in and out of the camp on a normal day. They'll need a good story and a successful DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to walk past a guard station of five {@creature Guard||guards}. This check can be made only once for the group; they can't talk their way out of a failure. After the initial opportunity to enter the camp has passed, characters need to resort to stealth or subterfuge to get in. For example, characters scaling the plateau from the east could use brush for cover right up to where the cliff overlooks the camp. From there, they could observe or climb down the rocks under cover of darkness.": "随着时间的推移和骚乱的平息，营地变得更加平静和有组织。守卫们恢复了他们的正常生活。如果人物在第一天日落前没有进入营地，他们会发现更加困难，因为在正常情况下，进出营地的人很少。他们需要一个好的故事和成功的DC10魅力（（%0%））检查，才能走过一个五人（%1%）的警卫站。这个检定对这群人来说只能做一次；他们不能通过谈话来摆脱失败的命运。在进入营地的最初机会过去后，人物需要借助于隐身术或潜行术才能进入。例如，从东面爬上高原的人物可以利用灌木丛作掩护，一直到悬崖上俯瞰营地的地方。在那里，他们可以在黑暗的掩护下观察或爬下岩石。",
	"The whole camp goes on alert if the bodies of murdered human sentries or cultists are discovered. One dead kobold won't cause much alarm, but many dead kobolds will. If the camp goes on alert, every character must make a DC 15 Charisma check. A failure means the character has been spotted as a stranger and an infiltrator. Someone raises the hue and cry, which quickly draws a crowd. A roll of 10 or lower means someone has recognized the character from the fight in Greenest. The characters have a chance to get away if they immediately go on the attack and begin cutting their way out of camp, but if they delay or spin tales, a crowd of {@creature Cultist||cultists} that outnumbers them five to one surrounds them.": "如果发现被谋杀的人类哨兵或邪教分子的尸体，整个营地都会进入警戒状态。一个死亡的哥布林不会引起太大的恐慌，但许多死亡的哥布林会。如果营地进入警戒状态，每个角色都必须进行DC15魅力检查。失败意味着该角色已经被发现是一个陌生人和一个潜入者。有人提高了呼声，这很快吸引了一群人。10分或更低的分数意味着有人在Greenest的战斗中认出了这个角色。如果人物立即出击，开始切出营地，就有机会逃脱，但如果他们拖延或编造故事，就会有一群人数比他们多五倍的（%0%）的人包围他们。",
	"If characters try to estimate numbers in the camp, they count roughly one hundred kobolds and a mix of bandits, guards, and cultists totaling about eighty—effectively an unlimited supply if characters get the idea of fighting them all.": "如果人物试图估计营地里的人数，他们会发现大约有一百个哥布林和混合的强盗、卫兵和邪教徒，总数约为八十人，如果人物有与他们全部战斗的想法，那么实际上是无限的供应。",
	"If caught, characters are disarmed, their hands are tied, and they are brought before {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} for judgment. One by one, she asks them who they are, where they came from, and what they're doing in her camp.": "如果被抓到，人物会被解除武装，双手被绑，并被带到（%0%）面前接受审判。她一个一个地问他们是谁，从哪里来，在她的营地里做什么。",
	"If anyone was recognized from the fighting in Greenest, it doesn't matter what the characters say. Mondath sentences all of them to be executed on the morrow, after spending the night tied to posts alongside the monk Leosin. Characters have one night to escape this fate. They might wriggle out of their bonds, bribe or charm a cultist to set them free, or come up with a clever use for a cantrip. If all else fails, Leosin reveals that he has a hidden knife with which they can cut themselves free.": "如果有人在格林斯特的战斗中被认出，那么人物说什么都不重要。蒙达斯判处他们所有人在明天被处死，在与僧侣Leosin一起被绑在柱子上过夜。角色们有一个晚上的时间来逃避这个命运。他们可能会挣脱束缚，贿赂或施展魅力让邪教分子放他们自由，或者想出一个巧妙的法术用途。如果其他方法都失败了，Leosin会透露他有一把隐藏的刀，他们可以用它来解救自己。",
	"If characters admit they came from Greenest and are enemies of the cult, the effect is the same as if they'd been recognized.": "如果人物承认他们来自格林尼斯特，是邪教的敌人，其效果与他们被认出来一样。",
	"If characters lie to Mondath—claiming they are new recruits and this is all a mistake, for example, or that they are studying the cult before deciding whether to join—then compare their Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks to Mondath's Wisdom check to determine whether she believes them. You can allow advantage or disadvantage on the roll when someone's lies are especially plausible or implausible. Match die rolls individually for every character. Those who Mondath believes are set free, but watched and stopped if they try to leave the camp. Those who Mondath does not believe are sentenced to die as above.": "如果角色对Mondath撒谎--比如说，声称他们是新成员，这都是个错误，或者说他们在决定是否加入之前正在研究邪教--那么将他们的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查与Mondath的智慧检查进行比较，以确定她是否相信他们。当某人的谎言特别可信或不可信时，你可以在掷骰子时允许优势或劣势。为每个角色单独匹配掷骰子的次数。那些蒙达斯相信的人被释放，但如果他们试图离开营地，会被监视和阻止。那些蒙达斯不相信的人将被判处死刑，如上所述。",
	"Characters can learn much from poking around in the camp. If the characters pose as cult members, they can speak to other cultists and question them (carefully) about the cult's plans and long-term goals. Most cultists should be treated as indifferent when determining reactions or trying to gain a favor. Kobolds are less helpful and should be considered hostile when characters make Charisma checks to gauge their reaction.": "角色可以从营地里的打探中了解到很多东西。如果角色冒充邪教成员，他们可以与其他邪教成员交谈，并询问他们（仔细）关于邪教的计划和长期目标。在确定反应或试图获得好感时，大多数邪教人员应被视为无动于衷。哥布林的帮助较少，当角色进行魅力检查以判断他们的反应时，应被视为有敌意。",
	"Characters can learn the following information through observation and questioning. They need to be careful, however, not to attract attention for asking too many questions or poking their noses into things that are none of their business. Any time they come off as \"too nosy,\" feel free to call for another Charisma check to see whether someone recognizes them from Greenest.": "角色可以通过观察和询问了解以下信息。然而，他们需要小心，不要因为问太多问题或对与自己无关的事情刨根问底而引起注意。如果他们表现得 \"太爱管闲事\"，可以随时要求再做一次魅力检查，看看是否有人认出了他们来自格林斯特。",

	"In fact, it wasn't luck at all, at least not for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. Leosin had studied their previous attacks and concluded that the time was right for the cult to strike a bigger target, and he knew that Greenest was prosperous yet poorly defended, making it the most likely next target. So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult's plans and the location of their camp. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.": "事实上，这根本不是运气，至少对（%0%）来说不是。Leosin研究了他们之前的攻击，并得出结论，邪教打击更大目标的时机已经成熟，他知道Greenest镇很繁荣，但防守却很差，这使它成为最有可能的下一个目标。因此，当他认为时机差不多的时候，他访问了这个小镇，打算在这里待到事情发生。他的观察得到了回报，利奥辛在夜里与他的人分开，并在突袭者撤退时落入他们之中，希望能了解更多关于邪教的计划和他们营地的位置。太阳升起后，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}发现了他，这个和尚很快被制服并被俘。",
	"That portion of Leosin's scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed above under \"Exploring the Camp.\" Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he's in a very poor physical state.": "利奥辛的这部分计划取得了合理的效果。他现在知道上面 \"探索营地 \"项下所列的大部分信息。对他来说，不幸的是，囚禁比他预期的更残酷，虽然他的头脑和意志仍然很坚强，但他的身体状况非常糟糕。",
	"Despite the danger, Leosin isn't entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he's willing to take the risk. He's too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that's what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don't bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.": "尽管有危险，但如果有人物来解救他，Leosin并不完全高兴。他相信自己可以学到更多东西，他愿意冒这个险。然而，他太软弱了，无法抵抗，所以如果他们想这么做的话，人物可以轻易地违背他的意愿把他带走。他可以在没有援助的情况下以20英尺的速度移动，并以平民身份战斗，在攻击卷上处于劣势。如果人物不把他带出营地，Leosin就会自己挣脱。他后来拒绝谈论此事。",
	"If characters are captured and imprisoned alongside Leosin and their attempts to escape fall through, he reveals that he has a small knife hidden in his boot. They can use it to cut their bonds. Leosin's absence is noticed within five minutes if he is taken away, and an alarm goes up throughout the camp. Rigging up a dummy in his place delays the discovery by twenty minutes. Tying up a dead or {@condition unconscious} cultist (preferably a half-elf) in his place assures the intruders a two-hour head start before the escape is noticed.": "如果人物被抓，与Leosin一起被囚禁，而他们试图逃跑的努力失败了，他就会透露他的靴子里藏有一把小刀。他们可以用它来切断他们的束缚。如果Leosin被带走，他在五分钟内就会被发现，整个营地都会发出警报。在他的位置上装上一个假人，可以推迟20分钟被发现。在他的位置上绑上一个死人或（%0%）邪教徒（最好是半精灵），可以保证入侵者在逃跑被发现前有两个小时的时间。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter does not involve many fights, but it does present many challenges, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them and add to them as you see fit. Characters can reach 3rd level if they act prudently and capitalize on all the opportunities the camp offers, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。这一章的战斗不多，但确实提出了许多挑战，人物克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整和补充。如果角色谨慎行事并利用营地提供的所有机会，他们可以达到第三级，但这并不是他们必须这样做。",
	"If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 3rd level when they complete this chapter.": "如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，那么人物在完成本章时就达到了第三级。",
	"For getting into and out of the cultists' camp without causing an alarm or being caught: 100 XP per character.": "在不引起警报或被抓的情况下进出邪教组织的营地：每个角色100XP。",
	"For getting into and out of the cultists' camp without stirring any suspicion: an additional 100 XP per character.": "在不引起任何怀疑的情况下进出邪教分子的营地：每个角色增加100XP。",
	"For rescuing Leosin: 250 XP per character.": "因为救出了利奥辛：每个角色250XP。",
	"For leaving a dummy or decoy in Leosin's place: an additional 50 XP per character.": "对于在Leosin的位置上留下一个假人或诱饵：每个角色增加50XP。",
	"For rescuing other prisoners: 25 XP for each prisoner brought out of the camp alive.": "救出其他囚犯：每活着带出营地的囚犯有25XP。",
	"For each piece of information listed under \"Exploring the Camp\" that characters learn on their own (not from Leosin): 25 XP per character.": "在 \"探索营地 \"下所列的每一条信息，如果是人物自己学到的（不是从Leosin那里）：每个人物25XP。",
	"When the characters arrive safely back at Greenest—presumably with Leosin in tow—he can fill them in on any details they missed during their investigation of the cult's camp. The monks who accompanied him are delighted to see him alive, and the families of any other released prisoners are equally grateful for the return of their loved ones. Governor Nighthill pays the characters their promised 250 gp each and publicly praises their courage and daring.": "当人物安全地回到格林斯特时--估计是在Leosin的陪同下--他可以把他们在调查邪教营地时遗漏的任何细节都告诉他们。陪同他的僧侣们很高兴看到他还活着，其他被释放的囚犯的家人也同样对他们的亲人回来表示感谢。奈特希尔总督向这些人物支付了他们承诺的每人250金币，并公开赞扬他们的勇气和胆量。",
	"After his experience in captivity, Leosin needs several days to recover. When he's healthy again, he intends to travel north to Elturel to convey what he's learned to {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, a paladin of Torm who shares his concern over the Cult of the Dragon's recent surge in activity. He has a favor to ask of the characters.": "在被囚禁的经历之后，利奥辛需要几天时间来恢复。当他恢复健康后，他打算前往北方的艾尔图勒，将他所学到的东西传达给{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}，这位托尔姆的圣骑士与他一样对龙之教最近的活动激增感到担忧。他有一个要求，就是请这些人物帮忙。",
	"\"After all you've done already for me personally and for the people of Greenest, I hate to ask anything more from you. But the need is great, and I dare to hope that you can aid me one time more. I need you to return to the cultists' camp. You know your way around it now. If the cultists are preparing to conduct another raid, or a large body of them marches away, or if anything substantial is carried into or out of that cave, I need to know. If you have a chance to get into the camp and look around again, that would be the ideal way to spot anything that's changed.": "\"在你已经为我个人和Greenest的人们做了那么多事之后，我不想再向你要求什么。但需求是巨大的，我敢于希望你能再援助我一次。我需要你回到邪教分子的营地。你现在知道怎么走了。如果邪教分子准备进行另一次突袭，或者他们中的一大批人行军离开，或者如果有什么实质性的东西被带进或带出那个洞穴，我都需要知道。如果你有机会进入营地，再看看周围，这将是发现任何变化的理想方式。",
	"\"I don't recommend letting yourselves get captured,\" he adds with a wry smile.": "\"我不建议让你们自己被抓，\"他狡黠地笑着补充道。",
	"If the characters were working as caravan guards, Leosin offers to match whatever their previous employer was paying them plus 20 percent. If they are currently unemployed, he offers them 150 gp apiece. He's willing to haggle; this mission is important, and no one else is available who Leosin believes can handle it. If the characters accept, he tells them to find him at the city of Elturel afterward, both to report and to collect their pay. If he has moved on before they reach the city, they can speak to the paladin {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} instead.": "如果这些人物以前是商队守卫，Leosin会提供与他们以前的雇主所支付的报酬相当的报酬，外加20%。如果他们目前没有工作，他就给他们每人150戈比。他愿意讨价还价；这个任务很重要，而且没有人可以让Leosin相信他能胜任。如果这些人物接受了，他告诉他们之后到Elturel城找他，既要报告又要领取报酬。如果在他们到达城市之前他已经离开了，他们可以和圣骑士（%0%）谈谈。",
	"The monk doesn't believe it's essential that the characters head back to the camp immediately. He doesn't expect the cultists to make any sudden changes in their plans or mode of operation. Leosin is wrong about this, because he doesn't realize how much his presence in Greenest alarmed the wyrmspeaker. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows that Leosin is investigating the Cult of the Dragon, but she doesn't know whether the monk's appearance in Greenest was a coincidence, a good guess, or a sign that the cult's whole plan has been compromised. She isn't willing to take chances: she's heading north with the accumulated treasure immediately.": "和尚认为人物立即返回营地并不是必须的。他并不指望邪教分子会突然改变他们的计划或行动方式。Leosin在这一点上是错误的，因为他没有意识到他在Greenest的出现让wyrmspeaker感到多么震惊。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}知道Leosin正在调查神龙教，但她不知道这个和尚在Greenest的出现是一个巧合，一个好的猜测，还是预示着神龙教的整个计划已经被破坏了。她不愿意冒险：她要立即带着积累的财宝向北走。",
	"When characters return to the camp area, they find it mostly abandoned. (If they stayed, they witnessed the rapid packing up and abandonment of the camp.) The stinking huts of the kobolds (those on level 1) have been burned, but the level 2 huts and both guard towers remain. Anyone can determine from tracks that the cultists trekked away in small groups in all directions. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that most of the camp's wagons and pack animals moved in a train toward the west.": "当人物回到营地区域时，他们发现营地大多被遗弃。(如果他们留下来，他们就目睹了营地的快速收拾和遗弃。） 臭气熏天的哥布林小屋（1层的那些）已经被烧毁，但2层的小屋和两个警卫塔还在。任何人都可以从足迹中判断出，邪教徒们分批向各个方向跋涉离开。成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以发现，营地的大部分马车和驮运的牲畜都在一列火车中向西移动。",
	"Still left in the camp are some hunters, the kobolds who tend the dragon nursery in the caves, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, her guards, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}. Only the hunters still use the huts. All others live in the hatchery cave. The activity and guards around the cave mouth should be the top draw on the characters' attention.": "营地里还剩下一些猎人、在山洞里照看龙苗的哥布林、{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}、她的卫兵和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}。只有猎人还在使用木屋。其他所有人都住在孵化室的洞穴里。洞口周围的活动和守卫应该是最吸引人物注意力的地方。",
	"On most mornings, hunters fan out onto the grassland to hunt for antelope and other large game. They travel on horseback and bring along an extra horse to pack the field-dressed game back to the camp. Hunters don't necessarily return to the camp every evening. They stay out until they have a load of meat to bring back. Hunting on the Greenfields is good, so they seldom need to spend more than a night or two away. Four {@creature Scout||scouts} act as hunters; roll a {@dice d4} to determine how many are in the camp when characters arrive. They are not dedicated cultists, so they won't challenge characters who enter the camp, attack them, or even alert the cultists. They consider standing guard to be beneath them.": "在大多数的早晨，猎人在草原上打猎，寻找羚羊和其他大型动物。他们在马背上行走，并带着一匹额外的马，把穿戴整齐的猎物带回营地。猎人不一定每天晚上都要回到营地。他们一直在外面，直到有一车肉可以带回来。绿原上的狩猎情况很好，所以他们很少需要在外面过一两个晚上。四个{@creature Scout||scouts}充当猎人；当角色到达时，掷一个{@dice d4}来决定有多少人在营地里。他们不是专门的邪教徒，所以他们不会挑战进入营地的人物，不会攻击他们，甚至不会提醒邪教徒。他们认为站岗是在他们之下。",
	"They are a taciturn bunch, so they won't be much help to inquisitive characters. They converse more freely with rangers, but to most strangers they merely nod, point, shake their heads, scowl, and utter one- or two-word answers. If characters converse with them, these hunters can relate how the camp dissolved within hours after the discovery of the captured half-elf's escape. Crates carried from the cave were loaded onto wagons or animals and hauled to the west. A few raiders remain in the cave: the Wearer of Purple (Mondath), the \"dragon-man\" (Cyanwrath), the better warriors, and the \"dragon-dogs\" (kobolds). As long as the cultists pay well for fresh meat, the trackers continue hunting for them. Whatever else the cave holds is none of their concern.": "他们是一群沉默寡言的人，所以他们对好奇的人没有什么帮助。他们与游骑兵交谈时比较随意，但对于大多数陌生人，他们只是点头、指点、摇头、皱眉，并说出一两个字的答案。如果人物与他们交谈，这些猎人可以讲述营地是如何在发现被俘的半精灵逃跑后的几个小时内解散的。从山洞里搬运出来的箱子被装上马车或牲口，拉到了西部。少数突袭者仍留在洞穴中：穿紫衣的人（Mondath）、\"龙人\"（Cyanwrath）、更好的战士和 \"龙狗\"（kobolds）。只要邪教徒们为新鲜的肉付出丰厚的代价，追踪者们就会继续为他们狩猎。不管洞穴里还有什么，都与他们无关。",
	"A thorough search of the camp takes about ten man-hours. Allow characters to make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check after the first hour. A successful roll means the character realizes that while quite a bit of material has been left behind, it's all trash: cracked pottery, rusty knives, soiled clothing and bedding, cheap cookware, and wine that's gone to vinegar. Some of it might be of use to the people of Greenest who lost everything in fires, but it has no value as treasure.": "对营地进行彻底的搜索需要大约10个工时。允许角色在第一小时后进行智慧（（%0%））检查。成功的检查意味着角色意识到，虽然留下了相当多的材料，但都是垃圾：破裂的陶器、生锈的刀子、弄脏的衣服和被褥、廉价的炊具，还有已经变成醋的酒。有些东西可能对在火灾中失去一切的格林斯特人有用，但它没有作为宝藏的价值。",
	"The only thing of interest remaining in the camp is the cave itself (area 4 on the map of the camp), which characters can see from the camp. There, characters find the cultists who stayed behind, a clutch of dragon eggs, the special cadre of kobolds who tend the eggs—and the many traps the kobolds set to defend their home. These eggs are important to the cult, but they were deemed too near to hatching to be moved safely. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} left them with what she believed was an adequate guard force under {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}.": "营地里唯一有意义的东西是洞穴本身（营地地图上的第4区），角色可以从营地里看到它。在那里，角色们发现了留下来的邪教人员、一窝龙蛋、照顾龙蛋的特殊哥布林干部以及哥布林为保卫家园而设置的许多陷阱。这些龙蛋对邪教很重要，但它们被认为太接近孵化而无法安全移动。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}把它们留给了她认为是足够的护卫力量的{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}手下。",
	"Cavern ceilings are 15 feet high. Ceilings in the humans' chambers ({@area areas 11|0ce|x}, {@area 12|0d1|x}, and {@area 13|0d3|x}) are 10 feet high.": "洞穴的天花板有15英尺高。人类的房间（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））的天花板是10英尺高。",
	"During daytime, areas {@area 1|0af|x} and {@area 2|0b0|x} are brightly lit, and areas{@area  3|0b1|x} and {@area 4|0b4|x} are dimly lit by outside light.

	"The caverns are filled with faint sounds: dripping water, scratching rodents, scrabbling lizards, wind moaning across the entrance. These normal underground sounds camouflage the clanks, thuds, coughs, and speech of the kobolds and cultists. Sound echoes well along the main chamber (areas 1–5), so a fight in any of these can be heard in the others. Elsewhere, normal sounds echo confusingly and are lost in the background noise. The sound of a scream carries a long distance, however, and the sound of a fight travels through 30 feet of tunnel and attracts attention if the fight lasts more than 3 rounds.": "洞穴里充满了微弱的声音：滴水声、啮齿动物的抓挠声、蜥蜴的抓挠声、风在入口处的呻吟声。这些正常的地下声音掩盖了哥布林和邪教徒们的叮当声、砰砰声、咳嗽声和说话声。声音在主室（1-5区）中回响良好，因此在其中任何一个区域的战斗都可以在其他区域听到。在其他地方，正常的声音回声很混乱，并在背景噪音中消失。然而，尖叫的声音可以传得很远，战斗的声音可以穿过30英尺的隧道，如果战斗持续超过3个回合，就会引起注意。",
	"Kobolds move freely through the caverns, going about their business. Characters have a chance to randomly encounter these wandering kobolds. Roll a {@dice d6} every time characters enter or re-enter {@area areas 3|0b1|x} to {@area 10|0c8|x}. On a roll of 1, monsters are present. Roll on the table to determine what they meet.

Be sure to make this roll before characters enter the area, because both groups have a chance to gain surprise.": "哥布林在洞穴中自由移动，做着自己的事情。角色有机会随机遇到这些游荡的哥布林。每次人物进入或重新进入{@area areas 3|0b1|x}至{@area 10|0c8|x}时，都要掷出{@dice d6}。掷到1时，怪物就会出现。在表格上滚动，以确定他们遇到的是什么。这些随机遇到的怪物会加到区域描述中提到的任何生物上。一定要在人物进入该地区之前进行这个掷骰，因为两组人都有机会获得惊喜。",
	"The entrance to the cave is broad and tall, but the ceiling quickly lowers to a height of 15 feet. Standing guard inside the entrance are two {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). They position themselves about 30 feet inside the cave and stay near the walls and the column, so that while they aren't hidden, they aren't conspicuous, either. Characters who observe the cave from a distance—from the area of the plateau where the steps ascend from level 1 to level 2, for example—spot one of the dragonclaws.": "洞穴的入口宽阔高大，但天花板很快就降低到15英尺的高度。在入口处站岗的是两个（%0%）（见（%1%））。他们的位置在洞内约30英尺处，靠近墙壁和柱子，所以虽然他们没有被隐藏，但也不显眼。从远处观察洞穴的角色--例如从台阶从第一层上升到第二层的地方--发现了一只龙爪。",
	"If characters approach openly through the camp, the dragonclaws spot them automatically and retreat toward area 2 in the cave, to set up an ambush. If characters approach the cave quietly from the sides, they won't be spotted. They then have a chance to surprise the dragonclaws.": "如果角色公开地通过营地接近，龙爪会自动发现他们，并向洞穴中的2号区域撤退，以设下伏击。如果角色从侧面悄悄地接近洞穴，他们就不会被发现。这样他们就有机会给龙爪们一个惊喜。",
	"If the guards at the entrance spotted the characters' approach, they wait here until the characters come into view, then try to spring an ambush. Determine surprise normally.": "如果入口处的卫兵发现了人物的接近，他们就会在这里等待，直到人物进入视野，然后试图发动一场伏击。正常情况下，判断出奇制胜。",
	"The passage at the end of this alcove is deeply shadowed and hidden by a cleverly cut fold in the rock. It's obvious to anyone who walks to the end of the alcove, but from elsewhere in the cavern, it can be spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "这个洞穴尽头的通道有很深的阴影，被岩石上巧妙切割的褶皱所隐藏。对任何走到洞穴尽头的人来说，这都是显而易见的，但从洞穴的其他地方，只有在成功通过DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查后才能发现它。",

	"Nothing distinguishes the paths to casual inspection. The path on the right is flanked by four {@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}, while the path on the left is free of these dangerous growths. The violet fungi can be spotted among all the other mushrooms with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, but only from the base of the steps, not from atop the ledge. Likewise, a careful inspection of the path reveals that only the left trail sees heavy use.": "没有任何东西可以将这两条路区分开来。右边的路两侧有四个{@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}，而左边的路则没有这些危险的植物。在所有其他的蘑菇中，只要成功地进行DC15智力（（%1%））检查，就可以发现紫色的真菌，但只能从台阶的底部，而不是从壁架的顶部。同样地，仔细检查这条路可以发现，只有左边的小路被大量使用。",
	"The stairs are constructed so that the lowest steps collapse into a ramp that dumps a character right at the base of the violet fungi. Roll any die as each character descends the steps; on an odd roll, the character triggers the trap.

The kobolds and guards know where to avoid stepping, of course.": "楼梯的构造是这样的：最低的台阶会坍塌成一个斜坡，将一个角色扔在紫罗兰真菌的底部。每个角色在下台阶时都要掷骰子；如果掷出奇数，角色就会触发陷阱。一个在楼梯上积极寻找陷阱的角色可以通过成功的DC15智慧（（%0%））检查找到被困住的台阶。当然，哥布林和守卫知道哪里可以避免踩踏。",
	"Some fungus from area 3 dots this area, but chiefly it is the lair of a colony of bats. Hidden among the bats are ten {@creature Stirge||stirges}.

Normally the stirges prey on the plentiful bats and leave the cave's other residents alone, but not always.": "第三区的一些真菌点缀着这个区域，但主要是一个蝙蝠群的巢穴。隐藏在蝙蝠中的有10只（%0%）。蝙蝠只在日出至日落时分出现，但海马总是在这里。通常情况下，海马捕食大量的蝙蝠，而不去管洞里的其他居民，但并非总是如此。",
	"Characters notice dead bats on the floor (victims of the stirges). If that causes someone to look up, describe how the ceiling is carpeted with bats with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. To avoid startling the bats, characters must proceed very quietly. This requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If three or more characters fail the check, the bats are alarmed by the noise, drop from the ceiling, and fly through the cavern in a blinding cloud of flapping and squeaking rodents. The bats present no danger, but their racket drowns out other noise and makes it impossible to see more than 5 feet. It also alerts the stirges, and the opportunistic bloodsuckers attack in the confusion. The stirges gain a +2 bonus to AC in the bat storm.": "角色注意到地板上的蝙蝠尸体（搅拌器的受害者）。如果这引起了某人的注意，可以用成功的DC 10智慧（（%0%））检查来描述天花板上是如何铺满蝙蝠的。为了避免惊动这些蝙蝠，人物必须非常安静地前进。这需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查。如果三个或更多的角色没有通过检定，蝙蝠就会被噪音惊动，从天花板上掉下来，并在一团耀眼的拍打和吱吱作响的啮齿动物中飞过洞穴。蝙蝠没有危险，但它们的喧闹声淹没了其他噪音，使人无法看到5英尺以上的地方。它也惊动了海燕，而这些投机取巧的吸血动物在混乱中发动了攻击。在蝙蝠风暴中，海蜇获得了+2的交流奖励。",

Along with normal sorts of refuse, such as broken pottery, rotted baskets, and mouse-chewed rope, they've also thrown out items that appear useful from a distance: discarded clothes, worn boots, tattered books, cracked lamps, and so forth. Some of these items came from prisoners who died, and others were taken in treasure raids and later deemed to be unworthy of Tiamat.

The strips are fixed to the ceiling and are long enough to drag on the floor. The curtain extends from wall to wall. The leather comes from a variety of local animals and is badly cured. The curtain is several layers thick with no gaps, so you can't see through it at all.": "在这些陡峭的下行台阶的底部，有一块帘子挂在通道上。它是由数百条沉重的皮条制成的，每条皮条大约有人手的宽度。这些皮条被固定在天花板上，长到可以拖在地板上。帘子从墙上延伸到墙上。皮革来自于当地的各种动物，并且经过了严重的腌制。帘子有好几层厚，没有缝隙，所以你根本看不透它。",
	"This cavern is naturally cold. It hovers a few degrees above freezing year round, regardless of the season. Much of the meat brought in by the hunters feeds the cultists and the kobolds, but the extra is stored here for eventual use when the dragon eggs hatch and the ravenous hatchlings emerge. The carcasses range from very fresh to several months old. The meat is only cold, not frozen, so the older items are slowly going bad.": "这个岩洞是自然寒冷的。无论什么季节，它全年都在冰点以上几度徘徊。猎人们带来的大部分肉都喂养了邪教徒和哥布林，但多余的肉被储存在这里，以便在龙蛋孵化和贪婪的幼龙出现时最终使用。尸体从非常新鲜到几个月大的都有。这些肉只是冷的，而不是冷冻的，所以老的东西会慢慢变坏。",
	"The smell of old blood assaults your nose. The floor is covered with dried puddles of it. Four floor-to-ceiling columns are spaced across the chamber, and chains have been strung between them like clothesline. Animal carcasses hang on hooks from the chains. You see gutted and skinned antelope, deer, goats, what might be big cats, and even a few small bears. Some of this meat has been here for a while if the smell is a reliable indicator.": "旧血的气味袭击了你的鼻子。地板上布满了干涸的水坑。四根从地板到天花板的柱子横跨整个房间，铁链像晾衣绳一样被串在它们之间。动物的尸体挂在铁链的钩子上。你看到被开膛破肚的羚羊、鹿、山羊、可能是大猫的东西，甚至还有几只小熊。如果气味是一个可靠的指标，这些肉有些已经在这里有一段时间了。",

	"A careful inspection of the leather strips coupled with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds barbs; they can't be noticed otherwise. When kobolds use this stairway, they bring the ruined spear that's kept in{@area  area 4|0b4|x}. With it, they sweep the leather strips to the left side of the corridor and wedge the end of the spear shaft into an angled socket in the floor just inside area 6. This holds the leather strips safely out of the way while they move in and out of the chamber.": "仔细检查皮条，再加上成功的DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以发现倒刺；否则就不会被发现。当哥布林使用这个楼梯的时候，他们会带上放在{@area  area 4|0b4|x}的废旧长矛。他们用它把皮条扫到走廊的左边，然后把矛杆的一端楔入6号区域内地板上的一个斜面插座。在他们进出密室的时候，这样可以将皮条安全地挡住。",

Every surface glistens with moisture, and the air is warm and humid. The flat walls of the chamber are decorated with shallow abstract carvings of dragons. Dragons' tails coil into intricate patterns and knots that flow across the walls. The creature portrayed in the northwest corner stands out: a five-headed dragon, rising from an erupting volcano. Other dragons, which seem dwarfed by the five-headed monstrosity, flock to its side. A small, wooden chest with silver and mother-of-pearl inlays sits on the floor in the corner, in front of the monstrous dragon carving.": "这个密室在原来的基础上进行了扩建和重塑。地板和三面墙壁都很光滑，钟乳石和石笋都被打磨成闪闪发光的柱子。每一个表面都闪烁着水汽，空气温暖而湿润。密室的平坦墙壁上装饰着浅浅的龙的抽象雕刻。龙的尾巴卷成复杂的图案和结，在墙壁上流动。西北角所描绘的生物非常突出：一条五头龙，从喷发的火山中升起。其他的龙，在五头怪兽面前显得相形见绌，纷纷涌向它的身边。角落里的地板上放着一个镶嵌着银色和珍珠母的小木箱，就在那条巨龙雕刻的前面。",

Inside are a string of pearls (300 gp), a gold-and-sapphire ring (900 gp), and a pouch containing a half-dozen masterfully cut and polished precious stones (100 gp each). The ring and the pearls were taken from Greenest and would be recognized by anyone from there, but the stones came from elsewhere and would be difficult to identify.

	"This chamber holds three eggs that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} hoped to hatch into a new brood of dragons. They have not hatched yet but they will very soon, which is why {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} was unwilling to move them when the camp packed up and left.

	"The lower portion of the room (10A) is 15 feet below the ledge. Wooden steps have been built down to the lower floor. As in room 7, the steps are enclosed in a stout iron cage with a gate at the bottom. The key to the gate hangs on a wall peg opposite the top of the stairs.

	"Mixed in among the stalactites near the southeast corner of the room is an unusual {@creature roper} that can speak Common. It doesn't attack the kobolds or guard drakes because the kobolds feed it spoiled meat that the guard drakes won't eat. If attacked, it fights back (and it's very dangerous to 3rd-level characters!). It can reach anywhere in area 10 with its tentacles, and it can also move at speed 10. It is currently full and curious about strangers, however, so it's not averse to talking. Its only real concern is food. If told about the supply of meat in area 6 and brought some as proof, It leaves the characters along while it creeps away to investigate the larder.": "在房间东南角附近的钟乳石中混杂着一种不寻常的（%0%），能说普通话。它不攻击哥布林或护卫德拉克，因为哥布林喂它吃变质的肉，而护卫德拉克则不吃。如果被攻击，它就会反击（而且它对3级的角色非常危险！）。它的触手可以到达10号区域的任何地方，它也可以以10号速度移动。不过，它目前已经吃饱了，对陌生人很好奇，所以它不排斥说话。它唯一真正关心的是食物。如果被告知第6区有肉类供应，并带来一些作为证据，它就会把人物留在身边，而自己则悄悄地去调查储藏室。",
	"A total of three dragon eggs are spread throughout the area. Each is about three feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Two of them are easy to spot just by walking through the room with a light source. The third is tucked into a pile of similar-colored stones behind one of the columns, making it easy to miss. When characters search the room, have everyone make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Only a character who rolls 15 or higher notices the egg in its camouflaged nest. Looking at a dragon egg, a character can determine the color of dragon with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check.": "共有三个龙蛋分布在整个地区。每一个都大约有三英尺高，重达150磅。其中两个只要在有光源的房间里走动就很容易发现。第三颗则藏在其中一根柱子后面的一堆类似颜色的石头里，很容易错过。当人物搜索房间时，让每个人都做一个智慧（（%0%））检查。只有掷出15分或更高分数的人物才会注意到在其伪装的巢穴中的蛋。观察龙蛋，角色可以通过成功的DC10智力（（%1%））检查来确定龙的颜色。",
	"If the eggs are left here, they hatch in less than a week. If they are taken away, whether they hatch depends on how they are stored and treated. Away from a warm, humid environment such as this chamber, their progress halts until they are again in a suitable incubator. The dragons can be killed easily if the eggs are smashed, crushed, or stabbed. If an egg is simply cracked open, the infant dragon struggles for breath, cries and squirms like a human baby for a few minutes, and then dies.": "如果鸡蛋被留在这里，它们在不到一周的时间内就会孵化。如果它们被带走，它们是否孵化取决于它们的储存和处理方式。离开了像这个房间这样温暖潮湿的环境，它们的进展就会停止，直到它们再次进入一个合适的孵化器。如果鸡蛋被砸碎、压碎或刺伤，龙就很容易被杀死。如果鸡蛋被简单地敲开，幼龙会挣扎着呼吸，像人类婴儿一样哭闹，蠕动几分钟，然后死亡。",
	"The floor of this area is about 10 feet below the ledge. The four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} who tend the eggs hid in this depression when they heard the fight break out in area 9. When characters approach within 25 feet of the ledge overlooking 10B (when they come in line with the top of the stairs to 10A), two kobolds toss glue bombs and the other two toss fire bombs. They do the same thing on the next round. Then they wait a round or two, if possible, while the roper in area 10A drags characters into its tentacles, bites them, or drops them 20 feet to the guard drakes.": "这个区域的地面比壁架低约10英尺。照顾鸡蛋的四个人（%0%）在听到第9区的战斗爆发时躲在这个凹陷处。当角色接近俯瞰10B的窗台25英尺范围内时（当他们与通往10A的楼梯顶端一致时），两个哥布林扔出胶水炸弹，另外两个扔出火焰炸弹。他们在下一回合做同样的事情。然后他们等待一两轮，如果可能的话，当10A区的罗布人把人物拖进它的触角，咬他们，或者把他们丢到20英尺外的守卫德拉克。",
	"Each creature within 10 feet of the bomb's target point must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition restrained}. The target or another creature within reach of it can use an action to make a DC 11 Strength check; if the check succeeds, the effect on the target ends.": "炸弹目标点10英尺内的每个生物都必须在DC11灵巧判定中成功，否则会被（%0%）。目标或在其范围内的另一个生物可以使用一个行动来进行DC 11力量检查；如果检查成功，对目标的影响结束。",
	"Each creature within 10 feet of the bomb's target point must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage (half as much damage on a successful saving throw).": "炸弹目标点10英尺范围内的每个生物必须在DC 11的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到4({@dice 1d8})的火焰伤害（救赎成功时伤害为一半）。",
	"If all else fails, the kobolds scramble up their makeshift ladder and attack with their shortswords.": "如果一切都失败了，哥布林们就爬上他们临时搭建的梯子，用短剑攻击。",
	"{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) moved into this simple but comfortable chamber when the camp was abandoned. If no fight has occurred with the guards in area 12 and characters enter this chamber from {@area area 9|0c1|x}, then Mondath is here when they arrive. Guards in area 12 hear whatever happens in this chamber and respond dutifully.": "{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）在营地被遗弃时搬进了这个简单而舒适的房间。如果没有与12区的守卫发生争斗，并且角色从{@area area 9|0c1|x}进入这个房间，那么当他们到达时，蒙达斯就在这里。12区的守卫会听到这个房间里发生的任何事情，并尽职尽责地做出反应。",
	"The chamber contains a writing desk and stool, several tables with books and papers, and a mirror on a floor stand. Light comes from two oil lamps. Thick rugs completely cover the floor, including an open chute that drops down to area 9. A rope ladder is fixed in the chute for climbing up and down, but nothing marks the position of the open, 3-foot-wide hole when it is covered by rugs. The slight depression it causes in the rug can be noticed with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If someone steps on the chute without knowing it's there, the character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Success means the character hops off the rug before it collapses through the hole, or grabs the top of ladder as he or she falls; failure means the character plunges 30 feet down the chute into area 9, taking {@dice 3d6} bludgeoning damage from the fall.": "房间里有一张写字台和凳子，几张摆放着书籍和文件的桌子，以及一面摆在地板上的镜子。光线来自于两盏油灯。厚厚的地毯完全覆盖了地板，包括一条通向第9区的开放式滑道。一个绳梯被固定在滑道上，用于爬上爬下，但当它被地毯覆盖时，没有任何东西标志着这个开放的、3英尺宽的洞的位置。只要成功地进行DC10智慧（（%0%））检查，就可以注意到它在地毯上造成的轻微凹陷。如果有人在不知道滑道存在的情况下踩到了它，这个角色必须做一个DC 10的灵巧救赎动作。成功意味着角色在地毯从洞口坍塌之前跳下，或者在坠落时抓住梯子的顶端；失败意味着角色从滑道上坠落30英尺到9号区域，在坠落时受到{@dice 3d6}重击伤害。",
	"Spread open on one of the tables is a simple map of the Greenfields area showing the villages the cult attacked and looted. An arrow is sketched in from the Greenfields toward the west and the town of Beregost on the Trade Way, where the arrow turns north. A separate sheet of paper that is covered with numerals in columns contains the note, \"Everything must be freighted north to Naerytar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} allowed us to keep some pearls, a ring, and a handful of small stones.\" Other papers are of less interest; most of them have bad poetry about dragons.": "在其中一张桌子上摊开的是一张简单的绿野地区地图，显示了邪教所攻击和掠夺的村庄。一个箭头从绿原区向西勾勒，贸易路上的贝雷戈斯特镇，箭头在那里转向北方。一张单独的纸上用数字列着，上面写着：\"所有东西都必须向北运到Naerytar。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}允许我们保留一些珍珠、一枚戒指和一小撮小石头\"。其他的文件就不太感兴趣了，它们中的大多数都有关于龙的坏诗。",
	"The smaller chamber off the main one contains a bed, a trunk containing Mondath's clothes, and a second trunk containing Mondath's Cult of the Dragon regalia and a key to the chest in area 9. With this regalia, one person (preferably a human woman, but the clothing can be adjusted to fit a man) can be outfitted as a Wearer of Purple. It's worth noting that each Wearer of Purple's regalia is similar but unique, so high-ranking cult members are likely to recognize this regalia as Mondath's. When they see that the person wearing it is not Mondath, or if they know she is dead, alarm bells are guaranteed to go off.": "主房间外的小房间里有一张床，一个装着蒙达斯衣服的箱子，还有一个装着蒙达斯的龙之崇拜服饰的箱子和一把通往第9区箱子的钥匙。有了这些装备，一个人（最好是人类女性，但衣服可以调整为适合男性）可以被装备成紫色的穿戴者。值得注意的是，每个 \"紫色穿戴者 \"的服饰都是相似但独特的，所以高级邪教成员很可能会认出这套服饰是蒙达斯的。当他们看到穿着它的人不是蒙达斯，或者他们知道她已经死了，警钟一定会响起。",
	"If a fight breaks out in area 12 and four of the guards from that chamber retreat here to defend Mondath, her response is up to you. If the fight in the barracks takes a heavy toll on the characters, she might decide to confront them here. If the attackers plow through her forward guards, Mondath might retreat down the chute to area 9 and join forces with Cyanwrath or even flee from the cave. She has dedicated her life to the Cult of the Dragon, but she isn't eager to die for the cult. Mondath knows that the Cult is amassing treasure in the north and that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spoke often of Tiamat, but that is the extent of her knowledge of the larger plan.": "如果第12区发生了战斗，那间屋子里的四个卫兵退到这里来保卫蒙达斯，她的反应就取决于你。如果军营里的战斗对人物造成了很大的伤害，她可能会决定在这里与他们对峙。如果攻击者冲破了她的前卫，蒙达斯可能会顺着滑道撤退到第9区，与赛恩沃斯联手，甚至从洞穴里逃走。她已经把自己的生命献给了神龙教，但她并不急于为神龙教而死。蒙达斯知道邪教正在北方积聚财宝，而且{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}经常谈到提亚马特，但这是她对大计划的了解程度。",
	"The guards who remained behind with Mondath use this chamber as their barracks. They maintain a two-person watch at the entrance (area 1); two dragonclaws are currently on duty in that area, and the others—three {@creature Guard||guards} and eight {@creature Cultist||cultists}—are here, asleep or relaxing. If fighting against the dragonclaws from area 1 pushes near the passage to area 12, roll a {@dice d20}; the guards here investigate the sound on a roll of 12 or higher. Otherwise they stay here, mostly oblivious to what's going on elsewhere.": "和蒙达斯一起留下来的守卫把这个房间作为他们的营房。他们在入口处（1号区域）保持着两人的监视；目前有两只龙爪在那个区域值班，其他的--三只（%0%）和八只（%1%）--在这里睡觉或休息。如果与第1区的龙爪作战时，在通往第12区的通道附近推了一把（%2%）；这里的守卫在掷出12或更高的分数时调查了声音。否则他们就呆在这里，对其他地方发生的事情大多漠不关心。",
	"If characters enter this chamber from area 2, the guards react quickly. Two of the guards and five of the cultists fight the characters here while one guard and three of the cultists retreat to area 11 to protect {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}.": "如果角色从2区进入这个密室，守卫会迅速做出反应。两名守卫和五名邪教徒在这里与角色战斗，而一名守卫和三名邪教徒则撤退到11区保护（%0%）。",
	"The guards' scabbards are decorated with dragon motifs. They are worth about 5 gp each. They are not part of a Cult of the Dragon \"uniform,\" but wearing one of these scabbards could buy a character credibility when trying to pose as a cultist. For example, you might grant a +1 bonus to Charisma checks made to fool or influence cultists. Aside from their gear, the guards have coins and small gems worth a total of 120 gp.": "守卫的刀鞘上有龙的图案装饰。每个价值约5戈比。它们不属于神龙教的 \"制服\"，但在试图冒充邪教人士时，佩戴这些刀鞘可以为角色赢得信誉。例如，你可以在愚弄或影响邪教人员时，给予魅力检查+1的奖励。除了他们的装备外，卫兵们还有总价值为120金币的硬币和小宝石。",
	"This chamber is now mostly empty, except for a few overturned boxes, broken items, scattered coins, small gems that were dropped during the hasty evacuation, and one {@creature cultist} who is sleeping soundly on the floor after consuming several bottles of wine. He won't wake up from anything less than vigorous shaking, and it will be several hours before he is coherent. All the dropped items left in this room have a total value of only 16 gp.": "这个密室现在大部分是空的，除了一些翻倒的箱子、破碎的物品、散落的硬币、匆忙撤离时掉落的小宝石，还有一个（%0%）在喝了几瓶酒后在地上酣睡。如果不是大力摇晃，他是不会醒来的，要过几个小时才会有精神。留在这个房间里的所有掉落物品的总价值只有16戈比。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter includes many challenges other than fights, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them as you see fit. Characters might reach 4th level by the end of this chapter, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。本章包括许多战斗以外的挑战，角色克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整。角色在本章结束时可能会达到4级，但这并不是必须的。",
	"If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 4th level.": "如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，人物就达到了4级。",
	"For locating and disarming traps: 100 XP per trap.": "用于定位和解除陷阱。每个陷阱100XP。",
	"For offering the roper meat instead of fighting it to the death: 1,800 XP (the roper's standard XP value).": "因为提供给漫游者肉，而不是和它决一死战。1,800 XP(该牧羊人的标准XP值)。",

	"With the dragon hatchery destroyed and the cultists all gone, characters should head for Elturel and their rendezvous with {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} and {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}. They might choose to follow the wagon tracks instead. The wagons followed the course roughly laid out on the map in Mondath's chamber: west to Beregost, then north along the Trade Way. They have at least a full day's head start on the characters, and possibly more, depending on how much time characters spent in Greenest before returning to the plateau.": "随着龙的孵化场被摧毁，邪教分子全部消失，角色们应该前往Elturel，与{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}和{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}会合。他们可能会选择沿着马车的轨迹前进。马车沿着蒙达斯房间里的地图上的路线前进：向西到贝雷戈斯特，然后沿着贸易路向北。他们至少比人物领先了一整天，甚至可能更多，这取决于人物在返回高原之前在Greenest花了多少时间。",
	"The treasure looted from the Greenfields is headed north on the Trade Way, hidden in unmarked freight wagons that are part of the regular merchant traffic of that well-traveled road. The heroes must find out where all that loot is going, which means taking a long, danger-filled trip northward.": "从绿地掠夺来的财宝正沿着贸易之路北上，藏在没有标记的货运车中，这些车是这条康庄大道上正常商人交通的一部分。英雄们必须找出所有这些战利品的去向，这意味着要向北走一段漫长的、充满危险的旅程。",
	"The characters should travel from the abandoned cult camp southeast of Greenest to the city of Elturel on the River Chionthar. Their route takes them back through Greenest, where they can return any stolen goods that they recovered from the cult and recuperate from their wounds. Nighthill greets the characters with delight and respect. He tells them that before {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} left town, he bought horses and riding gear for the characters to speed their journey to Elturel. The horses are being kept at the dealer's stables until the characters are ready to leave for Elturel; all their costs are paid for.": "角色们应该从Greenest东南的废弃邪教营地出发，前往Chionthar河上的Elturel城市。他们的路线要经过格林斯特，在那里他们可以归还从邪教那里搜出的任何赃物，并休养伤势。奈特希尔高兴地迎接了这些人物，并表示尊重。他告诉他们，在{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}离开镇子之前，他为人物买了马和骑具，以加快他们去Elturel的旅程。这些马匹被存放在经销商的马厩里，直到人物准备好前往Elturel；他们的所有费用都已支付。",
	"On horseback, characters can travel the 200 miles from Greenest to Elturel in about six days. They make the journey without incident, unless you throw an encounter or two at them to spice up the trip or to increase their XP totals. Encounters with bandits, humanoid clans, and roving monsters are appropriate in the untamed expanses of the Greenfields.": "在马背上，角色们可以在六天内从格林斯特到艾尔崔尔走完200英里。他们在旅途中不会发生任何意外，除非你给他们带来一两个遭遇，以增加旅途的乐趣或增加他们的XP总量。遇到强盗、人形部族和游荡的怪物，在绿野的未开化地区是合适的。",
	"Elturel, a large, orderly city overlooking the River Chionthar, is filled with merchants, river traders, and farmers' markets. Its most distinguishing feature is a brilliant magical light that hovers above it, illuminating it day and night. This light is painful to undead and is visible from almost every corner of Elturgard (of which Elturel is the capital), appearing from afar as a star or distant sun.": "Elturel是一座俯瞰奇昂塔尔河的大型有序城市，到处都是商人、河贩和农贸市场。它最突出的特点是有一道灿烂的魔法之光，盘旋在它的上方，日夜照耀着它。这种光对亡灵来说是痛苦的，几乎从埃尔图尔加德（埃尔图尔是其首都）的每个角落都能看到，从远处看就像一颗星星或遥远的太阳。",
	"When the characters meet {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, they find him to be a good-natured paladin of Torm, the god of heroics and bravery. He is a man of action who loves jokes and pranks, a stiff drink, and a friendly scuffle.": "当人物遇到{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}时，他们发现他是一个好脾气的托尔姆的圣骑士，托尔姆是英雄和勇敢之神。他是一个喜欢开玩笑和恶作剧的人，喜欢喝烈酒和友好的混战。",
	"If characters ask for {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} when they arrive in Elturel, none of the locals know him. If they ask for {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, anyone can direct them to the \"headquarters\" of Frume's faction, the Order of the Gauntlet, at a tavern called A Pair of Black Antlers. If the characters arrive within a tenday of Erlanthar's departure from Greenest, then the monk is still there with his handful of disciples, too.": "如果人物在到达Elturel时询问{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，当地人都不认识他。如果他们问（%1%），任何人都可以把他们引到弗鲁姆派系的 \"总部\"--高塔骑士团，在一个叫 \"一对黑鹿角 \"的小酒馆。如果人物在埃尔兰萨离开格林斯特后的一个工作日内到达，那么这个僧侣和他的少数弟子也还在那里。",
	"You can spend as much or as little time on interactions in Elturel as you and your players want. Characters are guaranteed to have a good time in Frume's company, provided they consider continual drinking, arm-wrestling, horseback riding contests, sparring, and weapon training to be a good time. If the players don't realize it, Erlanthar finds a quiet moment to be sure the characters understand that impressing Frume with their prowess, their honesty, and their drive is in their long-term interest. The characters can make a positive impression on Frume by winning a few contests (resolved quickly with opposed skill or ability checks) or sparring matches against his troopers or by telling entertaining tales of their exploits during the Greenest raid, in the raiders' camp, and in the dragon caves.": "你可以根据你和你的玩家的需要，在Elturel的互动上花更多或更少的时间。只要角色认为不断地喝酒、掰手腕、骑马比赛、比武和武器训练是一种好时光，就能保证他们在弗鲁姆的公司里过得很开心。如果玩家们没有意识到这一点，Erlanthar会找一个安静的时刻来确保角色们明白，用他们的能力、他们的诚实和他们的动力来打动Frumm是符合他们长期利益的。角色们可以通过赢得一些竞赛（通过相反的技能或能力检查快速解决）或与他的部队进行比武，或者通过讲述他们在Greenest突袭中、在突袭者营地中和在龙洞中的有趣故事来给Frum留下积极印象。",
	"Late in the evening, after a day when Frume has been suitably impressed by the characters, he sends one of his squires to summon them to a private room in the tavern.": "在一天之后的深夜，弗鲁姆对这些人物留下了适当的印象，他派他的一个侍从把他们召集到酒馆的一个私人房间。",
	"Frume's squire shows you to a private space off the tavern's common room and closes the door when he leaves. Waiting for you in the room are the broad-shouldered human paladin, the monk Leosin, and many pitchers of dark red wine. The paladin's face wears a serious expression, unlike its usual open countenance.": "弗鲁姆的侍从带你到酒馆公共房间外的一个私人空间，他离开时关上了门。在房间里等着你的是宽肩的人类圣骑士、修士Leosin和许多投掷的暗红色葡萄酒。圣骑士的脸上带着严肃的表情，与平时开放的面孔不同。",
	"\"My friends, we have important business to discuss. At this point, you know almost as much about it as we do, and thanks to you, we know twice as much today as we did a tenday ago. Something rotten is afoot. We have no formal organization to oppose these rascals—not yet anyway. We're working on that. And we need people like you, who know how and when to fight, and how and when to keep their heads down and observe. We can't promise you anything except long days filled with danger and stress—but what could be better than that, eh?\"": "\"我的朋友们，我们有重要的事情要讨论。在这一点上，你们知道的几乎和我们一样多，而且多亏了你们，我们今天知道的东西是一天前的两倍。腐朽的东西正在酝酿。我们没有正式的组织来反对这些流氓--反正还没有。我们正在努力解决这个问题。我们需要像你这样的人，知道如何和何时战斗，以及如何和何时保持低头观察。除了充满危险和压力的漫长日子，我们不能向你承诺什么--但还有什么比这更好的呢，嗯？",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} and {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}, along with a handful of other concerned leaders and scholars along the Sword Coast, are in the early stages of organizing against the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}和{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，以及剑海岸的其他一些相关领导人和学者，正处于组织起来反对神龙教的早期阶段。",
	"Erlanthar's organization is the Harpers. Characters might have heard of the older Harpers, but they're unlikely to know much about the secretive group beyond what is generally rumored: that the Harpers are dedicated to furthering equality and justice and to keeping power out of the hands of those who don't deserve it. Erlanthar explains that the Harpers are loosely organized; agents are allowed wide freedom of action.": "Erlanthar的组织是Harpers。角色们可能听说过老一辈的哈珀斯，但他们不可能对这个神秘的组织有太多的了解，除了一般的传闻：哈珀斯致力于促进平等和正义，不让权力落入那些不值得的人手中。Erlanthar解释说，哈珀斯组织很松散；代理人被允许有广泛的行动自由。",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} represents the Order of the Gauntlet. His order shares many of the Harpers' principles, but the two organizations are very different. The Order of the Gauntlet emphasizes faith, vigilance, and constant struggle against threats of evil. Many of its members are clerics and paladins, but the order welcomes anyone who shares its ideals. Discipline is key, and the order is distinctly more structured and hierarchical than the Harpers.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}代表高塔骑士团。他的组织与哈珀斯的许多原则相同，但这两个组织却非常不同。高塔骑士团强调信仰、警惕和与邪恶威胁的不断斗争。它的许多成员是牧师和圣骑士，但该组织欢迎任何与它有共同理想的人。纪律是关键，而且该组织明显比哈珀斯组织更有结构性和等级性。",
	"The top concern of both groups is the Cult of the Dragon. In the past, the cult was more active to the east and it was focused on creating dracoliches. Its shift to the Sword Coast and new emphasis on living dragons and on Tiamat are cause for concern. The cult is on the move and it's up to something big; the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and a third allied group known as the Emerald Enclave want to thwart the cult's plans.": "这两个团体最关心的问题是龙的崇拜。在过去，该邪教在东部比较活跃，它专注于创造龙族。它向剑海岸的转移以及对活龙和提亚马特的新强调，都令人担忧。该邪教正在行动，并在酝酿一件大事；高塔骑士团、哈珀斯和第三个被称为翡翠飞地的联盟组织想要挫败该邪教的计划。",
	"In this meeting, Frume and Erlanthar are offering the characters the chance to join their factions. At this early stage, there is no pay for members and there are no ranks. What they can offer is help and support from other members and allies, who are spread from Nashkel and Candlekeep in the south to Neverwinter and Mirabar in the north. The horses that Erlanthar arranged for the characters are just one small example of the aid the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet can provide.": "在这次会议中，Frumm和Erlanthar为人物提供了加入他们派系的机会。在这个早期阶段，成员没有报酬，也没有等级。他们能提供的是来自其他成员和盟友的帮助和支持，他们分布在南部的纳什克尔和烛台镇到北部的永夜城和米拉巴尔。Erlanthar为人物安排的马匹只是哈珀斯和高塔骑士团可以提供的援助的一个小例子。",
	"Harpers can be recognized by the group's symbol: a silver harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon. Some people wear the symbol openly, and others keep it concealed. Erlanthar wears his as a medallion around his neck when he is certain that he's not heading into a potential captive situation—sometimes openly and sometimes tucked away. Members of the Order of the Gauntlet wear their holy symbols openly. (Frume's is the right-handed gauntlet of Torm.) The order's universal symbol is a gauntlet grasping a sword by the blade. Frume wears such a symbol on a pendant around his neck, hidden below his flowing beard.": "哈珀人可以通过该团体的标志来识别：一个银色的竖琴依偎在一个新月的犄角之间。有些人公开佩戴这个标志，有些人则将其隐藏起来。埃兰萨在确定自己没有进入潜在的俘虏情况时，就把他的徽章戴在脖子上--有时是公开的，有时是藏起来的。高塔骑士团的成员公开佩戴他们的神圣标志。(Frumume的是Torm的右手铠甲。)该组织的通用标志是一个抓住剑刃的铠甲。弗鲁姆把这样的标志戴在脖子上的吊坠上，藏在他飘逸的胡须下面。",
	"Characters don't need to join either faction, but there are advantages to doing so and no real drawbacks. Even if characters don't agree to join, Frume and Erlanthar try to enlist their aid in tracking the cult's shipments.": "角色不需要加入任何一个派别，但这样做有好处，没有真正的坏处。即使角色不同意加入，弗鲁姆和埃兰萨也会试图让他们协助追踪邪教的货物。",
	"Thanks to the characters, the Harpers now know that the cult is amassing treasure and shipping it north. Where exactly this treasure is going and what the cult plans to do with it are the next two questions that need answering. Frume and Erlanthar would like the characters to join the cult's caravan and accompany it on the journey. They could get themselves hired as guards—if not by the cult's wagon masters, then by other merchants who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Merchants from different companies commonly join together to form larger trains for protection. Frume has contacts among the many merchants of the region and is certain he can arrange a job.": "多亏了这些人物，哈珀人现在知道邪教正在收集财宝并将其运往北方。接下来需要回答的两个问题是：这些财宝到底要去哪里，以及邪教打算用这些财宝做什么。Frume和Erlanthar希望角色们能加入邪教的商队，并在旅途中陪伴它。他们可以让自己被雇佣为卫兵--如果不是被邪教的马车主人雇佣，那就是被同时朝同一方向旅行的其他商人雇佣。来自不同公司的商人通常会联合起来，组成更大的列车以获得保护。弗鲁姆在这一地区的许多商人中都有联系，他肯定能安排一份工作。",
	"Timing is an issue. The tracks leaving the cultists' camp and the map from Mondath's chamber both indicate that the wagons were heading west to pick up the Coast Way road, where they would turn north to Beregost and Baldur's Gate, a journey of about 550 miles. The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery. Returning to Greenest, resting, and traveling to Elturel account for eight to ten more days. Unless the characters walked to Elturel or lounged for days in Greenest before coming north, they should have at least ten to fifteen days before the cult's wagons reach Baldur's Gate.": "时间是个问题。离开邪教徒营地的足迹和蒙达斯密室的地图都表明，马车正向西驶去，准备走上海岸路，在那里他们将向北转到贝雷戈斯特和博德之门，行程约550英里。根据情况，马车需要二十五到三十天的时间来完成这一行程。马车至少比人物返回营地的时间提前一天停靠，人物可能花了一天时间探索废弃的营地，并清理了龙的孵化场。回到Greenest，休息一下，然后去Elturel，这需要八到十天。除非人物是步行到Elturel，或者在北上之前在Greenest闲逛了好几天，否则在邪教的马车到达Baldur's Gate之前，他们应该至少有10到15天的时间。",
	"The River Chionthar flows directly from Elturel to Baldur's Gate. A sailing vessel can make that trip downstream in about three days if it ties up overnight for safety, or two if it risks pushing on through the night by lamplight. Frume has already arranged for such a boat to leave at dawn the next morning. They are also provided with 50 gp each to cover expenses on the trip.": "奇昂塔尔河从艾尔图勒直接流向博德之门。如果为了安全起见，一艘帆船可以在三天内顺流而下，如果冒险在夜里借着灯火继续前进，则需要两天。弗鲁姆已经安排好了这样一艘船，在第二天早上的黎明离开。还为他们每人提供了50戈比，以支付此行的费用。",
	"If the characters turn down this mission, Frume makes some remarks about how they aren't the people he thought they were, and he leaves the meeting more than a little bit angry. Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.": "如果这些人物拒绝了这个任务，弗鲁姆就会说他们不是他认为的那种人，他就会离开会议，而且有点生气。Erlanthar留下来，再次呼吁他们的荣誉感和责任感。如果这些人物仍然拒绝他，他就把手伸进他的外衣，掏出一个软皮袋，递给其中一个人物。里面是一颗华丽的红宝石，价值1,200戈比。他解释说，如果他们接受了这个任务，这颗红宝石就会在沃特迪普的一个哈珀特工手中等待他们。",
	"That night, Frume sees that the characters are all equipped with new clothing and gear, and even new weapons if they want. He suggests that they change their appearance as much as they can in simple ways, to reduce the odds of anyone they might have met at the cult camp recognizing them.": "那天晚上，弗鲁姆看到人物都配备了新的衣服和装备，如果他们愿意，甚至还有新的武器。他建议他们尽可能以简单的方式改变自己的外表，以减少他们在邪教营地可能遇到的人认出他们的几率。",
	"The trip downriver to Baldur's Gate is uneventful, regardless of whether it takes three days or two. The characters can bring their horses along on the boat if they wish. The horses won't like it, but they'll manage.": "顺流而下到Baldur's Gate的旅程并不顺利，不管是花三天还是两天。如果他们愿意，人物可以把他们的马带上船。马匹不会喜欢这样，但它们可以应付。",
	"Baldur's Gate is a bustling center of trade, with goods coming from north and south by wagon along the Trade Way and by ship on the Sea of Swords, and from the east along the River Chionthar and from Cormyr and Sembia. Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.": "博德之门是一个繁华的贸易中心，货物从北方和南方沿贸易之路、从剑海乘船而来，从东方沿奇安塔尔河、从科米尔和森比亚而来。博德之门位于河边一个突出的悬崖上，俯瞰着一个绝佳的天然港口。它被分为三个不同的部分：上城，最富有和最有影响力的公民居住在这里，城市的市场（Wide）也在这里；下城，围绕着港口，城市的大多数商人居住在这里并开展业务；外城，位于城墙外，城市的大多数劳动者居住在这里，条件从拥挤但干净到肮脏不等。",
	"Depending on timing, characters might have just a few days to wait in Baldur's Gate, or up to a tenday. Most of that time should be spent contacting a merchant recommended by Frume and arranging affairs so they can spot the cult wagons when they arrive.": "根据时间安排，人物可能只有几天的时间在Baldur's Gate等待，或者长达一个工作日。其中大部分时间应该用来联系Frumm推荐的商人，并安排好事务，以便他们在邪教马车到达时能够发现。",
	"Frume's contact is a human trader named Ackyn Selebon. He operates an equipage business in the Outer City north of the city wall, in a district called Blackgate. There he sells all the material needed for long-distance freight hauling: wagons, rope, netting, grease, chains, wheels, and so on. His shop also repairs wagons. He is not directly involved in the hiring of guards for caravans, but he knows people who are. With him to vouch for the characters, they should have no trouble getting hired on as guards for a northbound caravan, but he can't give them work with a specific merchant.": "弗鲁姆的联系人是一个名叫Ackyn Selebon的人类商人。他在城墙以北的外城经营装备生意，在一个叫黑门的地区。他在那里出售长途货运所需的所有材料：马车、绳子、网子、油脂、链条、车轮等等。他的商店还修理马车。他不直接参与雇佣商队的守卫，但他认识一些人。有了他的担保，他们被雇用为北行商队的守卫应该没有问题，但他不能给他们提供特定商人的工作。",
	"Baldur's Gate doesn't allow wagons, pack animals, horses, or even dogs into the city. The streets are so narrow, steep, and slick from frequent rain that heavy wagons would be a menace. This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city—a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.": "博德之门不允许马车、驮兽、马，甚至狗进入城市。街道非常狭窄、陡峭，而且经常下雨导致路面湿滑，沉重的马车会成为一种威胁。这实际上也是博德之门成为如此繁华的商业中心的原因之一：例如，货物要从南到北通过城市，必须在城墙以东的外城卸货，由搬运工人步行穿过城市，然后重新装到城北的不同马车上，继续他们的旅程。没有任何道路可以方便地绕过城市--这是城门的暴利中间商努力维持的局面。大多数商人发现，当他们到达博德门时，更容易将他们的货物卖给那些中间商和寄售商，从很远的地方买一车新的异国货物，然后转身回家，在那里他们可以再次出售新的货物以获得利润。",
	"Along with wagons, guards seldom make a continuous journey through Baldur's Gate. Guards for northbound caravans are typically hired in Blackgate where northbound wagons begin their journey. Selebon tells the characters that if they hang around any of the taverns or tent saloons near his shop, they are sure to see all the northbound traffic. They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.": "伴随着马车，守卫很少会在博德之门中进行连续的旅行。北行商队的守卫通常是在黑门雇佣的，北行的马车在那里开始他们的旅程。塞勒本告诉人物，如果他们在他的商店附近的任何一家酒馆或帐篷沙龙里闲逛，他们肯定会看到所有北行的交通。如果有潜在的雇主问起，他们应该毫不犹豫地把他作为一个参考。",
	"The northbound journey from Baldur's Gate is arduous, so merchants travel together for safety. Each merchant hires guards independently, but the common belief is that if everyone hires two or three and enough wagons travel together, the caravan is well protected.": "从博德之门向北的旅程很艰辛，所以商人们为了安全而结伴而行。每个商人都独立地雇佣卫兵，但人们普遍认为，如果每个人都雇佣两到三个卫兵，并且有足够多的马车一起旅行，商队就会得到很好的保护。",
	"Within a few days (the wait is up to you and the timing you've worked out for the cargo's arrival from the camp), characters spot people they recognize from the cult's camp on the plateau. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, being a half-dragon, can't travel openly in Baldur's Gate; she'd be attacked by a mob. The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does the same. When characters spot familiar faces from the cult camp, the cultists are carrying or accompanying a palanquin where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} rides. They might catch a glimpse of her through a briefly parted curtain if they're observant.": "在几天内（等待的时间取决于你和你为货物从营地到达的时间），角色们发现了他们在高原上的邪教营地里认识的人。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，作为一个半龙人，不能在博德之门公开旅行；她会被暴徒袭击的。然而，这个城市的富有的精英们，为了舒适和隐私，经常乘坐有屏风或窗帘的轿子在街上行走。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}也是如此。当人物发现邪教阵营中熟悉的面孔时，这些邪教人员正带着或伴随着{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}乘坐的轿子。如果他们善于观察，可能会透过短暂分开的帘子瞥见她。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and her bodyguards come to Selebon's yard to purchase five wagons and supplies (having sold the other wagons south of the city). Once they are equipped, local porters pack merchandise and supplies onto the wagons, cover them in canvas, and lash them down.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和她的保镖来到塞勒邦的院子里，购买五辆马车和物资（已将其他马车卖到城南）。装备好后，当地的搬运工将商品和物资装上马车，用帆布盖住，然后用绳子绑住。",
	"After the characters have identified the cultists' wagons and seen their arrangements, they should have an easy time getting hired as guards. They can apply to the cultists if they feel like being reckless, but other merchants are making the same preparations to leave on the morrow. Select anyone from the list of merchants and travelers to be a potential employer. Each character makes a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) or Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, whichever they prefer. Check the results below.": "在人物确定了邪教分子的马车并看到他们的安排后，他们应该很容易被雇用为卫兵。如果他们觉得自己很鲁莽，可以向邪教分子申请，但其他商人也在做同样的准备，准备在明天离开。从商人和旅行者的名单中选择任何人作为潜在雇主。每个角色进行魅力（（%0%））或力量（（%1%））检查，以他们喜欢的为准。检查结果如下。",
	"No one is interested in hiring the character, but he or she can tag along as a traveler. Guards sometimes quit or die on the road, and a replacement has a chance to find employment.": "没有人有兴趣雇用这个角色，但他或她可以作为一个旅行者跟在后面。警卫有时会辞职或死在路上，而替代者有机会找到工作。",
	"Hired as a basic guard for 5 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被雇为基本的警卫，每个工作日5个金币，外加路上的食物和生活费用。",
	"Hired as a sergeant for 8 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被聘为中士，每班8戈比，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"Hired as a bodyguard for the merchant at 10 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "受雇为商人的保镖，每个工作日10金币，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"All hires are for the journey to Waterdeep. Sergeants are expected to manage two to five other guards. Bodyguards are expected to stick close to their employer and protect him or her against harm.": "所有雇佣的人都是为了前往沃特德普的旅程。中士要管理两到五个其他的卫兵。保镖们要紧跟他们的雇主，保护他或她免受伤害。",
	"During the course of this journey, the characters have opportunities to meet a range of people from across Faerûn. Merchants, mercenaries, pilgrims, scholars, thieves, and explorers all mingle on the great Trade Way.": "在这个旅程中，人物有机会遇到来自整个法鲁恩的各种人。商人、佣兵、朝圣者、学者、盗贼和探险家都在这条伟大的贸易之路上打交道。",
	"Two NPCs who join the caravan partway through the trip are especially important: {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} and {@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}. Both join the caravan at Daggerford, about 120 miles south of Waterdeep and the last place where the caravan takes a day-long rest. They are not traveling together; being in Daggerford at the same time is coincidental.": "有两个在旅途中加入商队的NPC特别重要：（%0%）和（%1%）。他们都是在达格福加入商队的，达格福在沃特迪普以南约120英里处，是商队最后休息一天的地方。他们不是一起旅行的，在同一时间出现在达格福德是偶然的。",
	"{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a male human and a Red Wizard of Thay. Red Wizards are widely disliked and mistrusted, so he takes some pains to disguise his membership in that group by always wearing a wool cap with ear and neck flaps to cover his shaved, tattooed head. It's not an especially effective disguise; characters who make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notice the edges of the tattoos peeking out from under the cap. Many Thayans have shaved, tattooed heads, however, but only a few are Red Wizards. Countless Thayans fled their country when the lich Szass Tam seized control, so they are not entirely strange on the Sword Coast. If questioned, Jos claims to be just another Thayan expatriot trying to find refuge while his country is controlled by undead monsters. In fact, other than the denial that he's a Red Wizard, this is all true.": "{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}（统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）是一名男性人类，是泰伊的红袍巫师。红袍巫师被广泛厌恶和不信任，所以他花了一些心思来掩饰他的成员身份，他总是戴着一顶有耳翼和颈翼的羊毛帽来遮住他剃光的、有纹身的头。这并不是一种特别有效的伪装；通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查的人物会注意到纹身的边缘从帽子下探出。然而，许多泰雅人都剃了头，纹了身，但只有少数人是红袍巫师。当巫师萨斯-塔姆夺取控制权时，无数的泰雅人逃离了他们的国家，所以他们在剑海岸并不完全陌生。如果被询问，乔斯声称自己只是另一个试图在他的国家被不死怪物控制时找到避难所的泰雅族侨民。事实上，除了否认他是红袍巫师之外，这些都是事实。",
	"Jos buys space aboard one of the cult wagons, although they turned away everyone else who sought passage earlier in the journey. He does not mingle with the other travelers and seldom speaks to anyone except the man who seems to be the leader of the cultists.": "乔斯买了一辆邪教马车的空间，尽管他们拒绝了早些时候寻求通过的所有人。他不与其他旅行者打成一片，除了那个似乎是邪教领袖的人之外，他很少与其他人说话。",
	"{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a female gnome and a member of a secretive organization called the Black Network, also known as the Zhentarim. Outwardly, the Black Network provides mercenaries and other forms of muscle for hire. Informally, it is known as a criminal society akin to a widespread thieves guild. Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.": "{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})是一个女地精，是一个叫黑网的秘密组织的成员，也被称为Zhentarim。外表上，黑网提供雇佣兵和其他形式的雇佣兵。非正式地，它被称为是一个类似于广泛的盗贼公会的犯罪团体。暗地里，它的领导人试图将他们阴暗的手指伸向法鲁恩的每一个王室和统治者的议事厅。和哈珀人一样，真塔林也知道神龙教在行动，他们需要知道神龙教的计划，以便防止他们干扰真塔林自己的计划，也许还能利用掠夺的可能性。",
	"That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B—the one involving mass murder—into action.": "这就是格莱姆希尔弗加入商队的原因。黑网的间谍了解到邪教正在向北运输货物，和这些人物一样，她的任务是找出他们所运的货物以及货物的目的地。她上面的人认真考虑用伪装成强盗的雇佣兵消灭商队，洗劫马车，并折磨邪教成员以获得所需的信息。幸运的是，Gleamsilver说服了她的上级，让她以一种不那么血腥的方式来揭开真相。如果在商队到达沃特迪普时，她还没有想出有用的办法，她就会把B计划--涉及大规模谋杀的计划--付诸行动。",
	"Despite the vast gulf between their outlooks, the Black Network and the Harpers have a common enemy, and that is pushing them into an unlikely alliance. Gleamsilver is the antithesis of a hero—she is self-serving, a skilled thief and liar, and willing to murder anyone who stands between her and her goal.": "尽管他们的观点之间存在着巨大的差距，但黑网和哈珀斯有一个共同的敌人，这正促使他们结成一个不太可能的联盟。Gleamsilver是英雄的对立面--她自私自利，是一个熟练的小偷和骗子，并愿意谋杀任何阻挡她和她的目标的人。",
	"This list of twenty NPCs is provided for when you need one quickly. You can, of course, change any details about them that you wish. Use them to flesh out the caravan, to spice up the journey, to help bring the trip to life, and to give characters people to like and protect, or dislike and quarrel with, along the way.": "这二十个NPC的名单是为你快速需要时提供的。当然，你可以根据自己的意愿改变他们的任何细节。用他们来充实大篷车的内容，为旅程增添色彩，使旅程充满生机，并为角色提供喜欢和保护的人，或不喜欢和争吵的人，在一路上。",
	"Ulyeltin is an independent wagon master with two wagons in this caravan. Both are hauling cured furs and uncured hides. He is a boorish man without a trace of civilization about him. He's not unfriendly—just smelly, vulgar, and utterly without manners. His second wagon driver and two laborers, on the other hand, are perfectly pleasant.": "Ulyeltin是一个独立的马车主人，在这个商队中有两辆马车。两辆马车都在拉运腌制的毛皮和未腌制的兽皮。他是一个粗野的人，身上没有一丝文明气息。他不是不友好，只是臭气熏天，粗俗不堪，而且完全没有礼貌。另一方面，他的第二个马车夫和两个工人则非常讨人喜欢。",
	"A lawyer by training but a skunk by inclination, Urnpoleshurst is relocating from Baldur's Gate to anywhere that isn't Baldur's Gate. Gossip around the caravan is that he was driven out by a scandal, and that's hard not to believe. He is suspicious of everyone and makes outrageous accusations at the drop of a hat.": "厄恩波利斯特受训为律师，但倾向于臭鼬，他正从博德之门搬迁到任何不是博德之门的地方。商队周围的流言蜚语说他是被丑闻赶出来的，这很难不让人相信。他对每个人都心存疑虑，一言不合就提出离谱的指控。",
	"Ale and beer are so common that not much money can be made hauling them long distances. But that's what fills Sechepol's wagon. He will make his money on the road, selling his stock to his fellow travelers in the caravan. He is diplomatic and has a gift for defusing arguments to everyone's satisfaction before they escalate to violence, but he is careless about gear and horses—a fault that can cause friction with those who hate to see a horse mistreated through thoughtlessness.": "麦芽酒和啤酒是如此的普通，以至于远距离运输它们并不能赚到多少钱。但这就是塞克波尔的马车所装的东西。他要在路上赚钱，把他的存货卖给商队里的同伴。他是个外交家，有在争论升级为暴力之前化解争论的天赋，让每个人都满意，但他对装备和马匹很粗心--这个缺点会引起与那些讨厌看到马匹因不经意而被虐待的人的摩擦。",
	"Lewel's wagon is loaded with exotic wood from the Jungle of Chult for the master carpenters and cabinetmakers of Waterdeep to turn into exquisite furniture. She is the exact opposite of Beyd Sechepol in temperament: impatient with people but exacting about her wagon and doting on her animals.": "Lewel的马车装满了来自Chult丛林的奇异木材，供Waterdeep的木匠大师和橱柜制造商将其变成精美的家具。她的性情与贝德-塞克波完全相反：对人不耐烦，但对她的马车要求严格，对她的动物也很宠爱。",
	"Agetul has made this trip several times before and never hesitates to wave that experience in others' faces. She is a perfectionist, and she wants others to know it.": "阿吉图以前已经做过几次这样的旅行，并且从不犹豫地在别人面前挥舞这种经验。她是一个完美主义者，她想让别人知道这一点。",
	"Tobun has driven freight wagons across Faerûn for the past forty years, from Waterdeep to Calimport and from Baldur's Gate to Hillsfar. He is a font of stories and legends, but it's impossible to tell the truth from fiction in his tales. If anyone challenges him on the truth of a story, he grows argumentative, then sullen and vengeful. As long as a traveler stays on his good side, Tobun is a wonderful traveling companion.": "过去四十年来，托本驾驶货运马车穿越法鲁恩，从沃特迪普到卡林波特，从博德之门到希尔斯法尔。他是故事和传说的源泉，但在他的故事中不可能分辨出真相与虚构。如果有人对他的故事的真实性提出质疑，他就会变得争论不休，然后闷闷不乐，充满报复性。只要旅行者站在他的立场上，托本就是一个很好的旅行伙伴。",
	"The reason behind Imsa's name is obvious: she is green from head to foot. Her skin, hair, eyes, nails, teeth—everything about her is green. She readily admits that she is traveling to Waterdeep in search of a remedy for her condition. The coloration doesn't seem to bother her, but she becomes flustered if anyone asks how she came to be this way. She is friendly, if somewhat quiet, as long as the conversation stays away from her past.": "伊姆萨的名字背后的原因很明显：她从头到脚都是绿色的。她的皮肤、头发、眼睛、指甲、牙齿--她的所有东西都是绿色的。她欣然承认，她到沃特德普是为了寻找治疗她病情的方法。这种颜色似乎并不妨碍她，但如果有人问她是如何变成这样的，她就会变得很慌张。她很友好，虽然有些沉默，但只要谈话不涉及她的过去。",
	"This ambitious merchant is hauling scented cooking oil and perfumes from Amn, hoping to make a huge profit from the aristocrats and dandies of Waterdeep. He talks about money constantly: how much he intends to make, how he will spend it, and how others will envy him for it. He will not spend a single copper buying anyone else a drink or a roasted turnip during the entire trip.": "这个雄心勃勃的商人正在从阿姆拉运芳香的食用油和香水，希望从水底世界的贵族和花花公子那里赚取巨额利润。他不停地谈论钱：他打算赚多少钱，他将如何花钱，以及其他人将如何羡慕他的钱。在整个行程中，他不会花一个铜板请别人喝酒或吃烤萝卜。",
	"From time to time, Lasfelro inexplicably breaks into merry songs and short stretches of joke-telling. His voice is a fine tenor and his jokes are hilarious. But these gregarious moods are always short. The rest of the time, he is silent as the grave, staring sullenly at the road ahead, barely moving on the seat of his wagon, seeming hardly to breathe. No one knows what he transports in his wagon, but it is guarded by a brooding gargoyle that is tethered to the wagon by a slim, silver chain.": "拉斯费罗不时莫名其妙地闯入欢乐的歌曲和短促的笑话。他的声音是一个很好的男高音，他的笑话也很搞笑。但这些欢快的情绪总是很短暂。其余的时间，他像坟墓一样沉默不语，闷闷不乐地盯着前面的路，在马车的座位上几乎不动，似乎几乎不呼吸。没有人知道他的马车里装的是什么，但它被一只忧郁的妖怪看守着，这只妖怪被一条细长的银链拴在马车上。",
	"Widris is as honest and courageous as mercenaries come. She has spent many years in the south and now wants to see the snows and frozen seas of the far north and experience what a truly cold wind feels like.": "维德里斯和雇佣兵一样诚实和勇敢。她在南方呆了很多年，现在想去看看遥远的北方的雪和冰冻的海洋，体验一下真正的寒风是什么感觉。",
	"Although Losvius's nose is respectably large, even for a halfling, the appellation Longnose was hung on him for a different reason: he is curious about everything, including other people's business, and especially other people's embarrassing secrets. Losvius doesn't poke his nose where it's not wanted in a search for blackmail material. He is just overpoweringly curious about what other people don't talk about. If he is along, there's a good chance one or more of the characters will find him nosing through their belongings when he thought their backs were turned.": "虽然洛斯维乌斯的鼻子相当大，即使对一个半身人来说也是如此，但长鼻子这个称谓被挂在他身上是出于另一个原因：他对一切都很好奇，包括别人的事情，尤其是别人的尴尬秘密。洛斯维尤斯并不是为了寻找敲诈的材料而把鼻子探到不需要的地方。他只是对别人不说的事有强烈的好奇心。如果他在一起，很有可能一个或更多的人物会发现他在他们认为他们背对着他们的时候偷看他们的物品。",
	"Noohar and his mute brother, Selvek, are hauling exquisite wooden carvings made by the elves of Cormyr. Where his brother communicates only through sign language, Noohar may be the most articulate person the characters have ever met. Speech springs from him like music from the harp of Milil. The fact that he seldom has anything to say never seems to stop him from talking or others from listening.": "努哈尔和他的哑巴哥哥塞尔维克正在拖运科米尔精灵制作的精美木雕作品。他的哥哥只能通过手语进行交流，而努哈尔可能是这些人物所见过的最能说会道的人。言语从他口中涌出，就像米利尔的竖琴发出的音乐。他很少有话可说，但这似乎并不妨碍他说话，也不妨碍别人倾听。",
	"A load of Calishite silk will make Nyerhite Verther a rich man in Waterdeep, or so he believes. Sadly, he did not inspect his silk carefully when he bought it, and it's infested with worms. If anyone spots them and points them out to Verther during the trip, he becomes unhinged in his anger and grief.": "一批卡利希特的丝绸将使尼尔赫特-维瑟成为水底世界的富人，他是这么认为的。可悲的是，他在买丝的时候没有仔细检查，丝上有虫子出没。如果在旅途中有人发现它们并向维瑟指出它们，他就会在愤怒和悲伤中变得不正常。",
	"Esseren grew up in the farmland outside Baldur's Gate, and this is her first trip more than two miles away from home. She is smart, tough, and talented with both spear and bow, but she knows nothing of the world beyond her aunt's farm or of people who deal dishonestly. Her aunt, a wise woman, believes this trip will be good for her.": "艾瑟伦在博德之门外的农田里长大，这是她第一次离家超过两英里的旅行。她很聪明，很坚强，对长矛和弓箭都很有天赋，但她对她姨妈的农场以外的世界和不诚实交易的人一无所知。她的姨妈是个聪明的女人，相信这次旅行对她有好处。",
	"Evenmor is an independent wagon master hauling exotic birds to the lucrative markets in Waterdeep. He is a stubborn, argumentative man with strong opinions about almost everything, but he is generous when it comes to pouring drinks for those who will sit and argue with him endlessly.": "埃文摩尔是一个独立的马车主人，将异国的鸟类拉到沃特德普有利可图的市场。他是一个顽固的、爱争论的人，对几乎所有的事情都有强烈的意见，但当他为那些愿意坐下来和他争论不休的人倒酒时，他很慷慨。",
	"No one knows where Perethun is ultimately headed or why. He eats alone, seldom speaks, and always rides in the back of the wagon, staring wistfully at the road gone by. The only thing that brings him out of this shell is a game of chance. He gambles boisterously and well.": "没有人知道Perethun最终会去哪里，也没有人知道为什么。他独自吃饭，很少说话，总是坐在马车的后面，怀念地凝视着过去的道路。唯一能让他走出这层壳的是一场机会游戏。他赌得很欢，赌得很好。",
	"Perhaps someone who hauls crates of expensive, fragile porcelain in a bouncing, jarring wagon along the Trade Way must be a born optimist. In Samardag's world, the sky is always blue, the weather is always fine, and the outlook for tomorrow is always bright. Odds are he would be a wealthy man if he hung onto his money, but he is a soft touch for every urchin and hard-luck story that crosses his path.": "也许一个在贸易路上用颠簸的马车拖着一箱箱昂贵而脆弱的瓷器的人，一定是个天生的乐观主义者。在萨马尔达格的世界里，天空总是很蓝，天气总是很好，明天的前景总是很光明。如果他抓住他的钱，他可能会成为一个富有的人，但他对每一个与他擦肩而过的顽童和不幸的故事都很宽容。",
	"Among his tribe in his homeland of the Shaar, Sulesdeg's name means \"tall as a lodge pole.\" On the Sword Coast, he is just known as \"the Pole.\" At 7 feet 5 inches in height, he probably is the tallest human the characters or anyone else in the caravan has ever seen. He doesn't talk much, but when he does, people generally listen.": "在他的故乡沙尔的部落中，苏勒德格的名字的意思是 \"像小屋的柱子一样高\"。在剑海岸，他只是被称为 \"柱子\"。他身高7英尺5英寸，可能是大篷车上的人物或其他任何人见过的最高的人类。他不怎么说话，但当他说话时，人们一般都会听。",
	"It won't take long before everyone in the caravan knows to steer clear of Tyjit Skesh. She is quick to anger and quicker to resort to her blades when something sets her off. She is honest to a fault and never fails to let people know why she was angry, so they can correct their behavior in the future. She will not tolerate bullying.": "用不了多久，商队里的每个人都知道要避开泰吉特-斯凯什。她很快就会发怒，当有事情让她发怒时，她会更快地诉诸于她的刀片。她诚实到了极点，从不吝啬让人知道她为什么生气，这样他们就能在将来纠正自己的行为。她不会容忍欺凌行为。",
	"Quiet, unassuming Werond Torohar can handle a team of horses or mules better than anyone on the Trade Way. She has an uncanny knack for making animals understand what she wants from them with only a twitch on the reins, a whistle, and a snap of her whip. Mud, stones, and ice seem to not be obstacles at all when Torohar is handling the team. She is a starry-eyed romantic at heart, and she can bring strong men to tears with her tales of long-ago lost loves and thwarted passion.": "安静、不张扬的威龙-托罗哈比贸易之路上的任何人都能更好地驾驭一队马或骡子。她有一种不可思议的诀窍，只需抽动一下缰绳，吹一声口哨，抽一下鞭子，就能让动物明白她想要什么。在托罗哈带队时，泥土、石头和冰块似乎根本不是障碍。她是一个内心充满星光的浪漫主义者，她可以用她的故事让强壮的男人流泪，讲述久违的爱情和受挫的激情。",
	"The stretch of road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep is a journey of 750 miles. Horse-drawn or mule-drawn freight wagons cover 15 miles per day, depending on conditions. The animals need one day off after every six days of hauling to recover from their work. All things considered, the trip is expected to take two months.": "从博德之门（Baldur's Gate）到沃特德普（Waterdeep）这段路有750英里的路程。马拉或骡拉的货运马车每天行驶15英里，这取决于条件。牲畜在每六天的运输之后需要休息一天，以恢复它们的工作。综合考虑，这次旅行预计需要两个月时间。",
	"The caravan leaving Baldur's Gate contains the three wagons of the Cult of the Dragon plus {@dice 2d4} more. Not all travelers are merchants. A wagon might carry a family relocating to the north or a diplomat on a mission to Waterdeep. People and wagons join the caravan along the way, and others leave according to the dictates of business and fortune. Some travelers ride horses, some walk beside the wagons, and some pay the merchants to ride aboard their wagons. On several occasions, characters notice the cult teamsters turning away passengers even though they have spare room on their wagons.": "离开博德之门的商队包含了神龙教的三辆马车以及{@dice 2d4}更多。并非所有的旅行者都是商人。一辆马车可能载着一个迁往北方的家庭，或者一个去水底世界执行任务的外交官。人们和马车沿途加入商队，而其他人则根据商业和财富的要求离开。有些旅行者骑着马，有些走在马车旁边，有些则付钱给商人，让他们骑上马车。有几次，人物注意到邪教团队成员拒绝乘客，尽管他们的马车上还有空位。",
	"Nothing identifies the cult's wagons as anything but typical merchants hauling northbound freight. They don't bunch up during the day or camp together at night. As far as anyone else knows, their only connection is that they're part of this caravan.": "没有任何东西可以证明邪教的马车是典型的商人，是在拖动北行的货物。他们白天不聚在一起，晚上也不在一起扎营。就其他人所知，他们唯一的联系是他们是这个商队的一部分。",

One travels with each wagon, acting as a guard and assistant to the teamster. The other nine are cloaked as private travelers in two distinct groups, seeking company and protection in the caravan for their journey.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和她的八个卫兵秘密地在商队前面离开Baldur's Gate，快速向北骑行。他们要去死人谷的奈瑞塔城堡，直到{@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}才会再见到他们。她留下了12个{@creature Guard||guards}。一人与每辆马车同行，充当守卫和车夫的助手。另外九个人则以私人旅行者的身份隐身在两个不同的团体中，在商队中寻求陪伴和保护，以完成他们的旅程。",
	"The wagons travel for about eight hours per day, with a few stops to feed and water the horses and mules. Many nights are spent camping along the road. Most small towns have roadside inns if travelers want more comfort, and walled hostelries catering to wagon caravans are spread a few days apart. Animals and travelers can rest comfortably at these walled compounds while wagons are safely locked inside. The map for {@adventure chapter 5|HotDQ|5} shows a structure that once served that purpose. It can be used as the model for a typical hostelry if needed.": "马车每天行驶约8个小时，有几次停下来给马匹和骡子喂食和饮水。许多夜晚是在沿路露营。如果旅行者想要更多的舒适，大多数小镇都有路边的旅馆，而为马车商队服务的有墙的旅店则相隔几天。动物和旅行者可以在这些有墙的院子里舒适地休息，而马车则安全地锁在里面。{@adventure chapter 5|HotDQ|5}的地图显示了一个曾经用于该目的的结构。如果需要的话，它可以作为一个典型的旅店的模型。",
	"The most difficult part of the journey is near the beginning. A few days' travel north of Baldur's Gate brings the caravan into a countryside known as the Fields of the Dead. The road twists and wanders through hills dotted with ancient battlefields, dolmens, and barrow mounds. Common wisdom holds that it's a very bad idea to light a fire on a hilltop at night in the Fields of the Dead, because the light attracts monsters from miles around. Crossing this territory takes several days, during which everyone will be edgy and on watch.": "旅程中最困难的部分是接近开始的时候。在博德之门以北的几天行程中，商队进入了一个被称为 \"死亡之域 \"的乡间。道路曲折蜿蜒，穿过点缀着古战场、石墓和荒冢的山丘。一般认为，晚上在死亡之域的山顶上点火是一个非常糟糕的主意，因为灯光会吸引周围数英里的怪物。穿越这片领土需要几天时间，在此期间，每个人都会感到紧张和警惕。",
	"The journey north lasts about forty days, and most travelers hope these days are monotonous and uneventful. This being Faerûn, that's never the case.": "北上的旅程大约持续四十天，大多数旅行者都希望这些日子是单调而不平凡的。这里是法鲁恩，情况绝非如此。",
	"Many days pass with no excitement, but others see monster attacks, strange incidents, excitement at roadside stops, meetings with NPCs, and the ever-present question of where the cult's wagons are headed. You can pace these events however you like. Use a few, use them all, or make up more of your own.": "许多天过去了，没有任何激动人心的事情发生，但也有一些日子看到了怪物袭击、奇怪的事件、路边站的兴奋、与NPC的会面，以及始终存在的问题：邪教的马车要去哪里。你可以随心所欲地安排这些事件。你可以使用几个，也可以全部使用，或者自己编造更多的事件。",
	"On a trip of this length, checking for random events every hour is excessive. The Trade Way sees a lot of travelers and it is relatively (if not entirely) safe. Check for a random event each day by rolling a {@dice d20}. On a roll of 16 or higher, one or more events occur as indicated below:": "在这么长的旅程中，每小时检查一次随机事件是过分的。贸易之路有很多旅行者，而且相对（如果不是完全）安全。每天通过滚动{@dice d20}来检查一个随机事件。如果掷出16或更高的分数，就会发生一个或多个事件，如下所示。",

	"Another group of adventurers joins the caravan or is staying at the same roadside inn. Judging by their boasting, they have bested some of the most ferocious monsters and foes Faerûn has to offer. They look prosperous, they're filled with exciting tales, and they strike up a bond with a merchant who employs one or more of the characters. The next morning, that merchant informs the characters that their services are no longer needed because he has hired more experienced guards.": "另一队冒险者加入了商队，或者住在同一家路边旅馆。从他们的吹嘘来看，他们已经战胜了法鲁恩所能提供的一些最凶猛的怪物和敌人。他们看起来很富裕，充满了令人兴奋的故事，他们与雇佣了一个或多个人物的商人建立了联系。第二天早上，那个商人通知这些人物不再需要他们的服务了，因为他已经雇佣了更有经验的卫兵。",
	"The newcomers are a troop of actors trying to pay their way to the next town. They are gambling that no danger will arise that needs them to step up and fight. When it does (as it surely will), it becomes painfully obvious that not one warrior or wizard is among them; they are five human {@creature Commoner||commoners} with charisma to burn and shiny stage props for weapons and armor. After they've been rescued from danger, the characters' former employer, now suitably chastened, is willing to hire the characters back at slightly increased wages.": "新来的人是一队演员，试图支付他们去下一个城镇的路费。他们在赌，赌不会出现需要他们站出来战斗的危险。当危险发生时（肯定会发生），人们会痛苦地发现，他们中没有一个战士或巫师；他们是五个人类（%0%），有着燃烧的魅力和闪亮的武器和盔甲的舞台道具。在他们被救出危险后，这些人物的前雇主现在得到了适当的惩罚，愿意以略微增加的工资重新雇用这些人物。",
	"One of the travelers—a {@creature noble}—is regularly seen mistreating his horses. He allows their collars and girths to chafe sores in their hide, skimps on their feed, and whips them when the aching, hungry animals don't pull hard enough or fast enough to suit him. If the characters still have their horses, he admires them and offers to buy one or more to replace the \"useless nags\" he is stuck with. Eventually, one of his horses will collapse in its harness, and he will either beat it to death in the road or cut it loose and leave it to die, unless one or more characters intervenes. He has a {@creature knight} and a {@creature mage} traveling with him as bodyguards.": "其中一个旅行者--%0%--经常被看到虐待他的马。他让马的项圈和腰带在它们的皮上摩擦生疮，吝啬它们的饲料，当这些疼痛、饥饿的动物没有足够的力气或速度来满足他时，他就鞭打它们。如果主人公还有他们的马，他就会欣赏它们，并提出买一匹或多匹马来代替他的 \"无用的马\"。最终，他的一匹马会在马具中倒下，他要么把它打死在路上，要么把它松开，让它自生自灭，除非有一个或多个人物介入。他有一个（1%）和一个（2%）作为保镖与他同行。",
	"High above, two {@creature Peryton||perytons} are watching the road for fresh hearts they can consume before laying their eggs. They circle at an altitude where they are easily mistaken for eagles.

	"One of the cult wagons overturns on a difficult corner or when a wheel breaks on a rock. Of the crates that tumble free, one smashes open, revealing dozens of beautiful items of jewelry wrapped in wool for protection. This is an excellent opportunity for the characters to see some of the contraband and even to get friendly with the cultists by helping them repair their wagon.": "其中一辆邪教马车在一个困难的转角处翻倒，或者当一个车轮在岩石上断裂时。在翻出的箱子中，有一个箱子被砸开了，露出了几十件用羊毛包裹着的美丽的珠宝。这是一个很好的机会，人物可以看到一些违禁品，甚至可以通过帮助他们修理马车而与邪教分子交好。",
	"The cult members are angry that people saw the contents of their spilled cargo. Their instructions, direct from Wyrmspeaker {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, were to keep the material secure and secret. Witnesses who show much interest in the jewelry or who ask questions might need to be silenced.

The same attacks can be directed against characters who show too much curiosity.": "邪教成员对人们看到他们泄漏的货物内容感到愤怒。他们的指示，直接来自于Wyrmspeaker（%0%），是为了保持材料的安全和秘密。对珠宝表现出很大兴趣的目击者或提出问题的人可能需要被灭口。NPC目击者可能会在一夜之间消失，或者意外地死于突发疾病（成功通过DC10智慧[{@skill Medicine}]检查后发现是中毒）。同样的攻击也可以针对那些表现出过多好奇心的角色。",
	"Someone in the caravan develops a fancy for a treasured possession that belongs to one of the characters. The NPC tries to buy it, but the offered price is low. The NPC persists through the day, becoming more obnoxious without getting any more generous. Unless the character takes special precautions, the object disappears overnight. If the character accuses the NPC publicly the following morning, they make an enduring enemy; that NPC doesn't have the item and is incensed at the accusation. Someone else who witnessed the conversations the day before decided the other NPC provided perfect cover for a little nighttime thievery and took the missing item. To find the item, characters need to surreptitiously search people's bags and wagons, since few people will agree to have their belongings rifled through as if they were common thieves—especially not a common thief.": "商队中有人看上了属于某个角色的珍贵物品。这个NPC试图买下它，但出价很低。这名NPC坚持了一整天，变得更加令人讨厌，但却没有变得更加慷慨。除非角色采取特殊的预防措施，否则该物品会在一夜之间消失。如果这个角色在第二天早上公开指责这个NPC，他们就会成为一个持久的敌人；这个NPC没有这个物品，并且对这个指责感到愤怒。前一天目睹了这些对话的其他人认为另一个NPC为夜间偷窃提供了完美的掩护，并拿走了丢失的物品。为了找到物品，人物需要偷偷地搜查人们的袋子和马车，因为很少有人会同意把他们的物品当作普通的小偷来翻阅，尤其是普通的小偷。",
	"After two days and nights of rain, lightning, and strange whistling sounds on the wind, characters awaken to see that the surrounding countryside is blanketed with fungus. It grows everywhere, including on the road. When anyone steps on a mushroom (it's nearly impossible not to), it emits a puff of black spores and a moan of pain. These tiny shriekers sprout from an immense mycelium that has spread beneath the area from shallow caves. They can be identified with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, but if the roll is 10–14, the character misidentifies them and believes they are deadly poisonous (they aren't).": "经过两天两夜的雨水、闪电和风中奇怪的呼啸声，人物醒来后看到周围的乡村被真菌所覆盖。它到处生长，包括在路上。当有人踩到蘑菇时（几乎不可能不踩到），它会发出一蓬黑色的孢子和痛苦的呻吟。这些细小的尖叫声是从一个巨大的菌丝体中萌发出来的，这个菌丝体已经从浅层洞穴蔓延到了该地区的下面。只要成功地进行DC15智力（（%0%））检查，就可以识别它们，但如果卷轴是10-14，角色就会误认它们，认为它们有致命的毒性（它们不是）。",
	"The merchants are terrified of the things and refuse to drive through them, fearing that they may be poisonous or worse. Besides that, the sounds spook the animals and make them impossible to control.": "商人们对这些东西感到恐惧，拒绝开车通过它们，担心它们可能有毒或更糟糕。除此之外，这些声音还惊动了动物，使它们无法控制。",
	"The mushrooms are growing so fast on the rain-soaked ground that a person can almost see them getting bigger. They were the size of champagne corks when first noticed; within an hour, they grow six inches tall, and a foot tall an hour later. Their growth slows down after that, but by then, most people in the caravan are certain that all is doomed.": "蘑菇在被雨水浸泡的地面上生长得非常快，人们几乎可以看到它们在变大。第一次注意到它们时，它们只有香槟酒瓶大小；一小时内，它们长到六英寸高，一小时后长到一英尺高。此后，它们的生长速度放缓，但到那时，大篷车里的大多数人都确信一切都注定了。",
	"Anyone can literally sweep a path through the mushrooms with a heavy broom, a scythe, or a tree branch. The noise is distressing. Everyone involved in this process must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character is overcome with feelings of grief and remorse, seemingly triggered by hearing thousands of tiny cries of pain and death groans but which is in fact the result of inhaling mildly toxic spores released by the immature fungi. Affected characters break down after {@dice 1d20} minutes and simply can't face those sounds anymore. They have nightmares for days to come, until the toxin is completely out of their system. You can impose even more lingering results if you like, such as a lifelong aversion to eating mushrooms of any kind.": "任何人都可以用一把沉重的扫帚、一把镰刀或一根树枝在蘑菇中扫出一条路。噪声是令人不安的。参与这一过程的每个人都必须做一个DC10的宪法救赎动作。失败意味着角色被悲伤和悔恨的情绪所征服，似乎是由于听到成千上万细小的痛苦叫声和死亡呻吟而引发的，但实际上是由于吸入了未成熟真菌释放的轻度毒性孢子的结果。受影响的人物在（%0%）分钟后崩溃，根本无法再面对这些声音。他们会在未来几天做噩梦，直到毒素完全从他们的系统中排出。如果你愿意的话，你可以施加更多挥之不去的结果，比如终生厌恶吃任何种类的蘑菇。",

	"On a beautiful, sunny afternoon, a herd of {@creature deer} is spotted grazing on a nearby hill. The travelers take such opportunities to hunt fresh meat for the larder. This herd, however, includes a magnificent stag (use {@creature elk} statistics) that shimmers in the light as if its coat is spun from gold and its antlers plated with platinum. Nearly everyone in the caravan who can handle a bow wants to bring down that beast. Its pelt would be worth a fortune, even if it's not real gold. A few of the more cautious types warn that the creature is clearly a blessed being and that killing it would bring bad luck on the caravan, but no more than two or three people are persuaded. In minutes, the hunt is on, and the deer herd scatters into the nearby forest and through farmers' fields.": "在一个美丽的、阳光明媚的下午，人们发现一群（%0%）在附近的山上吃草。旅行者们利用这样的机会为储藏室猎取新鲜肉类。然而，这群鹿包括一只雄伟的雄鹿（使用（1%）统计），在灯光下闪闪发光，仿佛它的外衣是用金子纺成的，它的鹿角是用铂金镀成的。商队中几乎所有能驾驭弓箭的人都想打倒那只野兽。它的皮毛将价值连城，即使它不是真正的黄金。有几个比较谨慎的人警告说，这个生物显然是一个被祝福的生物，杀死它将给商队带来厄运，但被说服的人不超过两三个。几分钟后，狩猎开始了，鹿群散落在附近的森林和农民的田地中。",
	"The characters can join the chase, try to talk people down, protect the stag, or ignore the situation, as they see fit. It can be tracked through the forest with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. A new check must be made every 500 yards.": "角色们可以加入追逐，试图说服人们，保护雄鹿，或者无视这种情况，只要他们认为合适。只要成功通过DC 10智慧（（%0%））检查，就可以在森林中追踪它。每500码必须进行一次新的检查。",

	"The stag can be cornered, fought, and killed. It is a normal stag but with a breathtakingly beautiful coat of golden fur. If the local farmers learn that it's been killed, they grab their pitchforks and longbows and threaten to overrun the caravan unless they are paid 500 gp for their loss; the stag brought them luck.": "雄鹿可以被逼到墙角，与之搏斗，并被杀死。它是一只普通的雄鹿，但却有着漂亮得令人窒息的金色皮毛。如果当地的农民知道它被杀了，他们会拿起干草叉和长弓，威胁要攻占商队，除非他们得到500金币的损失赔偿；雄鹿给他们带来了好运。",
	"The stag greets the characters in Sylvan. If none of the characters speak that language, it switches to Elvish, and if no one responds again, it tries heavily accented, pidgin Common. It assures them that they are on the right track, and they must continue following the river of gold until they reach the castle in the sky. Sadly, their path will be filled with hardship and blood. To aid them, it offers the character a +1 longbow. The bow appears on the ground before them, and then the stag fades from view saying, \"Not all will survive...\"": "雄鹿用西尔凡语向人物打招呼。如果没有人说这种语言，它就换成精灵语，如果再没有人回应，它就试着用口音很重的普通话。它向他们保证，他们在正确的轨道上，他们必须继续沿着黄金之河前进，直到他们到达天空中的城堡。不幸的是，他们的道路将充满艰辛和血腥。为了帮助他们，它为角色提供了一把+1的长弓。弓出现在他们面前的地面上，然后雄鹿从视野中消失，说：\"不是所有人都能活下来......\"",
	"When the characters search the tumbled ruins, they find no sign of the stag but see a thin person who resembles a wood elf with bright golden skin. The young male is naked and either is wearing an antlered headpiece or has delicate antlers growing from his head. He drops to his knees and beseeches the characters in a dialect of Elvish that is archaic but understandable. He is an elf prince, and the stones around them were once the beautiful castle where he ruled. But he was cursed by the father of the woman he loved to transform into a {@creature golden stag|HotDQ} whenever he steps outside these walls. He has lived with the curse for so long that his kingdom is forgotten, his castle is fallen to ruin, and he no longer remembers his own name. He believes that a wizard somewhere can release him from the curse, but wherever he goes, people try to kill him for his golden coat. If the characters allow him to accompany them and protect him, he will do his best to reward them at the end of the journey. The story is true; several wizards in Waterdeep could remove the curse. The elf cannot pay a reward at the end, but the characters earn 500 XP apiece for believing him and protecting him. That job won't be easy, because people in the caravan find their story ridiculous and look for opportunities to kill the stag.": "当人物搜索翻滚的废墟时，他们没有发现雄鹿的踪迹，但看到一个瘦小的人，他类似于木精灵，有着明亮的金色皮肤。这个年轻的男性赤身裸体，要么戴着鹿角的头饰，要么头上长着精致的鹿角。他跪在地上，用一种古老但可以理解的精灵语方言恳求这些人物。他是一位精灵王子，他们周围的石头曾经是他统治的美丽城堡。但他被他所爱的女人的父亲诅咒了，只要他走出这些墙，就会变成一个（%0%）。他带着这个诅咒生活了这么久，以至于他的王国被遗忘，他的城堡沦为废墟，他也不再记得自己的名字。他相信某个地方的巫师可以把他从诅咒中解救出来，但无论他走到哪里，人们都想为了他的金衣而杀死他。如果人物允许他陪伴他们并保护他，他将在旅程结束后尽力回报他们。这个故事是真的；水底城的几个巫师可以解除诅咒。精灵不能在最后支付奖励，但角色们因为相信他并保护他而每人获得500XP。这项工作并不容易，因为商队里的人觉得他们的故事很荒谬，并寻找机会杀死雄鹿。",
	"As the caravan rounds a bend in the road, a human head can be seen sitting in the middle of the road a hundred yards ahead. From a distance, characters with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher recognize that the head is actually a person buried up to the neck, and he is {@condition unconscious} but still alive. That fact is obvious to anyone who approaches within 10 yards, as is the word \"Oathbreaker\" painted on his forehead.": "当商队绕过一个弯道时，可以看到一个人头坐在前面一百码的路中间。从远处看，被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在15分以上的人物可以认出，这个头颅实际上是一个被埋到脖子的人，他是{@condition unconscious}但仍然活着。这个事实对任何接近10码以内的人来说都是显而易见的，就像他额头上画着的 \"Oathbreaker \"字样。",

It's obvious from wheel tracks on the turned-over earth that other wagons have indeed passed him by during the last few days.": "商队中的许多商人都认为，不管他是谁，如果有人或东西费尽心思把他标记为叛徒并把他埋在贸易路上，那么他可能是活该，应该被留在那里。如果人物是为NPC商人工作的守卫，那么他们的雇主中至少有一个是在这群人中。从翻过的土地上的车轮痕迹可以看出，在过去的几天里，确实有其他马车从他身边经过。",

	"If any of the characters are Harpers and they reveal their association to Amoffel, he tells them the real story. He was on exactly the same mission they are: tracking a shipment of stolen loot north. But the smugglers—he's sure they're members of the Cult of the Dragon—became suspicious of him. Amoffel passed information to another Harper at a roadside inn, and members of the caravan witnessed the meeting. The cultists manufactured a story that he was passing information to bandits. The merchants were unwilling to kill him outright, but they were willing to leave him buried in the road and \"let providence decide the man's fate.\"": "如果任何一个角色是哈珀人，他们向阿莫菲尔透露了他们的关系，他就会告诉他们真实的情况。他的任务和他们一模一样：追踪一批被盗战利品的北上。但是那些走私者--他确信他们是 \"龙之教 \"的成员--对他产生了怀疑。Amoffel将信息传递给路边旅馆的另一个哈珀，商队成员目睹了这次会面。邪教分子制造了一个故事，说他在向土匪传递信息。商人们不愿意直接杀死他，但他们愿意把他埋在路上，\"让天意决定这个人的命运\"。",

Upon entering the warm, comfortable common room to make arrangements for the night, the embarrassed innkeeper tells the characters that the entire inn is sold out; all the private rooms are taken and the common room is reserved for a private party. The caravan will need to spend the night outside. Looking around the room, the characters see just one group: an aristocratic judge and his entourage of three human dilettantes. They smirk at the characters while making comments such as \"sleep tight\" and \"have a pleasant evening\" followed by insults muttered under their breath about the characters' mud-spattered clothing and low breeding. If characters ask about sleeping in the stable, one of the nobles speaks up, saying, \"Our horses are rather picky about who they share space with. We had to reserve all of it, too, for their sake.

	"Spending this night in the wagons will be hard on the characters but will be misery for the unprotected horses and mules, and the only reason for it is the cruelty and arrogance of these snickering twits in the inn.": "在马车上度过这个夜晚，对人物来说是艰难的，但对没有保护的马匹和骡子来说却是痛苦的，而唯一的原因是旅店里这些窃笑的笨蛋的残忍和傲慢。",

They are chiefly interested in taking horses, not merchandise, but they won't balk at taking people if they can't get horses. Two ettercaps go after horses while the third ettercap and the giant spiders keep the caravan guards busy. An ettercap can cut a horse free from its harness in 3 rounds. After that, they retreat into the trees, leading the horse away with reins of webbing. Without horses, the wagons are stranded. The characters' employer insists they go after the ettercaps and retrieve the stolen horses.": "贸易之路绕过巨大的巨魔树皮森林和迷雾森林，并在它们之间穿行，但它也会经过许多其他的、较小的森林，这些森林并没有出现在地图上。当商队经过一个这样的林区时，有三个（%0%）和两个（%1%）的人攻击它。他们主要是为了抢夺马匹，而不是商品，但如果得不到马匹，他们也会毫不犹豫地抢人。两只伊特帽去追赶马匹，而第三只伊特帽和巨型蜘蛛则让商队的守卫忙个不停。一只ETTERCAP可以在3个回合内将一匹马从马具中解救出来。之后，它们会退到树上，用网状物的缰绳牵着马走。没有马匹，马车就会被搁浅。人物的雇主坚持要他们去追捕伊特卡普，找回被盗的马匹。",
	"If the characters move quickly, they have a good chance to retrieve the horses alive. The animals leave a trail through the underbrush that's easy to follow; a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check is sufficient to keep on it. The horses are led away about half a mile to the ettercaps' lair. If characters charge straight in, they are attacked by three {@creature Ettercap||ettercaps} and two {@creature Giant Spider||giant spiders}. If they pause to observe for a few minutes, they see the ettercaps shoo the giant spiders away while they prepare for their feast of horse meat. The characters can then fight just the ettercaps for 6 rounds, before the spiders return to the sound of battle. The characters can't delay for long, however, because the ettercaps won't waste much time before killing and tucking into the horses.": "如果人物行动迅速，他们有很大的机会活捉马匹。这些动物在灌木丛中留下了一条很容易追踪的痕迹；成功通过DC 10智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查就可以继续追踪。马匹被牵着走了大约半英里，来到埃特卡普的巢穴。如果角色直接冲进去，他们会被三个（%1%）和两个（%2%）的攻击。如果他们停下来观察几分钟，就会看到伊特卡普把巨蛛赶走，同时准备吃马肉大餐。然后，角色们可以只与ettercaps战斗6个回合，然后蜘蛛们就会回到战斗的声音中。然而，角色们不能耽搁太久，因为在杀死马匹并将其塞进嘴里之前，蚀刻兽不会浪费太多的时间。",

	"The caravan sees a fight happening ahead. A freight wagon is stranded on the road, its draft animals dead. A merchant ({@creature noble}) and three {@creature Guard||guards} are sheltered under the wagon, with crates dragged between the wheels for cover. They are plentifully supplied with crossbows and bolts, but the six {@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins} and one {@creature hobgoblin captain} assailing them seem content to keep them under siege until sundown, when they plan to rush the wagon with darkness as cover. These are Urshani hobgoblins, recognizable by their unusually savage appearance (even for hobgoblins). Urshani hobgoblins adorn themselves with wolf furs, paint worg heads onto their shields, and incorporate other wolf parts and icons in their armor and clothing.": "商队看到前面发生了一场战斗。一辆货运马车滞留在路上，车上的牲畜已经死亡。一个商人({@creature noble})和三个{@creature Guard||guards}躲在马车下面，用拖在车轮之间的箱子做掩护。他们有充足的弩和弓箭，但袭击他们的六个（%2%）和一个（%3%）似乎满足于将他们围困到日落时分，他们打算以黑暗为掩护冲向马车。这些是乌尔萨尼的妖精，他们的外表异常野蛮（即使对妖精来说也是如此），是可以识别的。乌尔沙尼妖精用狼皮装饰自己，在他们的盾牌上画上狼头，并在他们的盔甲和衣服中加入其他狼的部件和图标。",
	"First the hobgoblins must be driven off, then the injured attended to, and then something must be done about the stranded wagon.

	"If the characters spent much time wandering through the raiders' camp on the Greenfields and talking to cultists, they might have struck up a conversation there with a cultist who is now one of the wagon drivers. Have each character make a Charisma check on the first day of the journey, but don't tell players what it's for. At some point during the journey, the character who scored the lowest result on the Charisma check is recognized by a cultist. The cultists assume that, at best, the character must be a deserter from the cult. At worst, he or she is a spy and a saboteur. At a dramatic point on the journey, when the caravan is away from Baldur's Gate, this means trouble.": "如果角色们花了很多时间在绿地上的突袭者营地徘徊，并与邪教分子交谈，他们可能会在那里与现在是马车司机之一的邪教分子交谈。让每个角色在旅程的第一天做一个魅力检查，但不要告诉玩家这是为了什么。在旅途中的某个时刻，在魅力检查中得分最低的角色被一个邪教分子认出。邪教分子认为，最好的情况是，这个角色一定是邪教的逃兵。最糟糕的是，他或她是一个间谍和破坏者。在旅途中的一个戏剧性时刻，当商队离开博德之门时，这意味着麻烦。",

	"If a character is recognized, allow that character to make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. Success means the character catches a cultist watching him or her suspiciously, noting who the character talks to, when the character eats, and where the character sleeps. Over the course of a few days, it should become obvious that this cultist has recognized the character. If characters delay taking action, the cultists strike first by trying to assassinate the characters in their bedrolls or perhaps by arranging an accident—a loose wheel, broken axle, or spooked lead horse might be an effective way to solve a problem. The only permanent solution to this problem for the characters is murder; the cultist with suspicions must be eliminated before he or she shares those suspicions with the others. Good characters may be reluctant to take this step; that's roleplaying. If they can find another way, that's excellent, but once the opposition recognizes someone, the situation is likely to end in death.": "如果一个角色被认出，允许该角色进行DC15智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查。成功意味着该角色抓到了一个邪教徒在怀疑地看着他或她，注意到该角色与谁交谈，什么时候吃饭，以及在哪里睡觉。在几天的时间里，应该可以明显看出这个邪教徒已经认出了这个角色。如果角色迟迟不采取行动，邪教分子就会先下手为强，试图暗杀躺在床铺上的角色，或者也许会安排一场意外--松动的车轮、断裂的车轴或受惊的铅马可能是解决问题的有效方法。对人物来说，解决这个问题的唯一永久办法是谋杀；必须在有怀疑的邪教分子与其他人分享这些怀疑之前将其消灭掉。好的角色可能不愿意采取这个步骤；这就是角色扮演。如果他们能找到其他的方法，那是极好的，但一旦反对派认出了某人，情况很可能以死亡告终。",
	"The day after the caravan leaves Daggerford, have each character make a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check.

	"10–12: The character notices that the gnome who recently joined the caravan shows an interest in the human who joined at the same time and who was welcomed aboard one of the cult wagons as a passenger. They aren't together, but during stops, the gnome often sidles up near enough to overhear anything the human might say, and she has also been spotted hovering near the cult wagons when the cultists are busy with tasks other than guarding the wagons closely.": "10-12: 这个人物注意到，最近加入商队的地精对同时加入的人类表现出兴趣，他被欢迎上了邪教的一辆马车，成为一名乘客。他们并不在一起，但在停留期间，地精经常靠近，足以听到人类可能说的话，而且她还被发现在邪教马车附近徘徊，当时邪教人员正忙于除严密看守马车之外的工作。",

	"After poking through your oatmeal with the blade of her dagger, the gnome lifts it out and shows you an oatmeal-smeared object resembling a tiny bead. She glances over her shoulder toward where cultists sit at their breakfast. \"It's a sliver of bone,\" she whispers, \"curled into a circle so you can swallow it in a mouthful of gruel without noticing. Once eaten, it slowly uncurls inside you, exposing needle points that pierce your guts and kill you slowly. I suspect they're in all your breakfasts.\" As she gets up and walks away, she adds, \"Let's talk this evening.\"": "用匕首的刀刃捅破你的燕麦片后，地精把燕麦片拿出来，给你看一个沾满燕麦片的物体，类似于一个小珠子。她朝邪教分子坐着吃早餐的地方瞥了一眼。\"这是一片骨头，\"她低声说，\"卷成一个圆圈，这样你就可以在不知不觉中把它吞进一口粥里。一旦被吃掉，它就会在你体内慢慢展开，露出针尖，刺穿你的内脏，慢慢杀死你。我怀疑它们就在你所有的早餐里。\" 当她起身走开时，她补充说：\"今晚我们来谈谈。\"",
	"No more bone slivers are in the characters' gruel. The one Gleamsilver showed them was already stuck to the underside of her dagger before she poked it into the bowl. If characters dig through their oatmeal looking for slivers, let them make DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) checks. If a check succeeds, tell them they find several small lumps that might be bone slivers, but they might just as easily be oat husks, sawdust, or insect eggs. Also tell them that two of the cultists keep looking in their direction but appear to be trying to hide their interest.": "人物的稀饭里不再有骨片了。在她把匕首捅进碗里之前，Gleamsilver给他们看的那块已经粘在她的匕首下面了。如果人物翻开他们的燕麦粥寻找碎片，让他们进行DC15智力（（%0%））检查。如果检查成功，告诉他们找到了几个小块，可能是骨片，但也可能是燕麦壳、锯末或昆虫卵。还要告诉他们，有两个邪教徒一直在朝他们的方向看，但似乎在试图掩饰他们的兴趣。",

	"Gleamsilver is especially cagey about why she's interested in all this. The gnome never mentions the Zhentarim or the Black Network. She never comes out and says she works for the Harpers, either. Gleamsilver is an expert at picking up on the subtlest clues and using them to seem to know things she doesn't actually know and to say what people want or expect to hear.

	"Two days after \"Who's Your Friend?\" happens, the camp awakens to a killing. One of the cultists acting as a wagon guard was murdered overnight. He was stabbed in the back with a sword (the wound is too big to be from a dagger) and left where he fell beneath a cult wagon.": "在 \"谁是你的朋友？\"发生两天后，营地被一场杀戮惊醒。一个充当马车警卫的邪教分子在一夜之间被谋杀了。他被人用剑刺中背部（伤口太大，不可能是匕首造成的），然后被丢在邪教马车下面。",
	"The dead man's companions immediately accuse one of the characters and demand to inspect the characters' weapons. If the character carries a shortsword, it will be a match, although that proves nothing. Any sword that size would be close enough. Many footprints are around the wagon, but a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check determines that they are all from people crowding around the body in the morning. The ground was swept during the night to remove prints.": "死者的同伴们立即指责其中一个角色，并要求检查角色的武器。如果该人物携带短剑，那就可以匹配，尽管这不能证明什么。任何这么大的剑都足够接近了。马车周围有许多脚印，但成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查后，可以确定这些脚印都是早上挤在尸体周围的人留下的。地面在夜里被清扫过，以清除脚印。",
	"By this point in the journey, the characters should be popular with the other travelers; they probably have saved numerous lives and the entire caravan more than once. The cultists, on the other hand, are not so popular. They are standoffish and even a bit odd. This works in the accused character's favor, because many people will speak up in his or her defense.": "到了这个时候，这些人物应该受到其他旅行者的欢迎；他们可能不止一次地拯救了无数的生命和整个商队。另一方面，邪教分子却不那么受欢迎。他们很冷漠，甚至有点古怪。这对被指控的人物有利，因为很多人会为他或她辩护。",
	"If a character suggests that the wagon's owners should open their crates to see if anything is missing, the accusations die away. (If a character doesn't suggest this, an onlooker in the crowd does.) Uncharacteristically, {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} comes forward and tries to calm the situation, in the process saying more than anyone has so far heard him say at one time.": "如果有一个人物建议马车的主人打开箱子看看是否有什么东西丢失，指责声就会消失。(如果一个角色不建议这样做，那么人群中的一个旁观者就会这样做。)一反常态，{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}站出来试图平息事态，在这个过程中，他说的话比至今为止大家听到的都多。",
	"In the end, the caravan's most prominent merchants agree that without witnesses, nothing can be done. The gods will punish the guilty party and life will go on.": "最后，商队中最著名的商人同意，没有证人，什么也做不了。诸神会惩罚有罪的一方，生活会继续下去。",
	"Most of the cultists never again look at the accused character with anything but undisguised hatred. This animosity becomes important later on in {@adventure chapter 5|HotDQ|5}.": "大多数邪教分子再也不会用任何东西来看待被指控的角色，而只是毫不掩饰地憎恨。这种敌意在后来的（%0%）中变得很重要。",
	"The murderer was, of course, {@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}. Knowing what was in the cargo, she couldn't resist helping herself to some. The theft itself is undetectable, because she left no signs, and the cult isn't carrying a manifest of its looted treasure. The guard interrupted her in the act and had to die; it was just that simple.": "凶手当然是（%0%）。知道货物里有什么，她忍不住帮自己拿了一些。盗窃本身是无法察觉的，因为她没有留下任何痕迹，而且邪教也没有携带其掠夺的宝物的清单。警卫打断了她的行为，不得不死；事情就是这么简单。",
	"The freight travels as far north as possible, following the Trade Way past Waterdeep to where the great road was swallowed up by the ever-expanding Mere of Dead Men. A fortified roadhouse that once served merchants and teamsters now feeds laborers and safeguards road-building supplies, and it also aids the Cult of the Dragon in smuggling its treasure.": "货物尽可能地往北走，沿着贸易之路经过沃特迪普（Waterdeep），到了那条大路被不断扩大的死人谷吞没的地方。一个曾经为商人和卡车司机服务的坚固的路屋现在为劳工提供食物，并保护筑路物资，它还帮助龙之教偷运宝藏。",
	"When the caravan rolls into Waterdeep after two months on the road, most of the merchants disperse to the city's markets, warehouses, and stables. They've reached their destination and the characters are paid off in silver and thanked for their service. If they performed well, they're told they can find work with these shippers any time in the future. Characters can't waste much time closing accounts with their own employers or sightseeing in Waterdeep, however, or they lose the treasure wagons in the crowded metropolis.": "当商队在路上行驶了两个月后驶入沃特迪普时，大部分的商人都分散到了城市的市场、仓库和马厩。他们已经到达了目的地，这些人物得到了银币的报酬，并感谢他们的服务。如果他们表现良好，他们被告知可以在未来任何时候在这些货主那里找到工作。然而，角色们不能浪费太多的时间与自己的雇主结账或在沃特德普观光，否则他们就会在这个拥挤的大都市中失去宝藏马车。",
	"The cult wagons don't follow the same pattern as the others from the caravan. Instead, they head for the north side of the city before looking for a place to spend the night. Everyone who the characters know to be associated with the cult gathers at the same spot by nightfall. {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} remains with the cultists during this time, and Jamna expresses her desire to stick with them until they uncover the treasure's destination.": "邪教的马车并不像商队中的其他人那样遵循同样的模式。相反，他们在寻找过夜的地方之前，先去了城市的北面。在夜幕降临前，所有人物知道的与邪教有关的人都聚集在同一地点。在这段时间里，{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}仍然和邪教分子在一起，贾姆娜表示她希望和他们在一起，直到他们发现宝藏的目的地。",
	"The cultists spend a day resting their horses at a stable on the north side of Waterdeep. Other wagons are already there, covertly carrying treasure from all over the Sword Coast to the collection point. During the day, some of the cultists visit a large warehouse just inside the northern city gate, where construction supplies are stockpiled for shipment north and where wagons are gathered and loaded for the trip.": "崇拜者们在沃特德普北侧的一个马厩里花了一天时间休息马匹。其他马车已经在那里了，暗中把来自剑海岸各地的财宝运到收集点。白天，一些邪教徒去了北面城门内的一个大仓库，那里囤积着准备向北运送的建筑用品，马车也在那里集结并装车准备出行。",
	"If characters ask around Waterdeep's northern gate about anyone matching {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s description, they hear rumors of a half-dragon being sighted in the area at least a tenday ago. Everyone remembers the incident; chromatic half-dragons are almost never seen, and they tend to cause alarm when they are. If the rumor is true, then the half-dragon was traveling with a strong escort of mounted guards, headed north. The rumor is true, of course, but it can't be confirmed 100 percent.": "如果人物在沃特德普的北门附近询问符合{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}描述的人，他们会听到关于至少在一天前在该地区看到一条半龙的传闻。每个人都记得这件事；半龙人几乎从未见过，而且他们一旦出现就会引起恐慌。如果传言属实，那么这条半龙是在强大的骑兵护卫下，向北行驶的。当然，这个传言是真的，但不能百分之百确认。",
	"By asking around, characters learn that the road to the north, called the High Road, used to connect Waterdeep to the city of Neverwinter. A cold, coastal marsh called the Mere of Dead Men lay between the road and the coast. Over the years, the mere continually expanded. Each time it grew, it flooded the road, which had to be relocated farther inland. That was the situation until a century ago, when Neverwinter was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow. With the city in ruins, efforts to keep the road open simply stopped. It no longer served a purpose.": "通过打听，人物了解到北边的道路被称为 \"高路\"，曾经连接沃特德普和永冬城。在道路和海岸之间有一片寒冷的沿海沼泽，叫做 \"死人之丘\"。多年来，这个沼泽不断地扩大。每次它的增长都会淹没公路，公路不得不迁往更远的内陆。这种情况一直持续到一个世纪前，当时永夜城几乎被霍特诺山的喷发所摧毁。随着城市成为废墟，保持道路畅通的努力也随之停止。它不再有任何作用了。",
	"But now, Lord Neverember is rebuilding Neverwinter and the road is needed again. The warehouse visited by the cultists is where shipments of supplies to the road-building camps are coordinated. If freight haulers went there, it must have been to see if they could haul supplies to the road-head for pay. Are they hiring guards for supply caravans? Sure, you bet they are. The Mere of Dead Men is wild and dangerous. Lord Neverember's agents in this endeavor are perpetually looking for laborers to build the road and fighters to protect the laborers. Turnover in those jobs is pretty high.": "但现在，永夜城主正在重建永夜城，又需要这条路了。邪教分子访问的仓库是协调向筑路营地运送物资的地方。如果货运商去了那里，一定是想看看他们是否能把物资拉到路头来换取报酬。他们在为补给品商队雇用警卫吗？当然，你打赌他们是。死人谷是狂野而危险的。纽伦堡勋爵在这方面的代理人一直在寻找修路的工人和保护工人的战士。这些工作的流失率是相当高的。",
	"The characters have no trouble getting hired as wagon escorts at the supply warehouse. Unlike in the caravan, guards are not hired by individual wagon masters but by the High Road Charter Company, a consortium of guilds and noble houses partnered with Lord Neverember. A human {@creature veteran} named Ardred Briferhew commands the entire convoy. It consists of six supply wagons, twelve escorts (including the characters and Jamna), and two dozen laborers marching out to relieve a group that is coming back to Waterdeep for some time off. Those cultists who weren't hired as teamsters for their three wagons are coming along as laborers.": "角色们在补给仓库被雇佣为马车护卫并不困难。与商队不同的是，护卫不是由各个马车主人雇佣的，而是由高路特许公司雇佣的，该公司是一个与Neverember勋爵合作的行会和贵族之家的联合体。一个名叫阿德雷德-布里费休的人类（%0%）指挥着整个车队。它由六辆补给车、十二名护卫（包括人物和贾姆纳）以及二十几名劳工组成，行进中的他们是为了接替一个要回水底世界休息一段时间的团体。那些没有被雇佣为三辆马车的队友的邪教徒们都是作为劳工来的。",

On the seventh night, the convoy camps on a hilltop from which characters have their first sight of the Mere of Dead Men. It is a chill tangle of trees, brush, boggy ground, standing water, reeds, and cat-tails stretching farther than the eye can see. The rest of the trip is within sight of the mere. The destination is reached sometime on the tenth day.": "车队要去的工作营地位于海岸线上200英里处。在这段距离的大部分时间里，道路蜿蜒穿过依偎在剑山和大海之间的粗糙的沿海山丘。第七天晚上，车队在一个山顶上扎营，从那里，人们第一次看到了死亡之谷。这是一个由树木、灌木、沼泽地、积水、芦苇和猫尾草组成的寒冷的纠结体，延伸到了人们视线所及的范围。其余的行程都在视线范围内。目的地在第十天的某个时候到达。",

Only the camp superintendent, a burly half-orc known only as Bog Luck (use {@creature veteran} statistics), has a key to that inner room.": "当马车从南方抵达时，每次有一到两辆被带入大院进行卸货，然后被移回外面停放。大院里挤满了食物、木材以及装在板条箱和木桶里的无数其他物资。不能暴露在阴冷潮湿的天气下或特别有价值的物资被存放在仓库（3号区域），任何有价值的东西都被存放在仓库（4号区域）附属的上锁的坚固房间。只有营地管理员，一个粗壮的半兽人，只知道他叫Bog Luck（使用（%0%）统计），有那间内屋的钥匙。",
	"Bog Luck was recruited to the Cult of the Dragon years ago. The only outward sign of this is the scabbard of his ever-present shortsword, which is decorated with a dragon resembling the designs on the scabbards characters saw in the dragon hatchery (and possibly have with them still; see {@area area 12|0d1|x} in that section). When cult wagons arrive, their road-building cargo is unloaded into the compound normally, but Bog Luck ensures that the contraband is stored in the strong room. Afterward, he goes into the strong room alone and paints a symbol onto each carton belonging to the cult.": "博格莱克多年前就被招入了龙的崇拜。唯一的外在标志是他随身携带的短剑的剑鞘，剑鞘上装饰着一条龙，与人物在龙的孵化场看到的剑鞘上的图案很相似（可能还带着，见该部分的（%0%））。当邪教马车到达时，他们的筑路货物被正常卸到院子里，但博格-勒克确保违禁品被存放在坚固的房间里。之后，他独自进入坚固的房间，在每个属于邪教的纸箱上画上一个符号。",
	"In the floor of the strong room is a camouflaged trapdoor. It can be found with a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. The trapdoor connects to a dripping, slimy tunnel that runs 500 yards into a dense stand of trees and brush at the edge of the Mere of Dead Men. At night, when everyone in the compound is asleep except for a few rooftop guards, lizardfolk creep through the tunnel and take the marked crates to a location in the mere (the subject of {@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}). They seldom perform this task over a single night unless the shipment is very small. Typically they take one night per wagon.": "在强壮房间的地板上有一个伪装的活板门。通过DC10智慧（（%0%））检查可以找到它。活板门连接着一条滴水的、粘稠的隧道，这条隧道延伸了500码，进入了死人谷边缘的一片茂密的树木和灌木。晚上，除了几个屋顶上的守卫外，院子里的人都在睡觉，蜥蜴人蹑手蹑脚地穿过隧道，把有标记的箱子带到麦地里的一个地方（{@adventure chapter 6|HotDQ|6}的主题）。他们很少在一个晚上完成这项任务，除非这批货物非常小。通常情况下，他们每辆马车需要一个晚上。",
	"Most of the time, this open courtyard is crowded with crates, barrels, and stacks of supplies. The damp climate means that the ground is muddy, except when the temperature is below freezing. Then the mud hardens into uneven, frost-covered ruts. A path is kept clear from the gate to the stables so animals can be moved, but during busy times, that path often runs under the balcony in front of the doors to the rooms.": "大多数时候，这个开放的院子里挤满了板条箱、木桶和成堆的物资。潮湿的气候意味着地面是泥泞的，除非温度低于冰点。然后，泥浆会硬化成不平整的、覆盖着霜的车辙。从大门到马厩有一条小路保持畅通，以便动物能够被移动，但在繁忙的时候，这条小路经常从房间门前的阳台下穿过。",
	"In some ways, the stables are the most comfortable area of the compound. When the stables are crowded, the horses' and mules' body heat keeps the building warm. Four stable boys take care of the animals and sleep here. Only the youngest, a quick-witted boy called Wump, has any suspicion that something mysterious is going on. He knows nothing about the Cult of the Dragon, but he's sharp enough to wonder why anything used by the road builders needs to be locked up.": "在某些方面，马厩是大院里最舒适的地方。当马厩拥挤时，马匹和骡子的体温使建筑物保持温暖。四个马厩男孩负责照顾动物，并在这里睡觉。只有最年轻的，一个叫Wump的机灵男孩，对发生的神秘事情有所怀疑。他对神龙教一无所知，但他足够敏锐，想知道为什么筑路工人使用的任何东西都需要被锁起来。",
	"The warehouse door is latched but unlocked. Supplies that shouldn't be left exposed to the weather are stored here: food for the people and fodder for animals.": "仓库的门是锁着的，但没有上锁。不应该暴露在天气下的物资都存放在这里：人们的食物和动物的饲料。",
	"Unusually valuable cargoes and personal items are kept in the strong room under lock and key. None of the workers know or care what sorts of road-building supplies are considered so valuable they must be locked up for protection. They just follow Bog Luck's instructions and stack things where they're told to stack them.": "异常珍贵的货物和个人物品被锁在坚固的房间里。没有一个工人知道或关心什么样的筑路物资被认为是非常有价值的，必须被锁起来保护。他们只是听从博格-勒克的指示，把东西堆放在他们被要求堆放的地方。",
	"Since the sleeping rooms can't be locked, workers and teamsters often have Bog Luck lock their cash and other valuables into the strong room for safekeeping. He keeps a record in a ledger book of all the personal items stored there and has a reputation for being meticulous about making sure everyone gets their belongings back—all of their belongings and {@i only} their belongings.": "由于寝室不能上锁，工人和团队成员经常让博格-勒克将他们的现金和其他贵重物品锁进强壮的房间保管。他把所有存放在那里的个人物品记录在账本上，并以一丝不苟地确保每个人都能拿回自己的物品--所有的物品和（%0%）他们的物品而闻名。",

	"The trapdoor is located in the southeast corner of the room. An empty crate nailed onto the door covers it; when the door is opened, the whole crate tips toward the north. Being nailed to the floor, the crate feels solid and full to a casual bump or shove. Only when it's tipped does the trick become obvious. It can be discovered with a thorough 20-minute search of the room or with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "活板门位于房间的东南角。一个钉在门上的空板条箱盖住了它；当门被打开时，整个板条箱向北倾斜。由于钉在地板上，板条箱感觉很结实，随便一撞或一推就满了。只有当它被推倒时，这一招才变得明显。只要对房间进行20分钟的彻底搜查，或者成功地进行DC10智慧（（%0%））检查，就可以发现它。",
	"If characters search the strong room during the night, lizardfolk show up to cart away contraband. There are three {@creature lizardfolk} for every two characters.": "如果人物在夜间搜查强壮的房间，蜥蜴人就会出现，把违禁品运走。每两个角色就有三个（%0%）。",
	"The wagon drivers, escorts, and laborers who stay at the compound share the rooms. None are private rooms; all have bunks for at least four people, and the larger rooms sleep six. They contain bunks, trunks for belongings, and wooden floors covered with rushes.": "住在院子里的马车司机、护卫人员和劳工共用这些房间。没有一间是私人房间；所有的房间都有至少四个人的床铺，较大的房间可以睡六个人。房间里有床铺、放物品的箱子，以及铺着芦苇的木地板。",
	"None of the rooms have locks on their doors except Bog Luck's. If asked about locks, Bog Luck explains that they kept freezing in cold weather so people couldn't get into or out of their rooms. This excuse is credible; the upper room doors, in particular, often are coated with ice in the morning. In fact, Bog Luck removed the locks to strengthen his excuse for locking the strong room.": "除了博格-勒克的房间，其他房间的门都没有锁。如果被问及锁的问题，博格-勒克解释说，在寒冷的天气里，锁一直在结冰，所以人们无法进入或离开他们的房间。这个借口是可信的；尤其是上层房间的门，在早上经常被冰块覆盖。事实上，博格-勒克拆除了门锁，以加强他锁住强壮房间的借口。",
	"Bog Luck has this room to himself, so it's more spacious and comfortable than the others. He's seldom here except when sleeping, and he keeps the door locked. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check with {@item thieves' tools|PHB} can open it. Despite his crude manner, Bog Luck is a somewhat educated man, as evidenced by the books of philosophy and natural history on his reading shelf.": "博格-勒克自己有这个房间，所以它比其他房间更宽敞、更舒适。除了睡觉的时候，他很少在这里，而且他把门锁着。成功通过DC10的灵巧检查（%0%）可以打开它。尽管他举止粗鲁，但博格-勒克是个有点文化的人，从他书架上的哲学和自然史书籍就可以看出。",
	"The commander of the hired guards has this small room to himself. There is nothing remarkable about it.": "雇来的卫兵指挥官自己有这个小房间。它没有什么了不起的地方。",
	"This upper room is used for preparing food on a large stove. In the evenings, this doubles as a common room where people gather to smoke, drink, swap stories, and keep warm. Eventually the cook, a grumpy human called Gristle Pete, kicks everyone out so he can unroll his mattress and blankets and get some sleep.": "这个上层房间是用来在一个大炉子上准备食物的。晚上，这里也是一个公共房间，人们聚集在一起抽烟、喝酒、交换故事，并保持温暖。最后，厨师，一个脾气暴躁的人类，名叫格里斯托-皮特（Gristle Pete），把所有人都赶了出去，这样他就可以铺开他的床垫和毯子，睡上一觉。",
	"If characters listen carefully to Gristle Pete's mutterings as he works around his kitchen, they'll hear him talking in circles to himself about how he \"... don't get no sleep from all the critters in the floors banging and knocking and hissing and whispering at all hours\" and so on. The noises he hears and mistakes for rats are the lizardfolk retrieving contraband from the strong room below. If questioned, he hears the noises every now and then, not every night. If pressed, he realizes that the sounds happen a few nights after a new load gets dropped off. Now ain't that some oddball rat behavior?": "如果人物在厨房周围工作时仔细聆听格里斯托-皮特的喃喃自语，他们会听到他自言自语地谈论他如何\"......被地板上的所有小动物敲打、敲打、嘶嘶作响和窃窃私语弄得无法入睡\"，等等。他听到的、被误认为是老鼠的声音是蜥蜴人从下面的坚固房间里取回违禁品。如果被询问，他偶尔会听到这些声音，而不是每天晚上。如果被追问，他意识到，这些声音是在新的货物被运走后的几个晚上发生的。这不是一些奇怪的老鼠行为吗？",
	"Characters have a few ways to collect clues about what's happening at the work camp. Jamna can help out with these tasks if none of the characters are up to it.": "角色们有几种方法来收集关于工作营发生的事情的线索。如果没有一个角色能够胜任，贾姆纳可以帮助完成这些任务。",
	"If they watch the wagons being unloaded, they'll notice Bog Luck directing laborers to carry the crates brought from the Greenfields into the warehouse. If they have a chance to see what's going on in the warehouse, they see that all the crates go into the strong room. If they don't look inside the warehouse while the wagons are unloaded but inspect the warehouse later, they won't find any of the crates; the only other place they could have gone is into the strong room.": "如果他们观看马车卸货，他们会注意到博格-勒克指挥工人把从绿地带来的板条箱运进仓库。如果他们有机会看到仓库里发生的事情，他们会看到所有的板条箱都进入了坚固的房间。如果他们在马车卸货的时候不看仓库里面，而是稍后检查仓库，他们就不会发现任何板条箱；它们唯一可能去的地方就是坚固的房间。",
	"Gristle Pete, who sleeps above the strong room, hears strange noises on certain nights. He mistakes those noises for rats, but they come from lizardfolk carrying contraband into the tunnel beneath the strong room.": "睡在坚固的房间上面的格里斯托-皮特（Gristle Pete）在某些晚上听到奇怪的声音。他误以为这些声音是老鼠，但它们是蜥蜴人携带违禁品进入坚固的房间下面的隧道。",
	"They can take the direct approach and inspect the strong room surreptitiously. This leads to a fight with lizardfolk if characters search the room in the dead of night. Getting in by picking the lock is the safest approach. Trying to lift the key from Bog Luck's belt can work, but it's risky. If he catches someone in the attempt, a beating is the best they can hope for. A smart character submits to this humiliation, because fighting back means that Bog Luck calls everyone else to help him punish the thief, and all the characters are ostracized from then on. Taking the beating means Bog Luck keeps the incident between the two of them.": "他们可以采取直接的方法，偷偷摸摸地检查强壮的房间。如果人物在夜深人静时搜查房间，这将导致与蜥蜴人的战斗。通过撬锁进入是最安全的方法。试图从博格-勒克的腰带上拔出钥匙也是可行的，但这是有风险的。如果他抓住了某人的企图，他们最好的希望就是挨打。聪明的人物会屈服于这种羞辱，因为反抗意味着Bog Luck会召集其他人来帮助他惩罚小偷，所有的人物都会从此被排斥在外。挨打意味着Bog Luck将事件保留在他们两个人之间。",
	"Characters can arrange to have a room next to the Cult of the Dragon teamsters and listen through the walls to the cultists' conversation. They can't make out entire conversations, but they do pick out the words \"strong room,\" \"tunnel,\" \"lizardfolk,\" and \"Bog Luck.\"": "角色可以安排在龙之教团队成员的旁边开一个房间，隔着墙听邪教分子的谈话。他们无法听出整个谈话内容，但他们确实能挑出 \"强壮的房间\"、\"隧道\"、\"蜥蜴人 \"和 \"沼泽地的运气 \"等词。",
	"Talking to other escorts and wagon drivers yields some interesting observations but no concrete leads. Most of the others who came along on the haul north of Waterdeep agree that there's something standoffish about the cultists (they don't use that word).": "与其他护送者和马车夫交谈，得到了一些有趣的观察，但没有具体的线索。在沃特德普以北的旅途中，其他大多数人都同意，这些邪教徒（他们不使用这个词）有些冷漠。",
	"Searching the cultists' two rooms turns up something a personal bag containing six polished gems and small, easily concealed items of jewelry, all together worth about 1,400 gp.

	"At an opportune time, the cultist tries to goad the character into a fight.

	"As far as the other cultists, teamsters, and hired guards are concerned, this is a personal issue between these two.

Bog Luck and Ardred Briferhew prevent anyone else from joining in, but they don't mind watching some limited bloodshed to break the boredom.": "就其他邪教徒、团队成员和雇佣的卫兵而言，这是他们两人之间的个人问题。如果这个角色退缩了，所有人都会认为这个角色是个懦夫，并在他或她在营地的剩余时间里对这个角色不尊重。如果其他角色在同伴身边跳入战斗，更多的邪教徒也会这样做（把他们当成十二个人（%0%）。沼泽之运和阿德雷德-布里弗休阻止其他人加入，但他们不介意观看一些有限的流血事件来打破无聊。",

	"The tunnel from the roadhouse emerges in a spot nearby that's screened by trees and brush from the camp. As characters approach through the tunnel, any of them with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 10 or higher hears bestial voices ahead, growling and murmuring indistinctly in Draconic. From there, a trail leads into the Mere of Dead Men, where a mix of swamp denizens and cultists of the dragon vie for power at the ruins of Castle Naerytar.": "从路边小屋出来的隧道出现在附近一个被树木和灌木丛挡住的地方。当人物通过隧道接近时，任何一个被动智慧（（%0%））得分在10分以上的人都会听到前面有兽性的声音，用德拉克语不清不楚地咆哮和咕哝着。从那里，一条小路通向死人谷，那里有沼泽居民和龙的崇拜者在奈瑞塔城堡的废墟上争夺权力。",
	"This stout, stone castle was the home of a half-elf wizard, but he abandoned it long ago when the swamp claimed the area. For a time, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers took over the structure, but they vanished mysteriously after a few years. No one knows what became of them. Before the group's destruction, the members modified the castle by building an observatory into the top floor of the keep. Some of their magical viewing equipment is still there.": "这座坚固的石头城堡曾是一个半精灵巫师的家，但他在很久以前就放弃了它，因为沼泽占据了这个地区。有一段时间，一群被称为观星者学院的占星师接管了这座建筑，但几年后他们神秘地消失了。没有人知道他们后来怎么样了。在这个团体被摧毁之前，成员们对城堡进行了改造，在堡垒的顶层建造了一个天文台。他们的一些神奇的观察设备还在那里。",
	"Now the Cult of the Dragon has moved people into Castle Naerytar and formed shaky alliances with nearby swamp dwellers, but the surrounding swampland is far from under anyone's control.

	"Castle Naerytar is not just a stone's throw down the road. It sits fifteen miles from the work camp—fifteen cold, muddy, difficult miles. It takes the characters two days to cover that ground at a moderate pace. Fortunately, the trail is marked by the lizardfolk who transport contraband through the mere to Castle Naerytar for the cult. Without the trail, finding the castle in this snarled, confusing maze would depend more on luck than skill. This trail doesn't make travel easy; the lizardfolk's trail is still treated as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. It only shows the direction to go.": "Naerytar城堡并不只是在路边的石头上。它距离工作营地有15英里--15英里寒冷、泥泞、艰难。角色们需要两天时间才能以适度的速度走完这段路。幸运的是，这条小路是由蜥蜴人标记的，他们为邪教组织运送违禁品，穿过泥泞的地方到Naerytar城堡。如果没有这条小路，在这个混乱的迷宫中找到城堡将更多地取决于运气而不是技巧。这条线索并不能使旅行变得容易；蜥蜴人的线索仍然被视为（%0%）。它只显示了要走的方向。",

Lizardfolk porters carry the cult's contraband on their backs along this portion of the trail, and their tracks can be plainly seen where the path crosses wet ground. Much of the path is through mucky, cold, knee-deep water. On those stretches, blaze marks are cut into trees to keep porters on the right course. No skill checks are needed to avoid getting lost as long as characters stick to the trail. If characters leave the trail, then a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check is needed to find it again. Each check equates to an hour of searching, which calls for a random encounters check.": "第一天的行程是步行穿过纠结的沼泽地。沼泽中的地面是干燥的：即使是 \"坚实的地面 \"也是湿漉漉的，水非常接近地表。蜥蜴人的搬运工在这段路上背着邪教的违禁品，他们的足迹在小路穿过湿地时可以清楚地看到。这条路的大部分路段都是穿过泥泞、寒冷、齐膝深的水。在这些路段上，在树上刻下了标记，以使搬运工人保持正确的路线。只要角色坚持走小路，就不需要检查技能以避免迷路。如果角色离开了小路，那么需要成功地进行DC 15智慧（（%0%））检查来重新找到它。每次检查相当于一个小时的搜索，这需要进行随机相遇检查。",

As the sun begins to set, nine {@creature lizardfolk} paddle up in three canoes. They are traveling from Castle Naerytar to the roadhouse to pick up a load of contraband. The lizardfolk expect no trouble near their camp, so if characters posted a watch, then those characters who are actively on watch notice the approaching lizardfolk automatically and the lizardfolk are surprised. If characters lit a fire, however, then the lizardfolk smell the smoke from quite a distance away and know someone is in the camp. They assume it's more of their own kind returning from the work camp with treasure bound for Castle Naerytar, but the mere is filled with potential enemies and one never knows for sure, so their approach is more cautious if they smell smoke. In that case, characters with passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores of 10 or higher notice the approaching lizardfolk canoes before the lizardfolk spot the strangers in their camp.": "如果角色在黄昏前到达，营地是空的，他们可以安全地探索它。当人物在营地时，没有随机的遭遇会打扰他们。当太阳开始落山时，九个人（0%）乘坐三艘独木舟划了过来。他们从奈瑞塔城堡出发，到路边小屋去取一车违禁品。蜥蜴人预计他们的营地附近不会有什么麻烦，所以如果角色发布了一个监视，那么那些积极放哨的角色就会自动注意到接近的蜥蜴人，而蜥蜴人则会感到惊讶。然而，如果角色点了火，那么蜥蜴人就会在很远的地方闻到烟味，知道有人在营地里。他们认为这是更多的同类从工作营地带着财宝返回奈瑞塔城堡，但这一带充满了潜在的敌人，人们永远无法确定，所以如果他们闻到烟味，他们的做法会更加谨慎。在这种情况下，被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在10分以上的角色会在蜥蜴人发现他们营地里的陌生人之前注意到接近的蜥蜴人独木舟。",

	"Lizardfolk know that they're transporting treasure to the castle. The \"dragon kneelers\" take it into the castle, and the lizardfolk never see it again. They are paid in steel blades (they have no ability to manufacture with metal) and magic talismans. All the lizardfolk wear necklaces and bracelets made of bone, teeth, feathers, carved soft stone, and leather. On close inspection, characters see mixed in among these things traces of civilization: glass beads, coins, costume jewelry, tiny mirrors, and stamped copper and tin amulets of the sort that can be bought for a few pennies at any trinket shop or souvenir stand. None of it is magical.": "蜥蜴人知道他们在向城堡运送财宝。跪龙者 \"将宝物带入城堡，而蜥蜴人再也看不到它了。他们的报酬是钢刀（他们没有用金属制造的能力）和魔法符咒。所有蜥蜴人都戴着由骨头、牙齿、羽毛、雕刻的软石和皮革制成的项链和手镯。仔细观察，人物会发现这些东西中混杂着文明的痕迹：玻璃珠、硬币、服装首饰、小镜子，以及在任何饰品店或纪念品摊位上花几分钱就能买到的那种盖章的铜和锡护身符。这些东西都不具有魔力。",
	"During the questioning, have every character make a Charisma check. Whichever character scores highest makes a strong impression on a lizardfolk captive.

Snapjaw tries to communicate with the chosen character, but he doesn't want any of his comrades to know. He speaks enough pidgin Common to converse in simple terms, in case no one in the party speaks Draconic.": "在问话过程中，让每个角色都做一个魅力检查。哪个角色的分数最高，就会给一个被俘的蜥蜴人留下深刻的印象。这个蜥蜴人的名字叫Snapjaw，他对Mere的情况很不满意，他认为这些陌生人可能是赶走邪教分子和屠杀他们残忍的恶霸盟友的关键。Snapjaw试图与被选中的人物沟通，但他不想让他的任何同志知道。他能说足够多的普通话，以进行简单的交流，以防队伍中没有人说德拉科尼亚语。",
	"How Snapjaw goes about opening a dialog depends on the situation. If he's the only surviving lizardfolk or he's questioned out of earshot from the others, he can speak openly. If several lizardfolk are tied up and they're being questioned together, he could sprinkle words of Common into his Draconic replies, such as \"want to help\" and \"talk alone.\" If several lizardfolk are tied up and left alone for a few minutes, he could scratch a similar message into the ground. He might try provoking a character into a wrestling match or a duel (if your players are the type to take up such a challenge), and then whisper his message into the character's ear.": "骁勇将军如何展开对话取决于情况。如果他是唯一幸存的蜥蜴人，或者他被审问时不在其他人的耳边，他可以公开说话。如果几个蜥蜴人被绑起来，而且他们被一起审问，他可以在他的龙语回答中撒上一些普通话，比如 \"想帮忙 \"和 \"单独谈谈\"。如果几个蜥蜴人被绑起来并被单独留下几分钟，他可以在地上划出类似的信息。他可能会试着挑衅一个角色进行摔跤比赛或决斗（如果你的玩家是接受这种挑战的类型），然后在这个角色的耳边说他的信息。",

	"Over a century ago, a half-elf wizard built a castle at the edge of the Mere of Dead Men. He lived there a relatively short time before the growing swamp flowed past the castle on all sides and made the location too remote for even his taste. After the structure sat abandoned for years, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers claimed it.

Then {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} happened upon the castle on one of her trips into the mere to study and negotiate with the black dragon Voaraghamanthar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} suspected the castle could become a useful stronghold for her, being located so conveniently close to the lair of a black dragon. She explored the structure, cleared the giant spiders out of the tower, and forged an alliance with the nearby tribe of bullywugs.": "占星家消失后，城堡再次陷入荒废状态。它是为了抵御寒冷的水环境而建造的，所以水的侵袭并没有破坏墙壁或淹没地牢。然而，在几十年的废弃过程中，它充满了碎片，吸引了许多不愉快的居住者。然后，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在一次她进入Mere研究并与黑龙Voaraghamanthar谈判的时候，偶然发现了这座城堡。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}怀疑这座城堡可以成为她的一个有用的据点，因为它离黑龙的巢穴很近，很方便。她探索了这个结构，把巨大的蜘蛛从塔里清理出来，并与附近的霸王龙部落建立了联盟。",
	"During that time, the half-dragon was still thinking of the castle simply as a fortified hideout. When she discovered the portal in the dungeon and learned that it connected to an abandoned lodge in the Graypeak Mountains, a new thought took shape. Lugging large amounts of treasure fifteen miles through the mere would not be easy, but if it cut 700 miles of wagon transport out of the picture, it would be worth the difficulty—especially if bullywugs and lizardfolk did all the hard work. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} laid claim to both structures, turned the Graypeak Mountain hunting lodge over to a trusted Cult of the Dragon associate (a half-elf named Talis who now despises {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}—see {@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}), and set about making Castle Naerytar an essential hub in the cult's treasure-amassing activity in the North.": "在那段时间里，半龙人仍然认为城堡只是一个坚固的藏身之处。当她发现地牢里的传送门，并得知它与灰峰山的一个废弃小屋相连时，一个新的想法形成了。把大量的财宝拖到15英里以外的地方并不容易，但如果能减少700英里的马车运输，那就值得一试了--特别是如果恶霸和蜥蜴人做了所有的辛苦工作。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}宣称拥有这两座建筑，将灰峰山狩猎小屋交给一个值得信赖的龙之教成员（一个半精灵，名叫塔利斯，现在看不起{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}--见{@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}），并着手将奈瑞塔城堡打造成该教在北方搜刮宝藏活动的重要枢纽。",
	"Through diplomacy and intimidation, and by leveraging the influence of Voaraghamanthar with the monstrous creatures of the mere, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} created an uneasy alliance in the Mere of Dead Men and brought her vision into reality.": "通过外交和恐吓，并利用沃拉格汉姆萨的影响力与纯粹的畸形生物，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}在死人谷建立了一个不稳定的联盟，并将她的愿景变为现实。",

	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s three-way alliance is unstable. The cultists despise living in the swamp and have little respect for the bullywugs or lizardfolk; the leader of the bullywugs would like to seize Castle Naerytar for his own purposes; the bullywugs in general take every opportunity to push around the lizardfolk; and the lizardfolk chafe under the abuse of the bullywugs and wonder why Voaraghamanthar doesn't step in to protect them.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的三方联盟是不稳定的。邪教徒鄙视生活在沼泽地的人，对恶霸和蜥蜴人都不尊重；恶霸的首领想为自己的目的夺取Naerytar城堡；恶霸一般会利用一切机会逼迫蜥蜴人；而蜥蜴人对恶霸的虐待感到不满，想知道为什么Voaraghamanthar不出面保护他们。",
	"Although {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is responsible for resurrecting Castle Naerytar and claiming it for the Cult of the Dragon (in name only; she considers it her personal property), an elf Wearer of Purple named {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) commands the castle for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The half-dragon needs to show up occasionally to remind the bullywugs and lizardfolk that the Cult of the Dragon is really in charge, but Borngray runs the operation.": "虽然{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}负责复活奈瑞塔城堡，并将其归于神龙教（只是名义上的，她认为这是自己的个人财产），但一个名为{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}的紫色精灵穿戴者（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）为{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}指挥着这座城堡。这个半龙人需要偶尔出现，以提醒恶霸和蜥蜴人，龙之教才是真正的负责人，但博恩格雷负责运营。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} is a member of the Eldreth Valuuthra, a group of elf supremacists dedicated to removing humanity from Faerûn.

	"The elf idolizes {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} in all ways but one: he rues her decision to elevate the bullywugs in their alliance. In Borngray's opinion, the lizardfolk would be more useful, more reliable, and more appropriate allies than the repulsive bullywugs are. He cannot alter the arrangement without countering {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}'s orders, but Borngray has taken small steps to restore the lizardfolk's tribal pride, such as by trying to teach them metallurgy. His effort has met with little success.": "精灵在所有方面都崇拜{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，只有一点：他为她在联盟中提升bullywugs的决定感到遗憾。在Borngray看来，蜥蜴人将是比令人厌恶的bullywugs更有用、更可靠、更合适的盟友。他不能在不违背{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的命令的情况下改变这种安排，但Borngray已经采取了一些小措施来恢复蜥蜴人的部落自豪感，例如试图教他们冶金术。他的努力收效甚微。",
	"Borngray is loyal to the cult and yearns for Tiamat's return. He genuinely looks forward to the whole world lying helpless under the claws of dragons, both because that's where the world belongs, and because it will mean that his job at Castle Naerytar is finished. The second-best day of his life will be the day when Borngray can scrape the mud and stink of the Mere of Dead Men off his boots and return to someplace civilized. He has never mentioned his desire to leave to the bullywugs, whom he considers revolting necessities.": "Borngray对邪教很忠诚，渴望Tiamat的回归。他真正期待着整个世界无助地躺在龙的爪子下，一是因为那是世界的归宿，二是因为这将意味着他在奈瑞塔城堡的工作结束。他生命中第二美好的一天将是Borngray能够从他的靴子上刮掉死人谷的泥土和臭味，回到某个文明的地方。他从未向恶霸们提起过他想离开的愿望，他认为恶霸们是令人反感的必需品。",
	"Only a handful of true Cult of the Dragon initiates and officers resides at the castle. All of them are noted in the castle description. They act as overseers and aides to Borngray and {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}.": "只有少数真正的神龙教入门者和官员居住在城堡里。所有这些人都在城堡的描述中提到。他们是博恩格雷和（%0%）的监督者和助手。",
	"The band of bullywugs serving the Cult of the Dragon follows the dictates of {@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}), a rare bullywug who has mastered shamanistic magic. His \"religion\" is a mishmash of confused tradition, borrowed mysticism, hallucinogenic intoxicants, and manufactured lore that serves more as a road to personal power for Pharblex than as a spiritual system for the bullywugs. Pharblex's spellcasting holds his followers together, and that makes him useful to {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}.": "为 \"龙之教 \"服务的一群恶霸遵循{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）的指令，他是一个罕见的掌握萨满教魔法的恶霸。他的 \"宗教 \"是由混乱的传统、借用的神秘主义、致幻的麻醉剂和制造的传说组成的混合体，对法布尔克斯来说，这更像是一条通往个人权力的道路，而不是恶霸的精神体系。法布尔克斯的法术使他的追随者团结在一起，这使他对{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}很有用。",
	"Pharblex hopes that when Tiamat returns, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} will hand Castle Naerytar over to him, and he will rule the entire Mere of Dead Men from the castle. The only obstacle he sees between himself and his goal is the castle's current master, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}; the notion that someone might want to not live in a swamp has never entered Pharblex's narrow mind, and the bullywug seems deaf to Borngray's ironic and sarcastic jabs at the mere. When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf—but it's not impossible. If it looks like the cult's operation at the castle is doomed, Pharblex is the sort of creature who will switch sides to save his slimy skin. The timing must be perfect, because he fears {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} more than he fears the characters. If, however, the characters have won the lizardfolk over to their side, slaughtered or driven off most of the bullywugs, overrun the castle, and are poised to kill Borngray and Pharblex in battle—Pharblex judges that the ideal time to forsake old allies and court new ones has arrived. He offers just about anything in exchange for the characters leaving him alive and in possession of Castle Naerytar (with or without the {@i farseer of Illusk} in operating condition).": "法尔布拉斯希望当提亚马特回来时，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}会把奈瑞塔城堡交给他，而他将在城堡里统治整个死人之地。他认为自己和他的目标之间的唯一障碍是城堡的现任主人{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}；有人可能想不住在沼泽地的想法从未进入法尔布拉斯狭隘的头脑，而且这个恶霸似乎对博恩格雷讽刺和挖苦的嘲讽充耳不闻。当时机成熟时，法布尔克斯计划通过任何必要的手段将这个精灵从画面中移除。他不太可能选择在与人物的战斗中，在他和博恩格雷并肩作战的时候，背叛精灵--但这也不是不可能。如果看起来邪教在城堡的行动是注定要失败的，法布尔克斯是那种会转换阵营以拯救他的粘稠皮肤的生物。时机必须是完美的，因为他对{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的恐惧比对角色的恐惧更甚。然而，如果角色们已经赢得了蜥蜴人的支持，屠杀或赶走了大部分的恶霸，占领了城堡，并准备在战斗中杀死博恩格雷和法布尔克斯--法布尔克斯判断，放弃旧盟友、争取新盟友的理想时机已经到来。他提供了几乎所有的东西，以换取角色们活着离开并拥有Naerytar城堡（无论是否有{@i farseer of Illusk}的运行状态）。",
	"The number of bullywugs around the castle fluctuates. They come and go as they please. On any given day, forty to fifty are camped outside the castle. Thirty-four more plus Pharblex live in the castle barracks (areas {@area 1G|14b|x} and {@area 2G|164|x}). Another thirty to seventy are in the immediate area, close enough to respond within fifteen minutes to the beating of the drum in the barbican.": "城堡周围的恶霸的数量是波动的。他们想来就来，想走就走。在任何一天，都有40到50只在城堡外扎营。还有34只加上法布尔克斯住在城堡的军营里（区域（%0%）和（%1%））。另有三十至七十人在附近地区，离得很近，可以在十五分钟内对巴比肯的鼓声作出反应。",
	"The bullywugs already believe themselves to be lords of the mere, and they act like it. They are easily confused, however. Under normal circumstances, they attack adventurers on sight, provided the bullywugs had superior numbers. They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if Snapjaw or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.": "恃强凌弱的人已经认为自己是这片土地的主宰，他们的行为也是如此。然而，他们很容易被迷惑。在正常情况下，他们会当场攻击冒险者，只要恶霸虫的数量占优。他们已经习惯了看到许多种族的邪教徒在城堡周围来来往往，所以当他们看到陌生人时，他们的第一个假设是，新来的人更多是邪教徒。如果Snapjaw或其他蜥蜴人陪伴着这些陌生人，或者如果角色有任何明显的邪教装备或服装，这种假设就会得到加强。",
	"This doesn't mean characters can wander at will through the camp and the castle. Bullywug guards still challenge them to ask who they are and where they're going (in fractured pidgin Common if none of the characters speak Bullywug). They just don't assume that every stranger is an enemy and attack on sight.": "这并不意味着人物可以在营地和城堡中随意游荡。恶霸守卫仍然会向他们提出挑战，询问他们是谁，要去哪里（如果角色中没有人说恶霸语，就用断断续续的皮金语）。他们只是不认为每个陌生人都是敌人，不会见人就攻击。",
	"The Scaly Death lizardfolk tribe has no leader. Pharblex killed its shaman, Suncaller, and the death left the tribe with an inferiority complex that was ripe for exploitation. When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe's labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.": "鳞片死亡蜥蜴人部落没有领袖。法布尔克斯杀死了它的萨满，太阳召唤者，这次死亡给该部落留下了自卑感，而这种自卑感已经成熟，可以利用。当{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}承诺Voaraghamanthar将奖励该部落为邪教所做的劳动时，蜥蜴人准备听从。",
	"Where the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult's laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle's far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn't expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it's too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray \"pays\" the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.": "蜥蜴人扮演着静态防御力量的角色，而蜥蜴人则扮演着五个角色。首先，他们是邪教的劳动者和搬运工。蜥蜴人在清理城堡中的碎片时做了大部分重活，他们用背和独木舟将大部分宝物从工作营地运到城堡中。第二，他们照看巨大的蜥蜴，这些蜥蜴被用来拖动或携带特别重的货物通过米勒。第三，他们做大部分的狩猎、捕鱼和采集，以养活城堡里的每个人。第四，他们充当城堡的远距离侦察兵和外围守卫，因为他们在积极巡逻、伏击和布置陷阱方面远胜于任何恶霸虫。第五，一队蜥蜴人被征召为城堡本身的精英警卫。博恩格雷并不指望任何力量会对城堡发动真正的攻击；它太难以接近了，深藏在沼泽中。但是，如果这种不可能发生的事情发生了，他知道那些大摇大摆的恶棍们会抛弃而不是与一个有组织的敌人作战。另一方面，当蜥蜴人有一个值得追随的领袖时，他们会变得勇敢而有纪律。博恩格雷希望成为这样的领袖，至少对他在城堡里安置的一小队蜥蜴人战士来说是这样，并给予特殊待遇。作为对他们工作的回报，博恩格雷用金属武器来 \"支付 \"这些部落，并将其与战利品一起带到城堡。",
	"Meanwhile, the bullywugs boss and bully the lizardfolk, emboldened by their superior numbers, the lizardfolk's instinctive awe of Pharblex's magic, and the absence of any restraining sign from Borngray or from the lair of the black dragon. Voaraghamanthar's silence, more than anything else, makes the lizardfolk wonder whether fate is punishing them for some unknown transgression. They grumble, and occasionally a few desert, but most of them bear up with reptilian stoicism.": "与此同时，恶霸们欺负蜥蜴人，因为他们人数众多，蜥蜴人对法布尔克斯的魔法有着本能的敬畏，而且博恩格雷和黑龙的巢穴都没有任何限制的迹象。沃拉格汉姆萨尔的沉默，比其他任何事情都更让蜥蜴人怀疑命运是否在惩罚他们某些未知的过失。他们怨声载道，偶尔会有几个人开小差，但他们中的大多数人都以爬行动物的坚忍不拔的精神忍受着。",
	"Snapjaw is one of the few who has suggested rebelling against the hated bullywugs and the cultists. He hasn't done so openly, because that would invite retribution from the bullywugs, but he has spoken to a few fellow tribesfolk he trusts. Their response was interested but noncommittal; they intend to take revenge on the bullywugs, but not until the omens are right. Meanwhile, they endure—and stockpile weapons. Borngray has only a rough idea of how many lizardfolk are in the tribe all together, and he hasn't kept close count over how many swords, spears, daggers, shields, and metal-tipped arrows have been turned over to them. The lizardfolk are much better armed at this point than they let on to either the bullywugs or the cultists. When the time comes to move against the bullywugs, the lizardfolk intend for every bullywug throat and belly to be slit open with a new, razor-sharp steel blade.": "骁勇是少数建议反抗可恨的恶霸和邪教徒的人之一。他没有公开这么做，因为那会招致恶霸的报复，但他已经和他信任的几个部落同胞谈过。他们的反应很感兴趣，但不置可否；他们打算向恶霸武者复仇，但要等到预兆正确时才能进行。与此同时，他们忍耐着--储存武器。Borngray对部落里有多少蜥蜴人只有一个粗略的概念，他也没有仔细数过有多少剑、长矛、匕首、盾牌和金属尖端的箭被移交给他们。在这一点上，蜥蜴人的武器要比他们对恶霸和邪教分子所说的好得多。当对付恶霸的时候，蜥蜴人打算用一把新的锋利的钢刀割开每个恶霸的喉咙和腹部。",
	"Like the bullywugs, the lizardfolk's first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don't share the bullywugs' arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don't really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won't attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.": "和霸王龙一样，蜥蜴人看到陌生人的第一个假设是，他们是邪教分子，或者是邪教分子的盟友，来城堡工作或谈判的。然而，他们并不认同恶霸的傲慢，所以除非他们受到攻击，否则他们并不关心谁在营地里徘徊。巡逻或站岗的蜥蜴人是个例外。他们很警觉，而且他们认为每个人都是潜在的敌人。在确定之前，他们不会攻击，以免因为杀死盟友而招致（%0%）或博恩格雷的愤怒。作为外围守卫，他们的任务是在有陌生人接近时提醒营地，对陌生人进行观察，并等待进一步指示。",
	"The Scaly Death tribe comprises eighty lizardfolk warriors, both male and female. About half of them are in the vicinity of the castle at any given time; twenty-six live in the castle and the rest in reed huts (area 3). The others are away hunting, fishing, patrolling, hauling contraband from the work camp, or visiting their families in the tribal village (a few hours away to the southwest).": "鳞片死亡部落由八十名蜥蜴人战士组成，有男有女。他们中大约有一半人在任何时候都在城堡附近；26人住在城堡里，其余的住在芦苇屋里（3号区域）。其他人则外出打猎、捕鱼、巡逻、从工作营地拖运违禁品，或到部落村落（西南方向几小时路程）探亲。",
	"Only one Red Wizard is present at Castle Naerytar: {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}, who was also in the cult camp on the Greenfields and traveled north with {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. He has no interest in the Mere of Dead Men, bullywugs, or lizardfolk, and just slightly more interest in black dragons. He is here only as {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s liaison to {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The portal beneath the castle piques Jos's interest, however; portals are always of concern to the Red Wizards.": "在奈瑞塔城堡只有一个红袍巫师。{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}，他也在绿原上的邪教营地，和{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}一起向北旅行。他对死人谷、恶霸、蜥蜴人没有兴趣，只是对黑龙稍有兴趣。他在这里只是作为{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}与{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的联络人。然而，城堡下面的传送门引起了乔斯的兴趣；传送门总是受到红袍巫师的关注。",
	"Adventurers appearing at this remote, secret site also interest him. If {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} sees the characters or learns of their presence, he arranges a private meeting—one that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray don't even know about, let alone attend. He wants to learn how much the characters know of the cult's plans, where and how they uncovered the information, who else knows about it, and what they think of the plan's chance to succeed. If the characters are captured and locked up in the castle, Jos finds an opportunity to ask all the same questions, again privately, but he is in a better position to force answers out of the characters.": "在这个偏远的秘密地点出现的冒险者也让他感兴趣。如果{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}看到这些人物或得知他们的存在，他就会安排一次私人会面--{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和Borngray甚至不知道，更不用说参加了。他想知道这些人物对邪教的计划了解多少，他们在哪里以及如何发现这些信息的，还有谁知道这些信息，以及他们对计划成功的可能性有何看法。如果人物被抓并被关在城堡里，乔斯就有机会再次私下问同样的问题，但他能更好地迫使人物回答。",
	"This assumes the characters are at Castle Naerytar posing as cultists or hiding among the lizardfolk. If they're rampaging through the castle, killing everyone they meet, then {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} has only one concern: escaping through the portal before someone or something kills him.": "这是假设人物在Naerytar城堡假扮成邪教徒或躲在蜥蜴人中。如果他们在城堡里横冲直撞，杀死他们遇到的每一个人，那么{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}只关心一个问题：在某人或某物杀死他之前从传送门逃出去。",
	"Voaraghamanthar is an adult black dragon who claims the Mere of Dead Men as his territory. Although many creatures live in the mere and dominate it to one extent or another, none challenge Voaraghamanthar's supremacy. The bullywugs consider him a constant threat and tremble whenever his shadow passes near. The yuan-ti grant him grudging respect and covet his immense wealth. The lizardfolk honor him and wonder why he allows the cultists to abuse them. The cultists venerate him and divert some of the arriving contraband to his lair as tribute.": "沃拉格曼瑟是一条成年黑龙，他声称死人谷是他的领土。虽然有许多生物生活在这个地方，并在某种程度上主宰着它，但没有人挑战沃拉格曼瑟的霸主地位。恶霸虫认为他是一个持续的威胁，每当他的影子经过附近时都会颤抖。元老们给予他勉强的尊重，并觊觎他巨大的财富。蜥蜴人尊敬他，并想知道为什么他允许邪教组织虐待他们。邪教徒们敬仰他，并将一些抵达的违禁品转移到他的巢穴作为贡品。",
	"Voaraghamanthar has a secret that is known to only two other creatures in Faerûn. One of them is {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. The other creature {@i is} the secret: Waervaerendor, the twin brother of Voaraghamanthar. For centuries, these twins have misled the world into believing that only one dragon dwells in the Mere of Dead Men—one dragon that must travel at immense speed, since it has been spotted at widely separated locales in rapid succession. The siblings seldom leave their lairs, but when they do, they coordinate so they are never seen together or seen in two distant places at precisely the same time.": "Voaraghamanthar有一个秘密，在Faerûn只有另外两种生物知道。其中一个是（%0%）。另一个生物{@i is}这个秘密：瓦瓦兰多(Waervaerendor)，是沃拉格曼瑟尔的双胞胎兄弟。几个世纪以来，这对双胞胎误导了世人，让他们相信只有一条龙居住在死人谷，这条龙必须以极快的速度旅行，因为它在相隔甚远的地方被迅速发现。这对兄妹很少离开他们的巢穴，但当他们离开时，他们会进行协调，所以他们从未被看到在一起，或在同一时间在两个遥远的地方被看到。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} persuaded the twins to pledge their aid to the cult, but so far, the pledge hasn't carried much weight. Neither dragon leaves its lair frequently enough to provide much help. Like all black dragons, these two are paranoid about all other dragons. Tiamat's potential return and the establishment of a vast dragon empire seem like remote possibilities compared to the real danger of tangling with another dragon, any of whom would gladly murder Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor for their hoards. That's the twins' outlook, anyway. While their concern over the murderous nature of other dragons is justified, the fact that they are two means they have little to fear from most solitary dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} is working hard to persuade them that they could gain great power by revealing their secret at the strategically correct moment. Until Tiamat's return looks more certain, however, Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor intend to keep playing it safe, stick close to home, and guard their secret.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}说服了这对双胞胎承诺对邪教的援助，但到目前为止，这个承诺还没有多少分量。两条龙都没有经常离开自己的巢穴，无法提供什么帮助。像所有的黑龙一样，这两条龙对所有其他的龙都很偏执。与与其他龙纠缠在一起的真正危险相比，提亚马特的潜在回归和一个庞大的龙帝国的建立似乎是遥远的可能性，任何一个龙都会为了它们的囤积物而高兴地谋杀沃拉格曼瑟尔和瓦瓦兰多。无论如何，这就是这对双胞胎的观点。虽然他们对其他龙的凶残本性的担忧是有道理的，但他们是两个人的事实意味着他们对大多数孤独的龙没有什么可担心的。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}正在努力说服他们，只要在战略上正确的时刻揭开他们的秘密，他们就能获得巨大的力量。然而，在提亚马特的回归看起来更加确定之前，沃拉格汉姆塔尔和华尔瓦伦多打算继续稳扎稳打，贴近家庭，并保护他们的秘密。",
	"Voaraghamanthar and Waervaerendor are not a true faction in the mere because they are not advancing any agenda of their own, but their presence affects the balance of power. Without Voaraghamanthar, the cult wouldn't be here at all. Without Voaraghamanthar, the lizardfolk probably could not have been maneuvered into making common cause with the bullywugs.": "Voaraghamanthar和Waervaerendor并不是一个真正的派别，因为他们没有推进自己的任何议程，但他们的存在影响了权力的平衡。没有Voaraghamanthar，邪教根本就不会出现在这里。如果没有沃拉格曼瑟，蜥蜴人可能就不会被操纵着与恶霸巫师建立共同的事业。",
	"Characters should not encounter either of these dragons face to face in this adventure (they are likely to meet in {@i The Rise of Tiamat}). If characters stray from the lizardfolk's path between the work camp and Castle Naerytar, intentionally or unintentionally—if, for example, they follow will-o'-wisps into the mere—they could enter the blighted territory around one of the lairs. Many clues can inform characters that they're in dragon territory. First, they pass markers consisting of the acid-eaten skulls of humans, humanoids, yuan-ti, crocodiles, and just about every other creature that lives in the mere. The skulls hang from withered trees and from spikes driven into the ground.": "在这次冒险中，角色不应该面对面地遇到这两条龙（它们很可能在（%0%）中相遇）。如果角色有意或无意地偏离了蜥蜴人在工作营地和奈瑞塔城堡之间的道路--例如，如果他们跟随will-o'-wisps进入mer--他们可能会进入其中一个巢穴周围的枯萎地带。许多线索可以告诉角色，他们在龙的领地。首先，他们会经过由人类、人形生物、元老、鳄鱼和其他生活在丛林中的生物的被酸吃掉的头骨组成的标记。这些头骨挂在枯萎的树上和钉在地上的钉子上。",
	"Both dragons' lairs are heavily guarded by lizardfolk. The dragons' guards are selected from the Scaly Death lizardfolk that work for the cult. Kobolds infest the actual lairs, but they seldom come out into the mere.": "两条龙的巢穴都有蜥蜴人的严密守卫。龙的守卫是从为邪教工作的鳞片死亡蜥蜴人中挑选出来的。哥布林在实际的巢穴中出没，但他们很少到外面来。",
	"Characters have several options at Castle Naerytar, and events there can go in many directions. Here are the key points to keep in mind when running this chapter.": "角色在Naerytar城堡有多种选择，那里的事件可以向许多方向发展。以下是运行本章时需要记住的关键点。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} do almost anything to avoid a battle with interfering adventurers. They have bigger concerns than the safety of Castle Naerytar and its occupants. If a battle develops, both of these characters head directly for the gate beneath the castle and teleport to {@creature Talis the White|HotDQ}'s hunting lodge (see {@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}). For purposes of this adventure, do everything you can to ensure that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Jos survive this chapter. It's not a catastrophe if they don't, but it's much better if they do.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}为了避免与干涉的冒险者发生战斗，几乎什么都做了。他们有比奈瑞塔城堡及其居民的安全更重要的考虑。如果发生战斗，这两个角色会直接前往城堡下面的大门，并传送到{@creature Talis the White|HotDQ}的狩猎小屋（见{@adventure chapter 7|HotDQ|7}）。为了这次冒险的目的，尽你所能确保{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和乔斯在这一章中幸存下来。如果他们没能活下来，也不是什么大灾难，但如果他们能活下来，那就更好了。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} and {@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} have everything to lose if enemies of the cult overrun Castle Naerytar; a defeat would cost Borngray his hard-earned rank in the cult, and Spattergoo would lose the base from which he hopes to rule the mere after the cult is finished with the castle. They fight to the death to protect the castle (simultaneously buying time for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Jos to escape). Despite their loathing for one another, they understand that they are much stronger together than apart. As soon as fighting breaks out, they join forces and cooperate.": "如果邪教的敌人攻占了Naerytar城堡，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}和{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}就会失去一切；失败会使Borngray失去他在邪教中来之不易的地位，而Spattergoo也会失去他希望在邪教结束对城堡的统治的基地。他们为了保护城堡而殊死搏斗（同时为{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和乔斯逃跑争取时间）。尽管他们彼此厌恶，但他们明白，他们在一起比分开要强得多。一旦战斗爆发，他们就会联合起来，进行合作。",
	"The best place for Borngray and Pharblex to make their stand depends on how the attack develops; you'll need to play that part by ear. Their best ploy against a determined assault may be a fighting retreat through the castle and down into the caverns, where the narrow passages and giant frogs work in their favor.": "Borngray和Pharblex的最佳位置取决于攻击的发展情况；你需要听从这部分的安排。他们应对坚决进攻的最好策略可能是通过城堡战斗性地撤退到洞穴里，那里的狭窄通道和巨大的青蛙对他们有利。",
	"The bullywugs are numerous but cowardly. They fight to protect Pharblex, but if he isn't immediately in sight—if Pharblex has retreated into the caverns while other bullywugs are fighting in the inner ward, for example—bullywugs who feel as if he has abandoned them are likely to leap away into the mere and never come back. If Pharblex is killed, most bullywugs desert immediately.": "恶霸虫的数量很多，但却很胆小。他们为保护法布尔克斯而战，但如果他没有立即出现在眼前--例如，如果法布尔克斯撤退到洞穴中，而其他恶霸虫正在内区战斗--恶霸虫们觉得他已经抛弃了他们，就很可能跳到远处，再也不回来了。如果法布尔克斯被杀，大多数恶霸武者会立即开溜。",
	"The lizardfolk are brave, but they despise the bullywugs. If characters haven't recruited the lizardfolk to their side, then the lizardfolk fight well whenever they're alone. If bullywugs are nearby, lizardfolk pull back and let the bullywugs bear the brunt of combat and casualties. If the lizardfolk have been won over to fighting alongside the characters, then they hunt bullywugs through the castle and grounds and murder them mercilessly. If bullywugs flee into the swamp, lizardfolk chase them. They are half-hearted when facing cultists—not because they fear the cultists but because they don't hate them, and they have a harder time mentally turning against that alliance.": "蜥蜴人很勇敢，但他们鄙视恶霸。如果角色没有把蜥蜴人招募到自己身边，那么蜥蜴人只要单独作战就会打得很好。如果附近有恶霸，蜥蜴人就会撤退，让恶霸承担战斗和伤亡的主要责任。如果蜥蜴人已经赢得了与角色并肩作战的机会，那么他们就会在城堡和地面上猎杀恶霸，并毫不留情地杀害他们。如果恶霸逃入沼泽，蜥蜴人就会追赶它们。他们在面对邪教徒时半信半疑--不是因为他们害怕邪教徒，而是因为他们不恨邪教徒，而且他们在精神上更难反对这个联盟。",
	"The cultists are dedicated but not fanatics, and they are laborers, not soldiers. They fight bravely with {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} leading them. Without him, the cultists' attacks are uncoordinated and hesitant. Their situation becomes even worse if they are fighting against rebellious lizardfolk. In that case, without Borngray to egg them on, they are most likely to barricade themselves in the upper levels of the southwest tower or the library and try to ride out the slaughter.": "邪教分子很敬业，但不是狂热者，他们是劳动者，不是士兵。他们在{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}的带领下勇敢地战斗。没有他，邪教分子的攻击是不协调的，而且犹豫不决。如果他们是在与反叛的蜥蜴人作战，他们的情况会变得更糟。在这种情况下，如果没有博恩格雷给他们打气，他们很可能会把自己关在西南塔的上层或图书馆里，试图度过这场屠杀。",
	"How characters approach Naerytar can set the tone for everything that happens at the castle.": "人物如何接近Naerytar可以为城堡里发生的一切定下基调。",
	"Snapjaw knows where the lizardfolk pickets are posted about half a mile out from the castle. If he is with the characters, he can prevent them from blundering into a trap or an ambush. He talks to the six {@creature lizardfolk} guards if characters let him. What he tells them depends on the opinion he's formed about the characters.": "骁勇知道蜥蜴人纠察队在离城堡大约半英里的地方驻扎。如果他和人物在一起，他可以防止他们误入陷阱或伏击。如果角色允许，他可以和六个{@creature lizardfolk}卫兵交谈。他告诉他们什么，取决于他对这些人物形成的看法。",
	"If Snapjaw isn't yet sure whether the characters are the saviors he hopes they are, he tells the guards that these are cultists coming to join those already in the castle. The guards accept that story without question and let everyone pass.": "如果Snapjaw还不确定这些人物是否是他希望的救世主，他就告诉守卫，这些人是来加入已经在城堡里的邪教徒的。守卫们毫无疑义地接受了这个说法，并让大家通过。",
	"If the heroes have established strong trust between themselves and Snapjaw, he tells the guards that the characters are great warriors come to destroy the Cult of the Dragon, and that now is the time to make their move against the bullywugs. You can either decide for yourself how the guards react to that, or make a DC 10 Charisma check for Snapjaw. If the check succeeds, the guards are persuaded. If the check fails, the characters don't impress them. They won't take action against the bullywugs now, but they won't interfere with the characters, either. If the result is 5 or lower, these guards decide Snapjaw's talk of an uprising is dangerously rash, and they attack him.": "如果英雄们已经在他们和Snapjaw之间建立了强大的信任，他就会告诉守卫们，这些角色是来摧毁龙之教的伟大战士，现在是对恶霸的行动的时候。你可以自己决定守卫们的反应，或者为Snapjaw做一个DC10魅力检查。如果检定成功，守卫们就会被说服。如果检定失败，人物就不会打动他们。他们现在不会对恶霸采取任何行动，但是他们也不会干涉这些角色。如果结果是5或更低，这些守卫认为Snapjaw关于起义的谈话是危险的轻率的，他们会攻击他。",
	"If the characters have done nothing to win Snapjaw's trust or they've treated him no better than bullywugs would have, then he tells the guards that the characters are nothing but trouble, and the lizardfolk attack.": "如果这些角色没有做任何事情来赢得Snapjaw的信任，或者他们对他的态度并不比bullywugs好，那么他就会告诉守卫，这些角色只是个麻烦，蜥蜴人就会发动攻击。",
	"If Snapjaw is not with the characters, they still have a chance to detect the guard outpost on their own. Characters with passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores of 15 or higher catch whiffs of wood smoke. Also make a single Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check for the lizardfolk guards, with advantage (they've had plenty of time to conceal themselves). Compare their result to the characters' passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores to see whether any of the characters notice the lizardfolk in hiding.": "如果Snapjaw不在角色身边，他们仍有机会独自探测到守卫的前哨。被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在15分以上的角色可以捕捉到一缕木头烟的味道。同时对蜥蜴人守卫进行一次灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，有优势（他们有足够的时间来隐藏自己）。将他们的结果与角色的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分相比较，看看是否有角色注意到蜥蜴人的隐藏。",
	"If the lizardfolk go undetected, they send two fast swimmers ahead by a secondary route to alert bullywugs at the castle. Two more scouts follow the characters while the last two remain at their post and continue keeping watch.": "如果蜥蜴人没有被发现，他们会派两个快速游泳的人从第二条路线前进，提醒城堡里的恶霸。另有两名侦察员跟随这些人物，而最后两名侦察员则留在自己的岗位上继续监视。",
	"Castle Naerytar was built on dry land, then a deep, dry moat was dug around it. When the mere expanded and surrounded the castle site, the moat flooded and overflowed. Now the whole site is swampy, and large pools of standing water dot the clearing. The castle was built on exposed bedrock, so its foundation is sound and mostly dry even a century after the flooding. Tangled brush and trees grow to within twenty feet of the walls on three sides of the castle. Only the front (southern) face is clear.": "Naerytar城堡建在干燥的土地上，然后在其周围挖了一条深而干的护城河。当单纯的扩大并包围城堡所在地时，护城河被淹没并溢出。现在整个场地都是沼泽地，大片的积水点缀在空地上。城堡建在裸露的基岩上，所以它的地基是健全的，即使在洪水泛滥的一个世纪后，也大多是干燥的。缠结的灌木和树木生长在城堡三面墙壁的20英尺以内。只有正面（南面）是清楚的。",
	"Bullywugs live in crowded, hastily made reed huts. The lizardfolk have sturdier, roomier reed longhouses.": "恶霸住在拥挤的、匆忙制作的芦苇屋里。蜥蜴人有更结实、更宽敞的芦苇长屋。",
	"A half-dozen dugout canoes are pulled up onto land here. Three to five paddles lie in the bottom of each. Five of them are in good condition; the sixth has a rotten bottom, and the lizardfolk never use it. If characters grab canoes in a hurry, there is a 1-in-6 chance they get the rotten one. It starts leaking as soon as it's put in water, and it sinks after fifteen minutes.": "有半打独木舟被拉到这里的陆地上。每艘船的底部都有三到五个船桨。其中五个状况良好；第六个底部已经腐烂，蜥蜴人从不使用它。如果角色们匆匆忙忙地抓住独木舟，他们有六分之一的机会得到腐烂的那只。它一放进水里就开始漏水，15分钟后就会沉下去。",
	"The lizardfolk keep their giant lizards penned here. The five-foot-high wall of the stockade is made from sturdy logs driven into the earth, spaced about six inches apart, and bound together with twisted fiber. The lizards can carry or drag loads that are too massive for the lizardfolk, such as large timbers or impressive crocodiles. They are also used to raise stone onto the castle battlements through ropes and pulleys—technology that never ceases to amaze the lizardfolk. There are {@dice 2d4} {@creature Giant Lizard||giant lizards} in the pen at any given time. They are ill-tempered and attack anyone who comes within reach if their handlers aren't present to keep them under control. If set loose, they most likely romp away into the swamp. If the goal is to have the lizards rampage through the camp, someone needs to rile them up first. Poking them through the stockade wall with spears will do the trick.": "蜥蜴人把他们的巨型蜥蜴关在这里。五英尺高的栅栏墙是由坚固的原木打入土中制成的，间隔约六英寸，用扭曲的纤维捆绑在一起。蜥蜴可以搬运或拖动那些对蜥蜴人来说过于庞大的货物，如大木头或令人印象深刻的鳄鱼。它们还被用来通过绳索和滑轮将石头提升到城堡的垛口上，这种技术从未停止过对蜥蜴人的惊奇。在任何时候都有{@dice 2d4}{@creature Giant Lizard||giant lizards}在栏里。它们脾气不好，如果饲养员不在现场控制它们，它们会攻击任何近在咫尺的人。如果放任不管，它们很可能会在沼泽地里乱跑。如果目标是让蜥蜴在营地里横冲直撞，需要有人先把它们激怒。用长矛把它们刺穿栅栏墙就可以了。",
	"The lizardfolk warriors live in these longhouses.": "蜥蜴人战士住在这些长屋里。",
	"The longhouses are made from reeds bound into long, thick bundles and bent into upside-down, U-shaped ribs. The spaces between the ribs are latticed and thatched with more reeds. Each longhouse has a single, woven door in the center of one end wall. The construction technique used in the longhouses is ingenious.": "长屋是用芦苇捆成长长的、厚厚的一捆，并弯曲成倒立的U形肋骨制成的。肋骨之间的空间是格子状的，用更多的芦苇做茅草。每个长屋都有一个单一的编织门，位于一端墙壁的中央。长屋中使用的建筑技术是很巧妙的。",
	"The lizardfolk may be technologically backward, but they are masters of their environment. They show the same building talent in their traps and snares.": "蜥蜴人可能在技术上比较落后，但他们是环境的主人。他们在陷阱和圈套中也表现出同样的建筑天赋。",
	"Inside, longhouses are roomy and well ventilated. The ground is covered with reed mats, and the interior is dry and airy. Gear hangs from pegs on the walls to keep it off the ground. Lizardfolk are especially careful with their new, steel weapons, which rust quickly when exposed to dampness. They fill small stone ovens with coals for heat. There are no open fireplaces; the danger from sparks is too great.": "长屋内部很宽敞，通风良好。地上铺着芦苇垫，室内干燥通风。装备挂在墙上的钉子上，使其远离地面。蜥蜴人对他们的新钢制武器特别小心，因为这些武器在潮湿的环境中会很快生锈。他们在小石炉里装上煤块取暖。没有开放的壁炉；火花带来的危险太大。",
	"Each of these longhouses could house twenty-five lizardfolk comfortably, and more with some crowding. When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} first negotiated with the lizardfolk, they intended to move the entire village here, and built accordingly. As more bullywugs also flocked to the castle and the real situation became apparent, the warriors instructed their families to stay behind. Thus, they have far more longhouse space at the castle than they need. Characters observing the area from hiding and judging solely from the longhouses would estimate conservatively that over a hundred lizardfolk live at the castle. They won't count anywhere near that many lizardfolk in the clearing. Snapjaw can explain the discrepancy, if he's around.": "每个长屋都可以舒适地容纳二十五个蜥蜴人，在有些拥挤的情况下可以容纳更多。当{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}第一次与蜥蜴人谈判时，他们打算把整个村子搬到这里，并据此建造。随着更多的bullywugs也涌向城堡，真正的情况变得明显，战士们指示他们的家人留下来。因此，他们在城堡里的长屋空间远远超过了他们的需要。从隐蔽处观察该地区并仅从长屋判断的人物会保守地估计，有超过一百个蜥蜴人住在城堡里。他们不会算出空地上有多少蜥蜴人。如果Snapjaw在的话，他可以解释这个差异。",
	"The bullywugs live in huts, which are crudely built.": "欺负人的人住在小屋中，这些小屋建造得很粗糙。",
	"A dozen or more huts are placed haphazardly on the boggy ground. Each is shaped like a slightly flattened dome. The doorways are open, but a low, short tunnel forces a creature to crawl into the hut. They are made of reeds woven through a lattice, with a generous layer of mud, grass, and dung smeared over the whole thing. Mud, swamp water, and muck slops between the huts and even flows in and out of the low, open doorways.": "十几间小屋胡乱地摆放在沼泽地上。每间的形状都像一个略微压扁的圆顶。门口是敞开的，但一条低矮的短隧道迫使生物爬进小屋。它们是由芦苇编织成的格子，上面抹了一层厚厚的泥巴、草和粪便。泥浆、沼泽水和淤泥在小屋之间滑动，甚至从低矮、敞开的门洞中流进和流出。",
	"The interiors of the bullywugs' huts are the complete opposite of the lizardfolk's longhouses: wet, filthy, sloppily made, and reeking. The floors aren't just damp; they're churned into mud pits up to 2 feet deep, so the bullywugs can rest froglike in mud up to their eyeballs. They have no sense of privacy or personal space. At night, they crowd in atop one another until everyone is squeezed. Bullywugs aren't assigned to any particular huts. They sleep in whichever is most convenient when they grow tired, so it's common for some huts to be packed at night while others sit completely empty.": "恶霸的小屋的内部结构与蜥蜴人的长屋完全相反：潮湿、肮脏、制作粗糙，而且散发着恶臭。地板不仅潮湿，而且被搅成了两英尺深的泥坑，所以恶霸们可以像青蛙一样在泥浆中休息，直到他们的眼睛。他们没有隐私或个人空间的意识。到了晚上，他们互相挤在一起，直到每个人都被挤垮。恶霸并不被分配到任何特定的小屋。当他们累了的时候，就睡在最方便的地方，所以晚上有些小屋挤满了人，而另一些小屋却完全空着，这很常见。",
	"Eight {@creature Giant Frog||giant frogs} hop randomly among the huts or sit silently in the pools of standing water. These creatures were raised from tadpoles by the bullywugs and don't bother them, but they attack anyone else who carelessly wanders within reach of their 15-foot-long tongues.": "八个（%0%）在木屋中随机跳跃，或静静地坐在积水池中。这些生物是由小霸王的蝌蚪养大的，不会打扰它们，但它们会攻击任何不小心在它们15英尺长的舌头范围内徘徊的其他人。",
	"The muddy water lapping against the castle walls is indistinguishable at a glance from the puddles and hip-deep water standing throughout the area, but it hides a moat. Portions of the moat around the southwest tower have filled in to ground level, but elsewhere it is 30 to 40 feet wide and up to 15 feet deep. The causeway (1A) arches over the moat, providing a visual clue that the water may be deeper than it appears. Anyone splashing around in the moat attracts the attention of six {@creature Crocodile||crocodiles}.": "拍打着城堡墙壁的泥水与整个地区的水坑和臀部深的水一眼望去无法区分，但它隐藏着一条护城河。西南塔周围的部分护城河已经填到了地面上，但在其他地方，它有30到40英尺宽，最深达15英尺。堤道（1A）在护城河上拱起，提供了一个视觉线索，即水可能比它看起来更深。任何在护城河中嬉戏的人都会引起六个人的注意（%0%）。",
	"This is the only entrance into the castle that's used. When the castle was built, a pair of stout wooden gates and an iron portcullis closed off this 12-foot-wide, 10-foot-high gateway. The gates are never closed; they now sag on their hinges so badly that it's not worth the effort of levering them into place for any reason short of an imminent attack. The portcullis is rigged so it can be dropped with a hard yank on a lever (located on the upper level, {@area area 2A|160|x}), but since it was last tested, the mechanism has rusted to the point where the gate will drop only 3 feet, then jam in place.": "这是进入城堡的唯一入口，也是唯一使用的入口。城堡建成后，一对坚固的木门和一个铁制的舷窗关闭了这个12英尺宽、10英尺高的大门。大门从来没有关闭过；现在它们的铰链下垂得很厉害，如果不是迫在眉睫的攻击，根本不值得花力气把它们撬开。舷窗的结构是这样的：只要用力拉动杠杆（位于上层，（%0%））就可以把它放下，但自从上次测试以来，这个装置已经生锈，以至于大门只能下降3英尺，然后卡在原地。",

A {@condition grappled} character is dragged into the pit where, along with all the hazards of being savaged by an otyugh, there is the added danger of drowning. It's safe to assume that characters entering this tower will take a big gulp of clean air first, but the otyugh's attack might knock the wind out of them. Allow the attacked character to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 5 plus the damage caused by the otyugh's tentacle attack. A successful saving throw means the character has a lungful of air when dragged into the muck and can hold his or her breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + his or her Constitution modifier, with a minimum of 30 seconds (5 rounds). Failure means the character's lungs are empty, and the character falls {@condition unconscious} at the end of his or her turn after a number of rounds equal to the character's Constitution modifier unless the character breaks free from the otyugh's grasp before then.

These lizards are used as riding mounts by lizardfolk on long patrols. The stalls, originally built for horses, have been enlarged to accommodate the beasts (eight {@creature Giant Lizard||giant lizards}). The normally lethargic creatures grow agitated when strangers enter the stables. If characters linger for more than a minute, two of the lizards start lashing the walls with their tails. The others pick up the ruckus in short order so that within two minutes, all are thrashing at the walls and bellowing. The commotion draws four {@creature lizardfolk} who are the giant lizards' handlers.

	"A few months ago, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} decided to put the forge back into operation. He despises Pharblex and the bullywugs, and he would prefer to deal solely with the lizardfolk if they could overcome the gloom that has gripped the tribe since Pharblex murdered their shaman. Borngray thought mastering a craft as advanced as metalworking would instill the lizardfolk with a renewed sense of pride. He might be right, but so far, the lizardfolk have shown little aptitude for the craft.

The workmanship is surprisingly good, though most of Tiamat's visages bear a stronger resemblance to lizardfolk than to dragons. The cultists venerate Tiamat but do not worship her, so the chapel is seldom used for anything that could be considered a religious observance or mass. Instead, individual cultists or small groups sometimes retire here for quiet reflection on how the world will suffer when the Queen of Dragons rises.": "多年来，这个小教堂一直被献给几个不同的神灵，这取决于谁统治了城堡。现在它是提亚马特的神龛，装饰着蜥蜴人制作的龙后的漂亮的木制雕像。做工出奇的好，尽管提亚马特的大部分面孔与蜥蜴人的相似度比与龙的相似度更高。崇拜者们敬仰提亚马特，但并不崇拜她，所以小教堂很少用于任何可被视为宗教仪式或弥撒的场合。相反，个别崇拜者或小团体有时会在这里静静地思考，当龙后崛起时，世界将遭受怎样的痛苦。",

Opening the box with the key disarms the trap automatically; Jos carries the key on a string around his neck.": "通常情况下，这些房间不被使用，但{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}目前占用了这些房间。它们是相当温暖和舒适的。当乔斯不在1U区、{@area 2N|16a|x}或{@area 3L|176|x}区与{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}协商时，他会在这里。乔斯把他所有真正的贵重物品都放在这里。他唯一留在这些房间里的东西是他的衣服和他的旅行法术书--里面有他准备的所有法术（见（%4%））。法术书被锁在一个嵌银红木的盒子里。通过成功的DC15灵巧检查可以打开这把锁，但是如果检查结果低于20，篡改就会引发一个与{@spell Melf's acid arrow}法术效果相同的魔法阵；酸液箭向打开盒子的角色发射，立即造成{@dice 4d6}酸液伤害，并在该角色的下一回合结束时再造成{@dice 4d6}酸液伤害。如果该角色成功地进行了DC15灵巧救赎，则伤害减半。用钥匙打开盒子会自动解除陷阱；乔斯把钥匙挂在他脖子上的绳子上。",
	"Although it is much cleaner than the lower level, the upper level of the barbican is still a mess. Muddy, webbed footprints of bullywugs trail up and down the stairs and fan out across the floor. This area is staffed by nine {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} day and night, but at night, they tend to sleep on watch.": "虽然比下层干净得多，但壁垒的上层仍然是一片混乱。泥泞的、有蹼的恶霸脚印在楼梯上来回走动，在地板上呈扇形分布。这个区域昼夜都有9名工作人员（%0%），但在晚上，他们往往会在守夜时睡觉。",
	"This level of the barbican has no roof. Hundreds of melon-sized stones are piled around the battlements for throwing down on the heads of attackers. Many of the piles have collapsed, and the bullywugs are too lazy to restack them.": "这一层的壁垒没有屋顶。数以百计的瓜子大小的石头堆在城垛周围，用来砸向攻击者的头。许多石堆已经坍塌，恶霸们也懒得重新堆放。",
	"The causeway is fully exposed to archers positioned at the rear of the barbican, but the bullywugs seldom watch that direction.": "堤道完全暴露在驻扎在壁垒后方的弓箭手面前，但恶霸们很少注意这个方向。",
	"The main feature of this area is a signal drum carved from an enormous hollow log. This drum can be heard for miles when it is beaten vigorously. The bullywugs send many different signals with the drum: they can recall patrols and foragers to the castle, wake up the camp, indicate mealtimes, announce changes of the guard, and sound a general alarm if the castle ever comes under attack. The drum is heard about six times on a typical day, and everyone who lives at the castle knows the meanings of the different drumbeats. Characters won't know what they mean without asking someone.": "这个地区的主要特征是一个由巨大的空心木头雕刻成的信号鼓。这面鼓在大力敲击时，可以听到数英里之外。恶霸们用鼓发出许多不同的信号：他们可以把巡逻队和觅食者召回城堡，唤醒营地，指示用餐时间，宣布卫兵的变化，如果城堡受到攻击，则发出总的警报。在一个典型的日子里，鼓声大约有六次，每个住在城堡里的人都知道不同鼓声的含义。如果不问别人，人物是不会知道它们的含义的。",
	"The second level of the northwest tower is in bad shape. There are large holes where the floorboards have completely rotted away or fallen into the muck below, and the floorboards that remain are unlikely to support a human's weight. The beams are still strong, but they are slick with fungus and mold. A successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check is needed to cross the level on a beam without slipping and falling into the awfulness of {@area area 1E|148|x}.": "西北塔的第二层情况很糟糕。有一些大洞，地板已经完全腐烂或掉入下面的淤泥中，剩下的地板不太可能支撑人的重量。横梁仍然很结实，但上面沾满了真菌和霉菌。需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查，才能在横梁上穿过这一层，而不至于滑倒，跌入{@area area 1E|148|x}的可怕境地。",
	"The stone steps that wind around the outer wall come to a small (approximately 3 feet by 3 feet) stone landing, then continue upward to the third level. Characters are safe from falling as long as they stay on the landing or the steps.": "绕过外墙的石阶来到一个小的（大约3英尺乘3英尺）石台，然后继续向上走到第三层。只要人物停留在平台或台阶上，就不会跌落。",
	"A trapdoor closes off the top of the stairs at the ceiling. The door is latched with a simple wooden turn-button. The door also bears a warning but, because the warning was drawn in chalk nearly a century ago, it is all but invisible now. It can be noticed with a successful DC20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. After the chalk mark is noticed, anyone who reads Dwarvish can correctly interpret it as a warning that powerful undead reside in the room beyond. Adventurers placed the rune here decades ago after running afoul of the specters in {@area area 3E|172|x}.": "一个活板门关闭了楼梯顶部的天花板。门是用一个简单的木质旋转按钮锁上的。门上还有一个警告，但由于警告是近一个世纪前用粉笔画的，现在几乎看不到了。只要成功地进行DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查，就能注意到它。在注意到这个粉笔标记后，任何能读懂矮人语的人都能正确地将其解释为一个警告，即强大的亡灵居住在房间之外。几十年前，冒险家们在与{@area area 3E|172|x}的幽灵相遇后，将符文放在这里。",
	"Across the tower, up against the south wall, is a single, locked trunk. The lock can be opened with a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. The chest contains 1,825 cp, 54 sp, and a pair of garish gold earrings that would be worth another 10 gp if melted. The chest was left behind when the last tenants of the castle departed, being considered not worth the effort to lug down the stairs.": "在塔的对面，靠南墙的地方，有一个上了锁的箱子。用一套{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和一个成功的DC10灵巧检查可以打开锁。箱子里有1,825便士，54英镑，还有一对花花绿绿的金耳环，如果融化了，还能再值10便士。这个箱子是在城堡的最后一批住户离开时留下的，因为他们认为不值得费力地拖下楼梯。",
	"The loft above the stables is where the lizardfolk store bundles of cut reeds to use as bedding in the stalls of the giant lizards. Other than reeds and a few bats, nothing else is here.": "马厩上方的阁楼是蜥蜴人存放成捆割下的芦苇的地方，用来作为巨型蜥蜴人马厩的铺垫。除了芦苇和几只蝙蝠之外，这里没有其他东西了。",
	"{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) and his personal retinue of ten {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} use this level of the barracks as their living quarters. No one else has any business being in this chamber, including cultists. Not even Borngray or {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} herself are welcome here. The bullywugs are always here at night but only two stand guard over the treasure chest during the day, when Pharblex spends most of his time in the giant frog hatchery beneath the castle. Those two guards trust no one, and one of them is equipped with a horn made of crocodile bone with which to sound the alarm if trouble develops.": "{@creature Pharblex Spattergoo|HotDQ}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})和他的十名私人随从{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}将这一层的兵营作为他们的生活区。其他任何人都无权进入这个房间，包括邪教分子。甚至博恩格雷和{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}她本人在这里都不受欢迎。恶霸们晚上总是在这里，但白天只有两个人在宝箱前站岗，这时法布尔克斯大部分时间都在城堡下面的巨型青蛙孵化场。这两个守卫不相信任何人，其中一个配备了一个鳄鱼骨制成的喇叭，如果出现麻烦，可以用它发出警报。",
	"Like all areas occupied by bullywugs, this chamber is a mess. Reed pallets, dirty baskets, and animal bones litter the floor.": "像所有被恶霸占据的区域一样，这个房间也是一片混乱。芦苇托盘、肮脏的篮子和动物骨头散落在地板上。",
	"In the southeast corner of the room is a large, sturdy chest, wrapped in chains and padlocked. The lock can be picked with {@item thieves' tools|PHB} and a successful DC 12 Dexterity check. Inside is Pharblex's share of the bullywugs' pay: silver and electrum jewelry, hand mirrors, shell combs, hair pins and brooches with semiprecious stones, all with a total value of 1,376 gp. Most of the silver is black from tarnish. In a civilized land, every one of these items is something that would be found on a woman's dressing table or nightstand. This is a private joke that {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} finds quietly hilarious. It's all the same to Pharblex, since he knows nothing of civilization or the fashions of human noblewomen.": "在房间的东南角有一个结实的大箱子，用铁链包裹着，挂着锁。锁可以用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}和成功的DC12灵巧检查来打开。里面放着法尔布拉斯的那份恶霸的报酬：银质和电子珠宝、手镜、贝壳梳子、发夹和带半宝石的胸针，总价值为1,376戈比。大部分的银子都因为变色而变黑了。在一个文明的国度里，这些物品中的每一件都是会在女人的梳妆台或床头柜上找到的东西。这是一个私人笑话，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}觉得悄悄地很搞笑。对法布尔克斯来说，这都是一样的，因为他对文明和人类贵族妇女的时尚一无所知。",
	"This chamber was stocked with armor, weapons, and hundreds of arrows when the castle was abandoned. The metal rusted to dust, the arrows warped into uselessness, and the leather was chewed away by rats and other vermin. Now this chamber is the unofficial headquarters of the lizardfolk in the castle. Neither the bullywugs nor the cultists ever come up here.": "当城堡被遗弃时，这个密室储存了盔甲、武器和数百支箭。金属锈迹斑斑，箭矢变形无用，皮革被老鼠和其他害虫咬坏了。现在这个房间是城堡里蜥蜴人的非官方总部。恶霸和邪教徒都不曾到这里来。",
	"The arsenal chamber is the warmest in the castle, thanks to heat rising from the forge ({@area area 1H|14d|x}). The lizardfolk that live in the castle gather here—usually at night—to discuss their situation and what they should do. The debate is between accepting their fate as lowly servants of the Cult of the Dragon, attacking the bullywugs in a glorious yet suicidal assault, or biding their time until they can attack with a chance of winning.": "军火库是城堡中最温暖的地方，这要归功于从锻造炉中升起的热量（（%0%））。住在城堡里的蜥蜴人聚集在这里--通常是在晚上--讨论他们的处境和他们应该做什么。争论的焦点是：是接受他们作为龙之崇拜的低级仆人的命运，还是在光荣而又自杀性的攻击中攻击恶霸，或者是等待时机，直到他们能够有机会攻击获胜。",
	"The lizardfolk's stockpile of new weapons is hidden beneath stacks of rusted, rotten, century-old arms. Just a few minutes of searching through the junk can turn up one or two bundles of sharp, clean blades for shortswords, daggers, and spears, neatly wrapped in oilskin.": "蜥蜴人的新武器储备藏在一堆生锈的、腐烂的、百年的武器下面。只要在这些垃圾中搜寻几分钟，就能发现一两捆锋利、干净的短剑、匕首和长矛的刀片，用油皮整齐地包裹着。",
	"Unless the lizardfolk are meeting, this chamber usually is empty. The lizardfolk seldom come here when they could be observed gathering, to avoid attracting suspicion or making anyone curious about what's in the unused room above the forge.": "除非蜥蜴人在开会，这个房间通常是空的。蜥蜴人很少在可以观察到他们聚会的时候来这里，以避免引起怀疑或让人对锻造厂上面的闲置房间里的东西感到好奇。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} assigned the entire northeast tower to the lizardfolk for their use, but they sleep and live mainly on the ground floor. The second-floor rooms contain nothing of interest or value.": "{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}将整个东北塔分配给蜥蜴人使用，但他们主要在一楼睡觉和生活。二楼的房间里没有任何有意义或有价值的东西。",
	"If characters poke around in this area, however, those with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher notice that the doors between areas 2H, 2I, and 2K open and close smoothly and soundlessly, unlike most other doors in the castle, which squeak and squeal loudly on corroded hinges. The lizardfolk keep these doors well-oiled so they can slip up to area 2H in the dead of night without awakening any bullywugs in the barracks (areas {@area 1G|14b|x} and {@area 2G|164|x}).": "然而，如果人物在这个区域打探，那些被动智慧（（%0%））得分在15分以上的人注意到，2H、2I和2K区之间的门开合平稳无声，不像城堡里其他大多数门，在腐蚀的铰链上发出吱吱的响声。蜥蜴人把这些门保养得很好，这样他们就可以在夜深人静的时候溜到2H区，而不会惊醒军营里的任何恶棍（区域（%1%）和（%2%））。",
	"A trapdoor closes off the top of the stairs up to {@area area 3H|175|x}. The trapdoor isn't locked, but a pair of iron spikes has been hammered between the door and the frame. Opening the door requires either a DC 10 Strength check or ten minutes spent carefully prying out the spikes. If the door is forced and no one is standing by ready to catch the spikes, they clatter noisily down the steps": "一个活板门将楼梯的顶部封闭起来，一直到（%0%）。活板门并没有上锁，但门和门框之间被钉上了一对铁钉。打开这扇门需要进行DC10力量测验，或者花10分钟小心翼翼地撬出铁钉。如果门被强行打开，而又没有人站在旁边准备接住铁钉，那么它们就会在台阶上发出嘈杂的声响。",
	"{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} has converted the second floor of the chapel into a library. This chamber at the top of the stairs contains a few crates and chests of books culled from the arriving treasure that haven't been sorted and cataloged yet. ": "{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}已经把小教堂的二楼改成了图书馆。楼梯顶端的这个密室里有几箱和几柜子的书，这些书是从抵达的宝藏中挑选出来的，还没有经过分类和编目。",
	"A small table and two chairs are the only furnishings in this chamber.": "一张小桌子和两把椅子是这个房间里唯一的家具。",

One dragonwing (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) and four {@creature Cultist||cultists} (initiates) spend most of their time here, organizing the books.": "书籍和手稿排列在用废旧木材建造的木架上。一个龙翼（统计数字见（%0%））和四个（%1%）（入门者）大部分时间都在这里整理书籍。",
	"Since treasure first started funneling through Naerytar, {@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ} has pulled out any books, parchments, tablets, and other written material that interested him. He knows better than to claim them as his own; he will forward these treasures to Tiamat's hoard when the work at Castle Naerytar draws to a close. Until then, he keeps the written material at the castle to study and to divert him from the miserable surroundings. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows about the library and approves of using the books this way, as long as they are delivered to the Well of Dragons before Tiamat's arrival.": "自从宝藏第一次开始通过Naerytar输送，{@creature Dralmorrer Borngray|HotDQ}就拿出了任何他感兴趣的书籍、羊皮纸、石板和其他书面材料。他知道最好不要把它们据为己有；当Naerytar城堡的工作接近尾声时，他将把这些宝藏转交给Tiamat的囤积物。在那之前，他把这些书面材料放在城堡里研究，以转移他对悲惨环境的注意力。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}知道图书馆的情况，并同意以这种方式使用这些书，只要在提亚马特到来之前将它们送到龙之井。",
	"Borngray has assembled an impressive library. It contains over one hundred books, quartos, and manuscripts covering the history of the Sword Coast, natural philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, magic, and many theoretical works on alternate reality, time, and dimensional travel. This collection would be a priceless addition to any library or collector in Waterdeep if it could be removed from the castle before the cultists spirit it away or the bullywugs spoil it.": "博恩格雷已经组建了一个令人印象深刻的图书馆。它包含了一百多本书籍、四开本和手稿，涵盖了剑海岸的历史、自然哲学、数学、天文学、魔法，以及许多关于替代现实、时间和维度旅行的理论著作。如果能在邪教分子把它运走或被恶霸破坏之前把它从城堡里移走，那么这套藏书对沃特迪普的任何图书馆或收藏家来说都是无价之宝。",
	"Items that are needed in the kitchen ({@area area 1P|157|x}) occasionally but not every day are stored here, along with nonperishable food such as cooking oil, grain, cheese, wine, and salted meat.": "厨房里偶尔但不是每天都需要的物品都存放在这里，还有一些不易腐烂的食物，如食用油、谷物、奶酪、酒和咸肉。",
	"The lowest-ranking cultists sleep here. At night, five {@creature Cultist||cultists} are present.

	"Area 2V is Borngray's sleeping chamber, furnished with a bed, a carpet-draped table with a wash basin and grooming supplies (comb, brush, soap, scented waters), and a stool. Rugs cover most of the floor. A raven in a large cage squawks loudly enough to be heard in the outer ward if a stranger enters the chamber, and the squawking awakens and draws the cultists and dragonwings from areas 2R and 2T to the tower. Borngray is seldom here except when sleeping, immediately before retiring, and immediately after rising.": "2V区是博恩格雷的睡房，配有一张床，一张铺着地毯的桌子，上面有一个洗脸盆和梳理用品（梳子、刷子、肥皂、香水），还有一张凳子。地板上大部分都铺着地毯。一只关在大笼子里的乌鸦大声地叫着，如果有陌生人进入密室，就会在外面的病房里听到，叫声会唤醒并把2R和2T区的邪教徒和龙翼吸引到塔上。除了睡觉时、退休前和起床后，博恩格雷很少在这里。",
	"In addition to the elf's clothing and personal effects, a small strongbox is hidden beneath a loose floorboard under a rug. The hiding place is spotted automatically if the rug is moved and missed automatically if the rug is left alone. The strongbox contains Borngray's emergency funds: 200 gp, 200 sp, and 10 precious stones worth 100 gp each.

	"Many of the topmost levels of the castle are unused by cultists. Some of them are still home to dangerous creatures that were sealed off instead of being cleared out.": "城堡的许多最顶层都没有被邪教分子使用。其中一些仍然是危险生物的家，它们被封存而不是被清理出去。",
	"Several years after its builder and original owner abandoned Castle Naerytar, the castle was re-occupied by an all-female school of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers. A few years after the astrologers moved in, they were wiped out by their own leader.

They attack other living creatures if they can't get at those who disturbed their rest, but they prefer the intruders over anyone else.": "开放的房间里有一张大桌子，墙壁周围的卷轴架上有星图。三具尸体横七竖八地躺在地板上，随着时间的推移，已经变成了粉状的骨头和尘封的破布。只要有人进入房间，他们就会像幽灵一样站起来，进行攻击。他们在城堡的任何地方追击，但他们不会离开城堡。如果它们不能对付那些打扰它们休息的人，它们就会攻击其他生物，但它们更喜欢入侵者而不是其他人。",
	"Most of the paper star charts crumble into dust when touched, but three are still sturdy enough to be carried away.

It is perched atop a heap of treasure consisting of actual gold and gems. Its value to a collector is 4,800 gp, and it weighs only 20 pounds. Rough handling will damage it, however, and reduce its value to just 1,200 gp.": "房间里少数几个容易携带的有价值的物品之一是一个2英尺高的黑龙雕像，由真正的黑龙鳞片和爪子制成，有红宝石的眼睛和钻石的牙齿。它坐落在一堆由真正的黄金和宝石组成的宝物之上。对收藏家来说，它的价值是4800金币，而且只有20磅重。然而，粗暴的处理会损坏它，使其价值降低到只有1,200金币。",
	"This chamber is where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} retires to venerate Tiamat privately. The room is bare. Its only decoration is a stylized depiction of a five-headed dragon rising from a volcano, painted on the back of the door (where it won't be seen unless someone closes the door while they're in this room). The artist had only a few colors to work with and was not especially talented, but the five heads are recognizable as the five chromatic dragons.": "这个房间是{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}退休后私下祭祀提亚马特的地方。房间里没有任何东西。它唯一的装饰是一幅五头龙从火山中升起的风格化描绘，画在门的背面（除非有人在这个房间里关上门，否则不会被看到）。画家只有几种颜色可供选择，而且没有特别的天赋，但这五个头可以辨认出是五色龙的样子。",

	"The Stargazers converted the top level of the keep into an astrological observatory. The most interesting device they installed was a {@i farseer of Illusk}—a telescope-like contraption that is useful for observing and studying heavenly bodies but which can also be used in a manner similar to an {@spell arcane eye} spell. In that mode, the {@i farseer} can view a location within fifty miles of it. Tuning and focusing the device this way calls for a considerable amount of skill and practice, and the device's dilapidated condition makes the process more difficult.": "观星者们将堡垒的顶层改造成一个星象观测站。他们安装的最有趣的设备是一个{@i farseer of Illusk}--一种类似望远镜的装置，对观察和研究天体很有用，但也可以用类似于{@spell arcane eye}咒语的方式使用。在这种模式下，{@i farseer}可以查看它周围50英里内的位置。以这种方式调整和聚焦设备需要相当多的技巧和练习，而设备的破旧状况使这个过程更加困难。",
	"Both {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray visit this area frequently to study the {@i farseer}. The elf has had limited success with it, but {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} has mastered its use.

	"To protect this area, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} enlisted the service of four {@creature Gargoyle||gargoyles}. They perch day and night on the four corners of the keep's roof, where they can be seen from the ground and where they can see through windows into the observatory. Only {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and Borngray know the gargoyles are alive. If anyone enters the observatory without being accompanied by one of the two cult officers, the gargoyles tear open the observatory's four ceiling hatches and attack.

	"The caverns beneath Castle Naerytar are accessible through {@area area 1S|15b|x}. At the top, the steps are smooth and well made. As they descend, they are rougher, make several turns, and descend about 20 feet to area 1 of the dungeon map.

	"The water flooding the center of the chamber is little more than a puddle; it reaches a depth of 1 foot near the center. The water is slightly acidic, but not enough to cause damage.

Fishing through that area turns up a handful of fancy and semiprecious stones worth 1,800 gp (2 × 50 gp, 5 × 100 gp, 200 gp, 400 gp, 600 gp). The gems came from a less-than-devoted cultist who throws a fistful of coins and other treasure items into area 2 every time he gets the chance. His plan is to come back to the castle after the cult leaves and collect his \"retirement fund.\" Unknown to him, the ooze living in area 2 scoops up the items when it passes through its lair. All the items except the gems dissolve in the ooze's body. The stones fascinate the creature's tiny brain, so it \"spits out\" the gems in the corner and collects them.

The passage connects to water south of the bullywugs' huts outside the castle. Its total length is 300 feet. At 80 feet from the entrance in this pool, the tunnel branches; the left branch leads to the surface and the right branch extends 50 feet to a dead-end.

They might also bargain and make a deal with Talis, striking against those who oppose her ascension.

	"If the players don't realize that the cult hopes to bring Tiamat to the Realms, this chapter is the best time for that information to be revealed or confirmed.

	"Because they are enemies, {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does not warn Talis that attackers might be coming through the portal on her heels, but instead slips off to Skyreach Castle (see {@area chapter 8|207|x}) with the intent of letting the adventurers destroy Talis.

	"If asked about a place to sleep, Raggnar makes it clear that he isn't an innkeeper: there are no beds or rooms, and even the stable is full. If anyone asks why, he gives his usual excuse: \"Lord Marsten and his entourage are coming to hunt. All the servants are making things ready for their arrival.\" (This is pure nonsense, of course—he has no rooms other than his own.) If the characters just wait a moment, Raggnar says he will offer them his own chambers, for a steep fee of 10 gp. \"I'll clear out a few things and it is all yours.\" This is also a stalling tactic, though he'll certainly take the money.": "如果被问及睡觉的地方，拉格纳明确表示他不是旅馆老板：没有床或房间，甚至连马厩都满了。如果有人问起原因，他就会给出惯常的借口：\"马斯顿大人和他的随行人员要来打猎。所有的仆人都在为他们的到来做准备\"。(当然，这纯属无稽之谈，除了他自己的房间，他没有其他房间。）如果角色们稍等片刻，拉格纳说他会把自己的房间提供给他们，但需要支付10戈比的高昂费用。\"我把一些东西清理出来，它就是你们的了。\" 这也是一种拖延战术，尽管他肯定会接受这笔钱。",
	"Because the cultists are about to ship a castle full of treasure from the village, they desperately don't want the characters to find anything suspicious, such as wagons loaded with chests (there's no room to hide a caravan in a village this small) or their wyvern mounts in the stables (see area 3). If Raggnar can keep the characters eating and drinking and gossiping, then Skyreach Castle can slip away into the sky.": "因为邪教分子要从村子里运走满满一城堡的财宝，所以他们极不希望角色们发现任何可疑的东西，比如装满箱子的马车（这么小的村子里没有空间隐藏商队）或者马厩里的狼人坐骑（见区域3）。如果拉格纳能让人物吃喝玩乐，闲话家常，那么Skyreach城堡就能溜到天上去。",

If the check fails by 5 or more, the wyvern strenuously objects and attacks the character once with its tail stinger as a reaction. The wyverns aren't choosy about who rides them, but convincing a wyvern to fly or move in a specific direction requires an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check; if the check fails, the wyvern ignores the rider's commands until the rider's next turn. After a rider succeeds on two such checks, the wyvern goes where the rider wants for the next hour, or until it takes damage or the rider dismounts.": "任何角色都可以通过成功的DC 10智慧({@skill Animal Handling})检查将安全带套在狼人身上。如果检定失败5次或更多，狼獾会极力反对，并作为反应用它的尾刺攻击该角色一次。狼人对骑乘它们的人并不挑剔，但说服狼人飞行或向一个特定的方向移动需要一个行动来进行DC15智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）检查；如果检查失败，狼人将忽略骑手的命令，直到骑手的下一个回合。在骑手成功地进行了两次这样的检查后，在接下来的一小时内，狼獾会去骑手想要去的地方，或者直到它受到伤害或骑手下马。",
