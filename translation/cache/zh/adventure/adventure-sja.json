	"If captured and interrogated, the giff reveal that they take their orders from Mustaf Shultz, the giff captain of the damselfly ship, who takes his orders from Vocath the mercane.

He neither helps nor harms the characters.": "如果一个Githyanki在战斗中倒下了，另一个Githyanki就会用它的下一个行动来试图杀死Miken并取走他的头。一击足以将米肯的命中率降至0，而用大剑的后续挥舞足以将其斩首。如果角色们在米肯被杀之前就击败了吉蒂扬基，那么米肯就会像婴儿一样瘫软在地上哭泣。他既不帮助也不伤害这些角色。",
