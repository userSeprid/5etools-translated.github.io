	"A large, grassy hill stands in the High Moors, cracked by some ancient stress. It was thought to be a barrow, once, but it was never meant to be a tomb. It is a vault turned into a prison as punishment for the poor souls who vowed to defend it... and failed.": "一座长满草的大山矗立在高沼泽地，被一些古老的压力压裂了。它曾经被认为是一个荒冢，但它从来就不是为了成为一个坟墓。它是一个变成监狱的金库，作为对那些发誓要保卫它的可怜人的惩罚......但却失败了。",

	"Thousands of years ago the Stone of Creation existed in another world in the multiverse, where it had been used and abused by warring mages. To protect the Stone and themselves, the mages of that world locked it in a colossal sphere of stone with two guardians to tend it: a gorgon called Kyrilla and a male human called Kathikon. They swore an oath to their gods to defend the Stone and protect its vault, for the sphere was meant to float, hidden, between various elemental planes of existence until the mages could decide what to do with it. But when the mages went looking for it, they could not find it.": "几千年前，创造之石存在于多元宇宙的另一个世界，在那里它被交战的法师们使用和滥用。为了保护创世之石和他们自己，那个世界的法师们把它锁在一个巨大的石球里，有两个监护人照看它：一个叫Kyrilla的戈尔贡和一个叫Kathikon的男性人类。他们向他们的神发过誓，要保卫石头和保护它的金库，因为这个球体要在各种元素存在的星球之间漂浮、隐藏，直到法师们能决定如何处理它。但当法师们去寻找它时，他们却找不到它。",

	"First, creatures of the ancient Realms cracked open the shell and took the Stone. Even the guardians, Kyrilla and Kathikon, cannot recall who they were—it was so long ago. But rather than die defending the Stone, they hid, each afraid of losing the other. Thus they broke their oaths to the gods and thus they were each cursed with hideous beauty and a petrifying gaze—so that they would find it impossible to see each other's faces again.": "首先，古界的生物敲开了外壳，拿走了石头。即使是守护者Kyrilla和Kathikon，也记不起他们是谁了--那是很久以前的事。但他们宁可为保卫宝石而死，也要躲起来，各自害怕失去对方。因此，他们违背了对诸神的誓言，因此，他们各自被诅咒为丑陋的美貌和石化的目光--因此，他们将发现不可能再看到对方的脸。",
	"For centuries, they dwelled alone in what remained of the sphere. That ended when yuan-ti cultists from the Serpent Hills found the sphere and dug into it, thinking it was a burial mound that might contain lost treasures. When the cultists found, instead, Kyrilla and Kathikon, they mistook them for medusae from legends. The cultists bestowed upon them powers to summon snakes. They gave them gifts, from supplicants to servitor snakes. They wanted to know the guardians' secrets—they wanted to know more about the Stone of Creation.": "几个世纪以来，他们独自居住在球体的剩余部分。当蛇山的元老级崇拜者发现球体并挖掘它，认为它是一个可能包含失落的宝藏的墓冢时，这种情况就结束了。当邪教徒们发现Kyrilla和Kathikon时，他们误以为他们是传说中的Medusae。邪教徒们赋予他们召唤蛇的能力。他们给了他们礼物，从祈求者到仆人蛇。他们想知道守护者的秘密--他们想知道更多关于创造之石的信息。",

Kathikon was turned to stone. 3 DEEPEST nIGHT Episode 4 DEEPEST nIGHT Episode 4 Furious, heartbroken, and now alone, Kyrilla took out her anguish on the yuan-ti.

Hamish—who believed himself to be descended from a giant of Ravnica—wanted to see the world his ancestors came to explore. As they all set out to explore the High Moors near the Sword Coast, they met a human fighter named Waltarn Everlake in the village of Secomber, and he joined their party. But the adventure met with disaster when the party delved into the lair of Kyrilla without knowing what they were getting into. Sylvene and Artura managed to recover pieces of the artifact they sought, but Waltarn was slain by arrows out of the darkness, and Hamish was turned to stone while attempting to secure everyone's escape by closing up the entrance to the monster's lair.": "50多年前，一位来自平面城市Ravnica的巫师，名叫Sylvene，跟随关于一件失落的神器的传说，一路来到Faerûn世界。在水底世界，她找到了两个强大的盟友：一个叫阿图拉的矮人流氓和一个叫{@creature Hamish Hewland|AitFR-DN}的慷慨的巨人。阿图拉想发现丢失的宝藏。哈米什--他认为自己是拉夫尼卡巨人的后裔--希望看到他的祖先来探索的世界。当他们都开始探索剑海岸附近的高地沼泽时，他们在塞康伯村遇到了一个名叫沃坦恩-埃弗莱克的人类战士，他加入了他们的队伍。但这次冒险遇到了灾难，他们在不知情的情况下深入到了基里拉的巢穴中。希尔维尼和阿图拉成功地找到了他们所寻找的神器的碎片，但瓦塔恩被黑暗中的箭矢射杀，而哈米什在试图通过关闭怪物巢穴的入口来确保所有人的逃脱时被变成了石头。",

When the adventurers arrive at the site of the lair, they likely find evidence of a previous adventuring party, whose misadventures here still echo through the years. Once inside the lair, they find a harrowing collection of monsters defending the secrets needed to destroy the Stone of Creation. Along the way, they may discover more about its strange origins and the danger it poses.": "当一个鬼魂恳求冒险者寻找一种方法来干扰泰勒斯的计划--甚至摧毁创造之石--冒险进入一个怪物的巢穴寻找秘密传说时，冒险就开始了。当冒险者们到达巢穴所在地时，他们可能会发现以前的冒险队伍的证据，他们在这里的不幸经历仍然回荡在岁月中。一旦进入巢穴，他们就会发现一群可怕的怪物在保卫摧毁创造之石所需的秘密。一路上，他们可能会发现更多关于它的奇怪起源和它所带来的危险。",

	"If the adventurers have access to Waltarn's crypt from the prior adventure, \"A Verdant Tomb,\" Waltarn's ghost appears to them there and sets things in motion. He explains that the keystones Tyreus stole from the tomb were recovered from the place where Waltarn was killed: a place that fell to the Realms from some far plane of existence. He tells them to head 110 miles southeast of the confluence of the Delimbiyr, east of Secomber, where a huge hill \"looks as if it had been cracked by lightning.\" More secrets about the stones can doubtless be found there. \"You are more powerful now than we were then,\" Waltarn says. \"But be wary all the same.\"": "如果冒险者们在之前的冒险 \"青翠的坟墓 \"中能够进入华塔恩的墓穴，华塔恩的鬼魂就会在那里出现，并让事情开始进行。他解释说，泰勒斯从坟墓里偷出来的钥匙石是从华尔丹被杀的地方找到的：一个从某个遥远的存在平面落入王国的地方。他告诉他们往东南方向110英里处的德林拜尔河汇合处走，在塞康伯的东边，那里有一座巨大的山丘，\"看起来就像被闪电劈开的一样\"。毫无疑问，在那里可以找到更多关于石头的秘密。\"你们现在比我们那时更强大，\"沃坦恩说。\"但还是要小心谨慎。\"",
	"If the adventurers need another way into the adventure, whether they've played prior installments or not, another spirit comes into play. The spirit of Artura—who is not dead but rather lost on the Astral Sea—reaches out to the adventurers as if she were a ghost. She hasn't chosen them personally but sees their futures entwined with her past in her surreal vision.": "如果冒险者需要另一种方式进入冒险，无论他们是否玩过之前的作品，另一个精神就会发挥作用。阿图拉的灵魂--她没有死，而是迷失在星海中--向冒险者伸出援手，就像她是一个幽灵。她没有亲自选择他们，但在她超现实的视野中看到他们的未来与她的过去纠缠在一起。",
	"She sees the Stone of Creation like a dark, black anchor in the water, holding her spirit in place, pulling down on fate. \"Something bad is going to happen, and I know that damn thing is part of it!\" To find out more about it, she tells the party to journey to where the Stone came from: 110 miles southeast of the Delimbiyr confluence east of Secomber. \"That's where things went wrong. Maybe it's not too late to set them right?\"": "她看到创造之石就像水中的一个黑暗的黑锚，把她的精神固定在那里，把命运拉下来。\"有坏事要发生，我知道那该死的东西是它的一部分！\" 为了了解更多情况，她告诉大家前往石头的来源地：在塞康伯以东的德林拜尔汇合处东南110英里。\"那是事情出错的地方。也许现在纠正它们还不算太晚？\"",

	"Though fog shrouds everything here, it's easy to recognize the huge, dome-like mound of earth and the great, dark cleft in its western edge. The domed hill must be more than sixty feet high, and the crack cuts half that high. A few tall boulders have fallen into the cleft—though the hill is so grassy and clear otherwise, those boulders look more like they've been placed there.": "虽然大雾笼罩着这里的一切，但很容易就能认出那座巨大的、圆顶状的土丘和它西边的巨大、黑暗的裂缝。圆顶山一定有60多英尺高，而裂缝有一半那么高。有几块高大的巨石掉进了裂缝中--尽管在其他方面，这座山是如此的草木皆兵，那些巨石看起来更像是被放在那里的。",
	"This is the place. The tall boulders are Medium-sized stones, each about 1,000 pounds, set in place by the galeb duhrs in area 2. They're meant to discourage trespassers and protect the statue that blocks the way into area 4. A creature that is Small or smaller can squeeze between the boulders to see into area 4, but it is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} all the way.": "这就是那个地方。这些高大的巨石是中等大小的石头，每块约1000磅，由2区的Galeb duhrs设置的。它们是为了阻止入侵者，并保护阻挡进入4区的雕像。小型或更小的生物可以挤在巨石之间看到4号区域，但它是{@quickref difficult terrain||3}一路的。",
	"Three squat boulders are here amid the long grasses and shallow water of the moor. Each is spotted with lichen and patches of rich, dark moss. They're arranged on the ground as if they are the points of a triangle.": "在荒野的长草和浅水中，有三块蹲着的巨石。每块石头上都有地衣和丰富的深色苔藓的斑点。它们排列在地上，仿佛是一个三角形的点。",
	"The ground here is littered with small, lifeless rocks amid windswept grasses. The three largest boulders are actually a trio of galeb duhrs quietly contemplating the countryside—and now, the adventurers. They came along after Sylvene's and Hamish's adventuring party fled the site, then animated boulders into area 4 to protect that area from later trespassers. Since then, the galeb duhrs have wandered the area slowly, returning to this place every twenty years or so to see what has changed. They've been sitting here for almost five years on this visit.": "这里的地面上，风吹草低见牛羊，到处都是毫无生气的小石头。三块最大的巨石实际上是三只加勒布杜尔，它们静静地沉思着这个国家--以及现在的冒险者们。他们是在希尔维尼和哈米什的冒险队伍逃离现场后出现的，然后将巨石动画化到4号区域，以保护该区域不被后来的人侵入。从那时起，galeb duhrs就慢慢地在这个地区游荡，每隔20年左右就会回到这个地方，看看有什么变化。这次来的时候，他们已经在这里坐了将近五年了。",
	"These elementals aren't looking for a fight. They'd love to hear a good story, though, if it isn't told too fast. If the adventurers talk openly about needing access to the cleft in the rock and do not seem to have villainous intent, the galeb duhrs animate the boulders out of their way. The elementals then stick around for a week waiting for the adventurers to emerge from the lair and leave before resealing the lair. The galeb duhrs become dismayed with (and thus bored of) the adventurers if they ignore or damage the statue of Hamish in area 4. While dismayed, they sit motionless and silent in the grass, stubbornly waiting for the adventurers to leave, then reseal the lair.": "这些元素并不是在寻找一场战斗。不过它们很想听一个好故事，如果故事讲得不是太快的话。如果冒险者公开谈论需要进入岩石的裂缝，而且看起来并没有邪恶的意图，那么加勒布都赫就会把巨石搬出来挡住他们的路。元素们会在附近停留一周，等待冒险者从巢穴中出来并离开，然后再重新密封巢穴。如果冒险者无视或破坏第4区的哈米什雕像，加勒布杜赫就会对他们感到失望（从而对他们感到厌烦）。在失望之余，他们一动不动地坐在草地上，沉默不语，顽固地等待着冒险者的离开，然后重新封闭巢穴。",
	"Carved into the hillside here is a ten-foot-high alcove of simple stones, framing a low stone altar. It might've been ornate once, but years of weather have smoothed its features. A wide, table-like slab of stone stands on four short supports carved like serpents. The ground under the altar is loose gravel atop a wide stone base.": "在这里的山坡上刻着一个十英尺高的简单石头凹槽，框住了一个低矮的石头祭坛。它可能曾经很华丽，但多年的风霜雨雪已经使它的特征变得平滑了。一块宽大的、像桌子一样的石板矗立在四个像蛇一样雕刻的短支架上。祭坛下的地面是松散的砾石，上面是宽大的石基。",
	"This altar was built by yuan-ti from the Serpent Kingdom, southeast of here. For a time, the cultists used the altar to perform ceremonies invoking the spirits of dead yuan-ti inside the structure below, but the cultists haven't been back in years. Their magic created the skeletal horrors inside the lair but could not control them.": "这个祭坛是由来自东南方向的蛇国的元老们建造的。有一段时间，邪教徒们用这个祭坛来举行仪式，召唤下面结构中死去的元帝的灵魂，但邪教徒们已经多年没有回来了。他们的魔法创造了巢穴内的骷髅恐怖，但却无法控制它们。",
	"The altar is made of four stout columns (150 pounds each) and a slab (400 pounds), all standing on a single 250-pound boulder, still under the gravel beneath the altar. That boulder caps a natural fissure in the ground which the yuan-ti cultists used to access the inner lair. If the altar and the boulder beneath it are moved, a 5-foot-diameter tunnel is revealed. It leads to area 7 inside the lair.": "祭坛由四根粗壮的柱子（每根150磅）和一块石板（400磅）组成，都站在一块250磅的巨石上，仍在祭坛下面的砾石下。那块巨石盖住了地面上的一个天然裂缝，元神崇拜者用它来进入内部巢穴。如果移动祭坛和它下面的巨石，就会发现一条直径5英尺的隧道。它通往巢穴内的第7区。",
	"The colossal sphere that is now Kyrilla's lair was meant to traverse various planes of existence for decades, until someone could decide what to do with the Stone of Creation. The idea was to use an extradimensional space conjured by Kyrilla's keystone of creation to feed and house Kyrilla and Kathikon. They would navigate the well shaft using {@spell levitate} spells—to which Kyrilla no longer has access. Almost nothing went as hoped.": "这个巨大的球体现在是Kyrilla的巢穴，本来是为了穿越各个存在的星球，持续几十年，直到有人能决定如何处理创造之石。这个想法是利用Kyrilla的创造之石所幻化出的超维空间来供养和安置Kyrilla和Kathikon。他们将使用{@spell levitate}Kyrilla不再能使用的法术在井道里航行。几乎没有任何事情能如愿以偿。",
	"The interior of Kyrilla's lair was meant to hold the Stone of Creation in a copper grip at its center, to protect it from people—and people from it. Now, the encasing shell of the Stone is a prison for Kyrilla.": "Kyrilla的巢穴的内部本来是要把创造之石放在中心的铜夹子里，以保护它不被人发现，而人也不被它发现。现在，创造之石的外壳成了Kyrilla的监狱。",
	"The sphere's meteoric arrival left this whole place almost exactly upside down. Iron sconces and hooks for tapestries are all upside down, relative to the current layout. The panoramic mural and various carved details at what is now the top of the well shaft also appear upside down.": "球体的陨落让这整个地方几乎完全颠倒了。相对于现在的布局，铁制的壁炉和挂毯的挂钩都是颠倒的。全景壁画和现在井口顶部的各种雕刻细节也是倒置的。",
	"None of this was built; all of it was conjured, either by distant mages' spells or by forgotten powers of the Stone itself. Individual stones and mortar were never set in place by hand. The whole place has a cold orderliness to it, made uneven by the passage of time. Water seeping into this place over thousands of years has been {@condition poisoned} by the stone shell—and by Kyrilla's curse.": "这一切都不是建造出来的；所有这些都是幻化出来的，要么是由遥远的法师的咒语，要么是由石头本身的遗忘的力量。每块石头和灰泥都不是用手摆放的。整个地方有一种冰冷的秩序感，因为时间的流逝而变得不平整。几千年来，渗入这个地方的水已经被石壳和Kyrilla的诅咒（%0%）了。",

	"Areas 8, 9, 10, and 11 were all conjured through the power of a keystone of creation to which Kyrilla is attuned. She created them in a time of fury and despair, resulting in their warped and strained appearances.

	"The statue leans against a huge stone slab, as though holding it in place; its hands even grip the stone with perfect precision. The giant depicted in the statue is fully detailed with a backpack, finely wrought hair, a coil of rope, laced boots—all rendered sharply from a single stone. He's positioned near the only gap around the slab, just a foot or so wide, and seems to peer through it.": "雕像靠在一块巨大的石板上，仿佛在支撑着它；它的双手甚至完美精确地抓着石头。雕像中所描绘的巨人是完全详细的，他有一个背包，精雕细琢的头发，一卷绳子，系带的靴子--所有这些都是从一块石头上鲜明地呈现出来的。他被安置在石板周围唯一的缝隙附近，只有一英尺左右宽，似乎在透过缝隙窥视。",
	"The statue, of course, is the {@condition petrified} form of {@creature Hamish Hewland|AitFR-DN} (see appendix A), the giant who accompanied Sylvene, Waltarn, and Artura here more than 50 years ago. Hamish tried to reseal the lair but caught sight of Kathikon on the other side just as he was fixing the slab into position. Kathikon was satisfied to leave Hamish there, holding the slab in place, in hopes that it would slow or thwart future visitors.": "当然，这尊雕像是{@creature Hamish Hewland|AitFR-DN}（见附录A）的{@condition petrified}形态，这个巨人在50多年前曾陪伴希尔维尼、沃坦恩和阿图拉来到这里。哈米什试图重新封住巢穴，但就在他把石板固定在位置上时，看到了另一边的卡西孔。Kathikon很满意地把哈米什留在那里，把石板固定在那里，希望它能减缓或阻挡未来的访客。",
	"Hamish's round, wooden shield—big enough for a giant—is still propped up near the statue's feet, but it has rotted beyond practical use.": "哈米什的圆形木质盾牌--足够一个巨人使用--仍旧支撑在雕像的脚边，但它已经腐烂得没有实际用途。",
	"If restored to life with a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic, Hamish comes back to life with a gasp. As far as Hamish is concerned, he had been fleeing the dark well beyond, alongside his adventuring peers, just moments ago. He realized he was being {@condition petrified} for one fleeting moment, then he was unthinking stone. Hamish was down to 11 hit points when he was {@condition petrified}.": "如果用{@spell greater restoration}的咒语或类似的魔法恢复生命，哈米什就会在喘息声中复活。在哈米什看来，就在刚才，他已经和他的冒险同伴们一起逃离了黑暗的远方。他意识到自己被{@condition petrified}了一个转瞬即逝的瞬间，然后他就成了不思进取的石头。哈米什在被{@condition petrified}的时候，命中率下降到11%。",
	"Hamish is willing to help the adventurers if he believes their intentions are good. He shares any lore he knows from the section \"Hamish's Tale,\" if he thinks it won't get people needlessly hurt. He wants to avoid descending the well shaft, or venturing beyond, after his last experience in there. He's happy to help with climbing gear, provide light, and otherwise be of use.": "哈米什愿意帮助冒险者，如果他相信他们的意图是好的。如果他认为不会让人们受到不必要的伤害，他就会分享他在 \"哈米什的故事 \"部分知道的任何传说。在他上次的经历中，他想避免下井，或在井外冒险。他很乐意帮助提供攀登装备，提供照明，以及在其他方面发挥作用。",
	"This dark, squared well shaft descends into the earthen darkness at a steep angle, as if bored out of the rock itself. Three long, hefty, coppery poles jut at even intervals from the walls of the shaft, almost meeting in the center, and each one ends in an empty clamp or claw. If they held something once, it would have been suspended at the center of the shaft.": "这个黑暗的方形井口以一个陡峭的角度下降到土质的黑暗中，仿佛是从岩石本身钻出来的。三根长长的、厚重的、铜质的杆子以均匀的间隔从井壁上伸出来，几乎在中心相遇，每根杆子的末端都是一个空的夹子或爪子。如果它们曾经容纳过什么东西，那么它就会被悬挂在竖井的中心。",
	"The top of this chamber was meant to be the floor when the structure was made. The walls at that end of the structure are etched with deep carvings of humanoid figures of many races, all of them with heads upturned and arms outstretched toward their sky as if basking or reveling. Behind them, a depiction of a long wall of tall towers and spiked battlements runs all along the well shaft. The only break in the ring of people features a carved set of double doors in the depiction of the wall—but it is only a picture. (This was intended to be the location of the mystic door now located in area 11.)": "这间屋子的顶部在建造时被认为是地板。结构那一端的墙壁上刻有许多种族的人形图案，他们都仰着头，向天空伸出手臂，似乎在晒太阳或狂欢。在他们身后，描绘的是一堵由高大的塔楼和带尖刺的垛口组成的长墙，沿着井口一直延伸。人群中唯一的破绽是在墙的描绘中出现了一组雕花的双门--但这只是一幅画。(这本来是现在位于11区的神秘之门的位置）。",
	"The floor at the feet of the carved figures is dominated by a silver disc almost 10 feet in diameter, etched with sigils and symbols in concentric circles and anchored by a short, iron pedestal and a simple mounting bracket designed to hold something that is no longer there. (It was made to hold the tuning fork that is now located in area 10.)": "雕刻人物脚下的地板上有一个直径近10英尺的银色圆盘，上面蚀刻着同心圆的符号和象征，并由一个短小的铁质基座和一个简单的安装支架固定，旨在放置一些已经不存在的东西。(它是为了放置现在位于第10区的音叉而制作的）。",
	"Irregularities in the rock walls, plus a variety of hooks and sconces (all upside down), make it easy to secure ropes and other climbing gear throughout the well shaft. The copper arms sticking out of the walls once grasped the Stone of Creation. Their clamping grippers were bent and mangled when ancient intruders stole the stone centuries ago and are still misshapen. The arms themselves were designed to support almost 1,000 pounds and are still strong.": "岩壁上的不规则现象，加上各种钩子和壁炉（都是颠倒的），使得整个井口很容易固定绳索和其他攀登工具。伸出岩壁的铜臂曾经抓住过创造之石。几个世纪前，当古代入侵者偷走石头时，它们的夹子被弄得弯弯曲曲，至今仍是错落有致。铜臂本身的设计可以支撑近1000磅的重量，而且仍然很坚固。",
	"Three original chambers extend off this center well shaft: areas 4, 6, and 7.": "在这个中心井轴上延伸出三个原始房间：4、6和7区。",
	"What is now the bottom of the shaft has fallen into the ground and become part of the physical construction made by Kyrilla and Kathikon using one of the keystones. The drop from area 5 to the floor of area 8 is a distance of 30 feet.": "现在井底的东西已经落入地下，成为Kyrilla和Kathikon用其中一块钥石做的实体建筑的一部分。从第5区到第8区的地面的落差是30英尺的距离。",
	"A {@creature giant zombie constrictor snake|AitFR-DN} (see appendix A) clings comfortably to this chamber, nestled into an angle where walls meet the floor. It came from area 6.": "一个（%0%）（见附录A）舒适地依附在这个房间里，依偎在墙壁与地板相接的一个角度。它来自第6区。",
	"The silver seal in the floor is mostly iron under a layer of silver leaf worth 525 gp. Etched into it is an inscription in a rare dialect of {@language Terran}, explaining lore about the Stone of Creation and its lesser artifacts—whatever lore you may want to convey to bring your players and their characters up to speed—and the names of Kyrilla and Kathikon, who were meant to be guardians of the artifacts.": "地板上的银色印章在一层价值525gp的银叶下，大部分是铁。它上面刻着一种罕见的方言（%0%），解释了关于创造之石及其较小的神器的传说--无论你想传达什么传说，以使你的玩家和他们的角色了解情况--以及Kyrilla和Kathikon的名字，他们本应是神器的守护者。",
	"The floor angles away from you, down to a section of wall that bristles with snagged and cast-off scales and piled dry refuse and remains, collected over hundreds of years.": "地板从你身边倾斜而下，到了一段墙上，上面布满了脱落的鳞片和堆积的干垃圾和残骸，这些都是几百年来收集的。",
	"This is where the giant zombie constrictors usually wait out eternity. Unless it has been drawn out by sounds of battle, a second giant undead constrictor snake is coiled here.": "这里是巨型僵尸缢杀者通常等待永恒的地方。除非它被战斗的声音吸引出来，否则第二条巨型不死缢蛇就盘踞在这里。",
	"Among the detritus and remains at the back of the chamber are a ruby-studded bracer (90 gp), four golden rings (30 gp each), and a silver circlet (45 gp), all leftover from yuan-ti cultists devoured years ago.": "在密室后面的残骸中，有一个镶有红宝石的手镯（90金币）、四个金戒指（每个30金币）和一个银环（45金币），都是多年前元老级崇拜者吞噬的遗物。",
	"This angled chamber is home to a pile of yellowed, rotten bones large enough to be human or similar. The angle of the room has caused all the bones to heap in one corner. Lots of slender rib bones suggest serpentine bodies or copious humanoid ribcages. Snake-like skulls—each the size of a human's or a dwarf's—peer out from the pile. They all look to be caught in place by the rough walls and whatever gore once clung to the bones—but they look like they could fall toward you at any moment.": "这个有角度的房间里有一堆发黄的腐烂的骨头，大到足以成为人类或类似的东西。这个房间的角度导致所有的骨头都堆在一个角落里。很多细长的肋骨表明是蛇形的身体或大量的人形肋骨。蛇形的头骨--每个都有人类或侏儒的大小--从这堆骨头中伸出来。它们看起来都被粗糙的墙壁和曾经附着在骨头上的任何血迹固定住了，但它们看起来随时都会向你倒下。",
	"The mass of bones clinging in place here is the body of a {@creature skeletal horror|AitFR-DN} (see appendix A). It has braced itself into position to await intruders and attacks when living creatures investigate its bones or attempt to leave the area—even if they disturb nothing. It is unmoved by the sights or sounds of battle in the well shaft.": "粘在这里的那团骨头是一个（%0%）的尸体（见附录A）。它已经支撑着自己的位置，等待着入侵者，当生物调查它的骨头或试图离开这个区域时，它就会发动攻击--即使它们什么也没打扰。它对井筒里的战斗景象或声音无动于衷。",
	"Centuries ago, yuan-ti cultists slipped into the lair and arrived in this chamber. They closed up the tunnel when they left the site for good, capping that tunnel with the boulder and the altar at area 3.": "几百年前，元老级的邪教徒溜进巢穴，来到了这个密室。他们在永远离开这里的时候关闭了隧道，用巨石和3号区域的祭坛封住了隧道。",
	"Any treasures taken from the bodies of the yuan-ti whose bones make up this skeletal horror are now at the bottom of the poison pool in area 8.": "任何从元帝身上取下的宝物，其骨头构成了这具恐怖的骨骼，现在都在第8区的毒水池底部。",
	"The floor here is hidden in a dark-red liquid with the consistency of thin mud. Something like algae clouds it, too. A musty, slightly sweet pond-scum smell fills the air.": "这里的地板隐藏在一种暗红色的液体中，其稠度像稀泥。一些像海藻一样的东西也混在其中。空气中弥漫着一股发霉的、略带甜味的池塘渣滓气味。",
	"This foul liquid combines all the fluids that have ebbed, flowed, or been bled into the lair over time. Most of it is rain and groundwater that have seeped in but all of it has become a gruesome and powerful poison through the accursed power of Kyrilla's lair.": "这种恶臭的液体结合了所有的液体，这些液体随着时间的流逝，流进了巢穴，或者被流进了巢穴。其中大部分是渗入的雨水和地下水，但所有这些都通过Kyrilla巢穴的诅咒之力变成了可怕而强大的毒药。",
	"The poison pool is 2 feet deep and {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. The bottom of it is covered in broken pieces of statues made from yuan-ti cultists she {@condition petrified} and then had destroyed.": "毒池有2英尺深，（%0%）。池底布满了由元始天尊制作的雕像碎片，这些雕像是她（%1%）后让人毁掉的。",
	"A living creature whose eyes, nose, ears, or mouth are submerged in the poison must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, suffering 11 ({@damage 2d10}) poison damage if it fails, or half as much if it succeeds. A creature that starts its turn submerged repeats the saving throw.": "眼睛、鼻子、耳朵或嘴巴被毒药淹没的生物必须做一个DC14的宪法救赎动作，如果失败则遭受11({@damage 2d10})的毒药伤害，如果成功则是一半的伤害。一个开始被淹没的生物会重复这个蓄力动作。",
	"A creature that drinks a mouthful of the poison must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. The creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on a success.": "喝下一口毒药的生物必须在DC14宪法救赎中成功，否则就会在1分钟内受到（%0%）。该生物可以在其每个回合结束时尝试新的自救动作，成功后结束该状态。",
	"The pool also hides a mass of bones that are actually the {@condition prone} body of another skeletal horror. Merely disturbing the pool isn't enough to stir its attention; it waits until living flesh touches the pool—or when Kyrilla commands it—then rises to attack intruders.": "池子里还藏着一团骨头，实际上是另一个骷髅恐怖的（%0%）身体。仅仅扰乱池子并不足以引起它的注意；它要等到活人的肉体接触到池子--或者当Kyrilla命令它时--才会站起来攻击入侵者。",
	"Near the northern edge of the poison pool, amid loose rocks on the ground, is a {@item brooch of shielding}. It is all that remains of an emissary from the Serpent Kingdoms. Also, Kyrilla's keystones are set into the floor at the center of the poison pool.": "靠近毒液池的北边，在地上松散的岩石中，有一个（%0%）。这是一位来自蛇国的使者的全部遗物。另外，Kyrilla的钥匙石被镶嵌在毒液池中心的地板上。",
	"This chamber is eerily empty. A layer of rock dust and stray earth blankets the space. Nothing has moved through this area in a long, long time.": "这个房间空得可怕。一层岩石尘埃和游离的泥土覆盖着这个空间。在很长、很长的时间里，没有任何东西在这个区域移动。",
	"These rooms were meant to be part of Kyrilla's and Kathikon's living space in this ornate prison, but as they fell into rote habits, they wandered their own spaces less and less.": "这些房间本应是基里拉和卡西孔在这个华丽的监狱中生活空间的一部分，但随着他们落入死板的习惯，他们越来越少地在自己的空间里徘徊。",
	"A simple stone chair is the only furniture in this colorful room. It stands in the center of the space, beneath the peak of a vaulted ceiling. The walls are hung with once-lavish, rotting silks and abstract tapestries. The vaulted ceiling is painted with a flaking mural across four sections, portraying a tale of humanoid figures and a black slab of stone marbled with gold. From the ceiling where the four sections join, someone has hung a single metal chime on a simple cord.": "一把简单的石椅是这个色彩斑斓的房间里唯一的家具。它矗立在空间的中心，在拱形天花板的顶峰之下。墙壁上挂着曾经辉煌的、腐烂的丝绸和抽象的挂毯。拱顶上的壁画剥落了四个部分，描绘了一个人形的故事和一块黑色的石板，上面镶嵌着金色的大理石。在这四个部分连接的天花板上，有人用一根简单的绳子挂了一个金属风铃。",
	"This area received all of Kyrilla's attention when she conjured the place with her keystone of creation. She created the ceiling's mural from memory and saved the chime after it fell from a wall during the sphere's arrival in Faerûn. There used to be five of them, hung from the walls at the base of the well shaft.": "当Kyrilla用她的创造基石幻化出这个地方时，这个区域得到了她所有的关注。她根据记忆创造了天花板上的壁画，并在球体抵达法鲁恩时从墙上掉下来后保存了风铃。以前有五个，挂在井底的墙壁上。",
	"The ceiling depicts four pieces of lore about the Stone of Creation:": "天花板上描绘了关于创世之石的四段传说。",
	"First, the Stone was placed inside the sphere, depicted by three wizards raising it magically into the grip of the three copper arms while a white male human and a green-skinned gorgon look on.": "首先，宝石被放置在球体中，由三名巫师将其神奇地举起，放入三只铜臂的握柄中，而一名白人男性人类和一名绿色皮肤的戈尔贡则在一旁观看。",
	"Second, the Stone is carried away by tall figures, possibly giants, as depicted by figures that make the human and the gorgon look small by comparison. They appear to be carrying the stone to a lake or inland sea.": "第二，石头被高大的人物抬走了，可能是巨人，所描绘的人物使人类和戈尔贡相比之下显得渺小。他们似乎是在把石头运到一个湖泊或内陆的海里。",
	"Third, the human and the gorgon are struck by a curse depicted as green flames that surround their bodies and replace their eyes.": "第三，人类和戈尔贡被一种诅咒击中，这种诅咒被描绘成绿色的火焰，围绕着他们的身体，取代了他们的眼睛。",
	"Fourth, the Stone is shown breaking into pieces by lightning, fire, and wind where a simple silver tuning fork touches it. Beneath it, towers turn to smoke.": "第四，在一个简单的银质音叉接触到石头的地方，石头被闪电、火焰和风打成碎片。在它的下面，塔楼变成了烟雾。",
	"The chime, like its siblings, plays precisely the frequency needed to plane shift into the Elemental Chaos. The chime is not magical.": "这个风铃和它的兄弟姐妹们一样，精确地播放着进入混沌元素的平面转换所需的频率。报时器并不神奇。",
	"The instruments tuned to the arcane frequency of the Elemental Chaos can be used in at least two ways. First, the chimes can be used to create components for a {@spell plane shift} spell leading to the tumultuous Elemental Chaos—components like the tuning fork itself, which is already crafted for such a purpose. Second, the fork (or another of its kind tuned to the Elemental Chaos) can be used to destroy the {@item Stone of Creation|AitFR-AVT} or its related artifacts, as described in appendix B.": "调谐到混沌元素的奥秘频率的乐器至少有两种用途。首先，风铃可以用来为通往动荡的元素混沌的{@spell plane shift}法术制造部件--像音叉本身一样的部件，它已经为这种目的而制作。其次，音叉（或另一个调谐到元素混沌的同类）可以用来摧毁（%%）或其相关的神器，如附录B中所述。",
	"The air buzzes and thrums. A five-foot-wide doorway swirls with dull light here, seemingly leading into the stone wall beyond, though its arcane glow hides whatever is on the other side.": "空气嗡嗡作响，激动人心。一个五英尺宽的门洞在这里闪烁着暗淡的光芒，似乎通向石墙之外，尽管它的神秘光芒掩盖了另一边的东西。",
	"This area holds only the mystical door that leads to Kyrilla's extradimensional refuge.": "这个区域只保留了通向Kyrilla异度空间避难所的神秘之门。",
	"Once through the portal, the fullness of Kyrilla's refuge becomes apparent—as well as a terrible price she has paid in her cursed form.": "一旦穿过传送门，Kyrilla的避难所就会变得很明显--以及她以被诅咒的形式付出的可怕代价。",
	"The ground is low grass that looks to have been nibbled by sheep or goats. The soil is good, strong dirt. The horizon seems to reach as far as you can imagine. The sky is deep and vast and brilliant, filled almost to bursting with stars undimmed by moonlight and glittering in a sea of colorful, stellar clouds.": "地面是低矮的草，看起来是被绵羊或山羊啃过的。土壤是良好的、坚固的泥土。地平线似乎可以达到你能想象的那么远。天空深邃、辽阔、灿烂，几乎充满了不受月光影响的星星，在五颜六色的恒星云海中闪闪发光。",
	"This extradimensional space is a peculiar variation on a magnificent mansion, conjured into existence by Kyrilla and her linked keystone. Despite appearing to be outdoors, the space is actually an enclosed dome with a grassy floor. The ceiling of the dome is an image of stars—the night sky of another world, without any city or moon to disrupt the light of the stars. The \"mansion\" consists of a single, cozy cottage in a wide meadow. The air smells like wheat in autumn but is utterly still.": "这个维度外的空间是一个奇特的变化，它是由Kyrilla和她连接的钥匙石幻化出来的一座宏伟的豪宅。尽管看起来是在户外，但这个空间实际上是一个封闭的穹顶，地面上长满了草。穹顶的天花板是星星的图像--另一个世界的夜空，没有任何城市或月亮来扰乱星星的光芒。这座 \"豪宅 \"由一个宽阔的草地上的单人舒适小屋组成。空气中弥漫着秋天的麦香，但完全是静止的。",
	"It is all an easy illusion to see through, no ability check required. Any creature that walks to the outer edge of the refuge can touch the sky—that is, the dome encasing the extradimensional space—and finds it smooth and solid. The stars twinkle and the clouds drift about, but they are merely imagery. This place was never real and represents only a fantasy that Kyrilla shared with Kathikon for a time. Alas, about 30 feet from the cottage door, a statue of Kathikon kneels amid the grass, {@condition petrified} by Kyrilla's gaze.": "这都是很容易看穿的幻象，不需要检查能力。任何走到避难所外围的生物都可以触摸到天空--也就是包裹着超维空间的穹顶--发现它是光滑而坚固的。星星在闪烁，云朵在飘动，但它们只是意象。这个地方从来都不是真实的，只代表了Kyrilla与Kathikon有一段时间的幻想。唉，在离小屋门约30英尺的地方，一尊卡西孔的雕像跪在草丛中，{@condition petrified}被Kyrilla注视着。",
	"From outside, it appears to be a cozy cottage with stone walls and a roof of sod. Smoke rises gently from the chimney.": "从外面看，这似乎是一个舒适的小屋，有石墙和草皮屋顶。烟雾从烟囱中缓缓升起。",
	"Here Kyrilla and Kathikon pretended they were whiling away eternity in some tranquil plane of existence, taking turns seeing for each other, or existing solely by touch. Everything they truly valued was here.": "在这里，Kyrilla和Kathikon假装他们是在某个宁静的存在平面上消磨永恒，轮流为对方看病，或仅靠触摸而存在。他们真正重视的一切都在这里。",
	"Inside, the cottage is mundane—even quaint. It's made of a single, long room with a fur-covered bed at one end and a large cooking hearth at the other. A wood fire crackles.": "小屋内部很平凡，甚至很古朴。它是由一个长条形的房间组成的，一端有一张覆盖着毛皮的床，另一端是一个大炉灶。一堆木头火在噼啪作响。",
	"A ring inset with a black diamond sits under a wooden bowl on the mantlepiece. Once, the ring was meant as a reminder of their duties here, but Kyrilla came to resent it even before it would become dangerous for her to look at it—lest she catch sight of her own reflection. It is a ring of protection.": "在壁炉架上的一个木碗下面放着一枚镶嵌着黑钻石的戒指。曾经，这枚戒指是为了提醒他们在这里的职责，但Kyrilla甚至在她看它变得危险之前就开始反感它了--以免她看到自己的倒影。这是一枚保护的戒指。",
	"Additionally, a simple silver tuning fork hangs from the ceiling from the same cord as another surviving chime (like the one in area 10).": "此外，一个简单的银质音叉从天花板上悬挂下来，与另一个幸存的风铃（如第10区的风铃）用同一根线连接。",
	"The adventurers have new information and, perhaps, everything they need to confront Tyreus and decide what fate shall befall the artifact he seeks. The final adventure in this series likely brings the players to the edge of Highstar Lake in the High Moors to deal with Tyreus and the Stone of Creation as they see fit, using what they've learned or recovered from Kyrilla's lair.": "冒险家们有了新的信息，也许还有他们所需要的一切，以对抗泰瑞斯，并决定他所寻求的神器将面临怎样的命运。这个系列的最后一次冒险可能会把玩家带到高摩尔的高星湖边缘，用他们学到的东西或从Kyrilla的巢穴中找到的东西来对付Tyreus和创造之石，他们认为合适。",
	"These NPCs and new monsters appear throughout the adventure.": "这些NPC和新的怪物在整个冒险过程中出现。",
	"Perhaps there is one way to inspire Kyrilla to hope: Introduce her to a restored Hamish and let her see that life might exist beyond the effects of her curse. If the adventurers restore Kathikon to flesh and blood, Kyrilla could be so moved as to break her attunement to her keystones and share everything about the ceremonial chamber, its chime, and the tuning fork, as described in the sidebar \"Tuning Chaos.\" Destroying the Stone of Creation could even end the curse on Kyrilla and Kathikon!": "也许有一个方法可以激发Kyrilla的希望：把她介绍给复原的哈米什，让她看到在她的诅咒影响之外，生命可能存在。如果冒险者们将卡提空恢复成血肉之躯，那么Kyrilla可能会被感动，从而打破她对钥石的调和，并分享关于仪式室、钟声和音叉的一切，如侧边栏 \"调和混沌 \"中所述。摧毁创造之石甚至可以结束对Kyrilla和Kathikon的诅咒!",
	"If you need statistics for Kathikon, use Kyrilla's.": "如果你需要卡西孔的统计数据，请使用Kyrilla的。",
	"The following artifacts either appear in this adventure or are important to foreshadowing the next adventure in the series. The Stone of Creation does not appear in this adventure but is included to help the DM understand it and allude to its powers.": "以下文物要么出现在这个冒险中，要么对预示系列中的下一个冒险很重要。创造之石并没有出现在这个冒险中，但包括在其中是为了帮助管理员理解它并暗示它的力量。",
	"The silver seal in the floor is mostly iron under a layer of silver leaf worth 525 gp.
