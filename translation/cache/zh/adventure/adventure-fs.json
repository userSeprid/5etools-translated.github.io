	"Something is killing people in Palebank Village, and if the characters don't stop it, they might be next. \"Frozen Sick\" is an adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level and introduces them to the continent's Biting North region—the bleak arctic realms of the Greying Wildlands and Eiselcross.": "Palebank村有东西在杀人，如果人物不阻止它，他们可能就是下一个。\"冰冻病 \"是一次冒险，将1至3级的角色引入大陆的北方地区--灰暗荒地和艾瑟克罗斯的荒凉北极地区。",
	"If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see {@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}), work with them to decide how they made their way to Palebank Village. Are they citizens of Uthodurn now aiding in the surface expansion of their civilization? Have they come north to seek freedom from the wars of other lands? Any number of options can help tie characters to this frigid region and the mysteries it holds.": "如果你的玩家使用英雄编年史来创建他们的角色（见{@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}），与他们一起决定他们是如何来到Palebank村的。他们是Uthodurn的公民，现在在协助他们的文明的表面扩张？他们是为了从其他土地的战争中寻求自由而来到北方吗？任何数量的选择都可以帮助将角色与这个寒冷的地区和它的神秘性联系起来。",
	"Urgon Wenth, a dwarf explorer, recently returned home to Palebank Village after exploring the icy wastes of Eiselcross for a year. The dwarf brought home several items plundered from ruins on Foren, the largest of Eiselcross's islands. Among these treasures were two beautiful blue glass vials, which Urgon sold to an elf collector named Verla Pelc. The vials were then stolen, given to a fence out of Shadycreek Run, and sold again to an unsuspecting merchant.": "矮人探险家Urgon Wenth在Eiselcross的冰雪荒原探索了一年后，最近回到了Palebank村的家中。这个矮人从艾瑟克罗斯最大的岛屿--福伦的废墟中掠夺了几件物品带回家。在这些宝物中，有两个美丽的蓝色玻璃瓶，乌尔冈将其卖给了一个名叫维拉-佩尔克的精灵收藏家。然后，这些玻璃瓶被偷了，交给了沙迪克雷恩的一个篱笆，并再次卖给了一个不知情的商人。",
	"In truth, the vials' beautiful blue color is the result of deadly blue spores that cling to the interior of the glass. Faint cracks in both the vials have exposed each person who handled them to frigid woe, a deadly disease that can't be cured by conventional means. The disease has already killed Urgon and Verla, turning them into ice statues. Details on frigid woe are found in the \"{@book Eiselcross|EGW|4}\" section of chapter 3.": "事实上，小瓶的美丽蓝色是粘附在玻璃内部的致命蓝色孢子的结果。这两个小瓶中的微弱裂缝使每个处理它们的人都暴露在冰冷的苦难中，这是一种致命的疾病，无法用常规方法治好。这种疾病已经杀死了乌尔贡和维拉，把他们变成了冰雕。关于寒冰之哀的详情可在第三章的\"（%0%）\"部分找到。",
	"While the characters are in Palebank Village, community leader Elro Aldataur asks for their help figuring out who or what has killed Urgon Wenth. An explorer recently returned from Eiselcross, Urgon was afflicted by a strange malady that turned him into an ice statue, and which has since shown up in another of the village's residents. The characters investigate the mystery while contending with the forces of the Uttolots, one of the criminal families that control Shadycreek Run. More infected locals are discovered, including one more already dead, before the characters clear Uttolot thugs out of a local cavern complex called Croaker Cave. In the end, the vials of frigid woe are reclaimed, but merchant Irven Liel and his family are infected and will be the next to die without a cure. Moreover, the characters might well be infected with the disease themselves.": "当人物在Palebank村时，社区领袖Elro Aldataur要求他们帮助找出杀害Urgon Wenth的人或事。乌尔根是一名刚从艾瑟克罗斯回来的探险家，他被一种奇怪的疾病折磨，变成了一尊冰雕，后来又在村里的另一位居民身上出现了。角色们一边调查这个谜团，一边与控制Shadycreek Run的犯罪家族之一的Uttolots的势力抗衡。更多被感染的当地人被发现，包括一个已经死亡的人，然后人物将Uttolot的暴徒赶出当地一个叫Croaker Cave的洞穴群。最后，冰冷哀伤的小瓶被收回，但商人Irven Liel和他的家人被感染了，并将成为下一个没有治愈方法的死者。此外，这些人物很可能自己也被感染了这种疾病。",
	"Elro asks the characters to travel to Eiselcross to seek a cure for frigid woe. The characters take a boat to Syrinlya, the Uthodurnian outpost on Foren, and retrace Urgon Wenth's path to the ruin of Salsvault. This magic laboratory was once a part of Aeor, an ancient flying city-state that crashed into Eiselcross during the Calamity. Only by braving Salsvault's defenses and deadly guardians can the adventurers find the antidote they need.": "埃尔罗要求角色们前往艾瑟克罗斯，以寻求治疗寒冷哀伤的方法。角色们乘船前往福林岛上的乌索多尼亚前哨站Syrinlya，并重走Urgon Wenth的道路，来到Salsvault的废墟。这个魔法实验室曾经是Aeor的一部分，Aeor是一个古老的飞行城邦，在灾变期间坠落到Eiselcross。只有冒着Salsvault的防御和致命的守护者，冒险者们才能找到他们需要的解药。",

	"The adventure begins in Palebank Village, with the characters drawn immediately into the drama of death in an isolated settlement. Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "冒险开始于帕勒班克村，角色们立即被卷入这个与世隔绝的定居点的死亡戏剧中。一旦玩家准备好开始，请阅读或转述以下内容来设定场景。",
	"Snow gently falls from the sky and wind bites your cheeks as you stand in the graveyard of Palebank Village, a fishing outpost of Uthodurn that is home to several hundred dwarves and elves. The sun is low in the sky, sinking behind the fresh grave of Urgon Wenth, an old dwarf who caught a curse or disease that turned him into an ice statue. The folk of the village have gathered to pay their final respects to Urgon's frozen remains.": "当你站在帕勒班克村的墓地时，雪从天空中轻轻落下，风咬着你的脸颊，帕勒班克村是乌索杜恩的渔业前哨站，有几百名矮人和精灵居住。太阳在天空中低垂，沉入乌尔根-温特的新坟后面。乌尔根-温特是一个老矮人，他受到了诅咒或疾病，变成了一尊冰雕。村民们聚集在一起，向乌尔根的冰冻遗体致以最后的敬意。",
	"As part of their characters' backstories, the players can decide whether any of them knew Urgon or whether they've come to the funeral simply to show respect to the folk of the community. Either way, continue by reading the following:": "作为角色背景故事的一部分，玩家可以决定他们中是否有人认识乌尔衮，或者他们来参加葬礼只是为了向社区的民众表示尊重。无论怎样，请继续阅读以下内容。",
	"A gruff voice speaks softly from behind you. \"Thank you for attending Urgon's service.\" You turn and meet the gaze of Elro Aldataur, a weathered elf, retired ranger, and the leader of the village. \"I'm sorry to speak of dark tidings under such circumstances, but I believe that Palebank Village might be in danger, and I'm hoping you can help us.\"": "一个粗犷的声音从你身后轻轻地说。\"谢谢你参加乌尔根的仪式。\" 你转过身来，迎上了埃尔罗-阿尔达图尔的目光，他是一个饱经风霜的精灵，退役的游侠，也是村子的领袖。\"我很抱歉在这种情况下说起黑暗的消息，但我相信帕勒班克村可能处于危险之中，我希望你能帮助我们。\"",
	"Whether the characters are known in the village as neophyte adventurers or simply look the part, Elro (a neutral good, male wood elf {@creature veteran}) hopes that they're the sort of people not afraid to step up to help folks in need. Use the following points to help guide the conversation as he explains his concerns to the characters:": "无论这些角色是在村子里被称为新进的冒险家，还是仅仅看起来像个角色，埃尔罗（一个中立的善良的男性木精灵（%0%））都希望他们是那种不怕站出来帮助有需要的人的人。在他向人物解释他的担忧时，请使用以下几点来帮助引导对话。",
	"Two months ago, Urgon Wenth returned home after exploring Eiselcross for a year. He had been back for only for a few days when he came down with a strange affliction, which made the dwarf move slowly and caused blue veins to appear all over his body.": "两个月前，乌尔根-温特在探索了艾瑟克罗斯一年后回到了家。他只回来了几天，就患上了一种奇怪的病症，这种病症使这个侏儒行动缓慢，并使他全身出现蓝色的血管。",
	"The village's priests of Moradin and Corellon used every spell they could muster to attempt to heal Urgon, but nothing they tried could stop the bizarre malady. Urgon battled the affliction for weeks, until his ever-slowing body eventually turned to ice.": "村里的莫拉丁和科瑞隆的牧师们用尽了他们能想到的所有法术来试图治愈乌尔冈，但他们所做的一切都无法阻止这种奇怪的疾病。乌尔根与这种病症斗争了数周，直到他不断缓慢的身体最终变成了冰。",
	"Until yesterday, Elro and the rest of the community believed that Urgon's sad fate was an isolated incident, most likely caused by something the dwarf came into contact with while exploring Eiselcross. Then Elro noticed Tulgi Lutan, a dwarf trapper, showing signs of the same illness.": "直到昨天，埃尔罗和社区其他成员都认为，乌尔根的悲惨命运是一个孤立的事件，很可能是这个矮人在探索艾瑟克罗斯时接触到的东西引起的。然后，埃尔罗注意到矮人捕猎者图尔吉-卢坦也出现了同样的疾病症状。",
	"Alarmed, Elro tried to talk to Tulgi about it, but she pushed him away, asking that he let her die in peace.": "震惊之余，埃尔罗试图与图尔吉谈及此事，但她把他推开，要求他让她平静地死去。",
	"If the characters are willing, Elro wants them to find out what caused Urgon and Tulgi's affliction. He's worried that it could spread, but Tulgi refuses to talk to him, and the Glassblades in the village are better known for their combat skills than their ability to glean the truth in a complicated situation. Moreover, Tulgi is extremely distrustful of the authorities.": "如果人物愿意的话，埃尔罗希望他们能找出乌尔根和图尔吉的病因。他担心病症会扩散，但图尔吉拒绝与他交谈，而且村子里的玻璃刀手更多的是以他们的战斗技巧而不是在复杂情况下搜集真相的能力而闻名。此外，图尔吉对当局极其不信任。",
	"Elro thinks a group of adventurers might have better luck convincing Tulgi to talk. If the characters agree to help find the cause of Urgon and Tulgi's affliction, Elro offers to pay them 100 gp. He suggests that the characters start by searching Urgon's home or talking to Tulgi at her cabin.": "埃尔罗认为一群冒险者可能会有更好的运气来说服图尔吉开口。如果角色们同意帮助找到乌尔根和图尔吉的病因，埃尔罗会付给他们100戈比。他建议角色们从搜索乌尔根的家或在图尔吉的小屋里与她交谈开始。",
	"Urgon Wenth lived in a one-story, one-room log cabin at the edge of town. A good-natured Glassblade rookie named Mila Teno (a lawful good, female wood elf {@creature scout}) stands guard outside the front door. If the characters explain why they've come, she allows them to enter the house and look around. When the characters enter the cabin, read:": "乌尔根-温斯住在镇子边缘的一栋一层的单间木屋里。一个名叫米拉-特诺（Mila Teno）的心地善良的玻璃刀新秀（合法善良，女木精灵（%0%））在前门外站岗。如果角色解释了他们的来意，她会允许他们进入房子并四处看看。当人物进入小屋时，请阅读。",
	"This cramped, dark cabin might have been a cozy place when its owner was alive. Now an unmade bed stands near a cold fireplace, its mantle hung with the head of some snarling white beast with gray horns.

	"Any character who examines the mess in the cabin realizes that someone recently trashed the place while searching it. A successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals the intruder's footprints.
