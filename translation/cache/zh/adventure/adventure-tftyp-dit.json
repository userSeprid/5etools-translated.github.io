	"Welcome to {@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}. Within this book you will find seven of the deadliest dungeons from the history of D&D, updated for the current edition of the game. Some are classics that have hosted an untold number of adventurers, while others are newer creations boldly staking their place in the pantheon of notable D&D adventures.": "欢迎来到{@i Tales from the Yawning Portal}。在这本书中，你会发现D&D历史上最致命的七个地牢，并为当前版本的游戏进行了更新。有些是承载了无数冒险者的经典之作，而有些则是较新的创作，大胆地在著名的D&D冒险圣殿中占据了一席之地。",
	"Just as these dungeons have made an impression on D&D players, so too have tales of their dangers spread across the D&D multiverse. When the night grows long in Waterdeep, City of Splendors, and the fireplace in the taproom of the Yawning Portal dims to a deep crimson, adventurers from across the Sword Coast-and even some visiting from other D&D worlds-spin tales and rumors of lost treasures.": "正如这些地牢给D&D玩家留下的印象一样，关于其危险的故事也在D&D多元宇宙中传播。当辉煌之城沃特迪普的夜色渐浓，打哈欠之门酒馆的壁炉暗淡成深红色时，来自整个剑海岸的冒险者--甚至是一些来自其他D&D世界的来访者，都在传颂着关于丢失宝藏的故事和传闻。",
	"A wanderer from the distant Shou Empire speaks of strange, leering devil faces carved in dungeon walls that can devour an explorer in an instant, leaving behind not a single trace of the poor soul's passing.": "一个来自遥远的寿氏帝国的流浪者说，在地牢的墙壁上雕刻着奇怪的、淫荡的魔鬼面孔，可以在瞬间吞噬一个探险者，不留下一个可怜的灵魂经过的痕迹。",
	"A bald, stern wizard clad in blue robes and speaking with a strange accent tells of a wizard who claimed three powerful weapons from a city on the shores of a lake of unknown depths, who spirited them away to a slumbering volcano and dared adventurers to enter his lair and recover them.": "一个身穿蓝色长袍、说话带着奇怪口音的秃头严厉的巫师讲述了一个巫师从一个不知名的深湖岸边的城市领走了三件强大的武器，他把这些武器带到了一座沉睡的火山，并让冒险家们敢于进入他的巢穴并找回这些武器。",
	"A one-eyed dwarf spins tales of a castle that fell into the earth, and whose ruins stand above a subterranean grove dominated by a tree that spawns evil.": "一个独眼矮人讲述了一个坠入地底的城堡的故事，其废墟矗立在一个地下小树林之上，该小树林由一棵孕育邪恶的树主导。",
	"These are only a few of the tales that have spread across the Sword Coast from the furthest reaches of Faerûn and beyond. The minor details change with the telling. The dread tomb of Acererak shifts its location from a dismal swamp, to a searing desert, to some other forbidding clime in each telling. The key elements remain the same in each version of the tales, lending a thread of truth to the tale.": "这些只是从法鲁恩最远的地方和其他地方传遍剑海岸的几个故事。这些小细节随着故事的进行而改变。可怕的阿塞拉克之墓在每次讲述中都会将其位置从阴暗的沼泽地转移到炙热的沙漠，再转移到其他一些禁忌的气候。在每个版本的故事中，关键因素保持不变，为故事提供了一条真实的线索。",
	"The seeds of those stories now rest in your hand. D&D's deadliest dungeons are now part of your arsenal of adventures. Enjoy, and remember to keep a few spare character sheets handy.": "这些故事的种子现在就在你手中。D&D最致命的地牢现在是你的冒险武器库的一部分。尽情享受吧，并记得保留一些备用的角色表。",
	"Tales from the Yawning Portal contains seven adventures taken from across D&D's history.": "来自哈欠门的故事》包含七个来自D&D历史上的冒险。",

	"These adventures provide the perfect side quest away from your current campaign. If you run published D&D campaigns, such as {@i Storm King's Thunder}, the higher level adventures presented here are an ideal way to extend the campaign beyond.": "这些冒险提供了远离你当前战役的完美副线任务。如果你运行已出版的D&D活动，如{@i Storm King's Thunder}，这里介绍的更高级别的冒险是扩展活动的理想方式。",
	"{@i The Sunless Citadel,} written by Bruce R. Cordell, was the first published adventure for the third edition of the D&D game. It is designed for a party of four or five 1st level player characters.": "{@i The Sunless Citadel,}由Bruce R. Cordell编写，是D&D游戏第三版的第一个出版的冒险。它是为四个或五个一级玩家角色的聚会设计的。",
	"Ever since its publication in 2000, The Sunless Citadel has been widely regarded as an excellent way to introduce new players to the game. It's also a great starting experience for someone looking to be a Dungeon Master for the first time.": "自2000年出版以来，《无日城堡》一直被广泛认为是向新玩家介绍游戏的绝佳方式。对于那些希望首次成为地下城主的人来说，这也是一个很好的开始经验。",

Those who survive the experience can expect to advance to 5th level-seasoned adventurers ready to strive for greater glory and renown.": "与前作一样，{@i The Forge of Fury}也是为人物在要塞中前进的过程中提供越来越强的威胁而量身定做的。那些活下来的人可望晋级到第五级--经验丰富的冒险家，准备为更大的荣耀和名声而奋斗。",
	"{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,} written by Harold Johnson and Jeff R. Leason, made its debut under the title {@i Lost Tamoachan} at the Origins game convention in 1979, where it was used in the official D&D competition. The first published version of the adventure was produced in 1980.": "{@i The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan,}由Harold Johnson和Jeff R.

	"Lawrence Schick, the author of {@i White Plume Mountain}, related in the 2013 compilation Dungeons of Dread that he wrote the adventure as a way of persuading Gary Gygax to hire him as a game designer. Not only did he get the job, but {@i White Plume} became an instant favorite when it was first published in 1979.": "{@i White Plume Mountain}的作者Lawrence Schick在2013年的汇编《Dungeons of Dread》中提到，他写这个冒险是为了说服Gary Gygax雇佣他做游戏设计师。他不仅得到了这份工作，而且(1%)在1979年首次出版时就立即成为了人们的最爱。",
	"The version of the adventure in this book is tailored to a group of characters of 8th level.": "本书中的冒险版本是为一组8级的角色量身定做的。",
	"{@i Dead in Thay,} written by Scott Fitzgerald Gray, was created when the fifth edition D&D game was in the testing stages. In its original form, it was used as the story of the D&D Encounters season in the spring of 2014. Featuring an immense and lethal dungeon known as the Doomvault, the adventure serves as a tribute to {@i Tomb of Horrors, Ruins of Undermountain}, and other \"killer dungeons\" throughout the history of the game.": "{@i Dead in Thay,}由斯科特-菲茨杰拉德-格雷撰写，是在第五版D&D游戏处于测试阶段时创作的。它的原始形式被用作2014年春季的D&D邂逅季的故事。这个冒险的特点是一个巨大而致命的地牢，被称为Doomvault，它是对(%%1%)以及游戏历史上其他 \"杀手地牢 \"的致敬。",
	"The version of {@i Dead in Thay} presented here is modified for use in home campaigns. It is designed for characters of 9th to 11th level.": "这里介绍的{@i Dead in Thay}的版本是为了在家庭活动中使用而修改的。它是为9至11级的人物设计的。",
	"The three linked adventures that make up {@i Against the Giants} were created and originally released in 1978, during the time when Gary Gygax was still writing the {@i Player's Handbook} for the original AD&D game. Despite being (in a sense) older than the game itself, these adventures continue to hold a special place in the hearts and memories of D&D players of all ages.": "构成{@i Against the Giants}的三个链接的冒险故事是在1978年创作并最初发布的，当时Gary Gygax还在为最初的AD&D游戏编写{@i Player's Handbook}。尽管（从某种意义上说）比游戏本身还要古老，但这些冒险在所有年龄段的D&D玩家心中仍然占有特殊的地位和记忆。",
	"The compilation of {@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}, and {@i Hall of the Fire Giant King} was published in 1981 as {@i Against the Giants}. The version presented here is designed to be undertaken by characters of 11th level.": "{@i Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl}和{@i Hall of the Fire Giant King}的汇编在1981年作为{@i Against the Giants}出版。这里介绍的版本是为11级的人物所设计的。",
	"Before there was much of anything else in the world of the D&D game, there was the {@i Tomb of Horrors}.": "在D&D游戏的世界里还没有太多的东西，就有了（%0%）。",
	"The first version of the adventure was crafted for Gary Gygax's personal campaign in the early 1970s and went on to be featured as the official Dungeons & Dragons event at the original Origins gaming convention in 1975. The first publication of {@i Tomb of Horrors}, as a part of the Advanced D&D game, came in 1978.": "该冒险的第一个版本是在1970年代早期为Gary Gygax的个人活动精心设计的，并在1975年最初的起源游戏大会上作为官方龙与地下城活动的特色。作为高级D&D游戏的一部分，{@i Tomb of Horrors}的首次出版是在1978年。",
	"As a proving ground for characters and players alike, fabricated by the devious mind of the game's cocreator, Tomb of Horrors has no equal in the annals of D&D's greatest adventures. Only high-level characters stand a chance of coming back alive, but every player who braves the Tomb will have the experience of a lifetime.": "作为一个由游戏创造者的邪恶思想所创造的角色和玩家的试验场，恐怖之墓在D&D最伟大的冒险史上是无与伦比的。只有高级别的角色才有机会活着回来，但每一个勇闯古墓的玩家都会有一生难忘的经历。",
	"To run each of these adventures, you need the fifth edition {@i Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide}, and {@i Monster Manual}. Before you sit down with your players, read the text of the adventure all the way through and familiarize yourself with the maps as well, perhaps making notes about complex areas or places where the characters are certain to go, so you're well prepared before the action starts.": "要运行这些冒险，你需要第五版（%0%）和（%1%）。在你和你的玩家坐下来之前，先把冒险的文字全部读一遍，也熟悉一下地图，也许可以把复杂的区域或人物一定会去的地方记下来，这样你就能在行动开始之前做好充分的准备。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@i Monster Manual} contains stat blocks for most of the monsters and NPCs found in this book. When a monster's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the Monster Manual. Descriptions and stat blocks for new monsters appear in appendix B. If a stat block is in that appendix, an adventure's text tells you so.": "{@i Monster Manual}包含本书中大多数怪物和NPC的状态块。当一个怪物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向怪物手册中该生物的状态块。新怪物的描述和状态块出现在附录B中。如果一个状态块在该附录中，冒险的文本会告诉你。",
	"Spells and nonmagical objects or equipment mentioned in the book are described in the {@i Player's Handbook}. Magic items are described in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, unless the adventure's text directs you to an item's description in appendix A.": "书中提到的法术和非魔法物品或装备在（%0%）中描述。魔法物品在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中描述，除非冒险的文字指示你去看附录A中的物品描述。",
	"While these adventures were never meant to be combined into a full campaign-over 30 years separates the newest from the oldest-they have been selected to provide play across a broad range of levels. With a little work, you can run a complete campaign using only this book.": "虽然这些冒险从来都不是为了组合成一个完整的战役--最新的和最老的相隔30多年--但它们被选来提供广泛的等级游戏。只要稍加努力，你就可以只用这本书开展一个完整的活动。",
	"Starting with The Sunless Citadel, guide your players through the adventures in the order that they are presented in this book. Each one provides enough XP that, upon completing the adventure, the characters should be high enough level to advance to the next one.": "从《无日城堡》开始，引导你的玩家按照本书中的顺序完成冒险。每一个冒险都提供了足够的XP，在完成冒险后，角色应该有足够高的等级来进入下一个冒险。",
	"The Yawning Portal, or some other tavern of your own invention or drawn from another D&D setting, provides the perfect framing device for the campaign. The characters hear rumors of each dungeon, with just enough information available to lead them to the next adventure. Perhaps a friendly NPC drawn from the upcoming adventure visits the tavern in search of help, or some element of a character's background pushes the group down the proper road. In any case, these dungeons are designed to be easily portable to any campaign setting.": "Yawning Portal，或其他你自己发明的或来自其他D&D设定的酒馆，为活动提供了完美的框架装置。角色们听到了每个地牢的传闻，有足够的信息来引导他们进行下一次冒险。也许一个从即将到来的冒险中抽出的友好的NPC会到酒馆寻求帮助，或者一个角色的背景的某些元素会把他们推到正确的道路上。在任何情况下，这些地牢的设计都可以很容易地移植到任何活动环境中。",
	"Amid the bustle of Waterdeep, within the Castle Ward where barristers, nobles, and emissaries battle with word and contract, stands an inn not quite like any other. Before there was a Castle Ward or even what could be recognized as an ancestor of the City of Splendors, there was a dungeon, and in that dungeon begins the tale of the Yawning Portal.": "在沃特迪普的喧嚣中，在大律师、贵族和使者们用言语和契约战斗的城堡区，矗立着一家与其他地方不太一样的旅馆。在没有城堡区或者甚至可以被认为是辉煌之城的祖先之前，有一个地牢，而在那个地牢里，打哈欠的门的故事开始了。",
	"In ages past, the mighty wizard Halaster built his tower at the foot of Mount Waterdeep and delved deep into tunnels first built by dwarves and drow in search of ever greater magical power. Halaster and his apprentices expanded the tunnels they found, worming out new lairs under the surface for reasons of their own. In time, their excavations grew into the vast labyrinth known today as Undermountain, the largest dungeon in all of the Forgotten Realms. Halaster eventually disappeared, as have all his apprentices, but the massive complex he built remains to this day.": "在过去的岁月里，强大的巫师哈拉斯特在沃特德普山脚下建造了他的塔，并深入到最初由矮人和乌鸦建造的隧道中，寻找更强大的魔法力量。哈拉斯特和他的学徒们扩大了他们所发现的隧道，出于他们自己的原因在地表下挖出了新的巢穴。随着时间的推移，他们的挖掘工作逐渐发展成为今天被称为 \"地下山 \"的巨大迷宫，这是整个被遗忘之域中最大的地牢。哈拉斯特最终消失了，他的所有学徒也都消失了，但他建造的巨大建筑群至今仍在。",
	"For untold years, the secrets of Undermountain remained hidden from the surface world. Everyone who entered its halls failed to return. Its reputation as a death trap grew to the point that criminals in Waterdeep who were sentenced to die were forcibly escorted into the dungeon and left to fend for themselves.": "无数年来，地下山的秘密一直被隐藏在地面世界。所有进入其大厅的人都没有回来。它作为死亡陷阱的名声越来越大，以至于在沃特迪普被判处死刑的罪犯被强行押入地牢，任其自生自灭。",
	"All of that changed with the arrival of two men, a warrior named Durnan and a ne'er-do-well named Mirt. The duo were the first adventurers to return from Undermountain, laden with riches and magic treasures. While Mirt used his wealth to buy a mansion, Durnan had different plans. Durnan retired from adventuring and purchased the land on which sat the deep, broad well that was the only known entrance to the dungeon. Around this well he built a tavern and inn that caters to adventurers and those who seek their services, and he called it the Yawning Portal.": "这一切都随着两个人的到来而改变，一个叫杜南的战士和一个叫米特的新教徒。这两个人是第一批从地下山回来的冒险家，满载着财富和魔法宝藏。米特用他的财富买了一座豪宅，而杜南则有不同的计划。杜南从冒险中退休，并购买了土地，那里有一口又深又宽的井，是地牢唯一已知的入口。围绕这口井，他建造了一个酒馆和旅店，以满足冒险者和那些寻求他们服务的人的需求，他把它称为打哈欠的入口。",
	"Some of the magic Durnan looted on his successful foray into Undermountain granted him a life span that exceeds even that of an elf. And for decades Durnan left delving into Undermountain to younger folk. Yet one day, something drew him back. Days of waiting for his triumphant return from the dungeon turned to months and then years. For nearly a century, citizens of Waterdeep thought him dead. But one night, a voice called up from the well. Few at first believed it could be Durnan, but folk as long-lived as he vouched it so. The Yawning Portal had passed into the hands of his ancestors, but Durnan returned with enough riches for them to quietly retire. Durnan took his customary place behind the bar, raised a toast to his own safe return, and then began serving customers as if he'd never left.": "杜南在成功进入地下山时掠夺的一些魔法使他的寿命甚至超过了精灵的寿命。几十年来，杜南把深入地下山的工作留给了年轻的人们。然而有一天，有东西吸引他回来了。等待他从地牢中凯旋的日子变成了几个月，然后是几年。近一个世纪以来，沃特德普的公民都认为他已经死了。但有一天晚上，一个声音从井里叫了起来。起初很少有人相信这可能是杜南，但和他一样长寿的人都证明了这一点。曙光之门已经落入他的祖先手中，但杜南带着足够的财富回来，让他们悄悄退休。杜南在酒吧后面找到了他习惯的位置，为自己的安全返回举杯，然后开始为顾客服务，就像他从未离开一样。",
	"Adventurers from across Faerûn, and even from elsewhere in the great span of the multiverse, visit the Yawning Portal to exchange knowledge about Undermountain and other dungeons. Most visitors are content to swap stories by the hearth, but sometimes a group driven by greed, ambition, or desperation pays the toll for entry and descends the well. Most don't survive to make the return trip, but enough come back with riches and tales of adventure to tempt other groups into trying their luck.": "来自法鲁恩各地的冒险者，甚至是来自多元宇宙其他地方的冒险者，都会来拜访打哈欠的入口，交流关于地下山和其他地牢的知识。大多数来访者都满足于在壁炉旁交换故事，但有时一群人在贪婪、野心或绝望的驱使下，会支付进入的费用并下井。大多数人都没能活到回程，但有足够的人带着财富和冒险故事回来，引诱其他团体尝试他们的运气。",
	"The Yawning Portal is not the only renowned tavern in D&D lore. In the Free City of Greyhawk stands the Green Dragon Inn, which has been the starting point for some of the most successful expeditions to Castle Greyhawk and beyond. The place is crowded and smoke-filled. Patrons talk in low voices, and anyone attempting to strike up a conversation without making a clear intent to pay can expect a cold reception. Paranoia and suspicion run rampant here, as befits a free city that stands at the nexus between a devil-haunted empire, a vast domain locked in the irontight grip of a demigod of evil, and a splintered, bickering host of kingdoms nominally committed to justice and weal. In the battered, weary world of Greyhawk, profit and power take precedence over heroics.": "Yawning Portal并不是D&D传说中唯一著名的酒馆。在灰鹰的自由城，矗立着绿龙客栈，它是一些最成功的远征灰鹰堡和其他地方的起点。这个地方很拥挤，烟雾缭绕。顾客们用低沉的声音交谈，任何试图在没有明确的付款意向的情况下进行交谈的人都会受到冷遇。妄想症和怀疑在这里肆虐，这与一个自由的城市相称，它站在一个被魔鬼困扰的帝国、一个被邪恶的半神牢牢控制的广阔领域，以及一个分裂的、争吵的、名义上致力于正义和福利的王国之间的交界处。在灰鹰这个疲惫不堪的世界里，利益和权力高于英雄主义。",
	"The Yawning Portal's taproom fills the first floor of the building. The 40-foot-diameter well that provides access to Undermountain dominates the space. The \"well\" is all that remains of Halaster's tower, and now, devoid of the stairways and floors that formed subterranean levels, it drops as an open shaft for 140 feet. Stirges, spiders, and worse have been known to invade the Yawning Portal from below.": "Yawning Portal的自来水室占满了建筑的第一层。直径40英尺的井提供了通往地下山的通道，占据了整个空间。这口 \"井 \"是哈拉斯特塔的全部遗迹，现在，没有了形成地下楼层的楼梯和地板，它就像一个开放的竖井一样下降了140英尺。据了解，搅屎棍、蜘蛛和更坏的东西都会从下面入侵打哈欠的门户。",
	"Balconies on the tavern's second and third floors overlook the well, with those floors accessed by way of wooden stairs that rise up from the taproom. Guests sitting at the tables on the balconies have an excellent view of the well and the action below.": "酒馆二楼和三楼的阳台可以俯瞰水井，通过从酒水间升起的木质楼梯进入这两层。坐在阳台上的桌子旁的客人可以看到水井和下面的活动，视野极佳。",
	"Those who wish to enter Undermountain for adventure (or the daring tourists who just want to \"ride the rope\") must pay a gold piece to be lowered down. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. Once the initial payment is made, a few stairs takes one to the top of the waisthigh lip of the well. The rope that hangs in the center of the well is levered over to the lip by a beam in the rafters, and when those who have paid are ready, they mount the rope and take the long ride down.": "那些想进入山下探险的人（或只是想 \"骑绳 \"的大胆游客）必须支付一块金子才能被放下去。回程也要付一块金子，事先用桶装好送上去。一旦支付了最初的费用，走几步楼梯就可以到达井口的腰部。悬挂在井中央的绳索被椽子上的横梁撬到了井口，当那些已经付款的人准备好了，他们就登上绳索，长途跋涉下去。",
	"A staggering variety of curios and oddities adorn the taproom. Traditionally, adventurers who recover a strange relic from Undermountain present it to Durnan as a trophy of their success. Other adventurers leave such curios to mark their visits to the tavern, or relinquish them after losing a bet with Durnan, who likes to wager on the fate of adventuring bands that enter the dungeon. Occasionally, something that strikes Durnan's fancy can be used to pay a bar tab.": "各种各样的奇珍异宝装饰着这个酒馆。传统上，冒险者如果从地下山找回了一件奇怪的遗物，就会把它送给杜南，作为他们成功的战利品。其他冒险者会留下这样的古玩来纪念他们对酒馆的访问，或者在与杜南打赌失败后放弃它们，杜南喜欢对进入地牢的冒险队伍的命运下注。偶尔，杜南看中的东西可以用来支付酒吧的帐单。",

	"On quiet nights, guests in the Yawning Portal gather around a large fireplace in the taproom and swap tales of distant places, strange monsters, and valuable treasures. On busier nights, the place is loud and crowded. The balconies overflow with merchants and nobles, while the tables on the ground floor are filled with adventurers and their associates. Invariably, the combination of a few drinks and the crowd's encouragement induces some folk to pay for a brief trip down into Undermountain. Most folk pay in advance for a ride down and immediately back up, though a few ambitious souls might launch impromptu expeditions into the dungeon. Few such ill-prepared parties ever return.": "在安静的夜晚，\"打哈欠门户 \"的客人们聚集在自来水间的大壁炉旁，交换关于遥远地方、奇怪的怪物和宝贵的宝藏的故事。在比较繁忙的夜晚，这里就会变得喧闹而拥挤。阳台上挤满了商人和贵族，而一楼的桌子上则坐满了冒险家和他们的伙伴。几杯酒加上众人的鼓励，总能诱使一些人花钱到山下做一次短暂的旅行。大多数人都是先付钱，然后马上回来，不过也有几个雄心勃勃的人可能会临时进入地牢探险。这种准备不足的队伍很少有机会回来。",
	"Groups seeking to enter Undermountain for a specific reason generally come to the tavern during its quiet hours. Even at such times, there are still a few prying eyes in the taproom, lurkers who carry news of the comings and goings from Undermountain to the Zhentarim, dark cults, criminal gangs, and other interested parties.": "因特殊原因想进入暗山的团体一般都是在酒馆安静的时候来的。即使在这种时候，酒馆里仍有一些窥探的目光，这些潜伏者将地下山的来往消息传递给镇塔林、黑暗教派、犯罪团伙和其他感兴趣的人。",
	"Kicking off a dungeon adventure can be as simple as having a mysterious stranger offer the characters a quest while they are at the Yawning Portal (or some other tavern).
