	"Deep beneath the surface of the world lies the Underdark, a realm of endless labyrinthine tunnels and caverns where the sun never shines. The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves—the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them. Rendered {@condition unconscious} with drow poison, then collared and shackled, these prisoners are eventually sold as slaves or entertainment in the dark elves' subterranean cities.": "在世界表面之下的深处是暗黑世界，一个由无尽的迷宫般的隧道和洞穴组成的领域，太阳从不照耀。黑暗世界充满了众多的种族和生物，数也数不清，其中最重要的是黑暗精灵--乌鸦。乌鸦甚至被他们在黑暗中的同伴所憎恨和恐惧，他们袭击了暗黑世界的其他定居点以及表面世界，并将囚犯带回去。这些囚犯被施以鸦人的毒药，然后被戴上项圈和镣铐，最终被卖到黑暗精灵的地下城市作为奴隶或娱乐。",
	"The adventurers have all had the misfortune of falling to such a fate. Captured by the drow, they are prisoners at one of the dark elves' outposts, awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Whether they came into the Underdark seeking knowledge or fortune, or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were ripe prey for a drow raid.": "冒险家们都曾不幸落入这样的命运。他们被乌鸦俘虏，在黑暗精灵的某个前哨站成为囚犯，等待被送往蜘蛛之城门索布兰赞。无论他们是来暗黑世界寻求知识或财富，还是在错误的时间出现在错误的地点，他们都是乌鸦突袭的成熟猎物。",
	"The setup of {@i Out of the Abyss} is such that the characters need have no connections with events in the Underdark, or with each other, prior to the start of the adventure. They can meet and get to know each other as prisoners of the drow. Players who would like their characters to have a stronger Underdark connection can choose from the background options in {@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}.": "{@i Out of the Abyss}的设置是这样的：在冒险开始之前，人物不需要与暗黑世界的事件或彼此之间有任何联系。他们可以作为乌鸦的俘虏来认识和了解对方。如果玩家希望他们的角色与暗黑世界有更强的联系，可以从{@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}的背景选项中选择。",
	"\"Prisoners of the Drow\" assumes the characters start at 1st level, and that they will achieve 2nd level (if not 3rd) by the end of this chapter of the adventure. Given the challenges of the adventure and the dangers of the Underdark, you can start the characters at a higher level (2nd or 3rd) to make things a bit easier for the players.": "\"乌鸦的囚徒 \"假设角色从1级开始，在冒险的这一章结束时他们将达到2级（如果不是3级）。考虑到冒险的挑战和地下城的危险，你可以让角色从更高的等级开始（2级或3级），让玩家更容易一些。",
	"The characters' goal in this chapter of the adventure is straightforward: escape from the drow outpost of Velkynvelve, with an eye toward escaping from the Underdark. However, this goal is complicated by the adventurers' lack of familiarity with their surroundings. Even if the prisoners can get away from the drow, where will they go and how will they survive?": "在这一章的冒险中，人物的目标很直接：从维尔基维尔的乌鸦前哨逃出，并着眼于逃离暗黑世界。然而，由于冒险者们对周围环境的不熟悉，这个目标变得很复杂。即使囚犯们能够摆脱乌鸦，他们将去哪里，如何生存？",
	"All the drow's prisoners, including the characters, wear iron slave collars along with manacles connected to iron belts by a short length of chain. This leaves the prisoners {@condition restrained}, but doesn't affect their movement or speed.": "所有乌鸦的囚犯，包括人物在内，都戴着铁制的奴隶项圈，以及用短链连接到铁质腰带的手铐。这让囚犯们（%0%），但并不影响他们的行动和速度。",
	"In addition to being manacled, spellcasters don't have any spell components or focuses, initially limiting their spellcasting ability. (Wizard characters don't need their spellbooks to cast spells, but will be unable to change their prepared spells without them. As such, give wizard characters some leeway in determining which spells they had previously prepared before being captured.) Moreover, spellcasting isn't possible inside the slave pen because of its magical wards (see area 11).": "除了被戴上手铐外，施法者没有任何法术组件或焦点，最初限制了他们的施法能力。(巫师角色不需要他们的法术书来施法，但没有法术书将无法改变他们准备的法术）。因此，在确定他们在被俘之前准备了哪些法术时，要给巫师角色一些余地）。此外，由于奴隶营内有魔法屏障，所以施法是不可能的（见区域11）。",
	"Slipping out of manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, while breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. A character can unlock the manacles using thieves' tools with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The manacles have 15 hit points. The iron collars can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The collars have 12 hit points. A character who fails a check to break a collar, break a set of manacles, or escape from a set of manacles can't attempt checks of that kind again until he or she finishes a long rest. A character can still use the {@action Help} action to aid another character, however.": "溜出手铐需要成功地进行DC20灵巧检查，而打破手铐则需要成功地进行DC20力量检查。一个角色可以用盗贼的工具解开手铐，但需要成功地进行DC 15的灵巧检查。手铐有15个打击点。铁领子可以通过成功的DC20力量检查来打破。项圈有12点生命值。一个角色如果在挣脱项圈、挣脱一套手铐或从一套手铐中逃脱的检查中失败，在他或她完成长时间的休息之前，不能再尝试此类检查。然而，一个角色仍然可以使用{@action Help}动作来帮助另一个角色。",
	"The characters begin the adventure in the slave pens of Velkynvelve. Stripped of everything but their underclothing, they are at the mercy of the dark elves and in the company of other prisoners, many of who aren't what they seem.": "角色们在Velkynvelve的奴隶牢房里开始冒险。他们被剥夺了所有的东西，只剩下内衣，任由黑暗精灵摆布，与其他囚犯为伍，其中许多人并不像他们看起来那样。",
	"Captured by the drow! You wouldn't wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are—locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you've met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. \"Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.\" Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.": "被乌鸦抓走了！你不希望任何人遭受这种命运。你不希望任何人遭受这种命运，但你现在却被锁在一个黑暗的山洞里，冰冷、沉重的金属紧紧箍住你的喉咙和手腕。你并不孤单。其他囚犯和你一起被困在这里，在一个远离阳光的地下哨所。俘虏你的人包括一个残酷的鸦人女祭司，她自称是米兹林家族的伊尔瓦拉女主人。在过去的几天里，你见过她好几次，她身穿丝质服装，身旁有两个男性乌鸦，其中一个的脸部和脖子一侧有大量的伤疤。女主人伊尔瓦拉喜欢用手中的鞭子打动她的意志，并提醒你，你的生命现在属于她了。\"接受你的命运，学会服从，你就可能活下来。\" 她的话在你的记忆中回响，甚至在你策划逃跑的时候。",
	"Assume that each player character has been a prisoner in Velkynvelve for {@dice 1d10} days. (Roll separately for each character.)

	"Feel free to play out any interaction between the drow, the player characters, and the other prisoners. This is an opportunity to reveal who the characters are and to flesh out their backgrounds and personalities through roleplaying, even as you introduce some of their fellow prisoners. Ilvara's newest consort, Shoor, wants to impress his mistress, while Jorlan, her former consort, sullenly does his duty but casts a curious eye over the prisoners. Any hostile move is met with poisoned crossbow bolts from the drow, and possibly a strike from Ilvara's scourge or a {@spell ray of sickness} spell. The giant spiders attack and poison anyone who attacks the drow. The drow don't kill any of the prisoners (leaving them {@condition unconscious} at 0 hit points) but have no compunction about beating them.": "请自由发挥乌鸦、玩家角色和其他囚犯之间的任何互动。这是一个揭示人物身份的机会，通过角色扮演来充实他们的背景和个性，甚至在你介绍他们的一些同伴的时候。伊尔瓦拉的新妃子肖尔想给他的女主人留下深刻印象，而她的前妃子乔兰则闷闷不乐地履行职责，但对囚犯们投以好奇的目光。任何有敌意的举动都会遭到乌鸦的毒弩箭的攻击，也可能是伊尔瓦拉的祸害或（%0%）法术的打击。巨型蜘蛛会攻击并毒死任何攻击乌鸦的人。乌鸦人没有杀死任何囚犯（让他们（%1%）的命中率为0），但对殴打他们却毫无怨言。",

	"The prisoners are provided with clay chamber pots, and one of the duties of slaves is to empty them into the pool during their shift. There are no other comforts in the slave pen. Prisoners must sit or lie on the stone floor, and are fed only once each day—a thin mushroom broth served in small clay bowls passed through gaps in the bars of the gate.": "囚犯们被提供了粘土箱，奴隶们的职责之一是在轮班时将其倒入水池。奴隶牢房里没有其他舒适的地方。囚犯必须坐在或躺在石板上，每天只吃一次饭--用小土碗盛着稀薄的蘑菇汤，从大门的栅栏缝隙中穿过。",

This pleasant facade conceals the soul of an insane killer. {@creature Buppido|OotA} secretly believes he is the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan—an avatar of murder offering bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory. He rationalizes any setbacks (including his capture and imprisonment) as part of his \"divine plan.\" His killings are carefully ritualized, following an exacting process of cutting open the victims and arranging their organs.": "一个男性{@creature derro|MTF}，{@creature Buppido|OotA}出人意料地好客和健谈，表现出敏锐的头脑和迷人的态度。这种令人愉快的外表下隐藏着一个疯狂的杀手的灵魂。{@creature Buppido|OotA}秘密地相信他是德鲁神Diinkarazan的活生生的化身--谋杀的化身，提供血腥的牺牲，为他的人民创造一条穿越暗黑世界的屠杀之路，以获得荣耀。他把任何挫折（包括他的被捕和监禁）都合理化为他 \"神圣计划 \"的一部分。他的杀戮是仔细的仪式化的，遵循严格的过程，切开受害者并排列他们的器官。",
	"Although mad, {@creature Buppido|OotA} is cunning and capable of hiding his true nature to serve his own ends. Because he believes he is a god, he is convinced that he can't be killed (or at least that the death of his mortal form means nothing to him), so he is completely fearless. He assumes everything is part of his divine plan, and enthusiastically participates in any plot to escape from the drow so he can continue his holy work. {@creature Buppido|OotA} is happy to consider his fellow prisoners allies until such time as he no longer needs them, or becomes convinced that the omens point toward the need for one or more of them to be sacrificed to his greater glory.": "虽然疯了，但（%0%）很狡猾，能够隐藏自己的真实本性，为自己的目的服务。因为他相信自己是个神，所以他坚信自己不会被杀死（或者至少他的凡人形态的死亡对他来说毫无意义），所以他完全无畏。他认为一切都是他神圣计划的一部分，并热情地参与任何逃离乌鸦的阴谋，以便他能继续他的神圣工作。(在他不再需要他的同伴之前，他很乐意将他们视为盟友，或者确信预兆表明他们中的一个或多个需要为他更大的荣耀而牺牲掉。",

If any of the characters speak to him, however, the quaggoth replies in urbane Elvish. He explains that he is not, in fact, a quaggoth, but a gold elf prince polymorphed into quaggoth form by a curse. He claims to be {@creature Prince Derendil|OotA} of the kingdom of Nelrindenvane in the High Forest. His crown was usurped by the evil wizard Terrestor, who trapped him in this form and exiled him from his people.": "这个大块头（%0%）是奴隶营里看起来最凶猛的囚犯，其他囚犯对他敬而远之。然而，如果有任何人物和他说话，这个夸父就会用彬彬有礼的Elvish语回答。他解释说，事实上他不是夸父，而是一个被诅咒变成夸父形态的金精灵王子。他声称自己是高等森林中的奈尔林登凡王国的（1%）。他的王位被邪恶的巫师泰瑞斯托篡夺，泰瑞斯托将他困在这个形态中，并将他从他的人民中放逐。",
	"Although Derendil behaves like the highborn prince he believes himself to be, he responds to stress—and particularly threats—like a quaggoth: violently tearing foes limb from limb and rending their flesh with sharp claws and teeth. He comes back to himself only after battle, or when someone reinforces his \"true identity\" to snap him out of it. Derendil laments that he is slowly but surely losing himself to the savagery of his quaggoth form.": "虽然德兰迪尔的行为就像他认为自己是高高在上的王子，但他对压力的反应--尤其是对威胁的反应--就像夸父一样：猛烈地将敌人的肢体撕裂，用锋利的爪子和牙齿撕碎他们的肉。只有在战斗结束后，或者当有人强化他的 \"真实身份 \"使他摆脱这种状态时，他才会恢复自我。德兰迪尔哀叹说，他正在慢慢地但肯定地失去自己，被他的夸父形态的野蛮所取代。",
	"In fact, Derendil is simply mad, touched by the delusions of the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu. The kingdom of Nelrindenvane doesn't exist, and all of \"Derendil's\" recollections and personality are an illusion created by the Demon Prince of Deception. The quaggoth refuses to believe the truth, and any incontrovertible evidence as to his real nature sends him into a murderous rage.": "事实上，Derendil只是疯了，被恶魔领主Fraz-Urb'luu的错觉所触动。内尔林登凡王国并不存在，所有 \"德兰迪尔 \"的回忆和个性都是由欺骗的恶魔王子创造的幻觉。夸父拒绝相信真相，任何关于他真实本性的无可争议的证据都会让他陷入杀戮的愤怒之中。",
	"A female shield dwarf {@creature scout} from Gauntlgrym, Eldeth is high spirited and proud of both her heritage and her people's achievement in reclaiming the ancient dwarven kingdom; she suggests Gauntlgrym as a destination to escape from the Underdark. Eldeth is stubborn and hates the drow and all other \"corrupt dark dwellers\" such as the derro and duergar.": "埃尔德斯是一个来自高特格林姆的女性盾牌矮人（%0%），她热情高涨，为她的遗产和她的人民在夺回古老的矮人王国方面取得的成就感到骄傲；她建议将高特格林姆作为逃离暗黑世界的目的地。埃尔德斯很固执，憎恨鸦人和所有其他 \"腐败的黑暗居民\"，如德鲁人和杜尔加人。",
	"Eldeth wants to get back home, but she is also defiant and self sacrificing—and therefore among the most likely prisoners to perish before getting the opportunity. If that happens, Eldeth asks a character she trusts to promise to carry word of her fate back to her family in Gauntlgrym, along with her shield and warhammer if they are recovered. This might win the characters the approval of Eldeth's kin when they later visit Gauntlgrym.": "埃尔德斯想回家，但她也是个挑衅和自我牺牲的人--因此是最有可能在得到机会之前丧生的囚犯之一。如果发生这种情况，埃尔德斯要求一个她信任的角色承诺将她的命运带回去给她在Gauntlgrym的家人，如果她的盾牌和战锤被找回来的话。这可能会使角色在以后访问Gauntlgrym时赢得Eldeth的亲属的认可。",
	"A male deep gnome {@creature spy}, {@creature Jimjar|OotA} is a feckless rogue with a devil-may-care attitude, a fondness for coin, and an obsession with betting on virtually anything and everything.

He sometimes uses betting to goad others into doing things, but characters can easily turn the tables knowing that {@creature Jimjar|OotA} finds it difficult to refuse a wager. His behavior is unusual for the dour deep gnomes, and others of his kind (including {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA}) find {@creature Jimjar|OotA} annoying at best, and unstable and potentially mad at worst.": "一个男性深地精（%0%），（%1%）是一个无精打采的流氓，有一种不顾一切的态度，喜欢钱币，并且痴迷于在几乎所有事情上打赌。一旦他认识了这些人物，{@creature Jimjar|OotA}就经常为他们提供赌注，从他们自己的努力（\"我赌10个金币，你不能在不被发现的情况下通过那个哨兵\"）到随机事件的结果（\"我赌20个金币，这个隧道是正确的\"）。他有时会用打赌来诱导别人做事，但人物很容易翻脸，因为知道（3%）发现很难拒绝赌注。他的行为对于沉闷的深山地精来说是不寻常的，他的其他同类（包括{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}）发现{@creature Jimjar|OotA}充其量是很烦人，最糟糕的是不稳定，可能会发疯。",
	"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} is always true to his word, and he manages to keep exact track of his debits and credits in his head, paying up on his bets (or demanding payment) as soon as possible. He's not above pocketing a little extra coin when no one is watching, and he has an amazing ability to secret significant wealth on his person.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}总是言出必行，他设法在脑子里准确地记录下他的借贷情况，尽快付清他的赌注（或要求付款）。他不惜在没人注意的情况下多掏一点钱，而且他有一种惊人的能力，可以将大量的财富藏在自己身上。",

He does his best to get along with everyone, although some find his gregariousness and constant wagers grating.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}觉得这对双胞胎{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}好像有些奇怪，但除非被问到，否则他不会发表自己的意见。他尽力与每个人相处，尽管有些人觉得他的好客和不断的赌注令人厌烦。",
	"A male {@creature orc} from the Iceshield tribe, {@creature Ront|OotA} fled from the slaughter of a band of orcs at the hands of the dwarves, falling down a shaft and wandering in the Underdark before being captured by the drow. He's ashamed of his cowardly act and knows that Gruumsh, the god of the orcs, is punishing him. But he also doesn't want to die, or at least not in drow captivity. {@creature Ront|OotA} is mean, stupid, and hateful, but he also knuckles under to authority and threats.

He is aware of his people's well-deserved reputation for madness, and claims to have spent a lifetime in contemplation and solitary meditation to overcome that legacy.

Infected with the curse of lycanthropy, neither deep gnome has entirely embraced it yet, and they struggle to control their wererat instincts and urges. They are fearful of what potential allies might do if they learn the truth, and are looking out for each other and their own survival. With their transformations controlled by the unseen cycle of the moon, you can use the twins' impending change as a wild card in the adventure. They've been prisoners for less than a month, meaning the full moon is coming.": "{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}隐藏了他们是{@creature Wererat||wererats}的事实。感染了狼人的诅咒，两个深山地精都还没有完全接受它，他们努力控制自己的狼人本能和冲动。他们害怕潜在的盟友在得知真相后会做出什么事来，他们正在为彼此和自己的生存着想。由于他们的转变受到看不见的月亮周期的控制，你可以把这对双胞胎即将发生的变化作为冒险中的一张底牌。他们被囚禁了不到一个月，意味着满月即将到来。",
	"The other prisoners who manage to escape with the player characters are likely to become their companions for a substantial part of the adventure, so it is good to lay the groundwork for those relationships early on. Some of the NPCs might not survive the initial escape attempt. Others might be lost to the dangers of the Underdark—or might reveal their true colors and betray the party. A few could become true companions. Keep in mind the other prisoners have their own personalities and goals, but are generally willing to cooperate for their own benefit. Their knowledge of the Underdark should encourage the player characters to keep them around at least initially.": "与玩家角色一起逃脱的其他囚犯可能会在冒险的大部分时间里成为他们的同伴，所以在早期为这些关系打下基础是很好的。有些NPC可能无法在最初的逃跑尝试中存活下来。其他人可能会在暗黑世界的危险中迷失方向，或者可能暴露出他们的真面目并背叛队伍。有几个可能成为真正的伙伴。请记住，其他囚犯有他们自己的个性和目标，但一般都愿意为自己的利益而合作。他们对暗黑世界的了解应该鼓励玩家角色至少在开始时把他们留在身边。",
	"Since managing such a large cast of NPCs can be quite involved, enlist the aid of the players if you wish, having each of them take on the role of managing one or more of the party's companions. The player generally decides what that NPC is doing, with the knowledge that you, as Dungeon Master, can overrule them as needed by the story. Not only does this make the secondary characters easier to manage, it helps the players get to know them and strengthens the bonds between the NPCs and the adventurers.": "由于管理这么多的NPC可能会很麻烦，如果你愿意的话，可以争取玩家的帮助，让他们每个人都扮演管理一个或多个聚会同伴的角色。一般来说，玩家决定该NPC在做什么，而作为地牢主管的你可以根据故事的需要否决他们。这不仅使次要角色更容易管理，而且有助于玩家了解他们，加强NPC和冒险者之间的联系。",
	"Allow the characters to freely mingle and interact with their fellow prisoners or even the drow guards, although the guards rarely talk to the \"surface-dweller scum.\" Of all the prisoners, only Eldeth and {@creature Jimjar|OotA} speak fluent Common.

	"You might wish to consult the social interaction rules in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, in which case the other prisoners are initially indifferent toward the characters. Handle the interactions using roleplaying, Charisma checks, or a balance of the two as best suits your group and the way the adventure unfolds.": "你可能希望参考{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中的社会互动规则，在这种情况下，其他囚犯最初对这些角色是无动于衷的。使用角色扮演、魅力检查或两者的平衡来处理互动，这最适合你的小组和冒险的展开方式。",

	"The drow divide their prisoners into three roughly equal-sized groups and put them to work for a third of the day, supervised by the quaggoths. Their menial tasks include filling and hauling water barrels, operating the lift, cleaning any or all parts of the outpost (whether they need it or not), emptying chamber pots, food preparation and service, washing dishes, and laundry. The prisoners are also given cruel or pointless tasks to occupy them, and for the dark elves' amusement. Such labors include moving or stacking rocks, coiling ropes, and organizing supplies, with prisoners forced to redo work that doesn't meet the drow's arbitrary standards.": "乌鸦把他们的囚犯分成三个大小大致相同的小组，让他们在夸父的监督下工作一天的三分之一。他们的琐碎任务包括填充和拖动水桶、操作电梯、清洁前哨的任何或所有部分（无论他们是否需要）、清空室内的盆子、准备食物和服务、洗碗和洗衣。囚犯们也会被赋予残酷或无意义的任务，以占据他们的时间，并供黑暗精灵们娱乐。这类劳动包括移动或堆放岩石、盘绕绳索、整理物资，囚犯们被迫重做不符合乌鸦任意标准的工作。",
	"Characters might or might not work together, depending on how the drow split them up. Prisoners known to be friendly to each other are usually kept apart, and no more than two or three prisoners are allowed to work at a single task at once.": "角色可能在一起工作，也可能不在一起工作，这取决于鸦人如何将他们分开。已知彼此友好的囚犯通常会被分开，而且不允许超过两到三个囚犯同时从事一项工作。",
	"The drow and quaggoths are cruel and capricious, but also somewhat bored and looking for amusement. The quaggoths are poor conversationalists, hateful and mistrustful toward the prisoners. The drow are more inclined to talk, if only to boast of their superiority. Characters might trick them into dropping useful bits of information, such as how long the journey to Menzoberranzan is expected to take, or that the outpost is relatively close to the Darklake.": "乌鸦和食人魔残忍而任性，但也有些无聊，想找点乐子。奎格斯人不善言谈，对囚犯充满仇恨和不信任。鸦人更倾向于交谈，如果只是为了夸耀他们的优越性的话。角色可能会骗他们说出一些有用的信息，比如去门索布兰赞的旅程预计需要多长时间，或者前哨站离黑暗湖比较近。",
	"The characters' sleep in the slave pen is troubled and fitful, filled with strange dreams and disturbing images. Dark shadows seem to move and reach out toward them as the characters wander lost through endless mazes of tunnels. Oily tentacles slide to brush up against them, while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. Suppurating wounds burst open in clouds of spores or crawling masses of maggots or insects. At least one or more of the characters should wake in a cold sweat from these nightmares after every rest, feeling as though something is out there in the dark depths—something far worse than the drow.": "奴隶营中的人物的睡眠是混乱和不稳定的，充满了奇怪的梦和令人不安的图像。当人物在无尽的隧道迷宫中迷失方向时，黑暗的阴影似乎在移动，并向他们伸出手来。油腻的触手滑向他们，而远处传来巨大的嗡嗡声和嚎叫。化脓的伤口在孢子云或爬行的蛆虫或昆虫群中爆裂开来。每次休息后，至少有一个或多个角色应该从这些噩梦中惊醒，感觉好像有什么东西在黑暗的深处--远比乌鸦更可怕。",
	"You need not explain the cause of these dreams and images at this time. Characters can chalk them up to the conditions in the slave pen, or to the aftereffects of drow poison, but they are omens of what is happening in the Underdark. Spellcasters, particularly clerics and warlocks, might be most prone to these dreams, but they can visit any or all of the characters.": "你现在不需要解释这些梦和图像的原因。角色们可以把它们归结为奴隶监狱的条件，或归结为鸦人毒药的后遗症，但它们是暗黑世界正在发生的事情的预兆。施法者，尤其是牧师和术士，可能最容易做这些梦，但它们可以拜访任何或所有角色。",
	"Most of the other prisoners aren't looking for trouble, and even killers such as {@creature Buppido|OotA} are careful to bide their time. Still, both Derendil and {@creature Ront|OotA} have quick tempers, and Sarith the drow is prone to bouts of violence as Zuggtmoy's spores take over his mind. It's possible the characters could provoke a fight. If they do, some of the prisoners (including the deep gnomes) egg on the fighters while others keep their distance or even try to break up the brawl.": "大多数其他的囚犯并不是在找麻烦，即使是像{@creature Buppido|OotA}这样的杀手也会小心翼翼地等待时机。不过，德兰迪尔和(1%)都有急躁的脾气，而乌鸦人萨利斯在祖格莫伊的孢子占据他的头脑时，很容易发生暴力行为。这些人物有可能挑起一场战斗。如果他们这样做了，一些囚犯（包括深层地精）就会对战士们大打出手，而其他人则会保持距离，甚至试图打破争吵的局面。",
	"Any violent conflict draws the attention of the drow guards, who initially order any prisoners to stand down from a fight, threatening them with hand crossbows from outside the gate. If necessary, they shoot prisoners with poisoned crossbow bolts to incapacitate them. (See {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for information on drow poison.) The guards let any fight play out for their own amusement as long as the prisoners don't seem likely to actually kill one another.": "任何暴力冲突都会引起鸦人守卫的注意，他们最初会命令任何囚犯从战斗中退下，在门外用手弩威胁他们。如果有必要，他们会用带毒的弩箭射杀囚犯，使他们丧失能力。(关于乌鸦毒药的信息，请看{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons}的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}。只要囚犯看起来不可能真的互相残杀，守卫们就会让任何争斗上演，供他们自己取乐。",
	"If a prisoner becomes too much trouble, or if the drow need to mete out a lesson on the price of disobedience, they make a gruesome spectacle of feeding a malcontent to the giant spiders in the webs beneath Velkynvelve. Drow guards or quaggoth servants throw the bound prisoner over the edge into the webs, where the spiders quickly converge to bite the victim, injecting their venom. Once the victim is {@condition paralyzed}, the spiders wrap their meal up in webbing.": "如果一个囚犯变得太麻烦了，或者如果鸦人需要教训一下不服从的代价，他们就会制造一个可怕的场面，把不满的人喂给Velkynvelve下面的网里的巨大蜘蛛。鸦人守卫或夸哥特仆人将被捆绑的囚犯从边缘扔进网里，蜘蛛们迅速聚集在一起，咬住受害者，注入毒液。一旦受害者被咬死（%0%），蜘蛛就会用网状物把它们的食物包裹起来。",
	"This event is a convenient opportunity to get rid of one or more of the other prisoners before the escape attempt if you don't want them around. As well, you can drive home the cruelty and threat of the drow by eliminating an NPC with whom the characters have formed a bond.": "如果你不希望其他囚犯在你身边，这个事件是一个方便的机会，可以在逃跑前除掉他们中的一个或多个。此外，你还可以通过消灭一个与角色建立了联系的NPC，让他们明白鸦人的残酷和威胁。",

	"A member of a drow house with a long history as slavers, Ilvara is a cruel mistress who enjoys taunting and tormenting enemies and underlings alike. In addition to a scourge, she wields a {@item tentacle rod}. Although she has taken Shoor Vandree as her lover, Ilvara cares no more about him than she did about Jorlan Duskryn, the lover she discarded due to his crippling injuries.": "伊尔瓦拉是一个有着悠久历史的奴隶主家族的成员，她是一个残忍的女主人，喜欢嘲弄和折磨敌人和下属。除了祸害之外，她还挥舞着一把（%0%）。虽然她把肖尔-范德里当作她的情人，但伊尔瓦拉对他的关心不亚于她对乔兰-杜斯克林的关心，后者是她因伤残而抛弃的情人。",

	"Asha is ambitious enough to know she could assume command of the outpost if anything was to happen to Ilvara, but not courageous enough to challenge her superior openly. She also knows that she would have to impress her superiors in the City of Spiders for any such field promotion to become permanent.

	"This drow elite warrior has assumed the role of Ilvara's lieutenant and lover after the injuries suffered by his predecessor, Jorlan Duskryn. Shoor is relatively young and quite arrogant for a drow male, proud of his abilities and accomplishments.

Still insecure in his position, Shoor feels the need to demonstrate his skill and effectiveness to his mistress and to find ways to please her.": "在他的前任乔兰-杜斯克林受伤后，这位鸦人精英战士承担了伊尔瓦拉的副手和情人的角色。肖尔比较年轻，作为一个鸦人男性，他相当傲慢，对自己的能力和成就感到骄傲。他还在为自己成功赢得伊尔瓦拉的青睐和提升自己在前哨站的地位而感到兴奋，这表现在他的豪迈和他对维尔基维尔其他男性的支配方式上，尤其是乔兰。肖尔对自己的地位仍然没有安全感，他觉得有必要向他的女主人展示他的技能和效率，并想办法取悦她。",

Even the lowest drow understands the inferiority of other creatures, behaving toward the prisoners like sneering nobility. With their superiors, however, the drow are fawning sycophants with a passive-aggressive edge. The males defer to the females, the rank-and-file warriors defer to the elite warriors, and everyone defers to the priestess Ilvara.": "乌鸦人傲慢、残忍、恶毒，把他们的奴隶看成不过是牲畜，对他们冷眼旁观。即使是最低级的乌鸦也明白其他生物的劣势，对囚犯的行为就像讥讽的贵族。然而，对于他们的上级，乌鸦是带着消极攻击性的媚俗的佞人。男性服从于女性，普通战士服从于精英战士，而每个人都服从于女祭司伊尔瓦拉。",

	"A {@creature gray ooze} lurks in the pool's shallows, blending perfectly with the dark, wet stone. It feeds on the waste dumped into the pool, along with the occasional creature that finds its way into the cavern or falls into the pool.": "一只{@creature gray ooze}潜伏在水池的浅滩上，与黑暗、潮湿的石头完美融合。它以倾倒在池子里的废物为食，还有偶尔发现进入洞穴或落入池中的生物。",
	"The inhabitants of Velkynvelve remain unaware that the recent arrival of the demon lord Juiblex in the Underdark has made this ooze particularly aggressive and malevolent. In addition to attacking any creature in the pool, the ooze surges up to 10 feet out of the pool to attack creatures at its edge. When it does so, creatures within 30 feet of the ooze telepathically sense a voice cry out, \"Flesh for the Faceless Lord!\"": "Velkynvelve的居民仍然不知道，最近恶魔领主Juiblex来到地下世界，使得这种渗水变得特别有侵略性和恶意。除了攻击池子里的任何生物外，这股泥浆还能从池子里涌出10英尺，攻击池子边缘的生物。当它这样做的时候，淤泥周围30英尺内的生物会通过心灵感应感觉到一个声音在呼喊：\"为无面者之主的肉体！\"",
	"Unless they want to spend the rest of their lives as drow slaves, the characters should quickly begin looking for ways they can escape. Though the task will not be easy, the characters can take advantage of certain opportunities if they use their heads.": "除非他们想一辈子做乌鸦的奴隶，否则人物应该迅速开始寻找他们可以逃跑的方法。虽然这个任务并不容易，但如果他们动脑筋的话，可以利用某些机会。",
	"One or more of the characters might have useful items in their possession (see \"Scavenged Possessions\"), and working outside the slave pen creates new opportunities for the characters to acquire and hide small items, including makeshift weapons or tools, or even lift a key to the slave pen from a guard. What they can acquire depends on the work they do and where they go. Use the description of the different locations throughout the outpost as a guide to opportunities. Taking something without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check contested by the Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks of any active observers, or using an observer's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score as the base DC. A prisoner that fails the check is commanded to relinquish the item, on pain of death.": "一个或多个角色可能拥有有用的物品（见 \"拾取的财物\"），在奴隶营外工作为角色创造了新的机会，可以获得和隐藏小物品，包括临时的武器或工具，甚至可以从守卫那里取到奴隶营的钥匙。他们能获得什么，取决于他们所做的工作和他们去的地方。用整个前哨站不同地点的描述作为机会的指南。在不被注意的情况下拿东西需要成功的灵巧（（%0%））检查，由任何主动观察者的智慧（（%1%））检查来争夺，或者用观察者的被动智慧（（%2%））得分作为基础DC。检查失败的囚犯会被命令放弃该物品，否则将被处以死刑。",
	"What equipment and treasures the characters claim during their escape depend on how much of the outpost they are able to explore before fleeing. For some characters, it might be a fun challenge to escape into the Underdark with little more than the clothes on their backs. For others (including spellcasters who need spellbooks or components), consider placing the party's captured equipment (normally in Ilvara's quarters) in an alternate location if the characters are intent on escaping without exploring all of the outpost, such as the elite drow barracks (area 4) or the armory (area 10).": "角色在逃亡过程中能得到什么装备和宝物，取决于他们在逃亡前能探索多少前哨站的地方。对于一些角色来说，除了身上的衣服之外，逃到地下世界可能是一个有趣的挑战。对于其他人（包括需要法术书或组件的施法者）来说，如果角色们打算在没有探索完前哨站的情况下逃跑，可以考虑将队伍中缴获的装备（通常在伊尔瓦拉的住处）放在另一个地方，比如精英鸦人兵营（4区）或军械库（10区）。",
	"When the initial contact between the adventurers and the other prisoners has been played out, Jorlan Duskryn arranges to bring the prisoners their food during his guard duty. (Shoor delights in giving Jorlan such menial work). Standing at the gate to the slave pen and passing in bowls, he mutters to the nearest character: \"If I could give you a means to escape from here, would you take it?\"": "当冒险者和其他囚犯之间的初步接触结束后，乔兰-杜斯克林安排他在看守期间为囚犯们送去食物。(肖尔以给乔兰这样的琐碎工作为乐）。他站在通往奴隶围栏的门口，递上碗，对最近的人物嘀咕道。\"如果我可以给你一个逃离这里的方法，你会接受吗？\"",
	"If the answer is affirmative, Jorlan quickly and quietly proposes to leave the gate to the slave pen unlocked, as well as to create a distraction during the changing of the guards on duty. He tells the characters about the armory, located in the chamber above the guard post in the hanging guard tower in front of the slave pen. The escapees can jump down into the webs below, then over the edge into the pool, making their escape from there.": "如果答案是肯定的，乔兰迅速而悄悄地提议不锁上通往奴隶圈的大门，并在换岗时制造分心。他告诉人物关于军械库的情况，军械库位于奴隶围栏前的悬空警卫塔的岗哨上方的密室中。逃跑的人可以跳到下面的网里，然后从边缘跳到水池里，从那里逃跑。",
	"Jorlan doesn't particularly care if the prisoners actually escape, which is why he doesn't offer any further help or warn them about the {@creature gray ooze} in the pool. It suits him just as well if the prisoners are killed during their attempt to flee. He simply wants to create an embarrassing incident for Shoor and Ilvara.": "乔兰并不特别关心囚犯是否真的逃脱，这就是为什么他没有提供任何进一步的帮助，也没有警告他们池子里的（%0%）。如果囚犯在试图逃跑的过程中被杀，这对他来说也很合适。他只是想给肖尔和伊尔瓦拉制造一个尴尬的事件。",
	"Jorlan furtively glances around as he speaks quickly to the characters. If they question him or ask for changes to the plan, he insists it is all he can do. If they accept, he is true to his word, leaving the gate unlocked close to the next guard shift change and delaying the replacement guards for a few minutes.": "乔兰一边对人物快速说话，一边鬼鬼祟祟地四处扫视。如果他们质疑他或要求改变计划，他坚持认为这是他能做的一切。如果他们接受了，他就言出必行，在接近下一次警卫换班的时候把大门解锁，把替换的警卫推迟几分钟。",
	"During a guard change, the prisoners hear a horrible droning buzz echoing through the cavern, followed by inhuman shrieking. Alarm horns sound out as four {@creature chasme} demons pursue a pair of {@creature vrock} demons into the cavern from the northern passage. The demons swoop and buzz around, initially ignoring other creatures as both groups savagely assault each other. The demons' arrival catches all of the drow off guard.": "在换岗时，囚犯们听到可怕的嗡嗡声在洞穴里回荡，接着是非人的尖叫声。当四个{@creature chasme}恶魔追赶一对{@creature vrock}恶魔从北部通道进入洞穴时，警报喇叭响了起来。恶魔们俯冲着，嗡嗡作响，最初无视其他生物，因为两组恶魔都在野蛮地攻击对方。恶魔们的到来让所有的乌鸦都措手不及。",
	"The drow rush to defend the outpost from a possible attack. The demons initially buzz past the hanging towers, leaving the walkways and caverns out of range of the effects of their droning and screeching. However, drow and quaggoths in the towers are close enough to be affected. The aerial battle eventually circles around the platform and the towers of the elite warriors as the demons savagely tear into each other.": "乌鸦们匆匆忙忙地保卫前哨站，以免受到可能的攻击。恶魔们最初从悬空的塔楼上嗡嗡作响，将走道和洞穴排除在它们的叨叨声和尖叫声的影响范围之外。然而，塔楼里的乌鸦和夸父都很近，足以受到影响。空中战斗最终围绕着平台和精锐战士的塔楼展开，因为恶魔们野蛮地撕咬着对方。",
	"The drow move to engage the demons and defend the outpost, leaving the characters with an opportunity to escape. You can combine this event with Jorlan's offer to leave the gate unlocked, making it easy for the characters to slip away. Alternatively (or if they refuse Jorlan's offer), the characters can use the distraction to engineer their own breakout, then decide how to get down to the cavern floor and where to go after that.": "乌鸦人开始与恶魔交战并保卫前哨，给角色们留下了逃跑的机会。你可以将这一事件与乔兰的提议结合起来，让大门不上锁，让角色们很容易溜走。另外（或者如果他们拒绝了乔兰的提议），角色们可以利用这次分心来设计自己的突围，然后决定如何下到洞穴的地板上，之后去哪里。",
	"Describe the chaos of the demon attack and the drow's response as the escaped prisoners try to flee. The characters can follow Jorlan's suggestion to drop into the webs and then dive into the pool, possibly dealing with a {@creature giant spider} or two and the {@creature gray ooze} along the way. Alternatively, they can look for another way down. Reaching the lift requires getting past the drow clustered on the platform and then attempting to operate it during the attack, which might prove difficult.": "描述恶魔袭击的混乱场面以及逃跑的囚犯试图逃离时乌鸦的反应。角色们可以按照乔兰的建议掉进网里，然后跳进池子里，沿途可能要对付一两个（%0%）和（%1%）。或者，他们也可以寻找另一条路下去。到达升降机需要越过聚集在平台上的乌鸦，然后在攻击期间尝试操作它，这可能会证明是困难的。",
	"If you want to provide an additional challenge for the characters, a {@creature vrock} tumbles almost in front of them as they reach the cavern floor or move toward their chosen exit. The demon is badly wounded, but even with only 11 hit points remaining and having expended its spores and stunning screech abilities, it is still quite dangerous. It screeches at the characters, but if they do nothing to threaten it for 1 round, the demon takes wing and launches itself back into the fight overhead.": "如果你想为角色提供一个额外的挑战，当他们到达洞穴地面或向他们选择的出口移动时，一个（%0%）几乎在他们面前翻滚着。这只恶魔受了重伤，但即使只剩下11点命中率，而且已经用完了它的孢子和令人震惊的尖叫能力，它仍然相当危险。它对着角色尖叫，但如果他们在一回合内没有做任何事情来威胁它，恶魔就会展翅高飞，回到头顶的战斗中。",
	"If the adventurers take on the fallen vrock and defeat or escape from it, award them a quarter of its usual XP value, or 575 XP, given its weakened state.": "如果冒险家们对付堕落的岩浆并击败它或从它手中逃脱，鉴于它的虚弱状态，奖励他们四分之一的通常XP值，或575XP。",
	"If Jorlan is alive when the demons attack, he might use the distraction to free the prisoners (as described in \"Jorlan's Gambit\").

	"The characters have three choices for leaving Velkynvelve: the north, west, and south passages.": "角色们有三种离开Velkynvelve的选择：北部、西部和南部的通道。",
	"This leads toward Menzoberranzan (see {@area chapter 15|4e4|x}) and, eventually, Blingdenstone (see {@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}).

	"Unless they obtain a supply of food and water, the adventurers must forage to survive on their journey. Finding sustenance in the Underdark is difficult but not impossible. Characters can gather food and water if the party travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.

If the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts catch up to them, and the drow leaders arrive not long thereafter (see \"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"). If the pursuit level drops to 0, the party has eluded the drow until circumstances bring both factions into contact again (see \"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\").": "乌鸦追击的密切程度由追击等级来衡量。它从4级开始，乌鸦在人物后面不远处。如果追击等级达到5，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵就会追上他们，而乌鸦首领也会在不久之后到达（见\"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"）。如果追击水平下降到0，那么这支队伍就躲过了乌鸦的追击，直到环境使两派再次接触（见\"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\"）。",
	"Characters can increase or decrease the pursuit level in the following ways:": "角色可以通过以下方式提高或降低追求水平。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 for each day the party travels at a fast pace.": "队伍在快速行进的过程中，每一天减少1个追击等级。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if a character spends time covering up the party's trail that day, requiring a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.": "如果一个角色在当天花时间掩盖队伍的踪迹，则追击等级降低1，需要成功进行DC 16智慧（（%0%））检查。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 each time the characters cross or traverse some feature that obscures their trail, such as a subterranean river.": "每次人物穿过或穿越一些掩盖其踪迹的特征时，如地下河，追击等级就会降低1。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if the party splits into two or more groups. Each group becomes a separate party for purposes of determining random encounters and whether or not the group becomes lost.": "如果队伍分成两组或更多组，追击等级减少1。在确定随机遭遇和是否迷路时，每组都成为一个单独的队伍。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 each time the party has a random encounter with one or more creatures, unless the encounter is bypassed or avoided entirely.": "每次聚会与一个或多个生物发生随机遭遇时，追击等级增加1，除非该遭遇被绕过或完全避开。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 for each day the adventurers travel at a slow pace.": "冒险者以缓慢的速度旅行，每一天增加1个追击等级。",
	"Certain terrain encounters increase or decrease the pursuit level. See the individual descriptions in the \"Random Encounters\" section.": "某些地形的遭遇会增加或减少追击水平。见 \"随机遭遇 \"部分的个别描述。",
	"The players might come up with additional ways of evading pursuit. Adjudicate these as you see fit. For example, if the characters convince a randomly encountered creature to let them pass by telling them about the wealthy drow following them, you might reduce the pursuit level by 1 as the drow are forced to deal with the encounter before they can resume tracking the party. Similarly, the adventurers could lay traps to slow down their pursuers, or they might convince a friendly creature to lie to the drow about which way the party went.": "队员们可能会想出更多的方法来逃避追捕。按照你认为合适的方式进行裁决。例如，如果角色们说服一个随机遇到的生物让他们通过，告诉他们有一个富有的乌鸦在跟踪他们，你可以将追捕等级降低1，因为乌鸦被迫在继续跟踪队伍之前处理好这次遭遇。同样地，冒险者们可以布置陷阱来减缓追捕者的速度，或者他们可以说服一个友好的生物向乌鸦撒谎，告诉他们队伍走了哪条路。",
	"If you choose to skip over a few days of travel (as described under \"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x}\" later in this chapter), the pursuit level doesn't change during that time.": "如果你选择跳过几天的旅行（如本章后面的\"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x} \"中所述），在这段时间里，追求水平不会改变。",
	"When the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts spot the party. At this point, the pursuit might become an encounter if the characters spot the drow and engage them. The characters might try to run, at which point a chase ensues (see \"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}), or they might stand and fight. They might even try to set up some sort of ambush, since the front ranks of the party are likely out of sight of the drow when they first catch up.": "当追击等级达到5级时，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵发现了这支队伍。这时，如果角色们发现了乌鸦并与之交战，追击就可能变成一场遭遇战。角色们可能会试图逃跑，这时就会发生追逐（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\"），或者他们可能会站起来战斗。他们甚至可以尝试设下某种埋伏，因为当他们第一次追上乌鸦时，队伍的前排很可能已经离开了他们的视线。",
	"If the adventurers flee and successfully escape, they lower the pursuit level to 4 and begin avoiding their pursuers again. If they fight the drow, run the encounter. The drow scouts focus on maintaining close pursuit and peppering the characters with poisoned hand crossbow bolts. After {@dice 1d6 + 4} rounds, the remainder of the drow party (Ilvara, Asha, Jorlan, and Shoor) catches up and joins the encounter.": "如果冒险者逃跑并成功逃脱，他们会将追击等级降低到4级，并再次开始躲避追兵。如果他们与乌鸦战斗，则进行遭遇战。乌鸦人的侦察兵专注于保持近距离追击，并用带毒的手弩箭攻击角色。在{@dice 1d6 + 4}回合之后，乌鸦队伍的其余成员（伊尔瓦拉、阿莎、乔兰和肖尔）追了上来，加入了这场遭遇战。",
	"If the adventurers lower the pursuit level to 0, the drow lose the trail unless circumstances allow them to locate the characters again. This might include the characters spending a day or more in a place where they are recognized, or where they talk openly about their escape from Velkynvelve. If the characters pass through an area watched over by drow scouts or spies, Ilvara will inevitably hear word of the characters' location. When this occurs, increase the pursuit level to 1 and begin tracking it again as the drow pick up the trail once more.": "如果冒险者将追捕等级降至0，那么乌鸦就会失去踪迹，除非情况允许他们再次找到这些人物。这可能包括人物在一个他们被认出的地方呆上一天或更久，或者他们在那里公开谈论他们从Velkynvelve逃出来的事情。如果这些角色经过了一个由鸦人侦察员或间谍监视的区域，伊尔瓦拉将不可避免地听到这些角色位置的消息。当这种情况发生时，将追捕级别提高到1，并在乌鸦再次拾起线索时再次开始追踪。",
	"If an encounter with the drow is going badly and you don't want the characters recaptured, you can always have fate intercede on their behalf with another encounter or event offering a distraction.": "如果与乌鸦的遭遇很糟糕，而你又不想让角色被抓回来，你可以让命运替他们出面，用另一个遭遇或事件来转移他们的注意力。",
	"For example, a wandering stone giant, a purple worm, or a pack of savage gnolls whipped into a frenzy by Yeenoghu might show up just as the drow have the characters cornered, giving them a chance to run. Likewise, a minor earthquake (caused by instability from the demonic incursion or a wild magic surge) might cause a cave-in, cutting off a tunnel between the party and their pursuers, and dropping the pursuit level by 1 or 2.": "例如，一个游荡的石巨人、一只紫色的虫子，或者一群被耶诺古激怒的野蛮地精，可能会在乌鸦把角色逼到角落时出现，给他们一个逃跑的机会。同样地，一场小地震（由恶魔入侵的不稳定性或狂野的魔法涌动引起）可能会导致洞穴坍塌，切断队伍与追兵之间的通道，并使追击等级下降1或2。",
	"Don't do this so often that the players feel they haven't earned it, but use it as an option to keep the pursuit going rather than coming to an anticlimactic conclusion.": "不要经常这样做，以至于玩家觉得他们没有赚到钱，但要把它作为一个选项，让追击的过程继续下去，而不是以一种反常的方式结束。",
	"The drow try to capture the escaped prisoners if at all possible, since Ilvara wants the pleasure of teaching them a lesson about disobedience. If the dark elves reduce any characters to 0 hit points, those characters are knocked out rather than dying (see \"{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}\" in chapter 9 of the {@i Player's Handbook}). Even if one or more of the characters are accidentally killed, Ilvara is obsessed enough to cast {@spell raise dead} to restore them to life (assuming the character's soul is willing to return).": "如果可能的话，乌鸦人试图抓住逃跑的囚犯，因为伊尔瓦拉希望能愉快地给他们一个关于不服从的教训。如果黑暗精灵将任何角色的命中率降至0，这些角色就会被击倒而不是死亡（见《{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}》第九章的\"{@i Player's Handbook}\"）。即使一个或多个角色被意外杀死，伊尔瓦拉也会执着地施展（%%2%）来恢复他们的生命（假设该角色的灵魂愿意回归）。",
	"Captured characters are disarmed, their hands bound with spider-silk rope, and gagged. The drow march them back to Velkynvelve unless Menzoberranzan is closer, in which case Ilvara takes them there instead. The characters will need to come up with a new plan of escape, ideally before Ilvara has the opportunity to torture them or sell them into slavery in the City of Spiders. If they escape her clutches again, the drow priestess continues her pursuit until she is dead or the party leaves the Underdark (see {@adventure chapter 7|OotA|6}).": "被俘的人物被解除武装，双手被蜘蛛丝绳绑住，并被塞住嘴。鸦人将他们押送回维尔基维尔，除非门索伯兰山更近，在这种情况下，伊尔瓦拉将他们带到那里。角色们需要想出一个新的逃跑计划，最好是在伊尔瓦拉有机会折磨他们或把他们卖到蜘蛛之城为奴之前。如果他们再次逃出她的魔掌，鸦人女祭司就会继续追捕他们，直到她死了或者队伍离开暗黑世界（见（%0%））。",
	"Each day of travel through the Underdark, check twice to see if the characters encounter anything unusual: once while they are traveling, and again while they are camped or resting.

	"Since there is no wind in the Underdark, all water travel involves either rowing at 1½ miles per hour, or floating with prevailing currents at 1 mile per hour. Characters can work in shifts to row more than 8 hours per day, but crewing a boat for longer than that is considered a forced march (see {@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace} of the {@i Player's Handbook}).": "由于暗黑世界没有风，所有的水上旅行都是以每小时1.5英里的速度划船，或者以每小时1英里的速度随水流漂浮。角色可以轮流工作，每天划船超过8小时，但划船时间超过8小时则被视为强制行军（见{@i Player's Handbook}的{@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace}）。",

Some are completely submerged, navigable only by those able to breathe underwater.": "黑暗湖是由湖泊、水路和运河组成的巨大迷宫，连接着无数的洞穴和房间。其中一些洞穴非常巨大，水深不可估量，拱形的天花板远远超出任何光线的范围。另一些则很狭窄，天花板和水面之间只有几英尺的空间。有些则完全被淹没，只有能够在水下呼吸的人才能航行。",
	"Without the sky or the stars to navigate by, any successful passage of the Darklake relies on one's familiarity with its intricate network of caverns, passages, and currents.

Such knowledge is something that takes years, if not decades, of wandering the Darklake to acquire.Those without the skill to navigate the Darklake (including the adventurers) must employ maps or guides.

Ploopploopeen wants the characters to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult. The archpriest promises that the characters will be \"well rewarded\" for their aid.": "海之母的大神官告诉这些人物，他想用他们作为诱饵。深海之父的大神官需要人形的祭品，而这一行人在这方面代表了一个奖品的收集。Ploopploopeen将把这些角色作为 \"和平与和解的信物\"，以接近深海之父的大祭司--只不过冒险者们将不是无助的囚犯，而是渗透者。Ploopploopeen希望角色们能破坏新晋派别的仪式，让他的海之母的真正信徒砍掉邪教的头。大祭司承诺，这些人物将因为他们的帮助而得到 \"丰厚的回报\"。",

	"It might well be that the kuo-toa's former masters—the mind flayers—used them as ferry pilots and navigators in the Underdark, and the fish-folk continue to do so out of habit or some deep-seated need. Certainly, their relative usefulness to the other races of the Underdark has served the kuo-toa well. Only the duergar have shown any interest in navigating the waters of the Darklake on their own, and not even they do it as well as the kuo-toa.": "很可能是Kuo-toa以前的主人--心灵传播者--把它们作为暗黑世界的渡轮驾驶员和导航员，而鱼人继续这样做是出于习惯或某种根深蒂固的需要。当然，他们对暗黑世界其他种族的相对有用性对Kuo-toa很有帮助。只有杜尔加人对自己在暗黑湖的水域中航行表现出任何兴趣，甚至他们也没有像国土人那样做得好。",
	"There is a persistent myth among the inhabitants of Sloobludop that the maze of tunnels, passages, and pools of the Darklake is a kind of meditation—a spiritual journey.

	"{@creature Buppido|OotA} (see {@area chapter 1|008|x}) and Hemeth (see {@area chapter 3|12a|x}) are the only NPCs who actively suggest going to Gracklstugh. They know that duergar have no love for the drow, and their draconian laws keep all foreigners in check, which should provide some measure of sanctuary from drow pursuit. Gracklstugh is as good a place as any in the Underdark to sell stolen gear and buy more useful equipment. Additionally, the duergar trade actively with other subterranean and surface-dwelling races. Gracklstugh's Blade Bazaar might be the ideal place to find traders or explorers heading to the surface world.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}（见{@area chapter 1|008|x}）和Hemeth（见{@area chapter 3|12a|x}）是唯一积极建议去Gracklstugh的NPC。他们知道杜尔加人对乌鸦没有好感，他们的严酷法律控制着所有的外国人，这应该能提供某种程度的避难所，让他们免受乌鸦的追捕。Gracklstugh是暗黑世界中最适合出售偷来的装备和购买更多有用装备的地方。此外，杜尔加人还积极地与其他地下和地面居住的种族进行贸易。格拉克斯图的刀锋集市可能是寻找前往地表世界的商人或探险家的理想场所。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Hemeth isn't with the party, others can provide the above information. Sarith resists plans to travel to the city at first, conscious of the low regard the duergar have for drow. He changes his mind quickly, however, as Zuggtmoy's spores drive him to seek a densely populated area where he can spread his contagion.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或Hemeth不在队伍中，其他人可以提供上述信息。Sarith起初抵制前往城市的计划，因为他意识到杜尔加人对乌鸦的轻视。然而，他很快就改变了主意，因为祖格莫伊的孢子促使他寻找一个人口稠密的地区，在那里他可以传播他的传染病。",
	"It's also possible the party arrives at Gracklstugh involuntarily. Duergar slavers scour the Underdark in search of new \"merchandise,\" and they might deceive or outright capture the characters and bring them to their city's slave markets. The random encounters in chapters 2 and 3 can easily set up this scenario.": "他们也有可能不由自主地来到了格拉克尔斯图。Duergar奴隶主在暗黑世界中寻找新的 \"商品\"，他们可能会欺骗或直接捕获角色，并将他们带到他们城市的奴隶市场。第2章和第3章中的随机遭遇可以很容易地设置这个场景。",
	"Taking refuge in Gracklstugh has its advantages. Each day they spend in the duergar capital, the characters can attempt a DC 16 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to move around cautiously, with success indicating that they avoid drawing attention to themselves. The characters can also attempt a DC 13 group Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to assess the mood in the city, with success allowing them to avoid trouble before it starts. Characters who lie low for the day have advantage on this Wisdom check.": "在Gracklstugh避难有其好处。在duergar首都度过的每一天，人物都可以尝试用DC16的团体灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查来谨慎行动，成功后表明他们可以避免引起注意。角色还可以尝试DC13的群体智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查来评估城市的情绪，成功后可以在麻烦开始之前避免麻烦。躺在地上一天的人物在这个智慧检查上有优势。",
	"Success with either check reduces the party's pursuit level by 1 (see \"{@area Drow Pursuit|078|x}\" in chapter 2).": "任何一项检查的成功都会使本方的追击等级降低1（见第2章的\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The Darklake District is a likely entry point to the city for the characters, whether they arrive via the water or travel one of the many tunnels leading to the district's gates. Non-duergar arriving from tunnels that lead to other districts are stopped and escorted to the Darklake District under heavy guard, as every other district is normally off limits to outsiders, and trespassers risk being confronted by an {@condition invisible} patrol of four duergar.": "黑暗湖区是人物进入城市的一个可能的入口，无论他们是通过水路还是通过通往该区大门的许多隧道到达。从通往其他地区的隧道到达的非龙人被拦住，并在严密的警卫下被护送到暗湖区，因为其他地区通常是禁止外人进入的，闯入者有可能被四名龙人组成的（%0%）巡逻队撞见。",
	"The party's fellow escapees know that trying to enter through the main entrances is a sure way to get enslaved, unless one of the characters is an epic liar who can convince the guards the party is a legitimate diplomatic or trade delegation. Anyone with a merchant or criminal background has heard rumors that the Zhentarim trade in the Underdark, but posing as Zhentarim has its own risks, as such claims are bound to be questioned. A character who is actually a member of the Zhentarim can buy the adventurers a couple of days inside the city before the duergar slavers start taking their measure.": "队伍的同伴们知道，试图从主要入口进入肯定会被奴役，除非其中一个角色是个史诗般的骗子，能让守卫相信队伍是一个合法的外交或贸易代表团。任何有商人或犯罪背景的人都听说过赞塔林在暗黑世界进行贸易的传闻，但冒充赞塔林也有其风险，因为这种说法必然会受到质疑。一个真正是赞塔林成员的角色可以为冒险者争取到几天的时间，在杜尔加奴隶主开始打量他们之前，他们可以在城内停留几天。",
	"Arriving by way of the Darklake Docks is easier and more discreet. If the characters are traveling by boat, {@creature Buppido|OotA} can guide them to a deserted pier where they can dock quietly. He warns them that they have to keep a low profile and head directly to the only inn in the city devoted to outsiders. The Ghohlbrorn's Lair is frequented by merchants, mercenaries, and other foreigners who can offer information about traveling elsewhere in the Underdark—or perhaps even to the surface world.": "通过暗湖码头到达更容易，也更隐蔽。如果人物是乘船旅行，{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以引导他们到一个废弃的码头，在那里他们可以安静地停靠。他警告他们必须保持低调，并直接前往城市中唯一专门为外来者服务的旅馆。Ghohlbrorn's Lair是商人、雇佣兵和其他外国人经常光顾的地方，他们可以提供有关在暗黑世界其他地方旅行的信息，甚至可能是到地面世界的信息。",
	"Sweltering heat and cloying smoke cling to every corner of the duergar city, spewing from smelters housed inside massive stalagmites and stalactites. These protrude from the cavern's floor and ceiling like the teeth of some great maw.": "闷热的天气和令人窒息的烟雾笼罩着杜尔加城市的每一个角落，从装在巨大的石笋和钟乳石里的冶炼厂喷出。这些石笋和钟乳石从洞穴的地板和天花板上伸出来，就像一些大嘴的牙齿。",
	"Gracklstugh's glowing forges and smithies operate continuously. Most of the city is dimly lit by a hellish red glow, with patches of darkness here and there.": "Gracklstugh的发光锻造厂和铁匠铺持续运作。城市的大部分地区都被地狱般的红光照亮，这里和那里都有一些黑暗的斑点。",
	"The clanging and clacking of hammers and machinery echoes constantly throughout the city. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to listen in Gracklstugh have disadvantage.": "锤子和机器的叮叮当当声在整个城市不断回响。在Gracklstugh进行的智慧({@skill Perception})检查对倾听是不利的。",
	"Despite vents dug into the walls and ceiling of the city's great cavern, fumes from smelters and forges linger at ground level (as does the gas tapped in Laduguer's Furrow). Visitors might contract the illness known as grackle-lung (see the Grackle-lung sidebar).": "尽管在城市大洞穴的墙壁和天花板上挖有通风口，但冶炼厂和锻造厂的烟气仍在地面上徘徊（就像在拉杜古尔沟挖掘的气体一样）。游客可能会感染被称为鹩哥肺的疾病（见 \"鹩哥肺 \"边栏）。",
	"With routine patrols of heavily armed gray dwarves who can turn {@condition invisible}, Gracklstugh is a relatively safe place for those who know where they belong and stay there. However, tensions are rising because of the influence of Demogorgon, and the characters have many opportunities to participate in events unfolding in the city. At the end of each long rest, roll a {@dice d20}; on a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place.

	"Wary outsiders visiting Gracklstugh quickly learn the most important details of life in the city.": "警惕的外来者在访问格拉克斯图的时候，很快就了解到了城市生活中最重要的细节。",
	"The duergar power of invisibility plays a significant role in their society. The potential presence of unseen spies everywhere enforces honesty among duergar. Slaves rarely, if ever, talk or act against their masters, never knowing who might be watching.": "杜尔加人的隐形能力在他们的社会中起着重要作用。到处都有看不见的间谍的潜在存在，这使得杜尔加人的诚实性得到加强。奴隶们很少（如果有的话）谈论或采取行动反对他们的主人，因为他们从不知道谁可能在监视。",
	"Not only is the layout of Gracklstugh divided, so are its people. Nearly five hundred years ago, the derro launched a Uniting War against the Deepkingdom, but were swiftly crushed, and the survivors brought back to Gracklstugh in chains.

	"The gray dwarves value efficiency, stoicism, and hard work, and these values are exemplified in their capital. Everything the duergar make or build has a purpose and function; the only aesthetic they value in architecture is imposing vastness, and even that is secondary to a building's structural function. The only ornamentations found in Gracklstugh are iconic representations of rank and function within duergar society, and the only music is the ceaseless rhythmic hammering in the forges. The duergar consider art a frivolous pursuit, and only rarely appreciate or create it.": "灰矮人重视效率、坚忍和努力工作，这些价值观在他们的资本中得到了体现。灰矮人制造或建造的所有东西都有其目的和功能；他们在建筑方面唯一重视的美学就是宏伟的规模，即使这也是次要的，因为建筑的结构功能。在Gracklstugh发现的唯一的装饰品是二重奏社会中等级和功能的标志性代表，唯一的音乐是锻造厂里无休止的有节奏的敲击声。duergar人认为艺术是一种轻浮的追求，而且很少欣赏或创造它。",
	"The lairds and merchants who sit at this council make sure that trade and commerce flow smoothly. They employ slave labor to maintain trade routes in the dangerous Underdark, and are always open to hiring explorers to check out leads on potential new routes. Expendable outsiders hired as caravan guards always take point and receive little aid or support from the caravan masters. Despite these unfair assignments, the duergar always live up to their bargains, paying survivors as promised.": "坐在议会里的领主和商人们确保贸易和商业的顺利进行。他们雇佣奴隶来维护危险的暗黑世界的贸易路线，并且总是愿意雇佣探险家来检查潜在的新路线的线索。被雇为商队守卫的消耗品的外来者总是拿着点，很少得到商队主人的援助或支持。尽管有这些不公平的任务，杜尔加人总是履行他们的协议，按照承诺支付幸存者。",
	"In addition to the clans' regular armies, Gracklstugh trains specialized warriors whose oaths of service always supersede their original loyalties. See {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19} for more information.": "除了部族的正规军，格拉克尔斯特还训练专门的战士，他们的服役誓言总是取代他们原来的忠诚。更多信息见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}。",

	"Despite reports that the darkhafts and the Stone Guards have received about the growing crisis outside the city's walls, hubris and the onset of madness prevents them from mounting any sort of response or campaign, blind to the corruption that festers around them.": "尽管暗堡和石卫收到了关于城墙外日益严重的危机的报告，但傲慢和疯狂的出现使他们无法采取任何形式的回应或行动，对他们周围发酵的腐败视而不见。",
	"The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

	"If a creature's {@condition exhaustion} level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week.

	"The stone giants of Clan Cairngorm lead quiet lives of art and contemplation in Gracklstugh. Although reclusive and averse to conflict, the giants have sworn an ancient oath of loyalty to the Deepking, and have been serving his line for as long as any can remember.

If the throne passes to another dynasty, the stone giants will cease to be the city's allies.": "凯恩戈姆氏族的石头巨人在格雷克尔斯图过着安静的艺术和沉思的生活。虽然隐居并不喜欢冲突，但这些巨人对深王发下了古老的忠诚誓言，并且从人们有记忆以来就一直为他的家族服务。然而，这个誓言只给了钢影氏族。如果王位传给另一个王朝，石巨人将不再是城市的盟友。",
	"The leader of the stone giants is Stonespeaker Hgraam, a priest of Skoraeus Stonebones, the god of his people. Hgraam is wise and knowledgeable.

	"The Wyrmsmith is beginning to chafe under the Keepers' control. He now wonders why he is content with a mere trickle of gold and a paltry handful of slaves, when he could simply force the entire city to bend knee to him and give him everything he desires. For now, his actions are limited by how little he cares about the duergar and how much the Keepers speak \"on his behalf.\" But he has begun taking an interest in the affairs of Gracklstugh and the opportunity to recruit new servants from outside the Keepers of the Flame, using his outings to rekindle forges and smelters as a means to keep an eye out for promising subjects.": "在守护者的控制下，巫师开始感到不安。他现在想知道为什么他只满足于涓涓细流的黄金和一小撮奴隶，而他可以简单地迫使整个城市向他屈膝，给他想要的一切。目前，他的行动受到了限制，因为他对杜尔加的关心程度很低，而且守卫者们 \"代表他 \"说话。但他已经开始对格拉克尔斯图的事务和从火焰守护者之外招募新仆人的机会感兴趣，利用他外出重燃锻造厂和冶炼厂的机会，留意有前途的对象。",

	"The {@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common) are a folktale in Gracklstugh, their name derived from an ancient, obscure Dwarvish dialect.

	"The duergar are called gray dwarves not only because of the color of their skin, but also because of their drab and joyless lifestyle.

	"By appearance and bearing, all duergar know their place and where they belong. Whether as individuals, families, or entire clans, duergar below other duergar in the social order don't seek to bring their rivals down through intrigue and deceit.

	"Duergar clans use caverns under Gracklstugh and choice outlying caves to farm a variety of plants and fungi. These crops are complemented by meat from Underdark beasts and fish from the Darklake.

	"The bottom rung in Gracklstugh society is mostly occupied by the underclass of the derro. Enslaved by the duergar centuries ago, then freed, the derro aren't allowed to hold honest jobs, and their rights are hardly ever recognized by the duergar. Even slaves are held in higher regard.

	"Another kind of outcasts are those duergar who dishonor their clans so grievously they are stripped of all but their lives: the {@i calassabrak}, meaning \"the flawed who aren't to be trusted\" in Dwarvish. They are shunned by other duergar, many eventually taking their lives rather than face an existence apart from family and clan.

The code of punishment is simple. Because dishonor, mutilation and imprisonment are a waste of resources and create weakness in society, a duergar who intentionally commits any crime receives a death sentence. Accidental crime by a duergar is compensated by goods or work equivalent to the damages.

	"The guard grudgingly lets the characters pass if the check succeeds, and refuses them entrance if it fails. If the check fails by 5 or more, the guard gives the order to arrest the characters, announcing that they are now slaves of the duergar (see \"Getting Captured\" below).": "如果检查成功，守卫会勉强让角色通过，如果检查失败则拒绝他们进入。如果检查的结果是5分或更多，警卫就会下令逮捕这些人物，宣布他们现在是duergar的奴隶（见下面的 \"被俘\"）。",
	"The first time the characters are allowed inside the city or turned away from a gate, a secret door on the wall opens, revealing Gorglak, a {@creature duergar Stone Guard|MTF} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}).": "人物第一次被允许进入城市或被拒之门外时，墙上的暗门会打开，露出高格拉克，一个（%0%）（见（%1%））。",

A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check lets a character notice that Gorglak is eying the adventurers' weapons (especially any drow weapons or magic weapons they might have), and that there's something odd about his behavior. The madness creeping into Gracklstugh has made Gorglak obsessed with rare weapons. He's willing to go to great extents to acquire new weapons of exquisite design for his growing collection.": "如果他们和队伍在一起，{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}、{@creature Sarith Kzekarit|OotA}、{@creature Jimjar|OotA}和{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以悄悄告诉角色，很少有duergar像Gorglak这样公然腐败的。成功通过DC12智慧（（%5%））检查可以让角色注意到戈尔格拉克正在盯着冒险者的武器（尤其是他们可能拥有的任何鸦人武器或魔法武器），而且他的行为有些奇怪。匍匐在格拉克斯图的疯狂使戈尔格拉克对稀有武器着迷。他愿意不惜一切代价为自己不断增长的收藏品获取设计精美的新武器。",

Any other bribe requires one of the characters to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, or Gorglak is insulted and has the party arrested. If the characters are too open about the negotiation, Gorglak has them arrested and pretends he didn't say anything.": "向戈尔格拉克提供一件值得收藏的武器，可以让这些角色通过大门。任何其他的贿赂都需要其中一个角色在DC13魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中获得成功，否则高格拉克会被侮辱并逮捕他们。如果人物对谈判太过开放，戈尔格拉克就会逮捕他们，并假装他什么都没说。",
	"If Gorglak finds the characters' bribe appealing, he refuses to accept it then and there, instead directing them to find one Werz Saltbaron in the Darklake Docks and hand the bribe to him. Gorglak tells the characters that he will check with Werz at the end of his shift, and will find the characters and arrest them if they have not paid by then.": "如果Gorglak发现人物的贿赂很有吸引力，他拒绝当时就接受贿赂，而是指示他们在Darklake码头找到Werz Saltbaron并把贿赂交给他。Gorglak告诉这些人物，他将在下班时向Werz核实，如果他们到时还没有付款，他将找到这些人物并逮捕他们。",

	"As the characters draw closer, they can see that the eastern docks are the least crowded. If {@creature Buppido|OotA} is with them, he guides them to a natural rock pier on the eastern edge of the cavern. Otherwise, the characters must make a successful DC 14 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check or a DC 15 group Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to guide their boat safely and inconspicuously to an empty dock. If the group check fails, nearby guards notice the characters but don't immediately identify them as a threat. However, you can choose to impose disadvantage on any checks the characters make to remain inconspicuous during their first day in Gracklstugh.": "随着人物的接近，他们可以看到东边的码头是最不拥挤的。如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}和他们在一起，他就会引导他们到洞穴东边的一个天然岩石码头。否则，角色们必须成功地进行DC14集体灵巧（（%%1%））检查或DC15集体智慧（（%%2%））检查，以引导他们的船安全而不显眼地到达一个空码头。如果团体检定失败，附近的守卫会注意到这些人物，但不会立即认定他们是一个威胁。然而，你可以选择对人物在Gracklstugh的第一天为保持不显眼而进行的任何检查施加不利条件。",
	"Even after making it inside the city, the characters must tread carefully, as the duergar use the slightest pretext to arrest them. Even trying to haggle with a duergar merchant might inspire a call for the guards to take the characters away. Getting caught stealing is punishable by death on the spot, but guards or the offended party might see some value in enslaving the culprits instead, so the characters can be shackled and shipped beyond the Darklake District. Resisting arrest is a truly bad idea; every duergar around is reinforcement.": "即使进了城，人物也必须小心翼翼，因为龙骑兵会用最轻微的借口来逮捕他们。即使是试图与杜尔加商人讨价还价，也可能会引起守卫的注意，让他们把人物带走。偷窃被抓会被当场处死，但守卫或被冒犯的一方可能会看到奴役罪犯的一些价值，所以人物可以被戴上镣铐，运到黑暗湖区以外。拒捕是一个非常糟糕的主意；周围的每一个杜尔加人都是援军。",
	"If the characters get arrested, you can interrupt their transfer with a random encounter or lead them to other planned encounters. The \"Rampaging Giant\" encounter (which takes place in the Darklake District) is the most likely event to interrupt a prisoner transfer. Alternatively, an agent of the Keepers of the Flame can stop the guards before they take the characters to Overlake Hold (see \"{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}'s Lair\" for information regarding the keepers' interest in foreign mercenaries).": "如果人物被捕，你可以用随机的遭遇来打断他们的转移，或者把他们引向其他计划的遭遇。横冲直撞的巨人 \"的遭遇（发生在黑暗湖区）是最有可能打断囚犯转移的事件。另外，火焰守卫者的代理人可以在守卫者将角色带到奥弗莱克城之前阻止他们（关于守卫者对外国雇佣兵的兴趣，请参见\"{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}的巢穴\"）。",

	"The Darklake District gives an illusion of openness. The streets are relatively wide to allow for merchant carts and wagons to pass, and the buildings aren't as crowded around stalagmites as in the southern districts. Openness doesn't mean welcoming, however. The duergar who ply their trades here are wary of all the foreigners confined by law to this part of the city.": "黑湖区给人一种开放的错觉。街道相对宽阔，可以让商车和马车通过，建筑物也不像南部地区那样挤在石笋周围。然而，开放并不意味着欢迎。在这里做生意的杜尔加人对所有被法律限制在城市的这一部分的外国人都很警惕。",
	"A wave of heat slams against you as an acrid smog rises to choke the air out of your lungs.

	"Behind the forbidding walls separating the Darklake District from the rest of the city stand the docks, markets, and shops where Gracklstugh's commerce and trade are conducted. The many duergar merchants—along with drow, svirfneblin, orcs, and others—pay little attention to the characters unless they are looking to do business.": "在将黑暗湖区与城市其他地方隔开的禁忌之墙后面，是码头、市场和商店，Gracklstugh的商业和贸易在这里进行。许多duergar商人--还有drow、svirfneblin、兽人和其他人--很少关注这些人物，除非他们想做生意。",

For gossip and a meal, the Shattered Spire tavern is recommended, while lodging for non-duergar can be had at the Ghohlbrorn's Lair inn.": "门口的守卫向人物明确表示，非精灵族人被限制在黑暗湖区，人物最好向其他外来者问路，而不是试图与精灵族当地人打交道。如果他们想出售他们可能携带的任何东西，他们会被引导到刀锋集市。如果要闲聊和吃饭，建议去 \"破碎尖塔 \"酒馆，而非龙人的住宿则可以在 \"戈尔布伦的巢穴 \"旅馆。",

	"This encounter triggers possible side quests through which the characters can learn about the influence of Demogorgon in Gracklstugh. You can use this event any time during the party's stay in the city. Holding it for later use gives characters a chance to notice the little things wrong among the duergar, while using it right away can help characters avoid being enslaved if they are arrested at any point during their visit.": "这个遭遇会触发可能的支线任务，通过这些任务，角色们可以了解德摩根在格拉克尔斯图的影响。你可以在队伍停留在这个城市的任何时候使用这个事件。将它留待以后使用，可以让人物有机会注意到德摩根之间的小问题，而立即使用它可以帮助人物在访问期间的任何时候被逮捕，避免被奴役。",
	"The rhythmic hammering of the city's forges is drowned for a second by a thundering roar and the sound of crumbling rock. Duergar and visitors alike turn to look as a two-headed, gray-skinned giant bursts through a gate, howling madly and lashing out left and right, littering the plaza with rock and stone debris. As he bellows, one of his swings connects with a duergar soldier, whose broken body flies through the air and crashes near you with a sickening crunch.": "城市锻造的有节奏的锤击声在一瞬间被雷鸣般的吼声和岩石崩裂的声音所淹没。杜尔加人和游客都转头看去，一个双头灰皮的巨人冲进了大门，疯狂地嚎叫着，左右开弓，在广场上到处都是岩石和石块碎片。随着他的嚎叫，他的一次挥舞击中了一名杜尔加士兵，他破碎的身体在空中飞翔，在你附近坠落，发出令人作呕的脆响。",

If the characters are prisoners under escort when the giant attacks, the guards who engage the giant are their escort.

Pelek doesn't know about the pygmywort mushrooms.": "当怪物被打败后，一个名叫佩莱克的深山地精的{@creature ghost}从地下探出头来，眨了眨眼，然后完全冒了出来。这个鬼魂很友好，他告诉冒险者，不久前{@creature Buppido|OotA}杀了他，然后把他切成碎片，和其他身体部分一起放在神龛里。佩莱克解释了他是如何从布林登斯通出发，与{@creature Buppido|OotA}坠入的。他对沃尔斯通隧道知之甚少，但他曾观察到一个戴着滑稽帽子的缩小版德鲁人（（%%3%））进出狭窄的隧道。佩莱克不知道侏儒草蘑菇的事。",
	"Pelek asks the characters to take one or more parts of him to Blingdenstone and bury his remains there, so that his spirit can rest. It's impossible to tell which body parts are his, and looking around is a gruesome task that speaks loudly to {@creature Buppido|OotA}'s madness. Pelek recalls that the strange magic that pervades the tunnels animated one of his severed hands, and it scuttled away through one of the narrow tunnels. (Characters might encounter it in area 13.) Pelek points out that characters can recognize the hand because it was wearing an obsidian ring. If the characters need more reasons to go to Blingdenstone, Pelek adds that the svirfneblin who live there know many ways to the surface.": "Pelek要求人物把他的一个或多个部分带到Blingdenstone，把他的遗体埋在那里，让他的精神得到安息。不可能分辨出哪些身体部位是他的，四处寻找是一项可怕的任务，大声说出了（%0%）的疯狂。佩莱克回忆说，弥漫在隧道中的奇怪的魔法使他的一只断手变得生动起来，它在一条狭窄的隧道中窜走了。(角色可能会在13区遇到它。）Pelek指出，角色可以认出这只手，因为它戴着一个黑曜石戒指。如果角色需要更多的理由去Blingdenstone，Pelek补充说，住在那里的svirfneblin知道许多通往地面的方法。",

The river carries many things from the subterranean lake, including the carcasses of countless creatures, fouling the pool (see the \"Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features\" sidebar).": "这个池子由一条从黑暗湖流来的河流提供水源。这条河从地下湖携带了许多东西，包括无数生物的尸体，弄脏了水池（见 \"霍尔石隧道：一般特征 \"侧边栏）。",

Gnomes are immune.": "水是由温泉加热的，温暖宜人。然而，这个池子里充满了疾病。任何在水中开始的生物都必须做一个DC13的宪法救赎动作。如果拯救失败，该生物就会被感染上咯咯热（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"）。地精是免疫的。",

Climbing the slippery walls of the cavern requires a successful DC 13 {@skill Athletics} check. On a failed check, a character falls into the water.": "人物可以尝试在不游泳的情况下绕过水池，通过使用魔法或沿着墙壁爬行。攀爬洞穴中湿滑的墙壁需要成功进行DC13（%0%）的检查。如果检查失败，角色就会掉入水中。",

	"The tunnel opens into a natural cave, wherein you see several fungal creatures dancing to a silent tune. Three of them stand five feet tall, while the others are half as tall.

	"If the characters try to communicate with the myconids, they release rapport spores so that everyone can speak telepathically. The leader of the myconids is an adult named Voosbur, who speaks on behalf of the others. Sharing thoughts with these sentient mushrooms is an odd and strangely intoxicating experience (and feels quite different than the rapport the characters might have shared with {@creature Stool|OotA}). Voosbur happily tells the party how its \"troupe\" was attracted by the special mushrooms in these tunnels, and it tells the characters about the magical properties of the pygmywort and bigwig mushrooms. Voosbur further explains that the myconids didn't wander into this area, but arrived here by traveling \"through the Lady's dream.\" Voosbur describes \"the Lady\" as a powerful being that loves and guides all myconids. He offers to share \"the Lady's gift\" with the characters, allowing them to travel \"through the Lady's dream\" as the myconids do. Characters who accept the offer gain Zuggtmoy's gift (see the sidebar).": "如果角色们试图与菌类沟通，它们就会释放出默契的孢子，从而使每个人都能用心灵感应说话。菌类的领袖是一个名叫沃斯伯的成年人，他代表其他人说话。与这些有知觉的蘑菇分享思想是一种奇怪的、令人陶醉的体验（感觉与人物可能与{@creature Stool|OotA}分享的融洽关系完全不同）。Voosbur高兴地告诉大家，它的 \"剧团 \"是如何被这些隧道中的特殊蘑菇所吸引的，它还告诉大家侏儒草和大头菜蘑菇的神奇特性。Voosbur进一步解释说，这些菌类并没有游荡到这个区域，而是通过 \"穿越女士的梦境 \"到达这里。沃斯伯将 \"女士 \"描述为一个强大的存在，她爱并引导所有的菌类。他提议与人物分享 \"女士的礼物\"，允许他们像菌类一样 \"通过女士的梦境 \"旅行。接受这个提议的角色会获得Zuggtmoy的礼物（见侧边栏）。",
	"If present, {@creature Stool|OotA} tells the characters it has no idea what Voosbur is talking about.

	"{@creature Rumpadump|OotA} is as introverted as {@creature Stool|OotA} is outgoing, preferring to hang back and not use its rapport spores unless absolutely necessary. Whether {@creature Stool|OotA} is present or not, {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} can guide the characters to Neverlight Grove (see {@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}), where the sovereigns might know of a way out of the Underdark. However, the myconid sprout is worried that Voosbur's \"strange spores\" might have infected the rest of the myconids back home.": "{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}和{@creature Stool|OotA}一样内向，喜欢呆在后面，不到万不得已不使用它的关系孢子。无论{@creature Stool|OotA}是否在场，{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}都可以引导人物到永光丛林（见{@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}），那里的君主可能知道离开地下世界的方法。然而，霉菌萌芽担心沃斯伯的 \"奇怪的孢子 \"可能已经感染了家乡的其他霉菌。",
	"Voosbur takes no offense if the characters refuse his offer to teach them how to travel \"the Lady's dream,\" simply bidding them farewell as the myconids resume their dancing. If the characters have shown {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} any kindness, it asks their permission to join the party, especially if {@creature Stool|OotA} is present. At the same time, Sarith breaks away from the party to join the myconids. The drow turns one last time to give the characters a look of terror and despair before his face loses all expression. He and the dancing myconids then enter a mushroom patch and use the {@spell tree stride} ability granted by Zuggtmoy's blessing to vanish from sight.": "如果人物拒绝他教他们如何旅行 \"女士的梦想 \"的提议，Voosbur不会介意，只是在菌类继续跳舞时向他们告别。如果人物对{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}有任何善意，它就会请求他们允许加入聚会，尤其是在{@creature Stool|OotA}在场的情况下。与此同时，萨利斯脱离了队伍，加入了菌类的行列。乌鸦最后一次转身，在他的脸上失去所有的表情之前，给了角色们一个恐怖和绝望的表情。然后他和跳舞的菌类进入一片蘑菇地，并使用祖格莫伊的祝福所赋予的（%2%）能力，从人们的视线中消失。",

	"Although creepy, the hissing sound is harmless, caused by air whistling through perforated mushrooms in the thicket of fungi. The characters can cross this area by forcing their way through it, or by eating pygmywort mushrooms first to move through without disturbing the other fungi present. If the characters are chasing {@creature Droki|OotA}, he uses the thicket to his advantage, eating a pygmywort to sneak his way across. At reduced size, he leaves no trail that normal-sized pursuers can follow.": "虽然令人毛骨悚然，但这种嘶嘶声是无害的，是空气呼啸着穿过真菌丛中的穿孔蘑菇造成的。角色可以通过强行穿越这个区域，或者先吃侏儒草菇，在不干扰其他在场的真菌的情况下通过。如果人物被追赶（%0%），他就会利用丛生的优势，吃下一个侏儒草来偷偷地穿过。在体型缩小的情况下，他不会留下正常体型的追捕者可以跟踪的痕迹。",

	"Many of the myconids in the grove are more extroverted than might be expected of their normally shy species. Characters who communicate with the myconids by way of their rapport spores note that the creatures seem to be preparing for a celebration of some sort, proclaiming \"The day of joy is nigh!\" and exhorting others to \"Rejoice in the true union that will meld us all!\" These are the myconids affected by Zuggtmoy, and their behavior is cause for concern among the unaffected, including {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its allies.": "丛林中的许多霉菌类动物都比通常情况下的害羞物种要外向得多。通过默契孢子与菌类沟通的角色注意到，这些生物似乎正在准备某种庆祝活动，它们宣称 \"欢乐的日子近了！\"并劝告其他人 \"为将我们所有人融合在一起的真正结合而欢呼！\" 这些是受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类，它们的行为引起了未受影响者的关注，包括{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的盟友。",
	"Myconid communities normally have only a single sovereign—the largest among them, who stands alone and outside of any circle (see below). Two years ago, {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} arrived in the grove with its two circles, and Sovereign Phylo welcomed the new myconids gladly, grateful for Basidia's offer to share the burdens of leading all the circles in the grove. The two sovereigns have been close friends ever since, sharing authority and responsibilities with no conflict. Each knows that an individual myconid has only so much time in the cycle of life, and that when both have passed, a single sovereign will take their place after their bodies are returned to nourish the soil.": "霉菌社区通常只有一个君主--他们中最大的君主，他独自站在任何圈子之外（见下文）。两年前，{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}带着它的两个圈子来到了小树林，主权者Phylo高兴地欢迎新的菌类，感谢Basidia提出分担领导小树林所有圈子的重任。从那时起，两位君主一直是亲密的朋友，分享权力和责任，没有冲突。每个人都知道，在生命的轮回中，一个单独的霉菌只有这么多时间，当两个人都去世后，在他们的身体回到土壤中滋养后，会有一个君主来取代他们。",
	"The circles in Neverlight Grove are divided by specialized function, with each circle performing a specific role in the colony. Seven circles are present in the grove, each containing an average of twenty myconids—the Circle of Hunters, the Circle of Explorers, the Circle of Sowers, the Circle of Builders, the Circle of Growers, plus the recently formed Inner Circle and Circle of Masters. Each circle gathers around a circle mound—a pile of rocks and soil upon which mold, lichen, and mushrooms are encouraged to grow. The myconids of a circle gather around their own mound to meld and sleep.": "永恒之光丛林中的圈子是按专门的功能划分的，每个圈子都在殖民地中发挥着特定的作用。小树林里有七个圈子，每个圈子平均有20个菌类--猎人圈子、探索者圈子、播种者圈子、建设者圈子、种植者圈子，加上最近形成的内部圈子和大师圈子。每个圈子都聚集在一个圈子的土堆周围--一堆岩石和土壤，鼓励霉菌、地衣和蘑菇在上面生长。一个圈子的菌类聚集在他们自己的圆丘周围，进行融合和睡眠。",
	"After becoming enthralled by Zuggtmoy, Phylo decided the myconids would meld exclusively within their own circle, and only the circle leaders would meld with the other circle leaders and the sovereigns. Phylo asserted that this would make all the circles' meldings far more efficient, thereby making the tending of the grove that much easier. Most of the grove's myconids have gone along with this new and unusual concept, swayed by Phylo's claims that a higher level of communal harmony will be achieved.": "在被Zuggtmoy迷住之后，Phylo决定，菌类将只在自己的圈子里融合，只有圈子的领导者才会与其他圈子的领导者和君主融合。菲洛断言，这将使所有圈子的融合更加有效，从而使小树林的管理更加容易。丛林中的大多数菌类都接受了这个新的、不寻常的概念，被菲洛声称将实现更高水平的社区和谐所动摇。",
	"Basidia believes that Phylo's separation of the circles is contrary to the unity and harmony of the myconid way of life, and that this segregation isolates individuals from the experiences of others outside their circle. Basidia has likewise expressed concern about the unnaturalness of the Inner Circle and the Circle of Masters. However, Basidia's views are either dismissed or ignored by Phylo and its allies, who zealously claim that exciting changes are coming for the grove.": "Basidia认为，Phylo对圈子的分离违背了菌类生活方式的统一性和和谐性，这种隔离使个人与他们圈子以外的其他人的经验相隔离。Basidia也同样对 \"内部圈子 \"和 \"大师圈子 \"的不自然性表示担忧。然而，Basidia的观点要么被Phylo及其盟友驳回，要么被他们忽视，他们热衷于宣称丛林即将发生激动人心的变化。",
	"A more recent development has Basidia even more disturbed when the adventurers arrive in Neverlight Grove. {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}, the leader of the Circle of Masters, has not attended an Inner Circle melding for several days now, instead sending a representative (see \"The Circle of Masters\" in area 5). Times in Neverlight Grove are strange and worrisome indeed.": "当冒险者们到达永光丛林时，一个更近的发展让巴西迪亚更加不安了。{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}，大师圈的领袖，已经好几天没有参加内圈的融合了，而是派了一个代表（见第五区的 \"大师圈\"）。永光丛林的时代确实很奇怪，也很令人担忧。",
	"Myconids lead lives completely unlike the experiences of any surface dweller. The only things they have in common with humanoids are the need for sustenance, the desire to live, and the joy of socialization, although they practice each of these things in different ways than humanoids. Truly alien creatures, myconids have difficulty telling flesh-and-blood humanoids apart.": "菌类所过的生活与任何地面居民的经历完全不同。他们与人类的唯一共同点是对食物的需求，对生活的渴望，以及社交的乐趣，尽管他们以不同于人类的方式实践这些事情。作为真正的外星生物，菌类很难区分有血有肉的类人。",
	"Myconids are innocent about matters of ethics and morality, their lives centered on living fully each day and worrying little about the future and nothing at all about the past. Despite the communal nature of their existence, they are individuals with their own unique interests and distinct personalities. They gravitate toward simple, shared joys, living by the wisdom and insight their melding provides. Because of their naive and sharing ways, as well as their fungal nature, they are extremely vulnerable to the corrupting influence of Zuggtmoy.": "霉菌在伦理和道德问题上是无辜的，他们的生活中心是充分地过好每一天，对未来很少担心，对过去根本不担心。尽管他们的存在具有公共性，但他们是有自己独特兴趣和独特个性的个体。他们倾向于简单的、共享的快乐，靠他们的融合提供的智慧和洞察力生活。由于他们的天真和分享方式，以及他们的真菌性质，他们非常容易受到Zuggtmoy的腐蚀影响。",
	"The myconids of Neverlight Grove are beginning to reel from the Lady of Decay's influence, with many blissfully welcoming her madness, while others bravely try to resist it. Myconids affected by Zuggtmoy abandon the growth of life as the core of their being in favor of decay and death. More horrifying is that they do so with childlike innocence, reveling in the corruption of all life with a sense of wonder and joy, unable to grasp the evil they have embraced.": "梦幻树丛的菌类开始受到腐烂女士的影响，许多人幸福地欢迎她的疯狂，而其他人则勇敢地试图抵制它。受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类放弃了作为其存在核心的生命成长，而选择了腐烂和死亡。更可怕的是，他们在这样做的时候还带着孩子般的天真，以一种好奇和喜悦的心情陶醉于所有生命的腐败，无法理解他们所拥抱的邪恶。",
	"Myconids share everything through melding. Rapport spores carry a tiny bit of all myconids to the other myconids in their circle, to be absorbed and reside within them, and creating a telepathic familial bond. When the myconids of a circle gather to meld, they share their individual insights, fears, hopes, and dreams. Through the melding, all myconids join together to form the heart and soul of a colony.": "霉菌类通过融合分享一切。和谐孢子将所有霉菌的一小部分带到他们圈子里的其他霉菌身上，被他们吸收并居住在其中，并创造一种心灵感应的家庭纽带。当一个圈子的霉菌聚集在一起进行融合时，他们会分享各自的见解、恐惧、希望和梦想。通过融合，所有的菌类都结合在一起，形成一个菌群的核心和灵魂。",
	"Initially weakened by the summoning ritual that wrenched her from the Abyss, Zuggtmoy found her way to Neverlight Grove, drawn by the strength of its fungal vitality. Upon her arrival, she quickly assessed the situation, realizing the shortest path to gain control of the grove would be to sway and corrupt its original sovereign to serve her until she recovered her strength.": "扎格莫伊最初被从深渊中召唤出来的仪式所削弱，她被永光丛林的真菌活力所吸引，找到了自己的道路。到达后，她迅速评估了情况，意识到获得丛林控制权的最短途径是动摇和腐蚀它原来的统治者，使其为她服务，直到她恢复力量。",
	"After being welcomed to the grove by Phylo, Zuggtmoy melded with the sovereign in secret, seducing it with the promise of a paradise for the mushroom folk if Phylo would lead them to become her followers on the Material Plane. Its mind completely lost inside the demon queen's insidiously mad vision, Phylo became enthralled by the promise of plentiful soil and moisture, perpetual rot, and beautiful transcendent dreams to be shared in a never-ending communal melding—all offered to the grove's folk as generous and wondrous gifts from the Lady of Decay.": "在受到菲洛的欢迎后，祖格莫伊秘密地与君主融合在一起，诱惑它承诺如果菲洛能带领他们成为她在物质世界的追随者，就能为蘑菇族提供一个天堂。Phylo完全迷失在恶魔女王阴险疯狂的视野中，它被丰富的土壤和水分、永久的腐烂和美丽的超凡梦想的承诺所迷惑，在一个永无止境的集体融合中分享这些东西--所有这些都是腐烂女士慷慨而奇妙的礼物，提供给丛林的人们的。",
	"Everyday melding has now become a subtle ideological war between supporters of the two myconid sovereigns. Phylo is slowly convincing the mushroom folk to follow the new path. Basidia and its dwindling supporters argue against the new way, even as they lose ground (and allies) each time the circles of the grove share consciousness.": "日常的融合现在已经成为两个菌类主权支持者之间微妙的意识形态战争。Phylo正在慢慢地说服蘑菇族人遵循新的道路。Basidia和它不断减少的支持者们则反对新的道路，甚至在每次小树林的圈子分享意识时，他们都会失去阵地（和盟友）。",
	"As more and more myconids unwittingly become vessels for Zuggtmoy's spores, Neverlight Grove becomes a more extravagantly festive place. The quiet, contemplative joy of the mushroom folk's way of life is being inexorably replaced by decadent, enraptured euphoria—and the madness that euphoria hides.": "随着越来越多的菌类不知不觉地成为Zuggtmoy孢子的容器，Neverlight Grove变成了一个更加奢侈的节日场所。蘑菇民的生活方式的安静、沉思的快乐正不可避免地被颓废、陶醉的欣快感所取代，以及欣快感所隐藏的疯狂。",

	"Upon her arrival in the Underdark, Zuggtmoy found Neverlight Grove and took up residence there. The myconids welcomed her, sealing their fate. Through telepathically shared dreams, corruption has taken root deep within the colony, warping the myconids' normally placid and peaceful nature into something restive and rapturous.

While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success.

With each step taken on the soggy ground, a rank scent of decay rises around you.": "淡奶油色和米色的茎秆长得又粗又高，类似于表面世界的森林。真菌到处生长，在它们之间很难找到类似于道路的东西。巨大的紫檀木蘑菇帽遮住了你对洞穴天花板的视线，但那里的发光真菌散发出闪亮的光环。在潮湿的地面上每走一步，你周围就会升起一股腐烂的气味。",

Loobamub redirects the spore servants and awakened zurkhwoods Phylo creates away from its circle's territory.": "作为猎人的圈子领袖，这个高大精干的菌人与巴西迪亚一样，对菲洛的新方式感到担忧，尽管它在加入内部圈子时仍有能力抵制菲洛的腐化融合。Loobamub对自己的意见保持沉默，但当其他猎人融合时，它的戒心会蔓延到其他猎人身上，巩固他们对Basidia的忠诚。Loobamub将Phylo创造的孢子仆人和被唤醒的Zurkhwoods从它的圈子的领土上重新定向。",
	"Loobamub is happy to enlist the party's aid in dealing with a few unwelcome monsters that have found their way into the fungal wilds. In particular, the circle leader asks the adventurers to kill a {@creature grick alpha} and then take its carcass to Basidia for reanimation.

	"If Gasbide interacts with the characters using rapport spores, it demands descriptions of surface-world structures, bristling with an excitement seldom seen in myconids. It asks for exasperatingly minor details such as the precise dimensions of bricks or the density of lumber. Gasbide reveals through the rapport that it dreams of building a fungal tower \"even greater than Yggmorgus.\" It hopes to break through the Underdark to the surface world, possibly \"with the aid of Araumycos.\" Gasbide has no conscious knowledge of what Araumycos is, sensing only that it is part of the great celebration to come.

	"The circle mound of the growers is on the top terrace, near the cavern wall. The growers are the colony's farmers, ensuring the soil beneath the pools remains fertile and tending the fungi there.": "种植者的圆丘在顶层平台上，靠近洞壁。种植者是殖民地的农民，确保水池下面的土壤保持肥沃，并照料那里的真菌。",
	"The leader of the growers doesn't care much for Phylo's new ideas. But though it misses mass meldings, Hebopbe doesn't see Basidia's protests as worthy of concern.

	"This depression in the cavern floor is the main part of the myconid colony. The central circle mound was only recently created, and is now a kind of \"town square\" where all the grove's myconids gather for mass meldings. These have become rare, however, reserved for when Phylo wants to stoke the myconids' enthusiasm for the celebration that only those infected by Zuggtmoy know about. This leaves the uninfected confused but happy that something joyous is about to happen.": "洞底的这个洼地是菌类聚居地的主要部分。中央的圆丘是最近才创建的，现在是一种 \"城市广场\"，丛林中所有的霉菌都聚集在这里进行大规模的融合。然而，这已经变得很罕见了，只保留在菲洛想激起菌类对庆祝活动的热情时，只有那些被Zuggtmoy感染的人知道。这让未受感染的人感到困惑，但又为即将发生的快乐的事情感到高兴。",
	"Beyond the mud and mushrooms that spread across the cavern, a large, clear pool sits in the midst of the fungal grove. A central mound seems to be the only dry spot in sight, though a small cliff rises above the cavern floor far across the clearing, with giant mushrooms visible in the distance. Bioluminescent fungi trace strange constellations along the cavern's ceiling and walls, showing the darkness of the ravine and a mist-shrouded smaller cavern beyond.": "在遍布洞穴的泥浆和蘑菇之外，一个巨大而清澈的水池坐落在真菌丛林的中间。一个中央小丘似乎是眼前唯一干燥的地方，尽管一个小悬崖在空地上远远地耸立在洞底，远处可见巨大的蘑菇。生物发光的真菌沿着洞穴的天花板和墙壁描画出奇怪的星座，显示出峡谷的黑暗和外面雾气笼罩的小洞穴。",
	"The central mound is the base of the colony's two {@creature Myconid Sovereign||myconid sovereigns}, Phylo and Basidia.

	"Phylo invites the characters to stay as long as they wish, inviting them to explore and enjoy the many delights of Neverlight Grove. He politely asks that they avoid the eastern plateau because the Circle of Masters is preparing \"a wondrous and glorious surprise\" in the Garden of Welcome. Phylo offers to give them a peek the next day if they want. If Sarith is with the characters, he suggests they accept this offer, saying that keeping on the sovereign's good side will help the party in the long term. In truth, he is attempting to deliver the adventurers to Zuggtmoy.": "菲洛邀请这些人物在此停留，只要他们愿意，请他们探索并享受永光丛林的诸多乐趣。他礼貌地要求他们避开东部的高原，因为大师们正在欢迎花园准备 \"一个奇妙而光荣的惊喜\"。菲洛提出，如果他们愿意的话，可以在第二天让他们看一看。如果萨利斯和这些人物在一起，他建议他们接受这个提议，并说保持与君主的良好关系将长期帮助他们。事实上，他是想把冒险者们送到扎格莫伊那里。",
	"Phylo goes on about how \"the Great Seeder\" who lives beyond the garden can answer any questions they have. The sovereign describes this entity in favorable terms, using \"she\" and \"her\" as it does so. Because myconids have no concept of gender, this unusual speech is further indication of Phylo's madness. However, the sovereign dodges any question about who the Great Seeder actually is, saying it is important for the characters to experience her first hand.": "Phylo继续说，住在花园外的 \"伟大的播种者 \"可以回答他们的任何问题。主权者用有利的术语描述了这个实体，在描述时使用了 \"她 \"和 \"她\"。因为菌类没有性别的概念，这种不寻常的说话方式进一步表明了菲洛的疯狂。然而，君主回避了任何关于大播种者究竟是谁的问题，他说重要的是让人物亲身体验她。",
	"A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} is uncomfortable with Phylo's behavior. {@creature Stool|OotA} and {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} can easily discern that the harmony between Phylo and Basidia is off. At the earliest opportunity, Basidia volunteers to show the characters around, or finds another opportunity to rapport with them privately.": "成功的DC12智慧（（%0%））检查显示，（%1%）对Phylo的行为感到不舒服。{@creature Stool|OotA}和{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}可以很容易地看出Phylo和Basidia之间的和谐是不正常的。在最早的机会，Basidia自愿带着这些人物参观，或者找到另一个机会与他们私下融洽相处。",
	"When alone with the characters, Basidia warns them about staying in Neverlight Grove too long. It tells them another group of \"softers\" (the name myconids use for fleshy creatures) arrived not too many cycles ago and accepted Phylo's offer. They were taken to the Garden of Welcome and Basidia hasn't seen them since, nor has Phylo made any further mention of them (see \"Questions for the Sovereigns\"). Basidia also tells the characters that the Circle of Masters is taking most of the carcasses the Circle of Hunters bring in, and are sending groups of myconids outside the grove without telling anybody.": "当与这些人物单独在一起时，Basidia警告他们不要在Neverlight Grove呆得太久。它告诉他们，另一群 \"软体人\"（菌类对肉体生物的称呼）在不久前来到这里，接受了菲洛的提议。他们被带到了欢迎花园，此后Basidia再也没有见过他们，Phylo也没有再提过他们（见 \"对统治者的疑问\"）。Basidia还告诉角色们，\"大师圈 \"拿走了 \"猎人圈 \"带来的大部分尸体，并在不告诉任何人的情况下把一群群的菌类送到丛林外。",
	"If Basidia rapports with Sarith or any other non-myconid infected with Zuggtmoy's spores, it senses the alien nature of the demon lord's corruption. It can't identify Zuggtmoy's spores, but knows only that it has not encountered them before. This is unusual, Basidia tells the party, since most myconid sovereigns recognize all spores produced by myconids throughout the Underdark.": "如果Basidia与Sarith或任何其他感染了Zuggtmoy孢子的非真菌类动物建立了联系，它就会感觉到恶魔领主的腐败的异类性质。它无法识别扎格莫伊的孢子，只知道它以前没有遇到过它们。这很不寻常，巴西迪亚告诉大家，因为大多数霉菌君主都能认出整个暗黑世界的所有霉菌产生的孢子。",
	"If the characters ask the sovereigns to help them return to the surface world, both are apologetic that they know of no routes. However, Basidia notes that during its colony's migration, the many travelers from the surface world they encountered were mostly merchants on their way to or from Blingdenstone, Gracklstugh, or Menzoberranzan.": "如果人物要求君主帮助他们返回地表世界，两人都很抱歉地表示他们不知道任何路线。然而，Basidia指出，在其殖民地的迁移过程中，他们遇到的许多来自地表世界的旅行者大多是来往于Blingdenstone、Gracklstugh或Menzoberranzan的商人。",
	"If the adventurers ask the sovereigns about any drow in the area, Basidia tells them about a drow patrol that just recently arrived. However, Phylo immediately interrupts, telling the characters that the drow were here a few days ago, but left shortly after Phylo showed them the Garden of Welcome. A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that Basidia seems puzzled by Phylo's answer. If pressed, Basidia simply says it didn't know the drow had already left.": "如果冒险者们向君主们询问该地区是否有乌鸦，巴西迪亚会告诉他们最近刚到的一支乌鸦巡逻队。然而，菲洛立刻打断了他们，告诉他们这些乌鸦几天前还在这里，但在菲洛带他们看完欢迎花园后不久就离开了。成功通过DC12智慧（（%0%））检查后，发现巴西迪亚似乎对菲洛的回答感到疑惑。如果被逼问，巴西迪亚只是说它不知道乌鸦已经离开了。",
	"Basidia offers to give the party a guided tour of all the circles in areas 1 through 4, where it introduces them to the respective circle leaders, pointing out which leaders support it, and which ones support Sovereign Phylo. Basidia uses this time away from Phylo to express its fear that Phylo has contracted some sort of \"diseased spore.\" Basidia thinks that a clue to the spore's nature might be found in the Garden of Welcome. Basidia asks the characters to investigate the garden, fearing to do so itself in case it also falls victim to Phylo's disease.": "Basidia提出要带着党员参观1到4区的所有圈子，在那里向他们介绍各自的圈子领袖，指出哪些领袖支持它，哪些支持Sovereign Phylo。Basidia利用这段远离Phylo的时间，表达了它对Phylo感染了某种 \"患病孢子 \"的担心。Basidia认为，在欢迎花园中可能会发现关于孢子性质的线索。Basidia要求角色们调查这个花园，但又害怕自己这样做，以防它也成为Phylo疾病的受害者。",
	"As a sign of friendship, Basidia gives the characters a moldy scroll case containing a {@item scroll of protection} against fiends. Basidia promises an additional reward (see \"Treasure\") if the characters investigate the Garden of Welcome on its behalf. Basidia can also brew potions out of the different molds and fungi in the grove, storing them in hollow gourd-like mushrooms. Basidia can craft a common or uncommon potion in eight hours, or a rare potion in two days.": "作为友谊的象征，Basidia给了人物一个发霉的卷轴箱，里面有一个对抗恶魔的（%0%）。Basidia承诺，如果人物代表它调查欢迎花园，还会有额外的奖励（见 \"宝藏\"）。Basidia还可以用小树林中不同的霉菌和真菌来酿造药水，将它们储存在空心葫芦状的蘑菇中。Basidia可以在八小时内制作出普通或不普通的药水，或者在两天内制作出稀有药水。",
	"If the characters complete Basidia's quest, the myconid sovereign digs up a small box buried in the earth and gives it to them. The box contains curiosities Basidia has collected from dead travelers over the years. The box is unlocked, made of fine wood inlaid with silver, and worth 25 gp by itself. It contains three amethysts (100 gp each), four small diamonds (50 gp each), and one large diamond (500 gp).": "如果角色们完成了巴西迪亚的任务，霉菌君主就会挖出一个埋在土里的小盒子，并把它交给他们。盒子里装着Basidia多年来从死去的旅行者那里收集的奇珍异宝。盒子没有上锁，由镶嵌着银子的上等木头制成，本身就价值25金币。里面有三颗紫水晶（每颗100金币），四颗小钻石（每颗50金币），和一颗大钻石（500金币）。",
	"If the characters kill the grick alpha, the umber hulk, or the shambling mound in the Fungal Wilds and bring the carcasses to Basidia, the sovereign rewards each character with a {@item potion of greater healing} stored in a hollow gourd-like mushroom.": "如果角色们在真菌荒野中杀死了格里克-阿尔法、黄褐色绿巨人或晃动的土丘，并将尸体带到巴西迪亚，君主会奖励每个角色一个（%0%），储存在一个空心葫芦状的蘑菇中。",
	"This circle mound is devoted to sporing new myconids. Freshly spored myconids are only a few inches tall and have no awareness, but they grow quickly into myconid sprouts.": "这个圆丘专门用来孢子新菌种。新生的孢子菌只有几英寸高，没有意识，但它们很快就会长成孢子菌的芽。",
	"The circle leader is infected by Zuggtmoy's madness. It is always swaying to music only it can hear, but those in rapport with Yrberop can hear a faint echo of its internal cacophony. Yrberop is enthusiastic about Phylo's plan to spread the happiness brought by the Great Seeder to everyone in the Underdark and beyond. For that to happen, the colony needs many more sprouts.": "圈子里的领袖被Zuggtmoy的疯狂所感染。它总是在只有它能听到的音乐中摇摆，但那些与Yrberop关系融洽的人可以听到它内部的微弱回声。Yrberop热衷于Phylo的计划，即把伟大的播种者带来的快乐传播给暗黑世界和其他地方的每个人。为了实现这一目标，殖民地需要更多的萌芽。",
	"If the characters confer with Basidia, {@creature Stool|OotA}, or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA}, these myconids tell them this push to expand the population is unusual, given the balance that the myconids have endeavored to maintain in Neverlight Grove for so long.": "如果人物与Basidia、{@creature Stool|OotA}或{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}商议，这些菌类就会告诉他们，鉴于菌类长期以来努力在Neverlight Grove维持的平衡，这种扩大人口的推动是不寻常的。",
	"Yrberop loses track of any conversation after a short while and begins talking to the newly spored myconids instead. Characters who communicate with Yrberop in rapport and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can make out some of the words and impressions in the circle leader's lullaby. It sings of the Great Seeder and \"her\" wedding to the Great Body, and how every myconid is invited, bringing joy to all in the world below and above.": "Yrberop在很短的时间内就失去了任何对话的踪迹，转而开始与新宠的菌类交谈。与Yrberop默契地交流，并在DC13智慧（（%0%））检查中成功的角色可以听出圈子领袖的摇篮曲中的一些话和印象。它唱的是伟大的播种者和 \"她 \"与伟大的身体的婚礼，以及每一个菌类是如何被邀请的，给下面和上面的世界带来欢乐。",
	"Behind the myconid breeding grounds is a narrow path leading up to a plateau and the Garden of Welcome (area 5).

	"This circle leader is loyal to Basidia. Frequent trips outside the grove have allowed Rasharoo to notice the changes in Phylo and the entire colony more sharply, and it now trusts nothing and no one except Basidia. Its paranoia isn't the product of Zuggtmoy's corruption, however, but of the rising madness gripping the Underdark from the intrusion of the demon lords. If the characters demonstrate sympathy with Basidia or if the sovereign is with them, Rasharoo discloses it has a few escape plans ready, and has nutrient caches hidden along exit tunnels in case Basidia decides it is better to abandon the grove and return to a nomadic lifestyle.": "这个圈子的领导者对巴西迪亚很忠诚。经常到小树林以外的地方去，让Rasharoo更敏锐地注意到Phylo和整个殖民地的变化，它现在除了Basidia之外，什么都不相信，也不相信任何人。然而，它的偏执并不是Zuggtmoy腐败的产物，而是由于恶魔领主的入侵而使暗黑世界的疯狂程度上升。如果人物表现出对巴西迪亚的同情，或者君主和他们在一起，拉沙鲁就会透露它已经准备好了一些逃跑计划，并在出口通道上藏有营养品，以防巴西迪亚决定放弃丛林，回到游牧生活中去。",
	"Characters can climb the eastern corner of the top terrace to reach area 5, and Rasharoo gladly helps them if they head to the Garden of Welcome at Basidia's request.": "角色们可以爬上顶层露台的东边一角到达5号区域，如果他们应Basidia的要求前往欢迎花园，Rasharoo很乐意帮助他们。",
	"Among the myconids, Rasharoo and its circle are the adventurers' best hope of finding a way back to the surface. Rasharoo knows many promising paths, but since myconids have no interest in the sunlit world, it has never followed them all the way there. The circle leader helps the characters only after they complete Basidia's quest, assigning one of its explorers to guide the characters to their destination.": "在菌类中，Rasharoo和它的圈子是冒险家们找到返回地面的最好希望。拉沙鲁知道许多有希望的道路，但由于菌类对阳光世界没有兴趣，它从来没有一直跟随他们到那里。圈子领袖只有在人物完成巴西迪亚的任务后才会帮助他们，指派它的一个探险家来引导人物到达目的地。",
	"Phylo has converted this unused terrace for the exciting new ideas that Zuggtmoy has inspired in it—ideas that are \"too incredible\" for the rest of the colony to absorb at once. This so-called garden is just a sample of the horrors that Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, intends to bring to the Underdark.": "菲洛将这个闲置的露台改造成Zuggtmoy在其中激发的令人兴奋的新想法--这些想法 \"太不可思议了\"，殖民地的其他成员无法一下子吸收。这个所谓的花园只是Zuggtmoy，真菌的恶魔女王，打算带给地下世界的恐怖的一个样本。",
	"This plateau rises higher than the other terraces, screened by a natural fence of soaring zurkhwood stalks. Muffled murmuring can be heard from atop the plateau.": "这片高原比其他梯田高，被高耸的紫檀树杆组成的天然栅栏挡住。从高原上可以听到低沉的杂音。",
	"The newest circle in the colony, the Circle of Masters is formed exclusively by myconids touched by Zuggtmoy. These myconids share Phylo's vision of happiness spread through Zuggtmoy's spores, experimenting on the carcasses brought to them by the hunters—or on live prisoners they hunt in their own expeditions outside the grove. Their mound lies at the center of an obscene garden.": "殖民地的最新圈子，\"大师之圈 \"是由被Zuggtmoy触动的菌类专门组成。这些菌类分享菲洛通过Zuggtmoy的孢子传播的幸福观，在猎人带来的尸体上做实验，或者在他们自己在丛林外的探险中猎取的活人身上做实验。他们的土丘位于一个淫秽花园的中心。",
	"Mutated by Zuggtmoy's spores, the circle leader has become an abomination. No longer recognizable as a myconid, it looks like a fungal larva slithering along the ground. Mold and lichen grow in hypnotic patterns along its ringed stalk, and it puffs clouds of spores from a slit resembling a mouth. It can use this orifice to actually speak, rather than depending on rapport spores. It no longer attends melds with the other leaders, instead sending its representative.": "被Zuggtmoy的孢子变异后，圆环首领已经变成了一个可憎的东西。它不再是可识别的菌类，看起来像一个在地面上滑行的真菌幼虫。霉菌和地衣沿着它的环状柄以催眠的方式生长，它从一个类似于嘴巴的缝隙中喷出孢子云。它可以用这个口子真正地说话，而不是依靠和睦的孢子。它不再参加与其他领导人的融合，而是派出它的代表。",
	"As the characters enter the garden, they make a frightening discovery.": "当人物进入花园时，他们有了一个可怕的发现。",
	"The low muttering grows louder as you reach the top, turning into a symphony of moans, cries, and hisses. The only light comes from a few glowing mushrooms along the edge, but even in the gloom, you can't miss the source of the sounds. The heads of creatures of a dozen humanoid Underdark races peek from the ground, mold and fungi growing around them.": "当你到达山顶时，低沉的咕哝声越来越大，变成了呻吟、哭喊和嘶嘶声的交响乐。唯一的光亮来自边缘的几个发光的蘑菇，但即使在阴暗中，你也不会错过声音的来源。十几个人形暗黑种族的生物的头颅从地面上探出，霉菌和真菌在它们周围生长。",
	"One voice calls out loudly in Undercommon—a female drow fighting to speak. \"Please... for your gods of light... kill me!\" She manages to stir within her living grave, raising a spider medallion half-embedded in the bloated growth that was once her hand. Half her face is rotten and pustulate, a bed for the sprouting of scores of tiny mushrooms. \"The Great Seeder... trap... she's here... the Lady of Decay... Zuggtmoy...\"": "有一个声音在地下城大声呼唤，一个女乌鸦奋力说话。\"请......为了你们的光明之神......杀了我！\" 她设法在她的活人墓里搅动，举起一个蜘蛛勋章，半截埋在曾经是她的手的臃肿的东西里。她的半边脸已经腐烂和化脓，成为几十个小蘑菇发芽的床。\"伟大的播种者......陷阱......她在这里......腐烂的女士...... Zuggtmoy...\"",
	"The drow is Xinaya, a young acolyte of Lolth. She was leading a routine scouting patrol out of Velkynvelve before Ilvara contacted her with a {@spell sending} spell. The patrol was ordered to search near the grove for the characters, anticipating that the escapees might seek shelter among the peaceful mushroom folk.": "这个乌鸦是辛纳亚，是洛尔思的年轻圣徒。在伊尔瓦拉用{@spell sending}的法术联系她之前，她正带领一支常规的侦察巡逻队离开维尔基维尔。巡逻队被命令在小树林附近搜索这些人物，预计逃跑者可能会在和平的蘑菇民中寻求庇护。",
	"Upon her arrival, Xinaya made the mistake of accepting Phylo's invitation to visit the Garden of Welcome, where she and her patrol quickly became victims of the myconids' madness. She begs the adventurers to end her suffering and warn her people about the presence of the Demon Queen of Fungi in the Underdark, unaware of the madness that has already erupted in Menzoberranzan and throughout the Underdark (see {@adventure chapter 15|OotA|14}). Xinaya is too far gone to be saved, and any amount of damage kills her.": "欣亚到达后，错误地接受了菲洛的邀请，参观了欢迎花园，她和她的巡逻队很快就成为了菌类疯狂的受害者。她恳求冒险者们结束她的痛苦，并警告她的人民，地下城中出现了真菌的恶魔女王，她不知道在门索布兰山和整个地下城已经爆发了疯狂的力量（见（%0%））。辛纳亚已经走得太远了，无法被拯救，任何程度的伤害都会杀死她。",
	"After the characters speak with Xinaya, {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} appears (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}). The master of the foul garden takes delight in toying with trespassers.": "在人物与辛纳亚对话后，{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}出现（见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}）。肮脏花园的主人以玩弄闯入者为乐。",
	"The moans of the garden's victims suddenly take on a new tone of fear as something moves across the foul ground. A disgusting larval creature rises up before you, showing only vestigial fungal growths that hint that it might once have been a myconid.": "当有东西在肮脏的地面上移动时，花园里受害者的呻吟声突然有了一种新的恐惧语气。一个恶心的幼虫在你面前升起，只露出残余的真菌生长，暗示它可能曾经是一个菌类。",
	"\"Welcome, travelers.\" The aberrant myconid's voice gurgles and spits as it speaks both aloud and in your minds at once. \"Are you here for the wedding rehearsal? Friends of the bride or her intended? No matter! Let the love of the Great Seeder embrace you as you become one with her chosen, the Great Body!\"": "\"欢迎，旅行者们。\" 这个反常的霉菌的声音咕噜咕噜地吐着，它同时在你们的头脑中大声说话。\"你们是来参加婚礼彩排的吗？新娘的朋友还是她的意中人？没有关系! 让伟大的播种者的爱拥抱你们，因为你们将与她所选择的伟大的身体融为一体！\"",

	"Any character reduced to 0 hit points in this encounter is knocked {@condition unconscious} rather than killed.

	"The tableau of the mock wedding is replaced by a vision of the inside of a great tower. Spiraling stairs and balconies are carved into its walls, with the interior lit by phosphorescent patches of mold growing in whorls. In the center of the open space floats a humanoid figure, womanlike in form, but made entirely of fungi and mold.

	"When Zuggtmoy arrived in the Underdark, she was immediately drawn to Neverlight Grove and its fungal riches. She cultivated Yggmorgus, a mushroom of titanic proportions, from the rich, rotting soil.": "当Zuggtmoy来到暗黑世界时，她立刻被永光丛林和它的真菌财富所吸引。她从肥沃的腐烂土壤中培育出Yggmorgus，一种具有巨大比例的蘑菇。",
	"Conveniently secluded from the rest of the Underdark, Yggmorgus is a perfect base of operations for the Demon Queen of Fungi. She has completely enthralled Phylo, and the hapless sovereign is growing a myconid and spore servant army for her. Zuggtmoy has also become aware of Araumycos, the largest fungal life form—and possibly the largest creature of any kind—in the world. Araumycos is a vast fungus colony with a single mind, which fills the caverns and tunnels of the Underdark in an area the size of the High Forest. Araumycos is so interwoven with the fabric of the world that control of it would grant Zuggtmoy nearly unlimited power in her new home.": "Yggmorgus与暗黑世界的其他地方相隔甚远，是真菌恶魔女王的完美行动基地。她已经完全迷住了菲洛，而这位无能的君主正在为她培养一支菌类和孢子仆从军。Zuggtmoy也意识到了Araumycos，它是世界上最大的真菌生命体，而且可能是任何种类的最大生物。Araumycos是一个巨大的真菌群，它只有一个思想，充斥着地下世界的洞穴和隧道，面积相当于高级森林。Araumycos与世界的结构交织在一起，对它的控制将赋予Zuggtmoy在她的新家几乎无限的权力。",
	"Though Yggmorgus can't be seen clearly from the main cavern of Neverlight Grove, the unholy lights and sounds there can be discerned and sometimes even felt. Characters who ask the myconids about it receive mixed responses. Sovereign Phylo and those loyal to it enter a state of near bliss when they speak about Yggmorgus, as if it was a paradise. {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its followers give wary answers. Phylo's secrecy means that they aren't sure what lies beyond the ravine.": "虽然从永光丛林的主洞中无法清楚地看到伊格摩格斯，但那里的邪恶之光和声音可以被辨别出来，有时甚至可以感觉到。向菌类问起它的人物得到了不同的回应。主权者菲洛和那些忠于它的人在谈到Yggmorgus时进入了一种近乎幸福的状态，仿佛它是一个天堂。{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的追随者给出了警惕的回答。Phylo的保密性意味着他们不确定峡谷之外有什么。",

	"You have no clear reference to judge the towering mushroom's size at this distance. Thousands of smaller fungi cling to the main stalk, which itself splits into several lesser stalks, each long enough with a cap big enough to be the top of a great tower.

An eerie luminescence pours through slitted windows carved into the trunk, with the same cacophony of atonal music heard earlier echoing within. A stench of rot and decay wraps around you, seemingly threatening to penetrate your flesh and pervade your soul.": "在这个距离上，你没有明确的参照物来判断这个高耸的蘑菇的大小。数以千计的较小的真菌附着在主茎上，主茎本身又分裂成几个较小的茎，每个茎都足够长，菌盖大到足以成为一座大塔的顶端。主茎周围的洞穴地面被真菌的地毯所覆盖。阴森恐怖的光亮透过刻在树干上的狭长窗口，与之前听到的无调音乐一样，在里面回荡。一股腐烂的臭味包裹着你，似乎要穿透你的肉体，弥漫你的灵魂。",

Other than a face, long white hair, and a breastplate, it is impossible to distinguish where the drow ends, and the rot and fungi consuming him begins. The drow feebly thrashes, his screams rising ever higher in pitch, until he locks eyes with one of the characters and abruptly stops screaming. A brief moment of lucidity replaces his terror, even as his eyes roll back into his head in some kind of bizarre euphoria as he goes limp and slowly sinks back down into the fungal muck. Characters witnessing this must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of madness.": "仿佛是在提示，最靠近人物的一个肿块冒出了气泡并爆裂。一团密密麻麻的孢子和漆黑发臭的液体向外爆炸，甚至当角色们听到一声痛苦和恐怖的刺耳尖叫时。在爆裂留下的麻点内，是辛纳亚的一个乌鸦侦察员--或者至少是他的遗体。除了一张脸、长长的白发和一件胸甲之外，不可能分辨出哪里是乌鸦的终点，哪里是吞噬他的腐烂和真菌的起点。乌鸦无力地挣扎着，他的尖叫声越来越高，直到他与其中一个人物对视，突然停止了尖叫。短暂的清醒取代了他的恐惧，甚至他的眼睛在某种奇异的兴奋中滚回了他的脑袋，他瘫软下来，慢慢地沉入了真菌的泥沼中。目睹这一切的人物必须在DC13智慧救赎中成功，否则就会获得一级的疯狂。",

	"Dozens of spore servants and myconids respond to Zuggtmoy's telepathic call if their mistress is in danger, attacking the characters heedless of their own safety. Any attack that successfully deals damage to Zuggtmoy damages her gown, driving the demon queen into a rage to attack the intruders.": "如果他们的女主人处于危险之中，几十个孢子仆人和菌类会对Zuggtmoy的心灵感应做出反应，攻击角色，而不顾他们自己的安全。任何成功地对扎格莫伊造成伤害的攻击都会破坏她的袍子，使恶魔女王陷入愤怒，攻击入侵者。",
	"Leaving the myconid enclave is easier than finding it. Whether they politely avoid Phylo's invitation or flee for their lives and sanity from the Demon Queen of Fungi, the adventurers can easily receive the aid of {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and the circles still loyal to it. Where the characters go next is up to them—a decision dependent upon where they have been, the pursuing drow, and whatever they have acquired (food, potions, treasure from the doomed drow patrol, and so on) during their visit to the grove.": "离开菌类飞地比找到它更容易。无论他们是礼貌地回避菲洛的邀请，还是为了自己的生命和理智而逃离真菌魔后，冒险者都可以轻易地得到（%0%）和仍然忠于它的圈子的援助。人物的下一步去向由他们决定--这取决于他们去过的地方、追捕的乌鸦，以及他们在访问小树林时获得的任何东西（食物、药水、来自注定失败的乌鸦巡逻队的财宝，等等）。",
	"Depending on how the characters interacted with the myconids and what tasks they accomplished for their hosts, they might depart in the company of a myconid guide, or even two whole circles of myconids fleeing the grove before Zuggtmoy's madness takes them. Sovereign Phylo doesn't stop the characters or {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} from leaving, still convinced the cause it embraces is one of joy and prosperity for its people.": "根据人物与霉菌的互动情况以及他们为主人完成的任务，他们可能会在一个霉菌向导的陪伴下离开，甚至是在Zuggtmoy的疯狂带走他们之前，有两整圈的霉菌逃离丛林。主权者Phylo并没有阻止人物或{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}的离开，仍然相信它所拥护的事业是为其人民带来快乐和繁荣的。",
	"In all probability, the characters leave the fungal grove with dire and horrific news. They have witnessed the effect a single demon lord can have on the Material Plane—and they realize far more and worse things are coming.": "在所有的可能性中，角色们带着可怕的消息离开真菌丛林。他们已经目睹了一个恶魔领主对物质世界的影响--他们意识到更多更糟糕的事情即将发生。",
	"Regardless of how many battles the characters might have had inside Neverlight Grove, discovering that a demon lord is on the loose on the Material Plane is a major revelation. Moreover, if they were in Sloobludop to witness the rise of Demogorgon, they now know that more than one demon lord is at large, hinting at the magnitude of the threat.": "不管角色们在永光丛林里经历了多少次战斗，发现一个恶魔领主在物质世界里逍遥法外是一个重大的启示。此外，如果他们在斯洛布洛普见证了德摩根的崛起，他们现在知道不止一个恶魔领主在逃，暗示了威胁的严重性。",
	"If the adventurers simply passed through the grove and enjoyed the hospitality of the doomed myconids, they leave with only suspicions about their odd behavior, which can help them later in piecing together the greater mystery in the Underdark.": "如果冒险家们只是简单地穿过小树林，享受着注定失败的菌类的款待，那么他们离开时只能对它们的古怪行为产生怀疑，这可以帮助他们以后拼凑出地下城中更大的谜团。",
	"If the adventurers learned nothing about the presence of Zuggtmoy or her plans, you might pass the information on to them by having a friendly myconid such as {@creature Stool|OotA} or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} come to them just as they are leaving. The myconid enters rapport and shows them a vision of the Garden of Welcome and Yggmorgus, saying these images come from the minds of other myconids in the grove, and asking what these \"strange dreams\" mean.": "如果冒险者们没有了解到关于祖格莫伊的存在或她的计划，你可以在他们即将离开时，让一个友好的菌类如（%0%）或（%1%）来找他们，把信息传递给他们。霉菌进入默契状态，向他们展示了迎宾花园和Yggmorgus的幻象，说这些图像来自小树林里其他霉菌的思想，并询问这些 \"奇怪的梦 \"意味着什么。",
	"Blingdenstone, once called the City of Speaking Stones, is a deep gnome settlement founded more than two millennia ago. The deep gnomes, insular and secretive by nature, care little about histories and legacies, and thus most of the ruined city's past is lost to time.": "Blingdenstone，曾经被称为 \"会说话的石头之城\"，是两千多年前建立的深层地精定居点。深层地精，生性孤僻而神秘，对历史和遗产不屑一顾，因此，这座废墟城市的大部分过去都消失在时间中。",
	"For centuries, Blingdenstone remained hidden and isolated from the rest of the Underdark, thanks to a combination of misdirection and magic. It wasn't until they provided shelter to a drow exile named Drizzt Do'Urden that the deep gnomes began to take a more active interest in the world outside their caverns. Perceiving the threat the drow represented to all the peoples of the Underdark, the deep gnomes abandoned their isolation when they came to the defense of the dwarves of Mithral Hall, defeating an invading drow force from Menzoberranzan.": "几个世纪以来，由于误导和魔法的结合，布林登石一直隐藏起来，与暗黑世界的其他地方隔绝。直到他们为一个名叫德里兹-多乌登（Drizzt Do'Urden）的鸦人流亡者提供了庇护，深层地精才开始对他们洞穴外的世界产生了更积极的兴趣。当深层地精意识到鸦人对暗黑世界所有人民的威胁时，他们放弃了与世隔绝的状态，为米特拉尔厅的矮人提供了保护，击败了一支来自门索布兰赞的鸦人入侵部队。",
	"This alliance, however, would spell Blingdenstone's doom. The vengeful drow bided their time, rebuilt their forces, and sent their armies out to strike back hard against the svirfneblin, returning in great force to lay siege to Blingdenstone. The deep gnomes were no match for the drow army. Thousands of svirfneblin were slaughtered, and those survivors who didn't escape to Mithral Hall or the surface world were dragged back in chains to Menzoberranzan as slaves.": "然而，这个联盟将宣告布林登斯顿的灭亡。复仇的鸦人等待时机，重建他们的部队，并派出他们的军队对svirfneblin进行猛烈的反击，以巨大的力量返回，围攻Blingdenstone。深海地精们不是鸦人军队的对手。数以千计的svirfneblin被屠杀，而那些没有逃到Mithral Hall或地表世界的幸存者则被锁链拖回Menzoberranzan作为奴隶。",
	"Within the past decade or so, the deep gnomes have returned to reclaim, resettle, and rebuild their city. The ultimate success of their efforts, however, hangs by a slender thread. Most of the ruined city is a dangerous place and remains closed off, with tunnels and chambers barricaded with gates or deliberately caused cave-ins. The svirfneblin must contend with incursions by wererat squatters, insane elementals, ghosts, and a plague of invading oozes controlled by {@creature the Pudding King|OotA}—a mad deep gnome under the influence of the demon lord Juiblex. Before they can offer the party any help, the deep gnomes likely need some themselves.": "在过去十年左右的时间里，深山地精们回到了这里，收回、重新安置并重建他们的城市。然而，他们的努力最终能否成功，还取决于一个细微的问题。废墟上的大部分地方都很危险，仍然被封闭着，隧道和房间都被门挡住，或者故意造成洞穴。svirfneblin必须应对wererat squatters、疯狂的元素、鬼魂的入侵，以及由{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}--一个受恶魔领主Juiblex影响的疯狂的深层地精--控制的入侵ozes瘟疫。在他们能够为党提供任何帮助之前，深层地精很可能自己也需要一些帮助。",
	"Blingdenstone is an obvious destination for characters seeking refuge from their drow pursuers and a way out of the Underdark. The deep gnomes continue to have regular dealings with the surface world.": "Blingdenstone是一个明显的目的地，可以让那些寻求庇护、躲避乌鸦追捕者和离开暗黑世界的角色。深海地精继续与地面世界保持着定期的交易。",
	"Among the party's fellow escapees, the deep gnome {@creature Jimjar|OotA} is the most enthusiastic about visiting Blingdenstone, and he can lead the adventurers there. {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA} also know the way, but they are noticeably less willing to go to the settlement because of the fear and shame they feel regarding their lycanthropic affliction. The shield dwarf scout {@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA} isn't sure how to reach the gnome settlement, but is in favor of going there if it offers a route to the surface or to Gauntlgrym. If the characters allow {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} (the sentient gelatinous cube from \"{@area The Oozing Temple|0ca|x}\" in chapter 2) to accompany them, it feels a certain pull toward Blingdenstone, and is curious enough to guide the characters there.": "在队伍的同伴中，深山地精（%0%）对访问布林登石最热心，他可以带领冒险者前往。(1%）和（2%）也知道路，但他们明显不太愿意去定居点，因为他们对自己的狼人病感到恐惧和羞耻。盾牌矮人侦察员（%3%）不确定如何到达地精定居点，但如果那里有一条通往地表或Gauntlgrym的路线，他就会赞成去那里。如果角色允许{@creature Glabbagool|OotA}（第二章\"{@area The Oozing Temple|0ca|x} \"中的有生命的胶状立方体）陪伴他们，它对布林登斯通有一定的吸引力，并好奇地引导角色去那里。",
	"The svirfneblin settlement is a haven for the characters. For good reason, the deep gnomes rarely allow drow into Blingdenstone, and only then with a heavily armed escort. A drow character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to enter escorted. However, if any deep gnomes are traveling with the party, having them vouch for the drow allows the escort to be waived at your discretion.": "svirfneblin定居点是这些人物的天堂。出于充分的理由，深山地精们很少允许乌鸦进入布林登斯通，而且只有在全副武装的护卫下才允许。鸦人角色必须在DC15魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中成功，才能在护送下进入。然而，如果有任何深层地精与队伍同行，让他们为乌鸦担保，就可以根据你的决定放弃护送。",
	"The party's drow pursuers won't attempt to follow the characters into Blingdenstone. The party's pursuit level (see \"{@area Drow Pursuit|078|x}\" in chapter 2) doesn't change while they are in the svirfneblin settlement.": "追捕他们的乌鸦人不会试图跟随他们进入布林登石。当他们在斯维尔芬林定居点时，队伍的追击等级（见第二章的\"（%0%）\"）不会改变。",
	"If the party's pursuit level is 3 or higher when they arrive at Blingdenstone, Ilvara and her party are watching the tunnels leaving the settlement.

	"Blingdenstone has a reputation for being a dangerous ruin inhabited only by monsters and other undesirables. Others think of it as a budding settlement well on its way to recovery. Once the characters reach the gates, they can see that the truth lies somewhere in between.": "Blingdenstone的名声是一个危险的废墟，只有怪物和其他不受欢迎的人居住在这里。其他人则认为它是一个正在萌芽的定居点，正在走向复兴。一旦人物到达大门，他们就会发现，真相就在两者之间。",
	"The characters must prove their goodwill to the deep gnomes before they are allowed inside. Once the characters win the gnomes' trust, they are welcomed into Inner Blingdenstone, and to what food and comfort the locals can readily provide.": "在被允许进入之前，角色们必须向深处的地精们证明他们的善意。一旦人物赢得了地精的信任，他们就会被欢迎进入内布林登斯通，并获得当地人可以随时提供的食物和安慰。",
	"Deep gnomes are a dour lot, reserved and careful in their dealings with outsiders. They make the assumption that every non-svirfneblin means to do them harm—which is understandable given their history. They speak softly in caves and tunnels where sound carries, eyes darting furtively, looking for signs of danger.": "深海地精是一个沉闷的群体，在与外人打交道时，他们保留并谨慎行事。他们假设每一个非精灵族人都想伤害他们--鉴于他们的历史，这一点是可以理解的。他们在有声音的洞穴和隧道里轻声说话，眼睛鬼鬼祟祟地闪动着，寻找危险的迹象。",
	"Despite their harsh outlook, svirfneblin are still gnomes, and many are as benevolent and joyful as their surface cousins. They reveal these aspects most easily among their own kind, and to those they come to trust.": "尽管前景严峻，但svirfneblin仍然是地精，而且许多人和他们的表亲一样仁慈和快乐。他们在自己的同类中，以及在他们信任的人面前，最容易透露出这些方面。",
	"The svirfneblin assign defined roles to each gender but hold females and males in equal standing. It is ancient custom for there to be both a king and a queen with equal responsibilities. Svirfneblin males are hunters, explorers, laborers, and warriors, while females are managers, judges, politicians, and caretakers. Deep gnomes sometimes forget this is not the case with other races, and that males are capable of careful thought just as much as females can fight.": "svirfneblin人给每个性别分配了明确的角色，但认为女性和男性地位平等。古老的习俗是有一个国王和一个王后，负有同等责任。Svirfneblin的男性是猎人、探险家、劳动者和战士，而女性是管理者、法官、政治家和看护人。深度地精有时会忘记其他种族的情况并非如此，男性能够仔细思考，就像女性能够战斗一样。",
	"The general attitude of deep gnomes toward strangers is hostile—not necessarily opposed, but deeply suspicious. This attitude can be shifted to indifferent and then friendly as the characters help the svirfneblin openly (see \"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "深山地精对陌生人的一般态度是敌对的--不一定是反对，而是深深地怀疑。这种态度可以转变为冷漠，然后随着人物公开帮助svirfneblin而变得友好（见《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中的\"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\"）。",
	"Some deeds in Blingdenstone reward the characters with an automatic attitude shift, while others require a DC 15 group Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the group check succeeds, the attitude of the svirfneblin shifts by one. If characters are rude or act in a way to make the deep gnomes more suspicious toward them, they must also make another group check. If this group check fails, the deep gnomes' attitude worsens by one.": "在布林登斯通的一些行为会使人物的态度自动转变，而其他行为则需要DC15的群体魅力（（%0%））检查。如果团体检定成功，svirfneblin的态度会转变一个。如果角色无礼或者行为方式让深海地精对他们更加怀疑，他们也必须进行另一次团体检查。如果这个团体检查失败，深海地精的态度会恶化一个。",

	"Although not truly organized, the ghosts of the svirfneblin killed during the drow attack are an undeniable presence. The settlers have been wise enough to mark haunted burrows off from their reclamation plans. But as new svirfneblin arrive and need accommodation, space is starting to become a problem.

	"The so-called Pudding King holds court in the deepest sections of Blingdenstone.

When he reaches 0 hit points, he shrieks as he dissolves into a dense puddle of goo. Read the following boxed text as he expires:": "当一个或多个角色接近到（%0%）的范围内时，他疯狂地大笑，因为他撕掉了他的人形伪装，变成了一个渗水体。当他的命中率达到0时，他嘶吼着溶入一滩浓密的粘液中。在他死后，请阅读下面的方框内的文字。",

	"With {@creature the Pudding King|OotA} gone, the oozes lose their organization, but they are still too many and the svirfneblin sound the call to retreat. Three {@creature galeb duhr} led by the ghost of Burrow Warden Jadger arrive to take the characters to safety. If the svirfneblin of Blingdenstone didn't already have a friendly attitude, they become friendly toward the characters after the battle.": "随着{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}的消失，ozes失去了他们的组织，但他们仍然太多，svirfneblin发出了撤退的号召。由洞穴守护者贾德格的鬼魂带领的三个{@creature galeb duhr}到达，将角色带到安全地带。如果Blingdenstone的svirfneblin还没有友好的态度的话，他们在战斗后对人物变得友好了。",
	"Back in Diggermattock Hall, the gnome leaders make good on their promise, giving the characters a {@item stone of controlling earth elementals} along with the gratitude of their people.": "回到迪格马托克大厅，地精首领兑现了他们的承诺，给了人物一个{@item stone of controlling earth elementals}以及他们人民的感谢。",
	"If the characters participated in the battle, they gain a special award of 200 XP each.": "如果角色参加了战斗，他们会获得每人200XP的特别奖励。",
	"The characters can leave Blingdenstone as heroes of the svirfneblin. If they express interest in visiting other Underdark locations, the deep gnomes give them whatever help they can, including placing them in a caravan to Gracklstugh or Neverlight Grove. If the characters ask for help reaching the surface world, the gnomes guiding them to a tunnel that leads there (eventually). They also provide enough food, water, and other basic supplies for the party's journey.": "这些角色可以作为svirfneblin的英雄离开Blingdenstone。如果他们表示有兴趣访问其他暗黑世界的地点，深渊地精会给他们提供一切帮助，包括将他们安排在前往Gracklstugh或Neverlight Grove的商队中。如果角色要求帮助他们到达地表世界，地精们会引导他们到一条通往那里的隧道（最终）。他们还提供足够的食物、水和其他基本用品，供队伍旅行使用。",
	"The characters achieve a great victory if they defeat {@creature the Pudding King|OotA}, but their victory is incomplete. {@creature The Pudding King|OotA}'s death is a small setback for Juiblex, and the demon lord might send another minion to command the remaining oozes in Blingdenstone until they are destroyed.": "人物如果打败了{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}就取得了伟大的胜利，但他们的胜利是不完整的。{@creature The Pudding King|OotA}的死亡对朱布利克斯来说是一个小小的挫折，恶魔领主可能会派另一个爪牙来指挥布林登斯通的剩余奥兹人，直到它们被消灭。",
	"The \"banquet\" {@creature the Pudding King|OotA} referred to is the demonic rite of domination through which Zuggtmoy plans to transform the Underdark into her new abyssal domain.

	"This chapter marks the midpoint of {@i Out of the Abyss} and sees the characters finally make their way out of the Underdark. Before their final push to freedom, however, the vengeful drow pursuing the adventurers catch up to them, intent on dragging them back to their domain of perpetual darkness.": "这一章是{@i Out of the Abyss}的中点，看到人物终于走出了暗黑世界。然而，在他们最后冲向自由之前，追捕冒险者的复仇的乌鸦追上了他们，打算把他们拖回他们永远的黑暗领域。",
	"If they survive this final confrontation, the characters reach the surface in a place of your choosing. After all their arduous adventures, they are finally safe to return to their homes, and must say goodbye to many of the NPCs who've been traveling with them. Though the characters don't yet know it, their exploits in the Underdark will bring them to the attention of the dwarves of Gauntlgrym, setting the stage for {@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7} and a new call to adventure.": "如果他们在这最后的对抗中幸存下来，角色们就会在你选择的地方到达地面。在经历了所有艰辛的冒险之后，他们终于可以安全地回到自己的家园，并且必须和许多与他们一起旅行的NPC说再见了。尽管角色们还不知道，他们在暗黑世界的探索将使他们引起Gauntlgrym矮人的注意，为{@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}和新的冒险召唤创造了条件。",
	"By the time they reach this point, the characters should be at least 7th level, having overcome countless challenges in their wild and dangerous journey through the locations described in chapters 1 through 6. They should also have reached a terrible conclusion: multiple demon lords of the Abyss are at large in the Underdark and could soon threaten the surface world.": "到了这一步，人物应该至少有7级，在穿越第1章到第6章所述地点的狂野而危险的旅程中克服了无数的挑战。他们还应该得出一个可怕的结论：深渊的多个恶魔领主在暗黑世界中逍遥法外，并可能很快威胁到地面世界。",
	"Since their escape from Velkynvelve in {@area chapter 1|022|x}, the characters have sought a way out of the Underdark. Given the somewhat free-form nature of chapters 2 through 6, which the characters can undertake in any order, it's up to you to determine how and where the adventurers finally find their escape route, as best suits the story of their journey through the Underdark.": "自从他们在{@area chapter 1|022|x}逃离Velkynvelve后，角色们一直在寻找离开地下城的方法。鉴于第2章到第6章有点自由的性质，人物可以按任何顺序进行，因此你要决定冒险者最终如何以及在哪里找到他们的逃跑路线，以最适合他们在地下城的旅程的故事。",
	"Escaping the Underdark is no simple matter. Characters who try to find their own way out might wander for years without stumbling upon the right series of passages to take them to the surface. As the DM, you determine where and when they find the way out. The characters can visit the places described in chapters 3 through 6, using the interconnecting material in chapters 2 and 3, in virtually any order. This makes it problematic to put the way to the surface world in a particular place, since the adventurers could just as easily bypass it as stumble upon it prematurely. Instead, the characters' escape is made possible by a set of conditions that you can implement when the time is right.": "逃离地下城不是一件简单的事情。试图自己寻找出路的角色可能会徘徊数年而无法偶然发现一系列正确的通道将他们带到地面。作为DM，你要决定他们在哪里以及何时找到出路。角色们可以使用第2章和第3章中相互关联的材料，以几乎任何顺序访问第3章到第6章中描述的地方。这样一来，把通往地表世界的路放在一个特定的地方就成了问题，因为冒险者可以很容易地绕过它，也可以过早地偶然发现它。取而代之的是，人物的逃亡是通过一系列的条件来实现的，你可以在适当的时候实施。",
	"The deep gnome settlement (see {@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}) has the most dealings with the surface world of any community in this region of the Underdark, and the adventurers can find the resources there to guide them out. However, the deep gnomes are dealing with a number of looming threats to their settlement, and they can't afford to help the characters unless the characters help them first.": "深层地精定居点（见{@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}）在暗黑世界的这个区域的所有社区中与地面世界打交道最多，冒险者们可以在那里找到资源来引导他们出去。然而，深层地精正在处理他们的定居点所面临的一些迫在眉睫的威胁，他们没有能力帮助这些人物，除非这些人物先帮助他们。",
	"Since Blingdenstone is the most obvious and reliable location from which to find a way out of the Underdark, you might want to steer the campaign to other locations first. This can be done by treating the other chapters as side adventures to the characters' main journey, with many of those side adventures focused on the characters helping their NPC companions return to their homes in the Underdark.": "由于布林登石是找到离开暗黑世界的最明显和最可靠的地点，你可能想先把活动引向其他地方。这可以通过将其他章节视为角色主要旅程的副线冒险来实现，其中许多副线冒险的重点是角色帮助他们的NPC同伴返回暗黑世界的家园。",
	"The duergar of Gracklstugh have fewer dealings with the surface world compared to other Underdark races, relying more on trade flowing through Mantol-Derith (see {@adventure chapter 9|OotA|8}). The paranoid duergar are reluctant to share known routes to the surface world, so the adventurers need to cultivate considerable influence with the gray dwarves to earn such a prize.": "与其他暗黑种族相比，格拉克斯图的灰矮人与地表世界的交易较少，他们更依赖通过曼托尔-德里斯进行的贸易（见（%0%））。偏执的杜尔加人不愿意分享通往地表世界的已知路线，所以冒险者需要在灰矮人那里培养相当大的影响力，以获得这样的奖励。",
	"The drow of Menzoberranzan know of several tunnels in this region of the Underdark that lead to the surface world. Characters lucky enough to find one eventually emerge in the Lurkwood, a forest south of the Spine of the World mountains. For more information on the Wormwrithings, see {@adventure chapter 13|OotA|12}.": "曼苏伯兰赞的乌鸦知道在暗黑世界的这一区域有几条通往地面世界的隧道。足够幸运地找到一个的角色最终会出现在世界之脊山脉南部的森林--卢克伍德。关于虫族的更多信息，请参见（%0%）。",
	"Various other tunnels and passages wend their way to the surface in places around the Evermoors or even more remote locations. You can place these wherever you like, if an opportune time for the characters to depart comes along before exploring any of the previous options.": "其他各种隧道和通道在Evermoors周围的地方甚至更偏远的地方蜿蜒通向地面。你可以把这些东西放在你喜欢的地方，如果在探索之前有一个合适的时间让人物离开的话。",
	"A number of ancient portals can be found in the Underdark. A functional portal is a magical doorway leading to some other specific location in Faerûn. If the characters' choices during the adventure leave them unable to secure escape with the help of the NPCs they meet, you could place a portal in or near one of the locations explored in chapters 2 through 6. If the portal is damaged, the characters might need to repair it. The characters also need to figure out how to activate the portal, or find the key or spell necessary to activate it. A portal can be one-way only and send the adventurers anywhere you want.": "在暗黑世界中可以找到许多古老的传送门。一个实用的传送门是一个通往法鲁恩其他特定地点的魔法门道。如果角色在冒险过程中的选择使他们无法在遇到的NPC的帮助下确保逃脱，你可以在第二章到第六章中探索的某个地点或附近放置一个传送门。如果传送门被损坏了，角色们可能需要修复它。人物还需要弄清楚如何激活传送门，或者找到激活传送门所需的钥匙或咒语。传送门可以是单向的，可以把冒险者送到你想要的任何地方。",
	"By the time they have visited the locations detailed in the previous chapters, the characters should have knowledge of a route to the surface world and a map or guide to help them navigate it. These two goals should serve as tools to help motivate the players throughout the earlier chapters of the adventure. As a reward in one chapter, the characters might learn of the existence of a potential route out, leading them to another location in the Underdark where it is supposed to be. Then they need to find a map or guide for the potential route, which could involve them in what is happening in the new location. To complicate the search, they might then discover that a route or guide isn't all they had hoped for, but instead leads them to more promising options.": "当他们访问了前几章详述的地点时，角色们应该知道通往地表世界的路线，并有地图或指南来帮助他们导航。这两个目标应该作为工具，在冒险的前几章帮助激励玩家。作为某一章的奖励，角色们可能会了解到一条潜在的外出路线的存在，将他们引向暗黑世界中另一个应该存在的地点。然后他们需要找到潜在路线的地图或指南，这可能会让他们参与到新地点所发生的事情中。让搜索更复杂的是，他们可能会发现一条路线或指南并不是他们所希望的全部，而是将他们引向更有希望的选择。",
	"As an example, the characters might hear of a potential route to the surface from Gracklstugh. They go to the duergar city and become embroiled in events unfolding there, only to be denied access by the gray dwarves. However, meeting a group of wandering myconids in the city reveals that the myconids of Neverlight Grove know a great deal about the hidden ways of the Underdark.": "举例来说，角色们可能听说了一条从格拉克斯图格（Gracklstugh）通往地表的潜在路线。他们去了duergar城，并卷入了那里发生的事件中，但却被灰矮人拒绝了进入。然而，在城市中遇到一群流浪的菌类，发现永光丛林的菌类对暗黑世界的隐秘方式了解甚多。",
	"Clues and leads should become more plentiful and substantial as the characters approach 7th level, leading them toward their eventual escape route—and with many adventures and encounters happening along the way. If you hand out these hints and opportunities carefully, the characters' path through the Underdark should feel like a smoothly escalating series of discoveries, no matter what order they chose to explore the locations and deal with the challenges of the previous chapters.": "当人物接近第7层时，线索应该变得更加丰富和充实，引导他们走向最终的逃跑路线--而且一路上会有许多冒险和遭遇。如果你小心翼翼地发放这些提示和机会，那么无论他们选择什么样的顺序来探索这些地点和应对前面章节的挑战，角色们在地下城的道路上都应该感觉是一连串顺利升级的发现。",
	"When the characters finally reach the surface, it's likely that some of their subterranean companions will choose to remain in the Underdark rather than face the perils of the surface world.": "当人物最终到达地面时，他们的一些地下同伴很可能会选择留在地下世界而不是面对地面世界的危险。",
	"Knowing that many of their NPC companions have homes in the Underdark can be an important part of the decision-making process that guides the characters through the early chapters of this adventure. The Underdark is a dangerous place, and characters might be reluctant to let their newfound friends fend for themselves. Helping some of them return home makes a good incentive to visit locations in the Underdark. Shuushar, {@creature Topsy|OotA}, {@creature Turvy|OotA}, {@creature Stool|OotA}, {@creature Rumpadump|OotA}, and {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} would rather remain in the Underdark than suffer sunlight.": "知道他们的许多NPC同伴在暗黑世界有家，可以成为指导角色完成冒险早期章节的决策过程的一个重要部分。暗黑世界是一个危险的地方，角色们可能不愿意让他们新发现的朋友自生自灭。帮助他们中的一些人回家是一个很好的激励机制，可以让他们访问地下城的各个地点。舒沙、{@creature Topsy|OotA}、{@creature Turvy|OotA}、{@creature Stool|OotA}、{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}和{@creature Glabbagool|OotA}宁愿留在暗黑世界也不愿意遭受阳光的照射。",
	"Companions such as Eldeth and {@creature Ront|OotA}, who prefer to live on or near the surface, gladly follow the characters all the way out if they can. Eldeth wishes to return to Gauntlgrym, and her presence there can provide a connection for the characters when they visit the dwarven settlement in {@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}. If Eldeth didn't survive, she might have charged the characters with returning her body or effects to Gauntlgrym. {@creature Ront|OotA} might wish to rejoin his tribe or seek a new home elsewhere, based on how the events in the earlier chapters of the adventure have influenced him. Depending on how he was treated, the orc most likely parts from the characters in peace—out of respect for their battle prowess, if nothing else.": "像Eldeth和{@creature Ront|OotA}这样的同伴，他们喜欢生活在地表或附近，如果可以的话，他们很乐意一直跟着人物走。Eldeth希望回到Gauntlgrym，当人物访问{@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}的矮人定居点时，她在那里的存在可以为他们提供一种联系。如果Eldeth没能活下来，她可能会责成人物把她的身体或影响送回Gauntlgrym。{@creature Ront|OotA}可能希望重新加入他的部落，或者在其他地方寻找新的家园，这取决于冒险的前几章中的事件对他的影响。根据他受到的待遇，这个兽人最有可能在和平中离开角色--如果没有其他原因的话，是对他们的战斗力的尊重。",
	"{@creature Buppido|OotA}, {@creature Prince Derendil|OotA}, and Sarith might be gone well before the adventurers are ready to return to the surface, having already revealed their dark secrets and treacherous natures.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}、{@creature Prince Derendil|OotA}和萨利斯可能在冒险者准备返回地面之前就已经离开了，他们已经暴露了自己的黑暗秘密和奸诈的本性。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Sarith are still around, either NPC could go mad and attempt to kill the adventurers before they reach the surface world. Derendil might still hold to his delusion of being an elf prince wanting to return to his forest kingdom. However, the quaggoth is poorly suited to travel on the surface, needing shelter from the light during the day. He becomes increasingly irrational and erratic, seeing enemies and plots everywhere, until he eventually accuses the characters of colluding with his enemies and attacks in a mad fury.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或萨利斯还在，任何一个NPC都可能发疯，试图在冒险者到达地表世界之前杀死他们。德兰迪尔可能仍然坚持他的妄想，认为自己是一个精灵王子，想要回到他的森林王国。然而，这只夸父并不适合在地面上旅行，他需要在白天躲避光线。他变得越来越不理智和反复无常，看到到处都是敌人和阴谋，直到他最终指责人物与他的敌人勾结，并在疯狂的愤怒中攻击。",
	"The drow from Velkynvelve have pursued their escaped prisoners throughout the first half of the adventure. Along the way, they might have engaged the characters in combat or set up a number of near-miss encounters. At times, the adventurers might have believed they had shaken off their pursuers for good, only to have the drow show up unexpectedly. The characters' departure from the Underdark offers the final opportunity for them to confront their pursuers and settle the score.": "Velkynvelve的乌鸦在整个冒险的前半部分都在追捕他们逃跑的囚犯。一路上，他们可能会与人物交战，或者安排一些差点被打倒的遭遇。有时，冒险者们可能认为他们已经永远甩掉了追兵，但鸦人却意外地出现了。角色们离开暗黑世界为他们提供了最后的机会，让他们与追捕者对峙并解决这个问题。",
	"The possibility that her prey might escape drives Ilvara onward. In turn, she relentlessly pushes those under her command to redouble their efforts to catch the characters. At this point, the pursuit level tracking set out in {@area chapter 2|078|x} is no longer relevant. Ilvara and her warriors catch up to the adventurers just before they reach the uppermost level of the Underdark. The adventurers can choose to lead the drow on a risky chase, or stand and fight.": "她的猎物可能逃脱的可能性促使伊尔瓦拉继续前进。反过来，她无情地推动她手下的人加倍努力去抓捕这些人物。在这一点上，{@area chapter 2|078|x}中设定的追击水平追踪已经不再重要。伊尔瓦拉和她的战士们在冒险家们到达地下城最上层之前追上了他们。冒险家们可以选择带领乌鸦进行冒险的追击，或者站着战斗。",
	"If the adventurers flee from the drow, use the chase rules in {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Chases} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} to play out the pursuit. The drow are on foot. If she gets close enough to do so, Ilvara tries to cut off the party's escape by casting {@spell web} across the tunnel ahead. In addition to giving chase, the {@creature drow} in the pursuit party pepper the characters with poisoned crossbow bolts, hoping to render some of them {@condition unconscious}.": "如果冒险者从乌鸦手中逃走，使用{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Chases}中的追击规则，发挥追击的作用。乌鸦是步行的。如果她足够接近，伊尔瓦拉会试图通过在前面的隧道里施放（%2%）来切断队伍的逃跑路线。除了追击之外，追击队伍中的（%3%）还用毒弩炮轰击人物，希望能使其中一些人（%4%）。",

	"After their escape from the Underdark in chapter 7, the adventurers have time to rest, recuperate, and reorient themselves back in the surface world from which they were taken. Some three months after their return, they receive a summons to the dwarf kingdom of Gauntlgrym in the North. King Bruenor Battlehammer desires an audience with them regarding their experiences in the Underdark. Representatives of several factions with an interest in what is happening in the Underdark will also be in attendance. Following the audience, Bruenor extends an offer to the characters, who are tasked with returning to the Underdark once more on a perilous mission.": "在第七章逃离暗黑世界后，冒险者们有时间休息、休整，并重新定位他们所处的地面世界。在他们回来的三个月后，他们收到了前往北方的矮人王国Gauntlgrym的传票。布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）国王希望就他们在暗黑世界的经历与他们会面。对暗黑世界所发生的事情感兴趣的几个派别的代表也将出席会议。觐见之后，布鲁诺向这些人物提出了一个提议，他们的任务是再次回到暗黑世界，执行一项危险的任务。",
	"King Bruenor has learned of the characters' exploits from dwarf merchants and couriers recently returned from the Underdark. (If {@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA} was part of the adventurers' successful escape and returned safely to Gauntlgrym, word of the party's heroics came to Bruenor through her. See \"Gauntlgrym Connections.\") King Bruenor's summons reaches the characters by whatever method best suits the story, depending on where they go and what they are doing following their return to the surface world. It can be in the form of a messenger carrying a handwritten letter bearing the king's seal, or even an {@spell animal messenger} or {@spell sending} spell focused on one or more of the adventurers. Regardless of how it gets to them, the message is simple and clear:": "布鲁诺国王从最近从暗黑世界回来的矮人商人和信使那里得知了这些人物的事迹。(如果{@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA}是冒险者成功逃脱并安全返回Gauntlgrym的一部分，队伍的英雄事迹通过她传到了Bruenor。参见 \"Gauntlgrym的联系\"）。布鲁诺国王的召唤以任何最适合故事的方式到达人物手中，这取决于他们回到地面世界后的去处和所做的事情。它的形式可以是信使携带带有国王印章的手写信件，或者甚至是针对一个或多个冒险者的{@spell animal messenger}或{@spell sending}咒语。无论它如何到达他们手中，信息都是简单而明确的。",
	"Characters belonging to any of the factions involved in the meeting at Gauntlgrym (see \"Forging an Alliance\") might receive a summons from their faction as well, and could even travel with the representative of that faction to the dwarf hold if circumstances permit. Otherwise, the choice to make the journey is up to the characters, although ignoring Bruenor's request leads the dwarf king to send ever more insistent messages.": "属于Gauntlgrym会议（见 \"建立联盟\"）的任何一个派别的角色可能也会收到他们派别的召唤，如果情况允许，甚至可以和该派别的代表一起前往矮人的领地。否则，是否出行由角色决定，尽管无视布鲁诺的要求会导致矮人国王发出更多坚持的信息。",
	"If {@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA} survived and escaped from the Underdark with the characters, she is eager to return home to Gauntlgrym, and does so at the first opportunity. In that case, King Bruenor's summons might come in the form of a personal message or a visit from her, and it's likely Bruenor has heard all about the Underdark exploits from Eldeth.": "如果{@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA}幸存下来，并和角色们一起逃离了暗黑世界，她渴望回到Gauntlgrym的家，并且一有机会就这样做。在这种情况下，布鲁诺国王的召唤可能会以私人信息的形式出现，或者是她的拜访，而且布鲁诺很可能已经从艾尔达斯那里听说了暗黑世界的所有事迹。",
	"If Eldeth didn't survive, she might have charged the characters with returning either her remains or her warhammer and shield to her home. This errand can bring the characters to Gauntlgrym of their own volition even before Bruenor's summons.": "如果埃尔德斯没能活下来，她可能会责成人物把她的遗体或她的战锤和盾牌送回她的家。这个任务可以让人物在布鲁诺的召唤之前就主动来到冈特格莱姆。",
	"Either aiding Eldeth's return or honoring her memory enhances the party's reputation with the dwarves of Gauntlgrym. It also reinforces King Bruenor's opinion that these adventurers are the right people to do the job of investigating the happenings in the Underdark.": "无论是帮助艾尔达斯归来还是纪念她，都能提高队伍在冈特格莱姆的矮人中的声誉。这也加强了布鲁诺国王的看法，即这些冒险者是调查暗黑世界事件的合适人选。",
	"Once the characters arrive at the gates of Gauntlgrym, they are welcomed as the king's guests and escorted into the underground city, through the Vault of Kings (see below), and shown to guest quarters. The dwarves of Gauntlgrym take matters of hospitality seriously, ensuring that the adventurers are offered food, drink, and a chance to rest and refresh themselves before their audience with the king (see \"Audience with Bruenor\" under \"Events in Gauntlgrym\").": "一旦人物到达高特格林姆的大门，他们就会被当作国王的客人来欢迎，并被护送到地下城市，通过国王的金库（见下文），并被带到客人的住处。Gauntlgrym的矮人非常重视接待工作，确保冒险者在觐见国王之前得到食物、饮料和休息的机会（见 \"Gauntlgrym的活动 \"中的 \"与布鲁诺会面\"）。",
	"The characters' arrival is noteworthy, and the dwarves of Gauntlgrym treat them in a manner befitting great dignitaries. You can also have one or two of the faction representatives described under \"Forging an Alliance\" pass the characters in the corridors of the city, giving them curious looks—and perhaps even making a brief introduction—before moving on.": "这些人物的到来是值得注意的，Gauntlgrym的矮人以一种适合于伟大的贵宾的方式对待他们。你也可以让 \"建立联盟 \"中描述的一两个派别代表在城市的走廊里与人物擦肩而过，给他们一个好奇的眼神，甚至做一个简单的介绍，然后继续前进。",
	"In ages past, the subterranean city of Gauntlgrym was the capital of the ancient dwarven Delzoun Empire. Its cavernous halls—some large enough to contain entire surface villages—were carved with unerring precision, their ceilings soaring scores of feet overhead. Towering statues of dwarven gods and heroes stood vigil over chambers and thoroughfares, the least of which was wide enough to march fifty dwarves standing abreast.": "在过去的年代，地下城市Gauntlgrym是古老的矮人Delzoun帝国的首都。它的洞穴大厅--有些大到足以容纳整个地面村庄--被雕刻得精确无误，其天花板高达几十英尺。矮人诸神和英雄的高大雕像在厅堂和大道上守候，其中最宽的一条足以让50个矮人并排前行。",
	"The mines of Gauntlgrym produced endless tides of iron, silver, gold, and mithral, and booming trade brought goods and wealth to the city from across Faerûn. But it was the Great Forge that was the burning heart and true treasure of the city. Deep beneath the settled levels of Gauntlgrym, dwarven crafting and elven magic bound the slumbering primordial Maegera, a being of fire and destruction, harnessing its incredible powers to heat the forge. On anvils of adamantine blessed by priests of Moradin, great items of power were forged, their base material infused with a splinter of Maegera's essence. The unceasing wonders flowing from these forges helped make Gauntlgrym into one of the most magnificent cities Faerûn has ever known.": "Gauntlgrym的矿场生产出无穷无尽的铁、银、金和米特拉，繁荣的贸易将货物和财富从整个Faerûn带到这个城市。但是，大锻造厂才是这座城市燃烧的心脏和真正的财富。在Gauntlgrym定居层的深处，矮人的工艺和精灵的魔法将沉睡的原始Maegera--一种火与毁灭的存在--捆绑起来，利用其不可思议的力量来加热锻造。在摩拉丁祭司祝福的金刚砂铁砧上，伟大的权力物品被锻造出来，它们的基本材料被注入了迈格拉的精华碎片。源源不断的奇迹从这些锻造厂流出，使Gauntlgrym成为Faerûn有史以来最宏伟的城市之一。",
	"Relations between the great empires of the elves, dwarves, and humans soured as the centuries passed. And so when numberless hordes of orcs smashed into the north, each empire stood alone. The war was brutal and devastating. Gauntlgrym was swarmed by rampaging armies of orcs, and the empire of Delzoun was overrun in the terrible fighting. Ultimately, the dwarves of Delzoun drove back the orcs, but at great cost. The once-mighty dwarven empire was left crippled, never to recover, and the great city of Gauntlgrym was left in the control of an orc horde.": "随着几个世纪的过去，精灵、矮人和人类的大帝国之间的关系逐渐恶化。因此，当无数的兽人成群结队地闯入北方时，每个帝国都孤立无援。这场战争是残酷的、毁灭性的。Gauntlgrym被猖獗的兽人军队包围，Delzoun帝国也在可怕的战斗中被攻陷。最终，德尔祖恩的矮人击退了兽人，但付出了巨大的代价。曾经强大的矮人帝国被打成了残废，再也没有恢复，伟大的Gauntlgrym城也被兽人部落控制了。",
	"It was humans from nearby Illusk who finally drove the orcs from Gauntlgrym, but their hold on the city proved just as short-lived, as foul creatures from the Underdark swarmed from the depths to claim Gauntlgrym as their own. Over the next thousand years, history turned to legend, and mighty Gauntlgrym was all but forgotten on the surface world. Illithids, duergar, drow, and aboleths vied for control of the fallen city, its treasures, and the primordial still bound within its core. The drow House Xorlarrin eventually took Gauntlgrym, establishing a new city they called Q'Xorlarrin, producing weapons at the forge that they traded and used to pay tribute to Menzoberranzan.": "最终是来自附近的伊拉斯克的人类将兽人赶出了高特格林姆，但他们对这座城市的控制也很短暂，因为来自暗黑世界的邪恶生物从深处蜂拥而至，将高特格林姆据为己有。在接下来的一千年里，历史变成了传说，强大的Gauntlgrym在地面世界几乎被遗忘。伊利希德人、杜尔加人、乌鸦人和阿波利斯人争相控制这座沦陷的城市、它的财宝以及仍被束缚在其核心的原始人。Xorlarrin乌鸦家族最终占领了Gauntlgrym，建立了一个名为Q'Xorlarrin的新城市，在锻造厂生产武器，用来交易和向Menzoberranzan进贡。",
	"In recent years, the dwarf hero Bruenor Battlehammer was able to seize the fabled city back from its drow masters. Bruenor, along with his companions Wulfgar, Cattie-brie, Regis, and Drizzt Do'Urden, gathered many allies from the surface world and nearby Underdark communities and retook the city. They prevented Maegera from being unleashed upon Faerûn, and set about attempting to restore the city to its former glory. Bruenor now sits upon the Great Throne of Moradin, working to rebuild the city and keep it safe—even as a new threat looms in the depths of the Underdark.": "近年来，矮人英雄布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）得以从鸦人的主人手中夺回了这座传说中的城市。布鲁诺和他的同伴沃夫加（Wulfgar）、凯蒂-布里（Cattie-brie）、雷吉斯（Regis）以及德里兹-杜尔登（Drizzt Do'Urden）一起，从地表世界和附近的暗黑社区召集了许多盟友，重新夺回了这座城市。他们阻止了迈格拉在法鲁恩的释放，并开始尝试将城市恢复到以前的荣耀。布鲁诺现在坐在莫拉丁的大王座上，致力于重建城市并保持其安全--即使在暗黑世界的深处出现了新的威胁。",
	"The following areas within Gauntlgrym might be of some importance during this part of the adventure, although they don't represent the full measure of the city by any means. A detailed description of every level, chamber, and vault of Gauntlgrym would take up an entire volume of its own, and the characters have limited time to see the wonders of the dwarven city.": "在冒险的这一部分，Gauntlgrym的以下区域可能会有一定的重要性，尽管它们并不代表这个城市的全部规模。对Gauntlgrym的每一层、每一个房间和每一个拱顶的详细描述都会占去一整本书的篇幅，而且人物有有限的时间来欣赏这个矮人城市的奇迹。",
	"Gauntlgrym is a city carved out of the living rock, with halls and passages wide enough for the largest dragons to walk through. There are hundreds of levels, twisting stairs, functioning elevators, and a system of mine carts crossing in and out of the central hub of the Iron Tabernacle. The players should feel their characters are in a place of great antiquity, poised on the edge of reclaiming its ancient glory. By no means is the city fully occupied. Indeed, given the relatively small size of Bruenor's occupying force, keeping track of anyone within Gauntlgrym is nearly impossible.": "Gauntlgrym是一座从活石中雕刻出来的城市，大厅和通道宽得足以让最大的龙走过。这里有数以百计的关卡、曲折的楼梯、运作良好的电梯，以及一个穿越铁幕中心枢纽的矿车系统。玩家应该感觉到他们的角色是在一个非常古老的地方，正准备重新获得其古老的荣耀。这座城市绝不是完全被占领。事实上，鉴于布鲁诺的占领军规模相对较小，在Gauntlgrym内追踪任何人几乎是不可能的。",
	"In the upper levels and around the Iron Tabernacle and Vault of Kings, Gauntlgrym is brightly lit. {@i Driftglobes}, phosphorescent fungi, and huge braziers and troughs of burning coals fill most hallways and chambers. Lights in many parts of the city are dimmed somewhat during the nighttime hours, so that its residents can mark the passage of time on the surface world. In the lower reaches, around the Great Forge, light isn't as ubiquitous. Farther down, and in parts of the city yet to be reclaimed from the ruins of the past, there is no light other than whatever visitors bring with them.": "在上层和铁塔和国王金库周围，冈特格莱姆灯火通明。{@i Driftglobes}，磷光真菌，以及巨大的火炉和燃烧着的煤槽充斥着大多数走廊和房间。城市的许多地方的灯光在夜间的时候会变暗一些，这样它的居民就可以在表面世界标记时间的流逝。在下游的大锻造厂周围，灯光并不那么普遍。在更远的地方，以及城市中尚未从过去的废墟中开垦出来的部分，除了游客带来的东西外，没有其他的光。",
	"Mining was one of Gauntlgrym's primary sources of wealth and materials. To facilitate the movement of ore, as well as the great quantities of stone used to construct and expand the city, the dwarves laid miles of track traversed by mine carts propelled by enchantments woven into their wheels. Even after thousands of years, the tracks remain largely intact and the magic of the carts has not faded. Where the carts trundle steadily throughout the city, Gauntlgrym's residents use them for travel, hopping on and off along the system's wide range of routes. While in Gauntlgrym, the characters can also make use of this convenient transportation system.": "采矿是Gauntlgrym的主要财富和材料来源之一。为了方便矿石的运输，以及用于建造和扩建城市的大量石料，矮人铺设了数英里的轨道，由车轮上编织的魔法所推动的矿车穿过。即使过了几千年，这些轨道仍然基本完好，矿车的魔力也没有消退。矿车稳定地行驶在城市的各个角落，Gauntlgrym的居民则用它们来旅行，沿着系统的各种路线跳上跳下。在Gauntlgrym的时候，人物也可以利用这个便利的交通系统。",
	"All tracks eventually lead to a switching station in the Iron Tabernacle. There, posted operators manipulate levers and gears to transfer carts from one track to another.": "所有的轨道最终都通向铁幕的一个转换站。在那里，派驻的操作员操纵杠杆和齿轮，将小车从一条轨道转移到另一条轨道。",
	"The shades of long-deceased inhabitants of the city, from the time of the Delzoun of old, haunt many of the tunnels and hallways of Gauntlgrym. These spectral remnants are seen passing through ruined sections of the city as if those sections were still intact, following habitual routes, engaging in silent conversation with one another, and generally keeping out of the way of the living. From time to time, the characters might run into a dwarven {@creature ghost} who warns them away from a place of danger, or confront a less beneficial creature such as a {@creature shadow} or {@creature specter}. King Bruenor has decreed the restless dead be left alone for now unless they cause problems.": "在Gauntlgrym的许多隧道和走廊里，都有古老的Delzoun时代的已故居民的影子。人们看到这些幽灵般的残余物穿过城市的废墟，就像这些地方仍然完好无损一样，沿着习惯的路线，相互之间进行无声的交谈，一般来说，他们不会挡住活人的路。时不时地，人物可能会遇到一个矮人（%0%），他警告他们远离危险的地方，或者面对一个不太有利的生物，如（%1%）或（%2%）。布鲁诺国王已经下令暂时不要管这些不安分的死者，除非他们造成麻烦。",
	"Large enough to enclose a small town, this high-ceilinged chamber rises above a network of bridges, stone towers, and sturdy walls carved from rock and sheathed in iron and mithral. Dozens of smaller chambers lead out from the Vault of Kings, including sprawling residential areas not yet filled by Gauntlgrym's new occupants.": "这个高大的密室足以包围一个小镇，它耸立在由桥梁、石塔和由岩石雕刻而成的坚固墙壁组成的网络之上，并以铁和密特拉尔合金为外皮。几十个较小的房间从国王的金库中出来，包括尚未被冈特格雷姆的新住户填满的广阔的住宅区。",
	"The vault is on the same level as the city's main gates and can be reached from there, though a system of smaller gates and checkpoints has been set up to keep potential invaders from reaching as far as the throne room. That section of the vault, where the king spends a considerable amount of his time, is a large hall lined with pillars and benches, intended as a meeting place as much as a seat of rulership. The Great Throne of Moradin is protected by powerful magic, and forcefully ejects anyone but the rightful king who attempts to sit upon it. While so seated, Bruenor has advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma checks—a divine blessing granted to the king of Gauntlgrym by Moradin and the other dwarven gods.": "金库与城市的主门在同一层，可以从那里到达，尽管已经建立了一个由小门和检查站组成的系统，以防止潜在的入侵者达到王室的程度。金库的那一部分是国王花费大量时间的地方，是一个有柱子和长椅的大殿，目的是作为一个会议场所，而不是统治者的座位。莫拉丁的大王座受到强大的魔法保护，除了合法的国王之外，任何试图坐在上面的人都会被强行驱逐。在坐着的时候，布鲁诺在所有智力、智慧和魅力的检查中都有优势--这是莫拉丁和其他矮人神灵授予冈特格莱姆国王的神圣祝福。",
	"The majority of the city's current inhabitants live and work within the vault, happy to share tales of the city's reclamation and praise Bruenor's leadership at any opportunity. This is where the characters reside as Bruenor's guests, and where the representatives of the five factions are likely to be found. Here, residents and guests alike enjoy access to well-lit passages, comfortable quarters, and substantial amounts of food and drink.": "城市目前的大部分居民都在金库内生活和工作，他们乐于分享城市开垦的故事，并在任何机会下赞美布鲁诺的领导。这里是人物作为布鲁诺的客人居住的地方，也是有可能找到五个派别的代表的地方。在这里，居民和客人都能享受到光线充足的通道、舒适的住所以及大量的食物和饮料。",
	"The Vault of Kings is heavily patrolled and guarded by shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans} traveling in squads of six. It is the safest part of the city, and the characters can probably depend upon its security enough to rest without interruption in one of the guest suites provided to them, barring any unusual occurrences (see \"Events in Gauntlgrym\").": "国王金库有大量的巡逻人员，并由盾牌矮人（%0%）以六人一组的方式进行守卫。这是城市中最安全的地方，如果没有任何异常情况发生，角色们也许可以依赖它的安全，在提供给他们的一个客人套房中不受干扰地休息（见 \"Gauntlgrym的事件\"）。",
	"The Iron Tabernacle is Gauntlgrym's spiritual and cultural heart as well as its physical center. More than a temple, the tabernacle is an entire section of the city larger than some surface towns, devoted to the faith of the former Delzoun Empire and of the dwarves who answered Bruenor's call to reclaim the city. Vast cathedrals of stone once echoed with the paeans of a thousand chanting voices. Great sculptures in honor of a multitude of gods gazed across an array of shrines and altars. Priests stood ready by night and day to tend to the spiritual needs of their people, and hundreds of stone tablets trumpeted the holy words of Moradin.": "铁幕是Gauntlgrym的精神和文化核心，也是它的物质中心。比起神庙，铁幕是城市的一整块区域，比一些地表城镇还要大，它致力于前德尔祖恩帝国的信仰，以及响应布鲁诺号召收回城市的矮人的信仰。巨大的石头大教堂曾经回荡着千百个吟唱者的颂歌。纪念众多神灵的巨大雕塑凝视着一连串的神龛和祭坛。祭司们夜以继日地准备着照顾他们人民的精神需求，数以百计的石板吹响了莫拉丁的圣言。",
	"Like so much else of ancient Gauntlgrym, the Iron Tabernacle isn't what it once was. The intricate patterns and knotwork have faded from the walls, some of the statues have begun to crumble, and many passages are blocked with rubble. The devilish duergar, once in control of the mines below, took delight in defiling the holy icons of the absent dwarves. They defaced statues, tore down altars, and carved obscenities into the sacred tablets. Anything of value, such as silver or mithral trim, gold icons, and hallowed weapons, has been completely scavenged.": "就像古代冈特格雷姆的许多其他地方一样，铁帐幕已经不是以前的样子了。墙上复杂的图案和绳结已经褪色，一些雕像已经开始坍塌，许多通道被碎石堵住。曾经控制着下面矿场的魔鬼杜尔加，以玷污缺席的矮人的圣像为乐。他们玷污了雕像，拆毁了祭坛，并在圣碑上刻下污言秽语。任何有价值的东西，如银或密特拉尔的饰物、黄金圣像和神圣的武器，都被完全搜刮一空。",
	"Shield dwarf {@creature Priest||priests} have begun the long task of rebuilding, revitalizing, and restoring the Iron Tabernacle to its former glory. The area is vast, and its halls are numerous and multileveled. The dwarf priests have restored many shrines and altars, and have cleared paths through the cracked and broken hallways to the Vault of Kings so that Bruenor can make personal visits to the main shrines and offer thanks to the gods. This procession often includes Bruenor's visitors or those ambassadors from the surface who come to Gauntlgrym to seek counsel with the king. Bruenor leads these processions not only to show off the city and its sheer size, but also to take measure of his guests' endurance and patience in matters of spirit.": "盾牌矮人{@creature Priest||priests}已经开始了重建、振兴和恢复铁幕的漫长任务，使其恢复昔日的荣光。这片区域非常广阔，其大厅数量众多，而且是多层次的。矮人祭司们修复了许多神龛和祭坛，并在裂缝和破损的走廊中清理出通往国王金库的道路，这样布鲁诺就可以亲自到主要的神龛前祭拜，向诸神致谢。这个队伍中经常包括布鲁诺的访客或那些来自地表的使者，他们来到Gauntlgrym寻求国王的建议。布鲁诺带领这些队伍不仅是为了炫耀这个城市和它的庞大规模，也是为了衡量他的客人在精神问题上的耐力和耐心。",
	"As the heart of Gauntlgrym, the Iron Tabernacle is the central hub of the city's passageways and railways. Broad corridors, winding stairs, iron rails, roadways carved into the earth—nearly all the city's major byways pass through the tabernacle. Every part of Gauntlgrym can be reached from this area, albeit sometimes indirectly. Notably, the Vault of Kings is about a mile to the north of the Iron Tabernacle, and the Great Forge is several hundred feet below it and a half mile to the south.": "作为Gauntlgrym的心脏，铁幕是城市通道和铁路的中心枢纽。宽阔的走廊、蜿蜒的楼梯、铁轨、刻在大地上的道路--几乎所有城市的主要通道都要经过这个会堂。Gauntlgrym的每个地方都可以从这里到达，尽管有时是间接的。值得注意的是，国王的金库在铁帐幕北面约一英里处，大锻造厂在铁帐幕下几百英尺处，南面有半英里。",
	"The lowest level of the Iron Tabernacle is a seemingly endless collection of crypts. Laid out according to patterns or traditions now lost to time, the tombs contain thousands of Gauntlgrym's honored dead. Some crypts are simple biers; others are intricate sarcophagi. All include names, titles, and lineage carved into the stone. A number of scholars have been drawn to Gauntlgrym in response to Bruenor's call, hoping to record a complete lineage of the great families of Gauntlgrym, including their possible connections to modern bloodlines, from an exhaustive study of the records carved in the crypt's stones.": "铁幕的最底层是一个似乎没有尽头的墓穴集合。这些墓穴按照现在已被时间遗忘的模式或传统铺设，里面有成千上万的高特立姆的尊贵死者。有些墓穴是简单的壁炉；有些是复杂的石棺。所有的墓穴都有刻在石头上的名字、头衔和世系。一些学者响应布鲁诺的号召被吸引到Gauntlgrym，希望通过对墓室石头上所刻记录的详尽研究，记录Gauntlgrym大家族的完整血统，包括他们与现代血统的可能联系。",
	"Unlike the rest of the Iron Tabernacle, the tombs are unmarred. Spectral dwarves are common in this area, though their spirits remain quiet as long as visitors are respectful of the dead. If any creatures attempt to deface or steal from the sarcophagi, a mob of dwarven {@creature Ghost||ghosts} quickly attacks. Start with a total number of ghosts equal to the number of intruders present, then add two new ghosts for each ghost destroyed.": "与铁幕的其他地方不同，这些坟墓没有被破坏。幽灵般的矮人在这个区域很常见，不过只要游客对死者尊重，他们的灵魂就会保持安静。如果有任何生物试图玷污或偷窃石棺，一群矮人（%0%）会迅速攻击。开始时，鬼魂的总数与在场的入侵者数量相等，然后每消灭一个鬼魂就增加两个新的鬼魂。",
	"The Iron Tabernacle is close enough to some of the lower reaches and fissures in the Underdark that monsters from below occasionally find their way in and set up lairs in one shrine or another. The dwarves impress upon the characters to be on their guard, or to take guards with them, if they visit. From time to time, the sound of combat rings through the tabernacle hallways, a contrast to the chanting voices of the priests and a sure sign that something unwelcome has made its way into this most sacred of places.": "铁匠铺离暗黑世界的一些下游和裂缝足够近，以至于下面的怪物偶尔会找到他们的方式，并在一个或另一个神龛里建立巢穴。矮人让这些人物提高警惕，或者带着警卫，如果他们来的话。不时有战斗的声音在神龛的走廊上响起，这与祭司们的诵经声形成了鲜明的对比，也是不受欢迎的东西进入这个最神圣的地方的肯定信号。",
	"Check for a random encounter once every hour of travel in the Iron Tabernacle by rolling a {@dice d20} and consulting the table below to determine what, if anything, the characters meet.": "在铁幕中旅行时，每小时检查一次随机遭遇，方法是滚动{@dice d20}并查阅下表，以确定角色会遇到什么，如果有的话。",
	"1 dwarf {@creature ghost} (friendly unless attacked)": "1个矮人 {@creature ghost} (友好的，除非被攻击)",
	"Patrol consisting of six shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans}": "由六个盾牌矮人组成的巡逻队 {@creature Veteran||veterans}",
	"1 shield dwarf {@creature priest} and {@dice 1d4 + 1} shield dwarf {@creature Acolyte||acolytes}": "1个盾牌矮人（%0%）和（%1%）盾牌矮人（%2%）。",
	"The Great Forge is a cavernous chamber divided into smaller sections housing furnaces and anvils. Some areas of the cavern are raised on daises of stone, while others stand in shallow pits. Layers of stone catwalks crisscross the chamber, providing not only vantage points but also anchors for pulleys transporting buckets of ore and water throughout the forge. The Great Forge is about a half mile south of the Iron Tabernacle and several hundred feet below it, and can be reached by mine cart or on foot.": "大锻造室是一个洞穴，被分成若干小部分，里面有熔炉和铁砧。洞穴中的一些区域是在石头的雏形上升起的，而其他区域则是在浅坑中。一层层的石板走道纵横交错，不仅提供了有利的位置，还为整个锻造厂运送矿石和水桶的滑轮提供了锚点。大锻造厂在铁幕以南约半英里处，在铁幕下面几百英尺处，可以通过矿车或步行到达。",
	"It was said of old that the Iron Tabernacle was Gauntlgrym's heart, the Vault of Kings its mind, and the Great Forge its mighty hands. Here, on adamantine anvils blessed by Moradin's priests, wonders were hammered from iron, mithral, silver, and steel. When Gauntlgrym thrived, the forge echoed with the hammering and songs of a hundred smiths working at once. In time, it might do so again.": "古人说，铁幕是高特立姆的心脏，王穹是它的思想，而大锻造厂则是它强有力的双手。在这里，由莫拉丁的祭司祝福的金刚铁砧上，铁、米塔尔、银和钢的奇迹被锤炼出来。当Gauntlgrym繁荣的时候，锻造厂回荡着一百个铁匠同时工作的锤子和歌声。随着时间的推移，它可能会再次这样做。",
	"It was the furnaces of the Great Forge that made this place the apex of the dwarf smiths' art, for those furnaces are driven by the power of Maegera the Dawn Titan—a primordial imprisoned below them. Slumbering within the stone, Maegera exudes an unnatural heat that the dwarves tap into by winding coils of copper and adamantine throughout the forge like webs and using them as conduits to transfer magical heat to their furnaces. Runes of power carved into the walls and etched into the coils allow them to withstand the intense energy. Metals melt almost instantly in the furnaces of the Great Forge, and tools cast from those metals are enchanted with motes of primordial essence.": "正是大锻造厂的熔炉使这里成为矮人铁匠艺术的顶点，因为这些熔炉是由黎明泰坦迈格拉的力量驱动的--一个被囚禁在下面的原始人。沉睡在石头里的迈格拉散发出一种非自然的热量，矮人通过将铜和金刚砂的线圈像网一样缠绕在整个熔炉里，并将它们作为管道将魔法热量传递到熔炉中。刻在墙壁上的力量符文和刻在线圈上的符文使它们能够承受住强烈的能量。金属在大锻造炉中几乎瞬间融化，用这些金属铸造的工具被赋予了原始精华的斑纹。",
	"When Maegera awoke in the last century, the earth shook, and many of the furnaces' conduits were severed. Today, lengths of twine-thin metal hang limp and broken throughout the rubble of the Great Forge, which lies upon the bones of those unable to escape the collapse of bridges and walls. Other coils remain in place, and the furnaces to which they are linked burn as hot today as they did in centuries gone by.": "当迈格拉在上个世纪苏醒时，大地震动，许多熔炉的管道被切断了。今天，在大锻造厂的废墟上，长长的两根薄金属软绵绵地挂着，断断续续地躺在那些无法逃脱桥梁和墙壁坍塌的人的骨头上。其他线圈仍在原地，它们所连接的熔炉今天仍像过去几个世纪一样燃烧着。",
	"Heat and ruddy light emanate from a pit in the depths of Gauntlgrym. Chambers and tunnels lead away from this chasm at different heights. Despite channels built into the walls to carry water to the magma below, the heat from the pit is ferocious. Gouts of steam billow up through cracks in the stone to fill the chambers above this area, and the earth rumbles in a pulse like labored breathing.": "热量和红光从Gauntlgrym深处的一个坑里发出来。房间和隧道以不同的高度从这道鸿沟中延伸出来。尽管墙壁上建有通道，将水输送到下面的岩浆中，但坑里的热量还是很凶猛。大量的蒸汽从石头的缝隙中涌出，填满了这个区域上方的房间，大地发出隆隆的脉搏声，就像费力的呼吸。",
	"The Fiery Pit is the prison of the primordial known as Maegera, who slumbers fitfully in its depths. The only sign of the entity's presence is a whirlpool of white-hot magma that resembles a great eye, set in the center of the lake of molten rock at the pit's bottom. Maegera sleeps and dreams, half conscious of its surroundings and half delirious with whatever dreams haunt a being of pure destruction.": "火坑是被称为 \"Maegera \"的原始人的监狱，他在火坑的深处昏昏欲睡。这个实体存在的唯一标志是一个白热岩浆的漩涡，它就像一只巨大的眼睛，镶嵌在坑底熔岩湖的中心。麦格拉睡觉和做梦，一半意识到周围的环境，一半被萦绕在一个纯粹的毁灭者身上的任何梦境所迷惑。",
	"When the mages of the Arcane Brotherhood first tapped into Maegera's power, they used water magic to bind elementals that cooled the primordial's rage and kept it asleep. This bond lasted for centuries until the channels of water were closed through trickery by agents of Thay. With the pit's cooling mechanism shut down, Maegera stirred in its slumber, and its dream of ruination was enough to destroy Gauntlgrym.": "当奥术兄弟会的法师们第一次挖掘迈格拉的力量时，他们用水的魔法来束缚元素，冷却了原始人的愤怒，使其沉睡。这种结合持续了几个世纪，直到水的通道被泰伊的代理人以欺骗的方式关闭。随着深坑冷却机制的关闭，麦格拉在沉睡中蠢蠢欲动，它的毁灭之梦足以摧毁冈特格莱姆。",
	"In the years following, Maegera groggily awoke from time to time, causing earthquakes throughout the region. Eventually, the primordial was returned to its slumber through the efforts of Bruenor, Drizzt Do'Urden, Jarlaxle, and other heroes. Where Maegera sleeps now, the intense heat it generates once again fires the Great Forge of Gauntlgrym.": "在随后的几年里，麦格拉不时地呻吟着醒来，在整个地区引起地震。最终，在布鲁诺、德里兹特-杜尔登、贾拉索和其他英雄的努力下，这个原始的东西又恢复了沉睡。在麦格拉现在沉睡的地方，它产生的强烈热量再次点燃了冈特格雷姆的大锻造炉。",
	"Under Bruenor's watchful governance, the Great Forge has again begun to produce metalworks. If the characters are in the market for any metal goods (including arms and armor), or have any such goods in need of repair or replacement, the dwarves of the Great Forge are happy to help. No magic weapons or armor are available for sale, although damaged magic items can be repaired.": "在布鲁诺的监督下，大锻造厂又开始生产金属制品了。如果人物在市场上需要任何金属制品（包括武器和盔甲），或者有任何需要修理或更换的此类物品，大锻造厂的矮人很乐意提供帮助。没有魔法武器或盔甲可供出售，尽管损坏的魔法物品可以被修复。",
	"The king has left the day-to-day running of the Great Forge to a pair of experienced smiths: Helgrim Candlewick and Rollo Summergold (both shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans}).": "国王把大锻造厂的日常运作交给了一对经验丰富的铁匠。Helgrim Candlewick和Rollo Summergold（都是盾牌矮人（%0%））。",
	"The Great Forge is always occupied by either Helgrim or Rollo, their apprentices and assistants ({@dice 2d4} shield dwarf {@creature Commoner||commoners}), and shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans} working in squads of six to guard the active furnaces. The characters might also encounter other creatures if they explore the unoccupied areas of the Great Forge. Check for such an encounter once per hour of travel or rest outside the protected areas of the forge by rolling a {@dice d20} and consulting the Great Forge Encounters table to determine what, if anything, comes out of the darkness. If the heroes call for help, four shield dwarf {@creature Veteran||veterans} arrive in {@dice 1d4 + 1} rounds to aid them.": "大锻造场总是由赫尔格林或罗洛、他们的学徒和助手（{@dice 2d4}盾牌矮人{@creature Commoner||commoners}）以及盾牌矮人{@creature Veteran||veterans}占据，他们以六人一队的方式守卫着正在使用的熔炉。如果他们探索大熔炉的无人区，也可能遇到其他生物。在锻造厂的保护区域之外，每旅行或休息一小时就检查一次这样的遭遇，方法是掷出（%3%）并查阅大锻造厂的遭遇表，以确定黑暗中会出现什么，如果有的话。如果英雄们呼救，四个盾牌矮人（%4%）会在（%5%）回合内赶来帮助他们。",

	"This chapter is dominated by negotiation, social activity, and diplomacy—first directed at the characters, then directed by them. The adventurers must first hear what King Bruenor has to say as he entreats them to head back into the Underdark to find out more about the rising threat of the demon lords. Then the characters must help convince the other factions summoned to Gauntlgrym to aid them on their mission. This section of the adventure has some opportunity for action, but players who enjoy plotting, making plans, and pitting NPCs against one another can shine here.": "这一章主要是谈判、社交活动和外交活动--先是针对人物，然后由他们指导。冒险家们必须首先听取布鲁诺国王的意见，他恳请他们返回暗黑世界，以了解更多关于恶魔领主的威胁。然后，角色们必须帮助说服被召唤到Gauntlgrym的其他派别，帮助他们完成任务。冒险的这一部分有一些行动的机会，但是喜欢密谋、制定计划和让NPC互相对立的玩家可以在这里大放异彩。",
	"Take note of your players' preferences. If they're not much for long periods of conversation with NPCs, you might want to move things along a little more quickly. On the other hand, you can really bring to life not just the faction representatives and the dwarf king in this chapter, but also highlight the personalities and goals of the characters and any NPCs who remain with them.": "注意到你的玩家的喜好。如果他们不喜欢与NPC进行长时间的对话，你可能想把事情进展得更快一些。另一方面，在这一章中，你不仅可以让派别代表和矮人国王真正活起来，还可以突出人物和任何留在他们身边的NPC的个性和目标。",
	"After the characters arrive and are shown to guest accommodations, they are allowed some time to refresh and prepare themselves. They are then called to an audience with Bruenor Battlehammer, the king of Gauntlgrym. Read or paraphrase the following:": "在人物到达并被带到客人的住处后，他们被允许有一些时间来养精蓄锐和准备自己。然后，他们被叫去觐见冈特格莱姆的国王布鲁诺-战锤。阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"You are taken to a mighty hall in which a red-haired dwarf of fierce and proud demeanor sits upon a massive stone throne, flanked by a number of guards and advisors. Although a long stone table has been set to one side, laid out with refreshments, there do not appear to be any other guests. \"Welcome, friends,\" says the king. \"I've a mind to know about the rumblings and rumors about goings-on in the depths outside my city. If ye relate to me what ye know, we can talk about what ye might want to do next.\"": "你被带到一个巨大的大厅，里面有一个红发的矮人，举止凶狠而骄傲，坐在一个巨大的石座上，两边是一些卫兵和顾问。虽然一边摆放着一张长长的石桌，上面摆放着茶点，但似乎没有任何其他客人。\"欢迎，朋友们，\"国王说。\"我很想知道关于我的城市外面深处的隆隆声和谣言的情况。如果你们把你们所知道的告诉我，我们可以谈谈你们接下来可能要做的事情。\"",
	"King Bruenor listens carefully to what the adventurers have to say. Once the adventurers have told their tale, Bruenor might have a few questions, particularly concerning the threat of the demon lords. The dwarf king answers questions from the characters if they have any. However, if asked about his overall plans, he says simply that he must consider all the information presented to him and consult with advisors. With the audience at an end, Bruenor tells the characters he will consider all they have told him, and that they will speak again at a welcoming feast later that night.": "布鲁诺国王仔细听着冒险家们的讲述。一旦冒险者讲述完他们的故事，布鲁诺可能会有一些问题，特别是关于恶魔领主的威胁。矮人国王会回答角色们的问题，如果他们有任何问题。然而，如果被问及他的整体计划，他只是说他必须考虑所有提交给他的信息，并与顾问协商。随着听证会的结束，布鲁诺告诉这些人物他将考虑他们所告诉他的一切，并且他们将在当天晚上的欢迎宴会上再次交谈。",
	"After the characters have had a chance to speak with Bruenor and take care of any personal business, the Vault of Kings plays host to a memorable feast. In attendance are representatives of different factions from the surface world, who have come to Gauntlgrym following rumors of bizarre events in the Underdark. If any of the adventurers belong to a faction, representatives of that faction might even be following up on information provided by the characters themselves. See \"Forging an Alliance\" for more information.": "在角色们有机会与布鲁诺交谈并处理任何个人事务之后，\"国王的金库 \"将举办一场令人难忘的盛宴。参加宴会的有来自地面世界的不同派别的代表，他们是在暗黑世界发生怪异事件的传言之后来到高特立姆的。如果冒险者中有人属于某个派别，该派别的代表甚至可能会跟进人物自己提供的信息。更多信息请参见 \"建立联盟\"。",
	"The celebration serves both to welcome the adventurers, who are seated at the high table with Bruenor, and to provide an opportunity for the representatives of the different factions to gather socially and be officially introduced to the adventurers. In addition to the king and his allies, a number of dwarves from Bruenor's court and important citizens of Gauntlgrym are also present. The feast is also an opportunity for you to include NPCs of your choice who might either be from or visiting Gauntlgrym, or part of the entourage of one of the representatives.": "庆祝活动既是为了欢迎冒险者，他们与布鲁诺一起坐在高桌旁，也为不同派别的代表提供了一个社交聚会和正式介绍冒险者的机会。除了国王和他的盟友之外，一些来自布鲁诺宫廷的矮人和冈特格莱姆的重要公民也会出席。宴会也是一个机会，你可以让你选择的NPC参加，他们可能来自或访问Gauntlgrym，或者是某个代表的随行人员的一部分。",
	"This is a free-form scene, which you can play out as best suits your group. It can range from a detailed roleplaying session, with characters mixing and mingling with their potential allies and members of Gauntlgrym society, or just a brief description of the event and the characters' initial impressions of the faction representatives, before their later efforts to negotiate with those representatives for the factions' aid.": "这是一个自由形式的场景，你可以按照最适合你的小组的方式来进行表演。它可以是一个详细的角色扮演会议，人物与他们的潜在盟友和Gauntlgrym社会成员混杂在一起，或者只是对事件的简要描述和人物对派别代表的初步印象，然后再努力与这些代表谈判以获得派别的援助。",
	"If you want to add some intrigue or action, consider having one of the options from \"Enemies Among Us\" interrupt the feast, giving the characters an opportunity to demonstrate their abilities in front of their potential patron and allies. Rogue {@creature Fire Elemental||fire elementals} roaring out of the hearth or a disguised {@creature assassin} poisoning one or more of the representatives can completely change the scene.": "如果你想增加一些阴谋或行动，可以考虑让 \"我们中间的敌人 \"中的一个选项来打断宴会，让人物有机会在他们的潜在赞助人和盟友面前展示他们的能力。流氓（%0%）从壁炉中咆哮而出，或伪装的（%1%）毒死一个或多个代表，可以完全改变场景。",
	"Once the feast winds down, Bruenor excuses himself as the guests depart. Shortly thereafter, a servant comes to collect the characters and takes them to a private chamber where the king of Gauntlgrym awaits them. His previously friendly manner has turned grave.": "宴会一结束，布鲁诺就借口客人离开而离开了。此后不久，一个仆人来接他们，把他们带到一个私人房间，Gauntlgrym的国王在那里等着他们。他以前的友好态度已经变成了严肃。",
	"\"I've told the allies ye met tonight what ye told me,\" he says. \"I invited them here to learn what is happening, to share what we know, and to get their backing for what it is I propose.

	"\"I don't propose to send ye into the dark unprepared, and I hope ye make an impression on those gathered here so they'll support our cause and your mission. From all I've seen and heard, there's no one better to do what needs be done.": "\"我不打算让你们在毫无准备的情况下进入黑暗，我希望你们能给聚集在这里的人留下印象，这样他们就会支持我们的事业和你们的任务。从我所见所闻来看，没有人比你更适合做需要做的事。",
	"\"So, what say ye?\"": "\"那么，你们怎么说？\"",
	"Paraphrase Bruenor's speech as needed to handle interjections by the characters. The king provides honest answers to any questions. He truly does believe the characters represent the best option to find out more about the demonic threat, unless they've given him any reason to think otherwise.": "根据需要转述布鲁诺的讲话，处理人物的插话。国王对任何问题都给予诚实的回答。他确实相信这些人物是了解恶魔威胁的最佳选择，除非他们给了他任何其他的理由。",
	"Bruenor assures the adventurers they will have his gratitude and that of all Gauntlgrym—indeed, of all Faerûn—if they are successful. If the characters press for details or try to negotiate compensation for their service, the king points out that Gauntlgrym has considerable space, and he can offer them titles, property, and the products of the Great Forge as rewards. Such mercenary negotiation lowers Bruenor's opinion of the adventurers a bit, but he never loses his genial manner.": "布鲁诺向冒险家们保证，如果他们成功了，他和整个Gauntlgrym--实际上是整个Faerûn--都会对他们表示感谢。如果冒险者们要求了解细节或试图就他们的服务进行谈判，国王会指出Gauntlgrym有相当大的空间，他可以为他们提供头衔、财产和大锻造厂的产品作为奖励。这样的雇佣兵谈判使布鲁诺对冒险者的评价降低了一些，但他从未失去他的和蔼可亲的态度。",
	"If the characters are agreeable, the king tells them the next step is to bring the various factions on board. One of the reasons he is looking to the adventurers to lead a new mission into the Underdark, apart from their experience, is that they can serve as brokers among all the various parties with an interest in the mission. They need to meet with the different faction representatives, emphasizing the importance of getting the Zhentarim to agree to grant access to Mantol-Derith. Otherwise, the journey to locate Gravenhollow is likely to be much longer and more difficult.": "如果人物同意，国王告诉他们，下一步是让各派别加入进来。他希望冒险家们带领一个新的任务进入暗黑世界，除了他们的经验之外，其中一个原因是他们可以作为所有对任务感兴趣的各方的中间人。他们需要与不同的派别代表会面，强调让赞塔林同意准许进入曼托尔-德利斯的重要性。否则，找到格雷文霍洛的旅程可能会更长，更困难。",
	"The legendary Bruenor Battlehammer is a good dwarf and king, and always has the best interests of his people and home at heart. He is drawn to help characters who follow a strong moral and ethical code, and often seeks their help in return. Use his good humor and folksy demeanor to help endear him to the players. The more the players grow to like him, the easier it is for them to respect his advice and request—and to gain more resources and assistance from him in turn.": "传说中的布鲁诺-战锤是一个善良的矮人和国王，他总是以他的人民和家园的最佳利益为重。他被吸引去帮助那些遵循强烈的道德和伦理准则的人物，并经常寻求他们的帮助作为回报。利用他的幽默感和平民化的举止来帮助玩家喜欢上他。玩家越是喜欢他，就越容易尊重他的建议和要求，并反过来从他那里获得更多的资源和帮助。",
	"Even Gauntlgrym isn't entirely safe, nor is it immune to the influence of the demon lords. During the characters' time in the city, you can implement one or more of the following threats to challenge them—and to potentially disrupt their negotiations with the factions.": "即使是Gauntlgrym也不是完全安全的，它也不能免于恶魔领主的影响。在人物在城中的时间里，你可以实施以下一种或多种威胁来挑战他们--并有可能破坏他们与各派别的谈判。",
	"One of the characters' traveling companions is revealed as a traitor or succumbs to madness. This NPC secretly serves one of the demon lords and turns against the adventurers.": "人物的一个旅伴被揭发为叛徒或屈服于疯狂。这个NPC暗中为某个恶魔领主服务，并转向反对冒险者。",

	"Maegera roars within its prison, stirred by the madness and chaos growing within the depths of the Underdark. As a natural reaction to this new stress upon itself, the primordial spawns a trio of {@creature Fire Elemental||fire elementals} that attack the Vault of Kings, setting fire to marketplaces and unleashing chaos upon the dwarven residents. If defeated or somehow convinced to return to the Fiery Pit, the elementals dissipate peacefully and Maegera falls dormant once again... for now.": "迈格拉在它的监狱里咆哮，被地下城深处的疯狂和混乱所激起。作为对这种新的压力的自然反应，原始元素产生了三个（%0%），它们袭击了国王金库，在市场上放火，给矮人居民带来混乱。如果被打败或被说服返回火坑，这些元素就会平静地消散，麦格拉再次陷入休眠...暂时。",

	"King Bruenor is the original proponent of the adventurers returning to the Underdark to gather additional information, but he knows that success requires the support of the other factions—particularly the Zhentarim. He doesn't, however, have the power to command the factions to help—and in some cases, can't even openly negotiate with them. As King of Gauntlgrym, he can't be seen to favor one faction over another. He is therefore relying on the characters to do the legwork of getting the different factions on board.": "布鲁诺国王是冒险家们返回暗黑世界收集更多信息的最初倡导者，但他知道成功需要其他派系的支持--尤其是赞塔林。然而，他没有权力命令各派别提供帮助--在某些情况下，甚至不能与他们公开谈判。作为Gauntlgrym的国王，他不能被视为偏袒某一派别。因此，他要依靠人物来完成让不同派别加入的工作。",

Those who maintain it as a trade hub have resisted any urge for expansion, apart from installing basic infrastructure to assist with commercial activities.": "Mantol-Derith作为一个中立的前哨站已经持续了几个世纪，在这里，乌鸦、duergar、svirfneblin和地表居民可以会面和交易而不用担心他们的生命。尽管曼托尔-德里斯很有用，也很安全，但它从未成为一个合适的城镇。那些将其作为贸易中心的人，除了安装基本的基础设施以协助商业活动外，一直抵制任何扩张的冲动。",

He paid Yantha Coaxrock, an honest svirfneblin mage, to appraise the jewel, hoping that he could use it to buy back the goodwill of his clan. Touched by the gem's madness, Yantha lied to Krimgol and told him the gem was worthless. She offered a lump of gold in exchange, whereupon Krimgol suspected treachery and demanded the gem's immediate return. While Krimgol and Yantha argued, one of Yantha's apprentices tried to hide the gem for his mistress but succumbed to its evil power. The apprentice, Flink, took the gem to the drow enclave, hoping to trade it for some rare spell components that he imagined Yantha needing to make Krimgol go away. A gargoyle assigned to watch for thieves spotted the gem and wrested it from Flink, who hid for fear of incurring Yantha's wrath. Soon thereafter, the delusional gargoyle laid eyes on a drow assassin named {@creature Kinyel Druu'giir|OotA} and was instantly smitten by her.

	"Much of this middle section of the adventure is free-form, dictated largely by the characters' decisions and tactics. The adventurers' immediate destination is the legendary library of Gravenhollow (see {@area chapter 11|3cb|x}), where they gain information that likely takes them to the tower of Araj, home of the mysterious drow archmage {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}. However, the characters are free to explore and visit different places before and after they explore Gravenhollow and unlock its secrets.": "冒险的中间部分大部分是自由的，主要由角色的决定和战术决定。冒险者的直接目的地是传说中的Gravenhollow图书馆（见{@area chapter 11|3cb|x}），他们在那里获得的信息可能会把他们带到Araj塔，神秘的乌鸦大法师（%1%）的家。然而，在探索Gravenhollow和解开它的秘密之前和之后，人物可以自由探索和访问不同的地方。",
	"The events described in chapters 13 through 16 can be interspersed among the material in this part of the adventure, as the characters work to fully understand the new menaces that have appeared in the Underdark, seek new allies and information, and ultimately attempt to create a plan to end the demon lord threat.": "第13章到第16章中描述的事件可以穿插在这部分冒险的材料中，因为角色们要努力充分了解暗黑世界出现的新威胁，寻找新的盟友和信息，并最终试图制定一个计划来结束恶魔领主的威胁。",
	"Character advancement through this section of the adventure is important. The journey from Mantol-Derith to Gravenhollow should involve sufficient encounters and challenges for the characters to reach 10th level by the time they visit the stone giant library. As the characters travel from place to place, check for random encounters as normal (see {@area chapter 2|07f|x}), but swap out the creature encounters with ones presented in this chapter. Ideally, the characters should be 14th level by the time they crash Zuggtmoy's wedding (chapter 16, \"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15}\"), and 15th level for the final showdown against the demon lords (see chapter 17, \"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}\").": "通过这一部分的冒险，角色的提升是很重要的。从Mantol-Derith到Gravenhollow的旅程应该有足够的遭遇和挑战，使角色在访问石巨人图书馆时达到10级。当角色从一个地方走到另一个地方时，像往常一样检查随机遭遇（见{@area chapter 2|07f|x}），但是要把生物遭遇换成本章介绍的遭遇。理想情况下，在他们撞破Zuggtmoy的婚礼时（第16章，\"{@adventure The Fetid Wedding|OotA|15}\"），人物应该达到14级，在与恶魔领主的最后决战中达到15级（见第17章，\"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}\"）。",
	"The characters initially traveled through the Underdark as a small group, perhaps joined by a few of their fellow prisoners from Velkynvelve and other allies they met along the way. Now, they return to the subterranean realm at the head of a group of allies that might outnumber the adventurers four-to-one, depending on how many NPCs were recruited from the factions in Gauntlgrym (see {@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}). This changes some of the conditions described in \"{@area Underdark Travel|051|x}\" in chapter 2.": "这些角色最初是以一个小团体的形式穿越地下世界的，也许还有一些来自维尔基维尔的囚犯和他们在路上遇到的其他盟友加入。现在，他们在一群盟友的带领下回到了地下世界，这些盟友的人数可能超过冒险者的四分之一，这取决于从Gauntlgrym的派别中招募了多少NPC（见{@adventure chapter 8|OotA|7}）。这改变了第二章\"{@area Underdark Travel|051|x} \"中描述的一些条件。",
	"When dealing with combat between large groups of creatures—either the adventurers' allies or their foes—you might wish to use the guidelines under \"{@book Handling Mobs|DMG|8|Handling Mobs}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. In some cases, you can simply match forces on one side with those on the other and assume they neutralize each other—for example, a band of shield dwarves fighting for the adventurers against a band of orcs. During such combat, the force on the losing side is wiped out while the winning force suffers a few casualties—anywhere from 10 to 50 percent—based on how difficult you judge the combat was for them.": "当处理大群生物之间的战斗时--无论是冒险者的盟友还是他们的敌人--你可能希望使用《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中\"{@book Handling Mobs|DMG|8|Handling Mobs} \"下的准则。在某些情况下，你可以简单地将一方的力量与另一方的力量相匹配，并假设他们互相抵消--例如，一队盾牌矮人为冒险者与一队兽人作战。在这样的战斗中，失败一方的部队被消灭了，而胜利一方的部队则遭受了一些伤亡--从10%到50%不等，这取决于你判断战斗对他们的难度。",
	"The tunnels and passages of the Underdark aren't easy routes through which to lead a large group of NPCs. When the characters set out, have the players describe how their expeditionary force is arrayed while traveling in single file, two abreast, and in open formation in wide-open spaces. Also ask the players if any of the NPCs are scouting ahead or serving as a rear guard (see \"{@area Scouting|399|x},\" below) or if the larger party remains in close formation at all times.": "地下城的隧道和通道并不容易带领一大群NPC通过。当人物出发时，让玩家描述他们的远征军是如何列队的，同时以单列、两列和开放的队形在宽阔的空间行进。还要问玩家是否有NPC在前面侦查或充当后卫（见下面的\"{@area Scouting|399|x}\"），或者大部队是否一直保持紧密队形。",
	"The marching order affects where and how different encounters might occur, particularly if they happen while characters are marching single file or two abreast. A threat approaching from above, below, or the flank could strike the middle of the expanded party, making it difficult for the characters at either end to reach it. Likewise, spellcasters must be aware of the allies around them at all times when casting area spells that don't solely target enemies.": "行军顺序会影响到不同遭遇的发生地点和方式，特别是如果它们发生在人物单排或两排行进时。从上方、下方或侧翼接近的威胁可能会袭击扩大的队伍的中部，使两端的角色难以到达。同样地，施法者在施放不只针对敌人的区域性法术时，必须随时注意他们周围的盟友。",
	"The pace of Underdark travel remains as outlined in {@area chapter 2|051|x}, and the characters move no slower for traveling with a larger party. Although a portion of the expeditionary force might be mounted on giant lizards, the lizards travel at the pace of the rest of the party unless they move out ahead.": "地下城旅行的速度仍然与{@area chapter 2|051|x}中所描述的一样，而且人物在与较大的队伍一起旅行时，移动速度不会慢。尽管一部分远征军可能骑在巨型蜥蜴身上，但除非蜥蜴走在前面，否则它们会以其他队伍的速度前进。",
	"As noted in {@area chapter 2|051|x}, a fast pace makes it harder for characters to spot ambushers or items of interest, and prevents characters from foraging. A slow pace improves chances of foraging. However, even while traveling at a slow pace, the characters and the NPCs can't use stealth, since they are too large a group to go unnoticed. {@skill Stealth} is an option only for a smaller scouting party traveling away from the main force (see \"{@area Scouting|399|x}\").": "如{@area chapter 2|051|x}所述，快节奏使角色更难发现伏击者或感兴趣的物品，并阻止角色觅食。缓慢的步伐可以提高觅食的机会。然而，即使在慢速旅行时，人物和NPC也不能使用隐身术，因为他们的队伍太大，不可能不被注意。{@skill Stealth}只适用于远离大部队的小型侦察队（见\"{@area Scouting|399|x}\"）。",
	"While traveling as part of a larger group, the characters have an easier time navigating their way through the Underdark than they did during their initial escape. The characters' own experience, plus that of their followers, along with maps and other information they might have acquired in Gauntlgrym or elsewhere, give all members of the expanded party advantage on any Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks to avoid becoming lost (see chapter 5, \"{@book Adventure Environments|DMG|5|Becoming Lost},\" of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "在作为大队伍的一部分旅行时，角色们在暗黑世界中的导航比他们最初逃跑时更容易。角色们自己的经验，加上他们的追随者的经验，以及他们在Gauntlgrym或其他地方可能获得的地图和其他信息，使扩大的队伍中的所有成员在任何智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查中都有优势，以避免迷路（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的第五章，\"{@book Adventure Environments|DMG|5|Becoming Lost}\"）。",
	"A portion of the expanded party can break off in order to travel some distance ahead, scouting for the right path while remaining on the lookout for potential hazards. A smaller group might also lag behind, serving as a rearguard watching for threats coming up behind the characters as they travel. NPCs can serve as scouts or members of a rearguard as the players wish. Some of the adventurers might choose to do so as well.": "一部分扩大的队伍可以分开，以便在前面走一段距离，探寻正确的道路，同时保持对潜在危险的警惕。一小部分人也可以落在后面，作为后卫，在他们旅行时注意后面的威胁。NPC可以按照玩家的意愿充当侦察兵或后卫成员。一些冒险者也可能选择这样做。",
	"A smaller scouting group can make use of stealth to travel unnoticed. If a random encounter occurs during the journey, characters in the scouting party discover it first and can choose whether to avoid or deal with the encounter. If characters in the scouting party notice the encounter without being seen themselves, they can retreat back to the main force to inform the other characters. Similarly, if a random encounter escapes the scouting characters' notice, the encountered creatures can lie in wait for the rest of the characters in order to ambush them.": "一个较小的侦察队可以利用隐身术在无人注意的情况下旅行。如果在旅途中发生了随机的遭遇，侦察队中的人物会首先发现它，并可以选择是避免还是处理这个遭遇。如果侦察队中的人物注意到了这个遭遇，而自己却没有被发现，他们可以退回到主力部队，通知其他人物。同样地，如果随机遇到的情况逃过了侦察队角色的注意，那么遇到的生物可以埋伏在其他角色身边，以便伏击他们。",
	"No longer a ragtag band of survivors and prisoners, the adventurers are now in command of a dedicated force of NPC followers. In addition to the advantages that brings, the characters must assume leadership roles as they deal with allies who might not entirely trust or respect them—or each other. Add in the dangers of the Underdark, along with the unpredictable influence of demonic madness, and the characters have several new challenges that must be faced.": "冒险家们不再是由幸存者和囚犯组成的破烂不堪的队伍，他们现在指挥着一支由NPC追随者组成的专门部队。除了带来的好处外，人物必须承担领导角色，因为他们要与可能不完全信任或尊重他们或彼此的盟友打交道。再加上暗黑世界的危险，以及恶魔的疯狂带来的不可预测的影响，角色们有几个必须面对的新挑战。",
	"Although the NPCs the characters lead are ostensibly allies, many belong to different factions, and old grudges and differences in ethos aren't easily set aside. Personality conflicts might arise among the followers in the expanded party, and the adventurers would be well advised to head off potential trouble. For example, having Lords' Alliance troops acting as scouts while keeping Zhentarim mercenaries close at hand will help keep those factions from fighting.": "虽然人物领导的NPC表面上是盟友，但许多人属于不同的派别，旧时的怨恨和精神上的差异不容易被搁置。在扩大的队伍中，追随者之间可能会出现性格上的冲突，冒险家们最好能避免潜在的麻烦。例如，让领主联盟的部队充当侦察兵，同时让赞塔林的雇佣兵近在咫尺，将有助于防止这些派别发生冲突。",
	"In this phase of the campaign, the characters are moving toward the demon lords and their influence rather than away from it, even as the Underdark sinks deeper into madness and chaos. The characters will make saving throws against acquiring levels of madness, as called for in different encounters and whenever you feel it is appropriate. (See {@area chapter 2|063|x} of the adventure for more information on madness.)": "在活动的这一阶段，角色们正朝着恶魔领主及其影响的方向发展，而不是远离它，即使地下城在疯狂和混乱中陷得更深。角色们将根据不同遭遇的要求，在你认为合适的时候，对获得的疯狂程度进行蓄力攻击。(关于疯狂的更多信息，请参见冒险的（%0%）。",
	"The NPCs following the characters into the Underdark are just as vulnerable to demonic madness. However, rather than make saving throws or track madness levels for each individual NPC, use the Random Events table in this chapter to determine when madness appears among those followers.": "跟随角色进入暗黑世界的NPC也同样容易受到恶魔的疯狂影响。然而，与其为每个NPC做拯救动作或追踪疯狂程度，不如使用本章的随机事件表来决定疯狂何时出现在这些追随者中。",
	"When madness appears among the NPCs, use it not just for its mechanical effects but to create real complications for the adventurers. For example, if the Random Events table indicates that one member of the expanded party suffers long-term madness, you might decide to bestow extreme paranoia on that NPC. In addition to the effect of Wisdom and Charisma checks, that character might believe that the adventurers are actually agents of the demon lords, and are intent on leading the NPCs to their doom.": "当疯狂出现在NPC中时，不仅要利用它的机械效果，还要为冒险者创造真正的复杂情况。例如，如果随机事件表显示，扩大的一方中的一个成员遭受了长期的疯狂，你可能会决定将极端的偏执赋予那个NPC。除了智慧和魅力检查的效果外，该角色可能会认为冒险者实际上是恶魔领主的代理人，并打算将NPC引向他们的末日。",
	"Having the adventurers leading an expanded party gives you the opportunity to use the optional loyalty rules in chapter 4, \"{@book Creating Nonplayer Characters|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty},\" of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}. You can track the loyalty scores of groups of NPCs, such as those belonging to each faction, rather than having to track NPCs individually. The characters must balance the goals and bonds of their followers in order to maintain and improve their loyalty.": "让冒险者带领一个扩大的队伍，让你有机会使用《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第四章\"{@book Creating Nonplayer Characters|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty} \"中的可选忠诚度规则。你可以追踪NPC群体的忠诚度分数，比如属于各派系的NPC，而不必单独追踪NPC。人物必须平衡其追随者的目标和纽带，以维持和提高他们的忠诚度。",
	"The factions in Gauntlgrym see to it that the expeditionary force is well provisioned with whatever the characters' expeditionary force can carry. Food and water aren't easy to come by in the Underdark, as the characters know all too well, and supplies must be managed and safeguarded.": "在Gauntlgrym的各派系会确保远征军有充足的供给，只要角色的远征军能够携带。食物和水在暗黑世界并不容易得到，这一点角色们都很清楚，物资必须得到管理和保障。",
	"If the expeditionary force needs to supplement or replace supplies while traveling, the amounts that characters are able to find become more important with a larger group to support. See \"{@book Foraging|DMG|5|Foraging}\" in chapter 5 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, as well as the guidelines in {@area chapter 2|067|x} of this adventure.": "如果远征军在旅行中需要补充或更换物资，那么在支持更大的队伍时，人物能够找到的数量就变得更加重要。请参阅《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第五章的\"{@book Foraging|DMG|5|Foraging}\"，以及本冒险的{@area chapter 2|067|x}中的指南。",
	"Just as they must ensure sufficient supplies for all the NPCs, the characters need to think about how best to share the spoils of encounters and adventures with their followers. Although the NPCs all accompany the adventurers out of loyalty to their factions—and on orders from their superiors in Gauntlgrym—the characters' treatment of the NPCs influences the loyalty of those followers during the mission into the Underdark.": "就像他们必须确保为所有的NPC提供足够的补给一样，角色需要考虑如何最好地与他们的追随者分享遭遇和冒险的战利品。虽然NPC都是出于对自己派系的忠诚而陪伴冒险者的，而且是在Gauntlgrym的上级的命令下，但在进入暗黑世界的任务中，角色对NPC的处理影响了这些追随者的忠诚度。",
	"The characters should come up with some means for dividing any treasure taken on the expedition between the NPCs. As long as the division is reasonably fair, most of the followers will be content. However, the NPCs will complain if all the choice pieces of treasure go to the adventurers.": "角色们应该想出一些办法，在NPC之间分配远征中获得的任何财宝。只要分得合理公平，大多数追随者都会感到满意。但是，如果所有选择的宝物都归冒险者所有，NPC们就会抱怨。",
	"The characters might also need to contend with the problem of theft, whether NPCs stealing from spoils not yet divided, stealing from the adventurers, or stealing from each other. Such theft might be driven by sheer greed, or it could be a manifestation of madness. A bout of long-term madness could easily lead to obsession with particular items of treasure—especially magic items—with an obsessed NPC willing to steal or even kill to obtain them.": "角色们可能还需要面对偷窃的问题，无论是NPC从尚未分到的战利品中偷窃，还是从冒险者那里偷窃，或者是互相偷窃。这种偷窃可能是由纯粹的贪婪驱动的，也可能是一种疯狂的表现。长期的疯狂很容易导致对特定宝物的痴迷--特别是魔法物品--痴迷的NPC愿意去偷窃甚至杀人来获得它们。",
	"The adventurers are in command of their NPC followers, and that means they are responsible for welding together disparate forces and maintaining discipline. The characters have a bit of an advantage in this regard, in that the NPCs placed under their command are all well-trained faction operatives, not raw recruits or mercenaries. However, some of these seasoned personnel might question the right of a ragtag band of adventurers to command them, even if their superiors seem to trust the player characters. Likewise, though the individual factions are typically disciplined within their own ranks, members of any faction might bristle at having to work alongside (much less take orders from) members of other factions.": "冒险家们负责指挥他们的NPC追随者，这意味着他们要负责将不同的部队焊接在一起并维持纪律。这些角色在这方面有一点优势，因为在他们指挥下的NPC都是训练有素的派系特工，而不是生手或雇佣兵。然而，这些经验丰富的人员中的一些人可能会质疑一个破烂不堪的冒险者队伍指挥他们的权利，即使他们的上级似乎信任玩家角色。同样，尽管各个派别在自己的队伍中通常都很有纪律，但任何派别的成员都可能对不得不与其他派别的成员一起工作（更不用说接受他们的命令）感到不满。",
	"In addition to deciding how the expeditionary force is organized and distributed (see \"{@area Marching Orders|396|x}\"), the players must also institute a clear chain of command. One or more of the adventurers might be the field commanders of the expanded party, while others serve as lieutenants. Likewise, the adventurers might appoint some of the NPCs to command positions. Without a clear chain of command, information might not go to the right people, and decisions might not get made quickly enough—or at all. Adding to the challenge of maintaining discipline is the ever-present threat of demonic madness growing among the ranks, creating problems even for seasoned and professional troops (see \"{@area Heart of Darkness|39c|x}\").": "除了决定远征军的组织和分配方式外（见\"{@area Marching Orders|396|x}\"），玩家还必须建立一个明确的指挥系统。一个或多个冒险家可能是扩大的队伍的战地指挥官，而其他人则担任副手。同样地，冒险家们可以任命一些NPC担任指挥职务。如果没有一个明确的指挥系统，信息可能不会传递给正确的人，决定可能不会被迅速做出，或者根本就没有。在维持纪律方面的挑战还包括在队伍中不断增长的恶魔般的疯狂威胁，这甚至给经验丰富的专业部队带来了问题（见\"{@area Heart of Darkness|39c|x}\"）。",
	"If the expeditionary force is made up of diverse factions, the players also need to decide how much latitude to give those factions. For example, Zhentarim mercenaries might be eager to torture prisoners for information unless the characters put a stop to it, and members of the Emerald Enclave might place a higher priority on maintaining the balance of nature in the Underdark than on political struggles.": "如果远征军是由不同的派别组成的，玩家还需要决定给这些派别多少自由度。例如，Zhentarim雇佣兵可能会急于折磨囚犯以获取信息，除非角色们加以制止，而翡翠飞地的成员可能会把维护暗黑世界的自然平衡看得比政治斗争更重要。",
	"You can change up the feel of these later chapters of {@i Out of the Abyss} by allowing the players to take on the roles of their faction allies as well as their regular characters. This can range from letting each player control the overall actions of the NPCs in a single faction, to creating multiple subgroups so that characters can split off and have their own adventures. While this involves a good deal more coordination among the game group, it can add a lot of detail, intrigue, and interaction to the campaign.": "你可以通过让玩家扮演他们的派系盟友以及普通角色，来改变{@i Out of the Abyss}这些后期章节的感觉。这可以从让每个玩家控制一个派别中的NPC的整体行动，到创建多个分组，使角色可以分开并有自己的冒险。虽然这涉及到游戏组之间更多的协调，但它可以为活动增加很多细节、阴谋和互动。",

	"{@creature Veldyskar|OotA} is committed to the protection of the library and its librarians. If trouble arises, his philosophy is to petrify first and ask questions later. Initially, this presented a problem for the stone giant librarians, as the basilisk had some difficulty reconciling his temper and bestial nature with the recognition of what trouble might actually look like. The stone giants taught {@creature Veldyskar|OotA} how to cast {@spell greater restoration}, which the basilisk can do once per day to restore anyone who crosses him.": "{@creature Veldyskar|OotA}致力于保护图书馆和它的图书管理员。如果出现麻烦，他的理念是先石化，后问话。起初，这给石巨人图书馆员带来了一个问题，因为玄武岩很难将他的脾气和兽性与认识到麻烦可能是什么样子相协调。石巨人教会了{@creature Veldyskar|OotA}如何施放{@spell greater restoration}，巴斯里斯克每天可以施放一次，以恢复任何与他交手的人。",
	"A pair of massive basalt doors mark the entrance to Gravenhollow, flanked by stone giant statues that are actually {@creature Stone Golem||stone golems}.

	"This younger version of Stonespeaker Hgraam (see chapter 4, \"{@area Gracklstugh|15d|x}\") treats the characters as spirits and asks them philosophical questions about the nature of dreams. If the characters engage him in conversation, he bids them farewell with the words, \"I will remember you.\"": "这个年轻版的讲石人Hgraam（见第4章，\"{@area Gracklstugh|15d|x}\"）把人物当作灵魂，向他们提出关于梦的本质的哲学问题。如果人物与他交谈，他就用 \"我会记住你的 \"这句话向他们告别。",
	"This young male drow was cast out of Menzoberranzan after he lost his sight, yet he survived and found his way here. The blind drow came to the library hoping to overcome his blindness and take revenge on his family. Characters familiar with drow lore or history know, with a successful DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill History}) check, that House Oblodra was all but wiped out years ago.": "这个年轻的男性乌鸦在失去视力后被赶出了门佐伯兰山，然而他却活了下来，并在这里找到了自己的路。这个失明的乌鸦来到图书馆，希望能克服他的失明，为他的家人报仇。熟悉乌鸦传说或历史的人物知道，只要成功通过DC14智力（{@skill History}）检查，奥布罗德拉家族在多年前就已经被消灭了。",
	"The characters encounter echoes of all five members of the Society of Brilliance (see the \"{@area Society of Brilliance|0a9|x}\" random encounter in chapter 2). Any members of the society traveling with the party know that these are echoes from the past.": "角色们遇到了华明会所有五个成员的回声（见第二章中的\"（%0%）\"随机遭遇）。任何与队伍同行的社会成员都知道，这些是来自过去的回声。",
	"The Society of Brilliance came to Gravenhollow years ago on a pilgrimage of enlightenment. If the characters mention the demonic incursion and postulate a theory of drow involvement, the Society of Brilliance echoes confirm that such an event is inevitable, \"given the drow propensity for demon summoning and the inherent unpredictability of {@i faerzress}.\" These echoes don't have much else to offer, although they can explain how the library works (see the \"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x}\" sidebar).": "Brilliance协会多年前来到Gravenhollow，进行启蒙朝圣之旅。如果角色们提到了恶魔入侵，并推测出乌鸦参与的理论，那么华美协会的回声就会确认这样的事件是不可避免的，\"鉴于乌鸦有召唤恶魔的倾向，以及{@i faerzress}固有的不可预测性。\" 这些回声没有什么其他的内容，尽管他们可以解释图书馆是如何运作的（见\"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x} \"侧边栏）。",
	"This mind flayer regards the characters with interest. Xetzirbor refuses to disclose its timeline but hints that it knows about the demonic incursion. The mind flayer tries to entice the characters into telling it what they have discovered, but of its own purpose, Xetzirbor reveals only that it came to Gravenhollow to find a way to save a dying elder brain it calls Cyrog.": "这只噬心者饶有兴趣地看着这些人物。Xetzirbor拒绝透露它的时间线，但暗示它知道恶魔入侵的事情。弑心者试图引诱人物告诉它他们的发现，但对于自己的目的，Xetzirbor只透露了它来到格雷文霍尔是为了找到一种方法来拯救一个它称之为Cyrog的垂死长者的大脑。",

Ustova's quarters feature a collection of musical instruments and divination tools, including crystal orbs, bags of bones, and a large mithral basin.": "乌尔玛斯和乌斯托娃住在图书馆的顶层，占据了该层两端的所有住处。他们的房间反映了他们的职责和个性。乌尔玛斯的房间里收集了一些雕刻的石板，以及图书馆里其他地方没有的实际书籍和卷轴。乌斯托瓦的房间里有一系列的乐器和占卜工具，包括水晶球、骨头袋和一个大的密特拉尔盆。",
	"Ulthar lives on a lower level that he claims is \"near the bottom of the library,\" though such a distinction is meaningless given how distorted distance and direction can be in the library (see the \"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x}\" sidebar). His quarters are a work of art, covered with murals and wall carvings of his own design, along with workshops where he engages in crafting.": "Ulthar住在一个较低的楼层，他声称 \"靠近图书馆的底部\"，尽管鉴于图书馆里的距离和方向是如此的扭曲，这样的区分是没有意义的（见\"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x} \"侧边栏）。他的住处是一件艺术品，布满了他自己设计的壁画和墙雕，还有他从事手工制作的工作室。",
	"The guest quarters appear bare until a visitor chooses a room. The next time that room is entered, it is fully furnished according to the character's taste and needs.

	"The walkways that surround the central well are wide and mostly empty, with the occasional galeb duhr or visitor echo wandering about.

No matter how far down visitors go, there always appear to be more levels below.": "围绕中央水井的走道很宽，大部分是空的，偶尔有加莱布-杜尔（galeb duhr）或访客回声在附近徘徊。每一层都由一个井口组成，周围有一条宽阔的走道，连接着挖在周围墙上的房间。桥梁以固定的间隔穿过井口，也连接着通往上下两层的楼梯。无论游客往下走多远，下面似乎总是有更多的楼层。",
	"Not even the current librarians know who built Gravenhollow. All they know is that the library has existed since the dawn of giantkind.": "甚至现在的图书馆员都不知道是谁建造了Gravenhollow。他们所知道的是，图书馆从巨人的黎明开始就已经存在了。",

The magic that suffuses the library profoundly affects time and space, altering the perceptions and reality of all beings within its walls.": "格雷文霍尔是由一个泰坦巨石雕刻而成的，它的晶体被灌注了浓缩的魔法（%0%）。弥漫在图书馆中的魔力深刻地影响着时间和空间，改变了其墙内所有生命的感知和现实。",
	"The notion of space works strangely in Gravenhollow. The interior of the library continually expands as lore is added to it, but visitors can still traverse all its floors and chambers with ease. Only the most absentminded and scatterbrained become lost in Gravenhollow.": "空间的概念在Gravenhollow中的作用很奇怪。图书馆的内部随着传说的增加而不断扩大，但游客仍然可以轻松地穿越所有的楼层和房间。只有那些最心不在焉和最散漫的人才会在Gravenhollow迷失方向。",

	"Gravenhollow is a window into the passage of time and history, and the magic permeating the library blocks it off from the real world around it. Though divination magic works normally within the library, no divination effect used outside the library can discern any creature, object, or location within it.": "Gravenhollow是一个了解时间和历史流逝的窗口，弥漫在图书馆中的魔法将其与周围的真实世界隔离开来。虽然占卜魔法在图书馆内可以正常使用，但在图书馆外使用的占卜效果都无法辨别图书馆内的任何生物、物体或位置。",
	"Visitors to the library of Gravenhollow are expected to conduct themselves with decorum, and to refrain from arguments and violence. Creatures that incite conflict quickly draw the attention of the basilisk {@creature Veldyskar|OotA}, who is quick to use his Petrifying Gaze on troublemakers. If a threat arises that {@creature Veldyskar|OotA} can't handle, the library generates {@dice 3d6} galeb duhr to assist him.": "格雷文霍尔图书馆的来访者应保持礼貌，避免争吵和暴力。煽动冲突的生物很快就会引起巴斯里斯克（%0%）的注意，他很快就会对捣乱者使用他的石化凝视。如果出现了{@creature Veldyskar|OotA}无法处理的威胁，图书馆会产生{@dice 3d6}加勒布杜尔来协助他。",
	"Finding anything in Gravenhollow is an effort of will. Whenever a character seeks a specific location in the library (a particular floor or period of history, for example), the character must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom check to find that location. On a failure, the character takes a wrong turn and must make additional checks until successful. If led by one of the library's keepers, characters don't need to make checks to find the location they seek.": "在Gravenhollow中寻找任何东西都是一种意志的努力。每当一个角色在图书馆中寻找一个特定的位置（例如一个特定的楼层或历史时期）时，该角色必须成功地进行DC14智慧检查以找到那个位置。一旦失败，角色就会走错路，必须进行额外的检查直到成功。如果由图书馆的管理员带领，角色就不需要进行检定就能找到他们所寻找的位置。",
	"Gravenhollow's records are organized by rooms attuned to the past, the present, or the future. Each level has a random number of rooms, arranged without any apparent system other than the library's intuitive ability to direct visitors to where they want to go—or to where the library thinks they need to go.": "Gravenhollow的记录是由适应过去、现在或未来的房间组织的。每一层都有随机数量的房间，没有任何明显的系统安排，只有图书馆凭直觉将游客引向他们想去的地方，或图书馆认为他们需要去的地方。",
	"The library keeps its records on stone and crystal slabs, monoliths, and stelae fitting neatly in niches carved into the walls of every room.

	"These records contain only what the librarians were able to write down. Even with their network of messengers and informants, and the visions they receive using the powers of the library, the stone giants are still mortal creatures. As such, the giants' own understanding might limit the characters' ability to locate information in the library.": "这些记录只包含图书管理员能够写下的内容。即使有他们的信使和线人网络，以及他们利用图书馆的力量所获得的幻觉，石巨人仍然是凡人的生物。因此，巨人自身的理解力可能会限制人物在图书馆中查找信息的能力。",
	"The library's written records deal only with events in the Underdark and the history of giants. Like most stone giants, the librarians consider the surface world a realm of dreams, and what happens there is deemed less important than events in the Underdark.": "图书馆的书面记录只涉及地下城的事件和巨人的历史。和大多数石像巨人一样，图书馆员认为表面世界是一个梦境，那里发生的事情被认为不如暗黑世界的事件重要。",
	"To acquire information not inscribed in the records (including any events outside the Underdark), the characters need a {@item stonespeaker crystal|OotA} (see {@adventure appendix B|OotA|18}), after which they must find an appropriate archive to query events in the past, present, or future.": "要获得记录中没有记载的信息（包括暗黑世界以外的任何事件），人物需要一个{@item stonespeaker crystal|OotA}（见{@adventure appendix B|OotA|18}），之后他们必须找到一个合适的档案馆来查询过去、现在或未来的事件。",

Some of the records here date back to the mythic times of the earliest giant gods.": "这些房间里有很多颜色的水晶。乌尔萨和他的助手们定期将平板电脑、圆柱体和石碑从现在的档案室移到这些房间。这里的一些记录可以追溯到最早的巨神的神话时代。",
	"Characters can research the backgrounds of the primary settlements of the Underdark and any well-known characters who dwell there. This lets them know what to expect if they visit those sites in the future, or to better understand some of the events that occurred during a previous visit. For example, they can learn more information about {@creature Themberchaud|OotA}, about the drow siege and demonic assault of Blingdenstone, or any other part of the well-known history of Faerûn.": "角色可以研究暗黑世界主要定居点的背景以及居住在那里的任何知名人物。这让他们知道如果将来访问这些地方会发生什么，或者更好地了解以前访问时发生的一些事件。例如，他们可以了解更多关于{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}的信息，了解鸦人对布林登石的围攻和恶魔的袭击，或法鲁恩著名历史的任何其他部分。",

	"The records in these rooms detail the current state of the Underdark and the giant kingdoms.": "这些房间里的记录详述了地下城和巨人王国的现状。",
	"Reading the tablets in these archives provides a good overview of what is going on in the Underdark at the present time. The latest news has a delay of a few days and is often incomplete, becoming more detailed as Urmas obtains more information from his messengers and informants. The reports about the demons' invasion are sketchy and incomplete, but characters can still get a rough idea about which demon lord arrived where. They can learn that Zuggtmoy might be on the move to an undisclosed location, or follow the ravaging paths of Yeenoghu and Baphomet as they gather and rally the races that worship them. Unlike the bits and pieces of news about the other demon lords, a significant amount of information is known about the cults of Demogorgon festering under Gracklstugh, as events there directly affect the resident stone giant clan.": "阅读这些档案中的石板可以很好地了解目前暗黑世界的情况。最新的消息有几天的延迟，而且往往是不完整的，随着乌尔玛斯从他的信使和线人那里获得更多的信息而变得更加详细。关于恶魔入侵的报告是粗略的、不完整的，但人物仍然可以大致了解哪个恶魔领主到达了哪里。他们可以了解到Zuggtmoy可能正在向一个未公开的地点移动，或者跟随Yeenoghu和Baphomet的蹂躏路线，因为他们聚集和召集了崇拜他们的种族。与其他恶魔领主的零星消息不同的是，关于在格拉克尔斯图格地下发酵的德摩根教派的大量信息是已知的，因为那里的事件直接影响到常驻的石巨人部族。",
	"The rooms with Ustova's prophetic writings have inscriptions above the doorways that anyone who knows Dwarvish or Giant can decipher:": "有乌斯托瓦预言著作的房间在门口上方有铭文，任何懂矮人语或巨人语的人都可以破译。",
	"Unlike the other rooms in the library, these archives echo with the sound of running water. The wall niches containing the stone cylinders Ustova favors for scribing are also fountains, where water shimmers over crystals as it falls.": "与图书馆的其他房间不同，这些档案室回荡着流水的声音。装有乌斯托娃喜欢用来刻字的石柱的壁龛也是喷泉，水落下时在水晶上闪闪发光。",
	"The information in the Archives of the Future is uncertain, not only because Ustova focuses on prophecies but also because her visions detail potential futures, not definite outcomes. Urmas and Ustova compare notes often to validate their visions. The prophecies in these rooms are limited to the future of giantkind—and the trials still to come for those once-great races—because this is Ustova's sole interest.": "未来档案》中的信息是不确定的，不仅因为乌斯托娃专注于预言，还因为她的预言详细描述了潜在的未来，而不是确定的结果。乌尔玛斯和乌斯托娃经常比较笔记，以验证他们的幻觉。这些房间里的预言仅限于巨人族的未来，以及那些曾经伟大的种族仍将面临的考验，因为这是乌斯托娃唯一感兴趣的。",
	"As the characters explore the library, ideally after encountering an echo or two, they meet the venerable drow archmage {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}, accompanied by Kleve, a {@creature death slaad} bodyguard in its natural form. Vizeran is an {@creature archmage} with the following statistical modifications:": "当人物探索图书馆时，最好是在遇到一两个回声后，他们遇到了可敬的乌鸦大法师（%0%），他身边有一个自然形态的（%1%）保镖克莱夫。维泽兰是一个{@creature archmage}，有以下统计学上的修改。",

	"Vizeran can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: {@spell dancing lights} at will, {@spell darkness} once per day, {@spell faerie fire} once per day (spell save DC 15), and {@spell levitate} (self only) once per day.": "维泽兰可以天生施展以下法术，不需要任何材料成分。{@spell dancing lights}随心所欲，{@spell darkness}每天一次，{@spell faerie fire}每天一次（法术救赎DC15），以及{@spell levitate}（仅限自己）每天一次。",
	"While in sunlight, Vizeran has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.": "在阳光下时，维泽兰在攻击卷上有劣势，在依赖视觉的智慧（（%0%））检查上也是如此。",

	"Two figures approach—a withered drow clad in dark flowing robes, and a hulking gray-skinned monster resembling a spiky humanoid toad, its wide mouth full of razor-sharp teeth. The drow's pinched and lined face speak to his great age, and his red eyes narrow and appraise you carefully as he approaches.": "有两个人影走过来--一个是身穿深色飘逸长袍的枯萎的乌鸦，另一个是身材魁梧的灰皮怪物，像一只长满尖刺的人形蟾蜍，宽大的嘴里长满了锋利的牙齿。乌鸦那张皱巴巴的脸说明了他的年龄很大，当他走近时，他那双红色的眼睛缩小了，仔细地评估着你。",
	"Vizeran greets the adventurers cautiously, introduces himself and his companion, and asks what business brings them to Gravenhollow. He remains cool and polite, trying to avoid any tension for fear of inciting violence in this place.": "维泽兰谨慎地迎接冒险者，介绍了自己和他的同伴，并问他们来格雷文霍尔有什么事。他保持冷静和礼貌，试图避免任何紧张，因为害怕在这个地方煽动暴力。",
	"If the characters are willing to talk to him, Vizeran tells them he has opposed the tyranny of Lolth and her priestesses for centuries. He believes that some kind of demonic invasion of the Underdark is underway, and he has come to Gravenhollow to confirm his suspicions and make plans to combat it.": "如果人物愿意与他交谈，维泽兰会告诉他们，几个世纪以来他一直反对洛尔思和她的女祭司们的暴政。他认为暗黑世界的某种恶魔入侵正在进行中，他来到格雷文霍尔是为了证实他的猜测，并制定计划来对抗它。",
	"The drow archmage suggests that the adventurers make their own inquiries—and that they look in particular into Menzoberranzan and its archmage, Gromph Baenre. Vizeran then returns to his quarters, telling the adventurers how to seek the librarians if they don't already know how to do so.": "鸦人大法师建议冒险者们自己去调查--特别是调查门索布兰赞和它的大法师格罗姆夫-贝恩雷。然后维泽兰回到了他的住处，告诉冒险者们如果他们还不知道如何寻找图书馆员的话，该怎么做。",
	"During their time in the library, the characters can meet with Vizeran several times to exchange notes. The drow archmage already knows a lot of what has transpired since the demon lords arrived. He isn't, however, using the library to delve into specific events, so he welcomes the characters' input while remaining tight-lipped about his own intentions and goals.": "在图书馆的这段时间里，人物可以与维泽兰见几次面，交换笔记。鸦人大法师已经知道自恶魔领主到来后发生的很多事情。然而，他并没有利用图书馆来深入研究具体的事件，所以他欢迎人物的意见，同时对自己的意图和目标保持缄默。",
	"If the characters threaten Vizeran, Kleve looms menacingly nearby even as the archmage tries to keep things civil, pointing out that there is nothing to be gained by fighting. If the adventurers attack him or Kleve, Vizeran casts {@spell time stop} and departs before {@creature Veldyskar|OotA} shows up (see \"A Place of Peace\" in the \"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x}\" sidebar). Kleve becomes {@condition invisible} and follows his master out of Gravenhollow. Despite their attack upon him, the archmage contacts the characters again in an attempt to forge an alliance (see chapter 12, \"{@adventure The Tower of Vengeance|OotA|11}\").": "如果人物威胁到维泽兰，克莱夫就会在附近气势汹汹地出现，即使大法师试图保持文明，指出战斗没有任何好处。如果冒险者攻击他或Kleve，Vizeran会施展{@spell time stop}并在{@creature Veldyskar|OotA}出现之前离开（见\"{@area Gravenhollow: General Features|3e2|x} \"侧边栏中的 \"和平之地\"）。克莱夫变成了{@condition invisible}，跟着他的主人离开了格雷文霍尔。尽管他们对他进行了攻击，大法师还是再次联系了这些人物，试图建立一个联盟（见第12章，\"（%4%）\"）。",
	"If the characters set out to find a librarian, Ulthar is the one they find first. He and Urmas agree that current events in the Underdark are a serious concern, but their roles as record keepers prevent them from acting in any way other than to provide information. Ulthar will speculate that this is likely why the library allowed Vizeran and the characters to find it so easily.": "如果角色们开始寻找图书管理员，乌尔萨是他们首先找到的人。他和乌尔玛斯都认为暗黑世界的当前事件是一个严重的问题，但他们作为记录者的角色使他们不能以任何方式采取行动，只能提供信息。乌尔撒尔会推测，这很可能是图书馆允许维泽兰和人物如此轻易地找到它的原因。",

	"Characters can expend charges to confirm suspicions, fill in gaps in their knowledge, and see for themselves the events that brought the demon lords into the world. Such research might take several days. Ulthar doesn't give them another {@item stonespeaker crystal|OotA} to speed up the process, but the characters can try to steal one, as the trusting librarian keeps them on a shelf in his quarters.

	"Two myconids approach the site in awe, not minding the carpet of rot under their feet. You sense their minds come alive in wonder, and as they kneel in worship, you know they are doomed.

They are chanting, swaying to their own words. And then they stop as the glow of {@i faerzress} rises around them, whispering to them in unintelligible sounds. The derro cackle and dance, their hands glowing with a power that isn't theirs. The vision shifts, and suddenly gray dwarves stare down at the red-hot metal on their anvils. The constant rhythm of their hammering falters. Suddenly, brother turns against brother as minds turn inward upon themselves. Sparks fly and a city burns.": "你看到一圈小的蒙面人，他们的形体蜷缩而憔悴。他们的手势和动作都很生硬，显示出他们的疯狂。他们在吟唱，随着自己的话语摇摆。然后他们停下来，因为%0%的光芒在他们周围升起，用难以理解的声音对他们说悄悄话。德罗人咯咯地笑着，跳着舞，他们的手发着一种不属于他们的力量。视线转移，灰矮人突然盯着铁砧上烧红的金属。他们不断敲打的节奏出现了动摇。突然间，兄弟反目成仇，头脑向内转。火花飞溅，一座城市在燃烧。",

It has seen something. It understands a new secret, and its already unhinged mind plunges further into madness.": "你看到一只国宝在一个黑暗的地下湖的阴暗深处游动，不确定。它左转右转，试图找到一些东西，即使它被一种类似于蝠鲼的长牙生物所包围。Kuo-toa微笑着，它的针牙即使在黑暗中也闪闪发光。它已经看到了一些东西。它明白了一个新的秘密，而它那已经失去理智的头脑则进一步陷入疯狂。",

	"The vision shifts to a brightly lit cavern full of crude merchant stalls, where the duergar hands the gem to a svirfneblin for appraisal. The gnome refuses to return the gem, instead giving it to one of her svirfneblin apprentices. The young apprentice skulks away with the gem in his clutches, but is ambushed by a gargoyle. The gargoyle snatches the gem, flies away, and gives it to a female drow. The drow gazes into the black gemstone and sees a hideous demonic face looking back at her. Thoughts of murder and carnage fill her thoughts as she hides the gemstone on her person, draws her shortsword, and coats the blade with poison.": "视线转移到一个光线明亮的洞穴，里面摆满了简陋的商摊，地精把宝石交给一个svirfneblin进行评估。地精拒绝归还宝石，而是把它交给她的一个斯维尔夫林学徒。这个年轻的学徒抱着宝石溜之大吉，但却被一只巨妖伏击。妖怪抢走了宝石，飞走了，并把它交给了一个女乌鸦。女乌鸦凝视着黑色的宝石，看到一张狰狞的恶魔面孔回望着她。当她把宝石藏在身上，拔出短剑，在剑上涂上毒药时，她的脑海里充满了谋杀和屠杀的念头。",

	"Suddenly, {@i faerzress }bathes the dark and twisted hall in purplish light. A rift opens, and a hulking, horned figure that reeks of putrescence steps out. It raises a skull-tipped wand and points it at the dead elder brain. The elder brain begins to pulsate, and you see intermittent flashes of purple light under its rotting flesh. The mind flayers are aghast as the elder brain speaks to them once more, telling them that Orcus has saved Cyrog, and commanding them to follow it into undeath.": "突然，{@i faerzress }使黑暗而扭曲的大厅沐浴在紫色的光中。一个裂缝打开了，一个巨大的、散发着腐臭味的带角的人物走了出来。它举起一根带有骷髅头的魔杖，指向死去的长者大脑。长老的大脑开始跳动，你看到它腐烂的肉体下断断续续地闪烁着紫色的光。当长老的大脑再次对他们说话时，那些心灵传播者们都惊呆了，告诉他们奥库斯已经救了赛罗格，并命令他们跟随它进入不死状态。",

With your bloody glaive, you carve a swath through a forest of towering zurkhwood mushrooms that stands in your way. The tunnels beyond would confuse an ordinary mind, but you instinctively know the path you must walk. Every step brings you closer to a magma-filled chasm, lodged in which is an enormous contraption of metal and stone—a weapon capable of reshaping the Underdark itself.": "当你徘徊在迷宫般的地下通道时，血腥味充斥着你的鼻孔，当你的巨蹄踩碎脚下的石头时，你有目的地移动。{@i Faerzress}光线显示你的影子是个怪物，暗示着你是一个长着角冠的巨大野兽。你用你的血腥玻璃刀，在挡在你面前的高耸的紫檀木蘑菇森林中划出一道口子。外面的隧道会让一个普通人感到困惑，但你本能地知道你必须走的路。每一步都使你更接近一个充满岩浆的鸿沟，里面有一个巨大的金属和石头的装置--一个能够重塑地下世界的武器。",

	"If the characters seem hesitant to work with Vizeran, he reminds them of the peril facing the surface world should the demon lords escape from the Underdark. If the characters accuse Vizeran of having ulterior motives, the drow smiles thinly and agrees. Still, he insists his goal is the same as the characters' own, and he doesn't ask them to involve themselves in his other plans. He points out that he is by far the most inconsequential of the many evils that the characters must contend with.": "如果角色们似乎对与维泽兰合作犹豫不决，他就会提醒他们，如果恶魔领主从暗黑世界逃脱，表面世界将面临危险。如果角色们指责维泽兰别有用心，那么乌鸦薄薄地笑了笑，表示同意。不过，他还是坚持认为他的目标和人物的目标是一样的，而且他没有要求他们参与他的其他计划。他指出，到目前为止，他是人物必须与之抗争的众多邪恶中最不重要的一个。",
	"Vizeran invites the adventurers and their NPC followers to Araj, his tower and stronghold, where they can discuss the matter further.

	"As long as the characters remain respectful guests, the librarians don't mind them staying in Gravenhollow as long as they like.

	"The passage behind the secret door is narrow enough that you need to move through it single file, occasionally turning sideways to squeeze.

Unfortunately for him, his rise to power came at the same time as one of the other great arcane talents of the City of Spiders, Gromph Baenre. A scion of the First House and as gifted a schemer as he is a mage, Gromph engineered Vizeran's disgrace and exile as an unbeliever in Lolth. Ironically, this might have saved Vizeran's life, as House DeVir was wiped out not long thereafter by its rival, House Do'Urden.": "{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}是鸦人城市Menzoberranzan产生的最伟大的魔法人才之一。不幸的是，他的权力崛起与蜘蛛城其他伟大的魔法人才之一，格罗姆夫-贝恩雷同时出现。作为第一家族的后裔，格罗姆夫是个有天赋的阴谋家，他设计了维泽兰的耻辱，并将其作为洛尔兹的不信者流放。讽刺的是，这可能救了维泽兰的命，因为德维尔家族不久后就被它的对手杜尔登家族消灭了。",
	"Consigned to solitude in the Underdark, Vizeran didn't perish as most assumed he would. Instead, he put his arcane powers to work to create a safe haven for himself, and spent the following centuries in isolated study, furthering his mastery of the magical arts. He has watched from afar as countless events unfolded in the Underdark and across Faerûn, gathering information and making plans for his eventual return. After waiting for centuries, Vizeran now believes that time has come.": "维泽兰被安排在暗黑世界中孤独地生活，但他并没有像大多数人认为的那样灭亡。相反，他把他的奥术力量用于为自己创造一个安全的避风港，并在接下来的几个世纪里与世隔绝地学习，进一步掌握了魔法艺术。他从远处看着无数事件在暗黑世界和整个法鲁恩展开，收集信息并为他最终的回归制定计划。在等待了几个世纪之后，维泽兰现在相信时机已经到来。",

As a follower of the Elder Elemental Eye, Vizeran also despises Lolth and her influence over the drow.

	"Vizeran makes a powerful but dangerous ally. His plans and goals are entirely self serving, and he will sacrifice the characters without hesitation to further his schemes.

Kleve can change its form to appear as any Small or Medium humanoid, sometimes taking on the appearance of a deep gnome servant or a drow assistant to Vizeran if it wants to blend in. It can also cast {@spell invisibility} to observe silently from hiding, and relies on its true form when it wants to intimidate other creatures.

As long as Vizeran possesses the gem, the death slaad must obey him and can't be {@condition charmed}.": "克莱夫的控制宝石是一块烟色的水晶，维泽兰戴在他脖子上的链子上，在他的长袍下面。只要维泽兰拥有这颗宝石，死亡之剑就必须服从他，并且不能被{@condition charmed}。",
	"The only other person in Araj is Grin Ousstyl, Vizeran's {@creature drow mage} apprentice. A clever troublemaker from an out-of-favor house, Grin worked his way into the outlawed alliance of drow mages known as the Council of Spiders, but was careless and nearly executed for his ambition. Exiled from Menzoberranzan, he was taken in by Vizeran, who plays the role of a shadowy patron of the council. The young drow has continued his magical training under the archmage's tutelage.": "在Araj的唯一其他人是格林-奥斯提尔，维泽兰（%0%）的学徒。格林是个聪明的麻烦制造者，来自一个不受欢迎的家族，他通过自己的努力进入了被称为蜘蛛议会的非法鸦人法师联盟，但由于大意，他的野心几乎被处决。他被放逐出孟索伯兰山，被维泽兰收留，维泽兰在议会中扮演着一个阴暗的赞助人的角色。这个年轻的乌鸦在大法师的指导下继续他的魔法训练。",
	"Grin is loyal to his master but not well suited to such a solitary existence. He longs for the opportunity to return to Menzoberranzan, supporting the notion of an uprising to overthrow the matron mothers and end their rule. He is less enthused about the potential of turning his old home into a battlefield for the demon lords, however, and he eventually betrays Vizeran's confidence to the adventurers in an effort to prevent that outcome (see chapter 15, \"{@adventure The City of Spiders|OotA|14}\").": "格林对他的主人很忠诚，但不太适合这种孤独的生活。他渴望有机会回到Menzoberranzan，支持起义的概念，以推翻母夜叉并结束其统治。然而，他对把他的老家变成恶魔领主的战场的可能性不太感兴趣，他最终把维泽兰的信任出卖给了冒险者，以防止这种结果（见第15章，\"（%0%）\"）。",

Vizeran dismisses any questions about such matters, but Grin Ousstyl confides to the characters that Vizeran once kept bound minor demons and humanoid slaves in his service. Vizeran banished the demons with the arrival of the demon lords in the Underdark, fearing some hidden connection between the creatures of the Abyss. The slaves held by the drow archmage (most of them acquired from Gracklstugh) are all dead—either lost to madness and killed by Vizeran, or sacrificed as part of the preparations for the archmage's dark ritual. Grin Ousstyl doesn't speak directly of that latter fate, saying only that Vizeran's work can be hard on his assistants.": "一个在塔周围探查并成功通过DC15智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查的角色注意到最近在Araj出现过其他类人生物的迹象，包括丢弃的衣服、发霉的食物，以及嵌入塔内一些房间墙壁的锁链和手铐。维泽兰回绝了任何关于这些事情的问题，但格林-奥斯提尔向这些人物透露，维泽兰曾经保留了被捆绑的小恶魔和人形奴隶为他服务。随着恶魔领主的到来，维泽兰驱逐了这些恶魔，因为他担心深渊生物之间存在某种隐秘的联系。鸦人大法师所持有的奴隶（大部分是从格拉克尔斯图获得的）都已经死了--要么是失去了疯狂而被维泽兰杀死，要么是作为大法师黑暗仪式准备工作的一部分而被牺牲。格林-奥斯提尔没有直接谈及后一种命运，只说维泽兰的工作对他的助手们来说可能很辛苦。",

	"\"The only one of my kind who could ever match me in the Art is Gromph Baenre. I think we knew from the moment we met that we were destined to be rivals. But where I sought only to master the Art, Gromph was also an astute political manipulator. No more devout than I in the service of the Spider Queen, he arranged for my disgrace and exile. Deprived of my considerable skills, my house fell to our rival, House Do'Urden. Gromph became the Archmage of Menzoberranzan under the auspices of his own house, the First House of the Ruling Council.": "\"我的同类中唯一能在艺术方面与我匹敌的是格罗夫-巴恩雷。我想从我们相遇的那一刻起，我们就知道我们注定要成为对手。但我只追求掌握艺术，而格罗夫也是一个精明的政治操纵者。在为蜘蛛女王服务方面，他并不比我更虔诚，他安排了我的羞辱和流放。由于失去了我的大量技能，我的家族落入了我们的对手多乌尔登家族手中。格罗姆夫在他自己的家族--执政委员会第一家族的支持下，成为了门索伯兰赞的大法师。",
	"\"Gromph and I only ever had two things in common: our passion for the Art, and our hatred of the manner in which our fellow mages suffer at the hands of the matron mothers and mistresses of the drow.

Nonetheless, my observations revealed that he was crafting a unique ritual—one that somehow drew on the energy of {@i faerzress} to channel incalculable arcane power. When Gromph performed this ritual, the walls between the planes shuddered. Then, as you have by now realized, the demon lords were wrenched from their layers of the Abyss and cast about here in the Underdark. What we all witnessed in Gravenhollow confirms this.\"": "\"在这座流亡之塔上，我一直监视着格罗姆夫的活动。鉴于他多疑和谨慎的天性，这不是一件容易的事。尽管如此，我的观察显示，他正在制作一个独特的仪式--一个以某种方式利用（%0%）的能量来引导不可估量的奥术力量。当格罗姆夫举行这个仪式时，两个星球之间的墙壁颤抖了一下。然后，正如你现在已经意识到的那样，恶魔领主被从他们的深渊层中剥离出来，并被投掷到这里的暗黑世界。我们在格雷文霍尔目睹的一切证实了这一点。\"",

	"The intended purpose of Gromph's ritual is unclear, but Vizeran believes that his rival meant to summon and bind one specific demon lord. Vizeran finds it difficult to believe that even Gromph could be arrogant enough to think he could bind all the demon lords of the Abyss at once.": "格罗姆夫仪式的预期目的并不清楚，但维泽兰认为他的对手是为了召唤和束缚一个特定的恶魔领主。维泽兰发现很难相信，即使是格罗姆夫也会傲慢到认为他能同时束缚深渊的所有恶魔领主。",

Likewise, the ritual can be performed in any location in the Underdark imbued with {@i faerzress}. Vizeran has kept this information from the adventurers only because he sees the ritual as his chance to destroy Menzoberranzan and take his revenge on the drow who cast him out.": "在没有维泽兰的帮助下，冒险者是否能成功对抗恶魔领主，这取决于你。他们也许能够自己实施他的计划，特别是在他为他们提供了必要的组件和信息之后。为仪式而制作的{@i dark heart}护身符（见{@adventure chapter 15|OotA|14}）可以放在任何地方以吸引恶魔。同样地，仪式也可以在暗黑世界中任何一个被赋予（%2%）的地方进行。维泽兰对冒险者隐瞒了这些信息，只是因为他认为这个仪式是他摧毁孟索伯兰赞的机会，并向把他赶出去的乌鸦报仇。",
	"A player character spellcaster might be able to reproduce Vizeran's work to create and perform the ritual, setting up the scenario in chapter 17, \"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}.\" Regardless of how the plan unfolds, though, the adventurers should get the opportunity to choose what they'll do about Vizeran when they learn that the drow archmage has not been entirely truthful with them. See chapter 15, \"{@adventure The City of Spiders|OotA|14},\" for details.": "玩家角色的施法者可能会复制维泽兰的工作，创造并执行仪式，从而为第17章\"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16} \"中的情景做准备。不过，无论计划如何展开，当冒险者得知鸦人大法师对他们并不完全诚实时，他们应该有机会选择如何对待维泽兰。详见第15章\"{@adventure The City of Spiders|OotA|14}\"。",
	"If the characters don't take warmly to Vizeran's initial offer, they might want to enter Araj covertly instead of at the archmage's invitation. Likewise, once they realize that they are being used by Vizeran to advance his plan to destroy Menzoberranzan, the characters might decide to steal the archmage's secrets and resources to use against the demon lords—or even to slay him just for the sake of looting the place.": "如果角色对Vizeran最初的提议不感冒，他们可能会想秘密地进入Araj，而不是应大法师的邀请。同样地，一旦他们意识到他们被维泽兰利用来推进他摧毁Menzoberranzan的计划，人物可能会决定偷取大法师的秘密和资源来对付恶魔领主，或者甚至为了掠夺这个地方而杀死他。",
	"Getting to the tower undetected is all but impossible. Vizeran knows whenever the secret door accessing the passage to Araj opens, by way of a permanent magical effect similar to a powerful {@spell alarm} spell. Intruders also have to deal with the {@spell guards and wards} spell active within the tower, which places {@spell arcane lock} spells on all the doors and sets {@spell web} spells across the central shaft and stairways. Doors within the Tower of Vengeance (including the main door) have AC 16, 25 hit points, a damage threshold of 5, resistance to thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.": "不被发现地进入塔楼是完全不可能的。Vizeran知道每当通往Araj的通道的秘密门打开时，通过类似于强大的{@spell alarm}法术的永久魔法效果。闯入者还必须对付塔内活跃的{@spell guards and wards}法术，它在所有的门上设置了{@spell arcane lock}法术，并在中央轴和楼梯间设置了{@spell web}法术。复仇之塔内的门（包括主门）有AC16，25点命中率，伤害阈值为5，对雷霆伤害有抵抗力，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。",
	"A {@spell magic mouth} spell at the entrance to the tower activates when intruders try to open the door, shouting: \"You dare to enter here unbidden? Flee for your lives now, while you still can!\" Another {@spell magic mouth} placed outside Vizeran's sanctum repeatedly calls out: \"Intruders! Beware!\" when any intruder approaches within 20 feet of the sanctum door.": "当入侵者试图开门时，塔楼入口处的一个（%0%）法术就会启动，并大喊。\"你们竟敢擅自进入这里？趁着现在还能逃命，赶紧逃命吧！\" 另一个放置在维泽兰圣殿外的{@spell magic mouth}反复呼喊。\"入侵者! 小心！\"当任何入侵者接近圣殿门20英尺以内时。",
	"The tower's twenty-four suits of {@creature animated armor} attack anyone who enters Araj without Vizeran's permission, and continue attacking until they are destroyed or he calls them off. At the first sign of trouble, the {@creature death slaad} Kleve stalks intruders invisibly and attempts to attack with surprise. If Kleve is reduced to half its hit points, it retreats to its master's side.": "塔内的二十四套{@creature animated armor}攻击任何未经维泽兰允许而进入Araj的人，并继续攻击，直到它们被摧毁或他叫停。一旦有麻烦的迹象，{@creature death slaad}Kleve就会隐身跟踪入侵者，并试图进行突袭。如果Kleve被降低到一半的命中率，它就会撤退到主人的身边。",
	"Vizeran casts his protective spells before entering combat, along with {@spell invisibility} (renewing the death slaad's {@spell invisibility} as well if he has time). As a last-ditch escape, Vizeran casts {@spell time stop} and uses the opportunity to flee or make a risky {@spell teleport} attempt to a bolt-hole shelter he has hidden in another Underdark location of your choice.": "维泽兰在进入战斗前施展他的保护性法术，同时施展{@spell invisibility}（如果他有时间，也会更新死亡之剑的{@spell invisibility}）。作为最后的逃生手段，维泽兰施展了{@spell time stop}，并利用这个机会逃离或冒险{@spell teleport}到他隐藏在你选择的另一个地下城地点的螺栓孔庇护所。",
	"In the event the characters have the opportunity to loot Araj, they find the items listed under \"What Vizeran Offers,\" along with other treasure suitable for a foe of the archmage's power. See chapter 7, \"{@book Treasure|DMG|7|Random Treasure},\" of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for guidelines on creating Vizeran's treasury, keeping in mind that the wily drow has likely trapped his most powerful magic items. If he survives and escapes, Vizeran adds those who dare to threaten him and loot his home to the list of people who will suffer his revenge.": "如果人物有机会掠夺Araj，他们会找到 \"Vizeran提供的东西 \"下所列的物品，以及其他适合大法师这种力量的敌人的宝物。请参阅{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的第7章\"{@book Treasure|DMG|7|Random Treasure}\"，了解创建维泽兰宝库的指南，记住，狡猾的乌鸦很可能困住了他最强大的魔法物品。如果他幸存下来并逃脱，维泽兰会把那些敢于威胁他并掠夺他家的人加入到遭受他报复的名单中。",
	"Two of the components that Vizeran needs to craft the talisman for his ritual (see {@area chapter 12|426|x}) can be found relatively close to the archmage's tower. The Wormwrithings are a honeycomb of tunnels spanning hundreds of miles in the northern reaches of the Underdark, carved from the rock by enormous purple worms. A purple worm nest in the Wormwrithings is an ideal place to find an unhatched purple worm egg. Additionally, Vizeran has heard rumors of a beholder living in the Vast Oblivium, a chasm deep within the Wormwrithings. If the characters didn't obtain the central eye from {@creature Lorthuun|OotA} or Xazax (the beholders in chapter 9), they can search the Vast Oblivium for the beholder believed to lair there.": "在大法师的塔楼附近，可以找到维泽兰制作仪式用的护身符所需的两种材料（见（%0%））。虫洞是暗黑世界北部的一个蜂窝状隧道，横跨数百英里，由巨大的紫色蠕虫从岩石上雕刻而成。虫洞中的紫虫巢是寻找未孵化紫虫卵的理想场所。此外，维泽兰还听说有传言说，有一个看守者住在广袤的遗忘之地，那是一个深藏在虫域的鸿沟。如果人物没有从{@creature Lorthuun|OotA}或Xazax（第九章中的beholders）那里获得中央之眼，他们可以在Vast Oblivium寻找据信在那里藏身的beholder。",
	"The nearest purple worm nesting area mapped out for the characters by {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA} lies forty-eight miles west of the archmage's tower. The Vast Oblivium lies some twelve miles south of this nursery. Use the guidelines in {@area chapters 2|051|x} and {@area 10|397|x} as the party travels through the Underdark, but use the Wormwrithings Encounters table instead of the random encounter tables in chapter 2. Foraging is more difficult in the Wormwrithings, requiring successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks.": "最近的紫色蠕虫筑巢区由{@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}为人物绘制，位于大法师的塔楼以西四十八英里处。广袤的遗忘之地位于这个苗圃以南约十二英里处。当队伍穿越暗黑世界时，请使用{@area chapters 2|051|x}和{@area 10|397|x}中的指南，但请使用沃姆里辛斯遭遇表，而不是第二章中的随机遭遇表。觅食在蠕虫森林中更加困难，需要成功地进行DC20智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。",
	"{@i Faerzress} permeates only the fringes of the Wormwrithings. While the party explores this region of the Underdark, spellcasters won't have to deal with the effects described under \"{@area Faerzress|05f|x}\" in chapter 2.": "{@i Faerzress}只渗透在虫族的边缘地带。当队伍探索暗黑世界的这一区域时，施法者不必处理第二章中\"{@area Faerzress|05f|x} \"下所描述的效果。",

	"When an encounter occurs, roll a {@dice d6} to determine how the area is illuminated. A roll of 1 indicates the area is dimly lit by phosphorescent lichen, while a 2–6 indicates the area is dark. The twisting tunnels of the Wormwrithings give creatures the opportunity to surprise the characters (see \"{@area Noticing Threats|058|x}\" in chapter 2).": "当遇到这种情况时，掷出{@dice d6}来确定该地区的照明情况。掷出1表示该区域被磷光地衣照亮，而2-6表示该区域是黑暗的。Wormwrithings的曲折隧道给了生物惊喜的机会（见第二章的\"{@area Noticing Threats|058|x}\"）。",

	"Whether they're escorted by Shedrak or make their own way into Karazikar's Maw, the adventurers first encounter the {@creature beholder} as they cross the chasm. The beholder descends from the shadowy ceiling, staying at least 20 feet away from the bridge.": "无论他们是由Shedrak护送还是自己进入卡拉兹卡尔之口，冒险者们在穿越鸿沟时都会首先遇到（%0%）。观察者从阴暗的天花板上下来，离桥面至少有20英尺远。",
	"If the characters have come to talk, Karazikar hears them out. The beholder is supremely arrogant, and it speaks and understands only Deep Speech and Undercommon. If any of the characters bluff about having information of interest to the beholder, Karazikar mentions the Maze Engine, either to see if the adventurers know of it, or in a scoffing tone to suggest they can't possibly know anything that it has not already learned.": "如果人物是来说话的，卡拉兹卡尔会听他们说。这个人非常傲慢，他只说和听得懂 \"深层语言 \"和 \"地下语言\"。如果有任何角色虚张声势地说他们有对看守者感兴趣的信息，卡拉兹卡尔就会提到迷宫引擎，看看冒险者们是否知道它，或者用嘲笑的语气暗示他们不可能知道任何它还没有学会的东西。",
	"Killing Karazikar is the only way to claim the beholder's central eye for Vizeran. At the first hint of violence, the beholder uses its disintegration ray to disintegrate a 10-foot section of the bridge, hoping to plunge one of more party members into the chasm. It then targets enemies with its other eye rays and makes full use of its lair actions (see the {@i Monster Manual}). Against characters who attempt to hide from it, the beholder uses a lair action to cause an eye to open up on a wall with line of effect to a hiding creature, then attacks with one of its eye rays.": "杀死卡拉兹卡尔是为维泽兰夺取看守者中央眼睛的唯一途径。一有暴力迹象，看守者就会用它的瓦解射线瓦解10英尺长的桥段，希望能将更多的党员投入到鸿沟中。然后它用它的其他眼睛射线瞄准敌人，并充分利用它的巢穴行动（见（%0%））。对付那些试图躲避它的角色，看守者会使用巢穴行动使一只眼睛在墙上张开，并对躲藏的生物产生影响，然后用它的一条眼睛射线进行攻击。",
	"Karazikar's slaves fearfully scatter during any confrontation, but if Shedrak is alive, he protects his \"god\" as best he can. If the beholder is reduced to 45 or fewer hit points, it attempts to flee, ordering Shedrak (if he's still alive) to cover its retreat.": "卡拉兹卡尔的奴隶们在任何对抗中都害怕地四散奔逃，但如果舍德拉克还活着，他会尽力保护他的 \"神\"。如果看守者的命中率降到45或更低，它就会试图逃跑，命令Shedrak（如果他还活着）掩护它撤退。",
	"When the beholder is reduced to 0 hit points, its corpse slowly sinks, falling 10 feet at the start of every turn until it reaches the bottom of the chasm. A character within reach of the beholder can use an action to gouge out its central eye. There is also a 10 percent chance at the end of each turn that the beholder's corpse lands on a bridge.": "当注视者的生命值降至0时，它的尸体会慢慢下沉，在每个回合开始时下降10英尺，直到它到达鸿沟的底部。在看守者范围内的角色可以使用一个动作来挖出它的中央眼睛。在每个回合结束时，也有10%的几率使看守者的尸体落在一座桥上。",
	"If Karazikar and Shedrak are defeated, the beholder's slaves emerge from various tunnels, file out onto the bridges, and kneel in supplication, worshiping their liberators as gods. Each slave bears the brand of Karazikar on its forehead—a scar shaped like an open eye. The slaves are unarmed and include the following:": "如果卡拉齐卡尔和塞德拉克被打败了，看守者的奴隶们就会从各个隧道里走出来，排队到桥上，跪下来祈求，把他们的解放者当作神来崇拜。每个奴隶的额头上都有卡拉齐卡尔的烙印--一道疤痕，形状像一只睁开的眼睛。奴隶们都没有武器，包括以下几种。",

	"The beholder recently captured a strange mechanical creature that might know where the Maze Engine is located (see \"{@area Modron Prisoner|48c|x}\" below). The creature is locked in a room sealed with a rolling stone door.

	"Any slaves that don't join the party are anxious to make their way to the nearest peaceful Underdark settlement. The drow are eager to return to Menzoberranzan, the deep gnomes to Blingdenstone. If the characters urge the slaves to leave the Vast Oblivium and make their own way home, they are all killed while trying to escape from the Wormwrithings. If the characters assign members of their expeditionary force to lead the slaves out of the Wormwrithings, the slaves stand a much better chance of making it to safety.": "任何没有加入队伍的奴隶都急于赶往最近的和平地下城定居点。鸦人渴望回到门索布兰赞，深渊地精渴望回到布林登石。如果角色们敦促奴隶们离开广袤的遗忘之地，自己回家，那么他们在试图逃离虫族的时候都会被杀死。如果角色指派他们的远征军成员带领奴隶们离开虫洞，奴隶们就有更大的机会到达安全地带。",
	"The liberation of the Vast Oblivium makes a useful bit of backstory for introducing or reintroducing a character into the party. If an adventurer or NPC was lost in the Underdark, or if you want an NPC left behind at a settlement to put in a reappearance, have that character appear as a slave taken by Karazikar. Depending on the circumstances, the character might even join up with the adventurers during the final battle to defeat the beholder. Similarly, a new player character joining the party might start out as a prisoner of the beholder, now freed.": "解放广袤的遗忘之地是一个很有用的背景故事，可以用来介绍或重新介绍一个角色到党内。如果一个冒险者或NPC在暗黑世界中失踪了，或者如果你想让一个留在定居点的NPC重新出现，可以让这个角色作为被卡拉兹卡尔带走的奴隶出现。根据情况，这个角色甚至可能在最后的战斗中与冒险者们会合，以打败持币人。同样地，一个新加入的玩家角色可能一开始就是持刀者的囚犯，现在被释放了。",
	"One or more slaves can lead characters to a small room on the uppermost level of the complex. The room is sealed off with a 6-inch-thick circular stone door that can be rolled aside with a DC 20 Strength check or opened with a {@spell knock} spell or similar magic. The room holds a damaged {@creature duodrone} that Karazikar recently captured in the hopes of unlocking more information about the Maze Engine.": "一个或更多的奴隶可以带领人物到建筑群最上面一层的一个小房间。这个房间被一扇6英寸厚的圆形石门封住了，可以用DC20的力量检查将其卷到一边，或者用{@spell knock}的咒语或类似的魔法打开。房间里有一个被损坏的{@creature duodrone}，卡拉兹卡尔最近抓到了它，希望能解开更多关于迷宫引擎的信息。",
	"The duodrone has 1 hit point remaining and speaks its own language of clicks and whirs, always referring to itself as \"we\" or \"us.\" The demonic madness as scrambled its memory, but if a {@spell greater restoration} spell is cast on it, the modron remembers two things:": "二元龙还有1点命中率，说着它自己的点击和呼啸的语言，总是把自己称为 \"我们 \"或 \"我们\"。恶魔的疯狂扰乱了它的记忆，但如果对它施以{@spell greater restoration}的法术，莫德隆会记得两件事。",

	"The beholder used its disintegration eye ray to carve a rough likeness of itself in the ceiling of Karazikar's Maw—a great stone beholder face glaring down upon the gaping chasm, its central eye a hollow shaft that leads up to a hemispherical vault where the beholder hides its considerable hoard: 15,000 gp, 1,300 pp, ten assorted gems worth 500 gp each, a {@item gem of seeing}, a {@item necklace of adaptation}, and a {@item robe of eyes}.": "看守者用它的分解眼射线在卡拉齐卡之口的天花板上刻下了自己的大致模样--一张巨大的石头看守者的脸俯视着这条裂缝，它中央的眼睛是一根空心轴，通向一个半球形的穹顶，看守者在那里藏着它的大量囤积物。15,000金币，1,300PP，十颗各值500金币的宝石，一颗{@item gem of seeing}，一颗{@item necklace of adaptation}，和一颗{@item robe of eyes}。",
	"More of the components needed for Vizeran's demon summoning ritual can be found in the depths of the Labyrinth—a snarl of twisting tunnels and caves extending approximately 240 miles from north to south and 120 miles east to west. Navigating the Labyrinth is a nightmare, since most tunnels follow a straight path only a short distance before doubling back on themselves or ending abruptly.": "维泽兰的恶魔召唤仪式所需的更多组件可以在迷宫的深处找到--迷宫是由扭曲的隧道和洞穴组成的咆哮，从北到南延伸约240英里，从东到西延伸120英里。迷宫的导航是一场噩梦，因为大多数隧道只走了一小段直路，然后又折返回来或突然结束。",
	"Baphomet the Horned King appeared in the Labyrinth when the demon lords were summoned to the Underdark. At the same time, Baphomet's rival Yeenoghu, Demon Lord of Gnolls, has taken to hunting the twisting passages of Baphomet's new domain.": "当恶魔领主被召唤到地下城的时候，角王巴弗灭出现在迷宫中。与此同时，巴弗灭的对手地精魔王耶诺古（Yeenoghu）也开始在巴弗灭的新领域的曲折通道中狩猎。",
	"Vizeran tells the characters to find the Gallery of Angels, a location in the heart of the Labyrinth lies some three hundred miles from Araj. It is the one place where Vizeran knows the characters can find the angel feathers required for his ritual's talisman. The Maze Engine lies forty-eight miles deeper into the Labyrinth if the characters choose to follow up on clues leading there (see the \"{@area March to Nowhere|4b5|x}\" and \"{@area Maze Engine|4c8|x}\" sections for details). The adventurers will also find a few unexpected opportunities to aid in the fight against the demon lords along the way.": "Vizeran告诉角色们要找到天使长廊，这是一个位于迷宫中心的位置，距离Araj大约300英里。这是维泽兰知道人物可以找到他的仪式护身符所需的天使羽毛的一个地方。迷宫引擎位于迷宫深处48英里处，如果角色选择跟进通往那里的线索的话（详见\"（%0%）\"和\"（%1%）\"部分）。冒险家们还会发现一些意想不到的机会，以帮助他们对抗沿途的恶魔领主。",
	"Long ago, the Labyrinth was much like any other part of the Underdark, consisting largely of natural caverns connected by tunnels and underground rivers. The discovery of precious metals and gemstones led dwarves and others to excavate, extending its tunnels and expanding its caves. The results of those efforts saw an insignificant corner of the Underdark transformed into a vast, sprawling network of passages.": "很久以前，迷宫和暗黑世界的其他地方一样，主要由隧道和地下河连接的天然洞穴组成。贵重金属和宝石的发现促使矮人和其他人进行挖掘，延长隧道并扩大洞穴。这些努力的结果是，暗黑世界的一个微不足道的角落变成了一个巨大的、蔓延的通道网络。",
	"Abandoned settlements within the Labyrinth are common, marked out by rusting iron rails and scattered ore carts. Dark mine shafts descend into the unknown depths, while tunnels stretch off in random directions. Rifts both small and large also appear throughout. Many a tunnel ends abruptly at a rift, as if the way ahead was simply sheared off to leave a vast, yawning chasm. Some of these rifts run to depths of a few hundred feet. Others ascend and descend for miles. Many of the rifts show their age by the presence of carved switchback staircases along their walls, or weathered bridges spanning their gaps.": "迷宫内被遗弃的定居点很常见，由生锈的铁轨和散落的矿车标示出来。黑暗的矿井下沉到未知的深处，而隧道则向随机方向延伸。大大小小的裂缝也到处出现。许多隧道在裂缝处戛然而止，仿佛前面的路被剪断了，留下一个巨大的、打着哈欠的鸿沟。这些裂缝有的深达几百英尺。其他的则上升和下降了数英里。许多裂缝显示出它们的年龄，因为它们的墙壁上有雕刻好的回旋楼梯，或有风化的桥梁横跨其间隙。",
	"Characters in the Labyrinth can easily become lost. Traveling through this area follows the rules under \"{@area Navigating|05a|x}\" in chapter 2, but it takes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to avoid becoming lost, rather than a DC 10 check.

A character can puzzle out the reason why the modrons might be here by making a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. Success indicates that the character recalls stories about the Great Modron March, which occurs every 289 years and sees a vast army of modrons marching across the Outer Planes. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character also knows the last march happened over two hundred years ago, and that these modrons are likely remnants of that march. The tridrone doesn't admit this (not wanting to acknowledge its failure), though it might be convinced to follow the characters if they offer to lead the modrons out of the Labyrinth. Additionally, the tridrone knows the Labyrinth well, and befriending the modrons grants characters a +5 bonus to Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks made to navigate the region.": "一旦确信了角色的友好意图，三头龙就会告诉他们，它和它的伙伴们正在执行一项极其重要的任务，尽管它并没有透露这项任务的性质。角色可以通过进行DC20智力({@skill Arcana})检查来弄清摩德隆人可能在这里的原因。成功表明该角色想起了关于莫德隆大进军的故事，这个故事每289年发生一次，看到一支庞大的莫德隆军队在外星系中行进。如果检查成功5个或更多，该角色还知道上一次行军发生在两百多年前，而这些莫德隆人很可能是那次行军的残余。三角龙并不承认这一点（不想承认自己的失败），不过如果角色提出要带领莫德隆人离开迷宫，它可能会被说服而跟随他们。此外，三头龙对迷宫非常熟悉，与莫德隆人交好，可以使人物在浏览该地区时获得+5的智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查奖励。",
	"The tridrone warns the characters to avoid the center of the Labyrinth, explaining that a malfunctioning \"Orderer\" is there. The characters might know the device by its other name: the Maze Engine. Because the device was built on Mechanus, its magical energy resonates with the modrons. The tridrone explains that an Orderer is designed to bring order to chaos by altering reality. A malfunctioning Orderer can be very dangerous, however, altering reality in unexpected ways. The tridrone knows exactly how far it is from the device. Because its knowledge of magic is limited and its focus on rejoining the Great Modron March is all-consuming, the tridrone has never thought about whether the Orderer might provide a solution to the modrons' predicament. If the characters express an interest in investigating this possibility, the tridrone leads the party to the center of the Labyrinth where the Maze Engine is found.": "三角龙警告人物要避开迷宫的中心，并解释说那里有一个发生故障的 \"订购者\"。人物可能知道这个装置的另一个名字：迷宫引擎。因为这个装置是在麦金努斯上建造的，它的魔法能量与莫德隆人产生了共鸣。三角龙解释说，\"秩序者 \"的目的是通过改变现实，将秩序带到混乱之中。然而，一个发生故障的 \"秩序者 \"可能非常危险，会以意想不到的方式改变现实。三角龙清楚地知道它离设备有多远。因为它对魔法的了解有限，而且它对重新加入伟大的莫德隆行军的关注是全神贯注的，所以tridrone从来没有想过秩序者是否可以为莫德隆人的困境提供一个解决方案。如果角色们表示有兴趣调查这种可能性，三头龙就会带领大家去迷宫的中心，那里有迷宫引擎。",
	"About twelve miles from their encounter with the modrons, as they travel through the Labyrinth, the characters hear sounds of howling in the distance off and on over the course of many hours. Sometimes the sounds get closer or fade away, echoing strangely through the surrounding tunnels.": "在离他们与莫德隆人相遇的地方约12英里处，当他们穿越迷宫时，人物在许多小时内断断续续地听到远处有嚎叫的声音。有时，这些声音会变得更近或消失，在周围的隧道中发出奇怪的回声。",
	"Eventually, the characters enter a smaller tunnel leading upward. As they move forward, they can clearly hear the sound of fighting ahead. Bestial howls and yips can be heard, along with deeper roaring. A successful DC 13 Intelligence check recognizes the language of the battle cries as Gnoll. The characters can retreat away from the sounds of combat, but doing so means backtracking for six miles to find another route. If they continue ahead, they are confronted with a grisly scene. Though the characters likely have no firsthand experience of a goristro, they recognize the creature from the information provided to them by {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}.": "最终，这些人物进入了一条较小的隧道，通往上方。随着他们的前进，他们可以清楚地听到前方的战斗声。可以听到兽性的嚎叫和叫声，还有更深的咆哮。如果成功通过DC13智力检查，就能认出战斗叫声的语言是地精。角色们可以从战斗声中撤退，但这样做意味着要倒退六英里去寻找另一条路线。如果他们继续前进，他们就会面对一个可怕的场景。尽管人物可能没有关于地精的第一手经验，但他们从（%0%）提供给他们的信息中认出了这种生物。",
	"As you move forward, the sounds of furious battle grow louder. The tunnel ends at a ledge twenty feet above the floor of a large cavern, giving you a perfect view of the conflict below.": "随着你的前进，激战的声音越来越大。隧道的尽头是一个离大洞穴地面20英尺高的壁架，使你可以完美地看到下面的冲突。",
	"On the shores of an underground lake, a pack of frenzied gnolls and hyenas surrounds a demon standing nearly twenty feet tall, with massive arms, clawed hands, cloven hooves, and the head of a bull. This is a goristro, whose heart {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA} has instructed you to claim.": "在一个地下湖的岸边，一群狂热的地精和鬣狗围绕着一个身高近20英尺的恶魔，他有巨大的手臂，有爪子的手，有蹄子，还有一个牛头。这是一个地精，他的心脏（%0%）已经指示你去认领。",
	"Leading the gnolls is a figure of fearful countenance, twelve feet tall with the head of a snarling, amber-eyed hyena. He wields a massive triple flail, whose whirling heads smash into the larger goristro. The gnolls howl their master's name as he strikes swiftly, again and again: \"Yeenoghu! Yeenoghu!\"": "领导地精的是一个面目可怖的人物，身高12英尺，长着一个咆哮的、琥珀色眼睛的鬣狗头。他挥舞着一把巨大的三连枷，其旋转的头部砸向较大的地精。当他迅速地、一次又一次地打击时，地精们嚎叫着他们主人的名字。\"耶诺古! 叶诺古！\"",
	"The larger demon roars, slashing with its bull's horns and flailing with its claws, but to no avail. Yeenoghu evades or shrugs off its attacks, even as gnoll archers pepper it with arrows. Then the gnolls swarm the goristro as it begins to falter, bringing it crashing to the ground.": "较大的恶魔咆哮着，用它的牛角猛砍，用它的爪子拍打，但毫无效果。耶诺古躲开或甩开它的攻击，甚至在地精弓箭手向它射箭时也是如此。然后，地精们蜂拥而上，因为它开始动摇了，把它撞到了地上。",
	"In less than a minute, the battle is won. The demon lord Yeenoghu pulls back the goristro's head by the horns and rips out its throat with his teeth. He throws back his head and his howl of triumph echoes through the chamber, shaking the stones themselves. Several hyenas nipping at Yeenoghu's heels leap onto the goristro's corpse and begin feasting on its flesh. As you watch, these hyenas transform into gnolls.": "在不到一分钟的时间里，战斗就胜利了。恶魔领主Yeenoghu用角拉回了小龙虾的头，用牙齿撕开了它的喉咙。他甩了甩头，胜利的嚎叫声在密室中回荡，震动着石头本身。几只鬣狗咬着耶诺古的脚后跟，跳到小狼的尸体上，开始大吃特吃它的肉。在你的注视下，这些鬣狗变成了地精。",
	"Any adventurer witnessing this horrible tableau must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of madness (see \"{@area Madness|063|x}\" in chapter 2). If this causes the character to suffer a bout of indefinite madness, determine the nature of the madness using the Madness of Yeenoghu table in {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}.": "任何目睹了这一可怕场景的冒险者都必须在DC12智慧救赎上获得成功，否则就会获得一级的疯狂（见第二章的\"（%0%）\"）。如果这导致该角色遭受一阵无限期的疯狂，请使用{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}中的Yeenoghu的疯狂表来确定疯狂的性质。",
	"{@creature Yeenoghu|MTF} (see {@adventure appendix D|OotA|20}) has been wandering the Underdark since he was first summoned, and the adventurers have run across him and his pack. The characters' only advantage at this moment is that they haven't yet been detected. Considering their level at this stage of the adventure, the players might be creating new characters quite soon if they dare confront the demon lord.": "{@creature Yeenoghu|MTF}(见{@adventure appendix D|OotA|20})自从第一次被召唤后就一直在暗黑世界游荡，而冒险者们已经碰到了他和他的族群。此刻人物的唯一优势是他们还没有被发现。考虑到他们在冒险的这个阶段的水平，如果玩家们敢于和恶魔领主对抗，他们可能很快就会创造出新的角色。",
	"If the characters stay hidden and observe, Yeenoghu leaves in short order. He is restless and eager for new prey. Yeenoghu gathers up most of the gnolls and hyenas and leads them down a tunnel on the right side of the cavern. Eight {@creature Gnoll||gnolls} led by a {@creature gnoll pack lord} remain in the cavern, feasting on the goristro's corpse.": "如果角色保持隐蔽和观察，耶诺古很快就会离开。他坐立不安，急于寻找新的猎物。耶诺古召集了大部分的地精和鬣狗，带领它们走到洞穴右侧的通道。八只{@creature Gnoll||gnolls}由一只{@creature gnoll pack lord}带领着留在洞穴里，在地精的尸体上大吃特吃。",
	"If the characters want to continue forward, the gnolls and hyenas need to be dealt with. Alternatively, if the characters are indecisive or spend too long debating the best course of action, the gnoll pack lord sniffs out the intruders. When it realizes that enemies are present, the pack lord howls to draw the attention of its followers.": "如果角色想继续前进，就需要对付地精和鬣狗。或者，如果角色优柔寡断，或者花了太多时间争论最佳行动方案，地精群主就会嗅出入侵者。当它意识到有敌人存在时，狼群领主就会嚎叫以吸引其追随者的注意。",
	"If you'd like Yeenoghu to play more of a role in this chapter of the adventure, it's easy to do so. When the gnolls killed by the characters do not rejoin the hunt, the demon lord circles back to the site of the goristro's demise and discovers his slain minions—and also picks up the scent of the adventurers.": "如果你想让耶诺古在这一章的冒险中扮演更多的角色，这很容易做到。当被角色杀死的地精没有重新加入狩猎时，恶魔领主回到了地精死亡的地方，发现了他被杀死的部下--同时也发现了冒险者的气味。",
	"Later in the adventure, Yeenoghu hunts down the characters to make them pay for their impudence (ideally when they are much higher in level). Before the final confrontation, give the characters hints that they have become the demon lord's prey. They might face an increasing number of gnoll ambushes, for example. One or more of their attackers might refer to them as \"prey of Yeenoghu,\" or otherwise taunt them by speaking of their impending doom.": "在冒险的后期，Yeenoghu会追捕这些角色，让他们为自己的无耻行为付出代价（最好是在他们等级更高的时候）。在最后的对抗之前，给角色们一些暗示，告诉他们已经成为恶魔领主的猎物。例如，他们可能会面临越来越多的地精的伏击。一个或多个攻击者可能会称他们为 \"耶诺古的猎物\"，或者以其他方式嘲弄他们，说他们即将面临厄运。",
	"The characters should have time to prepare for the fight they know is coming, and to think about tactics other than facing Yeenoghu in straight-up combat. For example, becoming the demon lord's quarry might work to their advantage later in the campaign, making them the perfect bait to lure Yeenoghu into a trap in chapter 17, \"{@adventure Against the Demon Lords|OotA|16}.\"": "角色们应该有时间为他们知道即将到来的战斗做准备，并考虑除直接面对耶诺古外的其他战术。例如，成为恶魔领主的猎物可能对他们以后的行动有利，使他们成为第17章\"（%0%）\"中引诱耶诺古进入陷阱的完美诱饵。",
	"Another tunnel on the opposite side of the cavern heads off in a different direction than where Yeenoghu led his pack. Characters who defeat the remaining gnolls can continue on their way without losing any more time.": "洞穴对面的另一条隧道的方向与叶诺古带领他的队伍的方向不同。打败剩下的地精的角色可以继续上路，不会再失去任何时间。",
	"The close brush with Yeenoghu pays dividends to the adventurers by delivering two components of Vizeran's ritual into their hands. The first is the heart of the goristro, which the characters can remove from its corpse. The massive heart is the size of a small trunk and weighs nearly one hundred pounds. Any characters close to it while it is being transported imagine that they can occasionally hear it beating. A character who carries the heart, even in a {@item bag of holding} or similar extradimensional space, makes saving throws against madness with disadvantage.": "与耶诺古的亲密接触给冒险者们带来了好处，他们将维泽兰仪式的两个组成部分交到了自己手中。第一个是大猩猩的心脏，人物可以从它的尸体上取出来。这颗巨大的心脏有一个小树干那么大，重达近百磅。在运送过程中，任何靠近它的角色都可以想象到他们偶尔可以听到它的跳动。携带这颗心脏的角色，即使是在{@item bag of holding}或类似的次元空间中，也会对疯狂进行不利的拯救。",
	"The second component takes the form of a few spatters of a demon lord's blood. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds some of Yeenoghu's black blood on the fallen goristro's horns.": "第二种成分是一些恶魔领主的血液喷溅。成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查后，可以在倒下的戈里斯特的角上发现一些耶诺古的黑血。",
	"This cavern lies deep inside the Labyrinth and contains another ritual component that Vizeran needs.": "这个洞穴位于迷宫的深处，里面有维泽兰需要的另一个仪式组件。",
	"The passage you follow climbs upward as it corkscrews through stone, finally emerging through the floor of a large cavern. The ceiling arches sixty feet overhead, bristling with stalactites that drip water onto stalagmites rising from the uneven and broken floor. Here and there between the stalagmites, several statues of winged humanoids are set in poses of suffering and anguish. Some cover their faces, while others claw at them. Others reach toward the ceiling, their faces twisted into expressions of longing.": "你所遵循的通道在石缝中不断向上攀升，最后穿过一个大洞穴的地板出现。天花板在头顶上拱起60英尺，上面布满了钟乳石，这些钟乳石将水滴在从不平整的破碎地板上升起的石笋上。在石笋之间，有几座长着翅膀的人形雕像，摆出了痛苦的姿势。有些人捂着脸，有些人则用爪子抓着脸。其他人则伸向天花板，他们的脸扭曲成渴望的表情。",
	"This chamber houses the {@condition petrified} remains of eight fallen angels, condemned by the gods to pass the ages in the dark depths. Each appears to have been carved from stone in some position of fear, suffering, hatred, or longing. Each statue is spotted with lichen and marred by mineral deposits, which have crystallized out of the water dripping from the ceiling over uncounted years.": "这个房间里有八个堕落天使的（%0%）遗体，他们被诸神判处在黑暗的深渊中度过漫长的岁月。每个人似乎都是以某种恐惧、痛苦、仇恨或渴望的姿势由石头雕刻而成。每座雕像都有地衣和矿物沉积物的痕迹，这些矿物沉积物是由天花板上滴下的水经过无数年的结晶而成的。",
	"Even though they are transformed into stone statues, the fallen angels remain very much alive, their {@condition petrified} bodies having become prisons for their minds and souls. They remember who they were. They know what they did and why they are here. They know everything transpiring around them. Yet they can do nothing. They are trapped forever, and the isolation, darkness, and endless torment of their fate have driven them mad. No spell can undo the angels' curse or free them from their {@condition petrified} state.": "即使他们变成了石像，堕落的天使仍然很有活力，他们的（%0%）身体已经成为他们思想和灵魂的监狱。他们记得自己是谁。他们知道自己做了什么，为什么在这里。他们知道他们周围发生的一切。然而他们什么也不能做。他们被永远地困住了，孤立、黑暗和他们命运的无尽折磨使他们发疯。没有任何咒语可以解除天使的诅咒，也没有任何咒语可以将他们从{@condition petrified}的状态中解救出来。",
	"The angels can communicate, albeit in a limited fashion, with living creatures that touch them.": "天使可以与接触他们的生物沟通，尽管是以有限的方式。",

	"While the character is {@condition charmed}, the angel has a telepathic link with the character as long as it and the character remain on the same plane of existence.

	"This angel points at a spot on the cavern wall, and its mouth hangs open in horror.

As the demon lords destroy each other in the material world, their dark essences will be drawn back to the Abyss once more. But one of the key parts of Vizeran's plan involves the characters' making sure that the City of Spiders plays host to this final, devastating battle.": "孟苏伯兰山是德摩根出现在暗黑世界的地方，他的触手的鞭打和他的爪脚的碾压留下了一串破碎的建筑、身体和思想。对鸦人来说，不幸的是，如果叛变的鸦人大法师（%0%）赢得了冒险者们的支持，他计划用一个强大的仪式将恶魔领主和他们邪恶的仆人从暗黑世界引出来，让他们互相对立，那么最糟糕的事情可能还在后面。当恶魔领主在物质世界中相互摧毁时，他们的黑暗本质将再次被吸引回深渊。但维泽兰计划的一个关键部分是，人物要确保蜘蛛城成为这场最后的、毁灭性的战斗的东道主。",

	"After their adventures in the Wormwrithings and the Labyrinth, the characters can return to Araj to deliver the components they have collected to {@creature Vizeran DeVir|OotA}. Over ten days, the drow archmage uses those components to craft a talisman that looks and feels like a five-pound black heart carved of black stone. Imbued with arcane and fiendish power, the {@i dark heart} talisman acts as a beacon when Vizeran's ritual is performed, drawing all demons presently loose in the Underdark. The talisman radiates faint conjuration magic even before it is activated, but it's primarily a focus for the power of the ritual rather than a source of power itself.": "在虫洞和迷宫的冒险结束后，人物可以回到阿拉吉，把他们收集到的组件交给（%0%）。在十天的时间里，鸦人大法师用这些部件制作了一个护身符，看起来和感觉上都像是一个用黑石雕刻的五磅重的黑心。这个护身符充满了神秘和邪恶的力量，当维泽兰的仪式进行时，它就像一个灯塔，吸引所有目前在地下世界松动的恶魔。护符甚至在被激活之前就会放射出微弱的魔法，但它主要是仪式力量的焦点，而不是力量的来源。",
	"Vizeran's plan calls for the adventurers to place the {@i dark heart} in Menzoberranzan.

	"Fortunately for the characters, Vizeran isn't without allies in the city. The Council of Spiders is a secret alliance of drow mages who want to overthrow Lolth's priestesses. The council has infiltrated Sorcere, the city's academy for arcane magic, and has sympathizers among male drow wizards. Vizeran has already contacted his allies, who have agreed to help the party gain access to the tower and Gromph's sanctum (see \"{@area Sorcere|55e|x}\" later in this chapter).": "幸运的是，维泽兰在这个城市并不是没有盟友。蜘蛛议会是一个由鸦人法师组成的秘密联盟，他们想要推翻洛尔思的女祭司。该委员会已经渗透到了城市的奥术魔法学院Sorcere，并在男性鸦人法师中拥有同情者。维泽兰已经联系了他的盟友，他们同意帮助队伍进入塔楼和格罗姆夫的圣殿（见本章后面的\"（%0%）\"）。",

Hollow, cocoon-like dwellings are constructed both above and below the layers of webbing.": "在西墙和Narbondellyn之间有一个叫Lolth's Web的住宅区。它的居民将他们的家园向上建造，用神奇的煅烧过的蜘蛛丝线精心打造街道，从洞穴的地面到上面的拱形屋顶。空心的、像蚕茧一样的住宅在网线层的上方和下方都有建造。",
	"Roll for random encounters as the characters cross this district. You can roll a {@dice d20} and consult the West Wall Encounters table, or choose an encounter that you like. The party can avoid random encounters in West Wall by succeeding on a DC 13 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) group check.": "当人物穿过这个区时，为随机遭遇进行掷骰子。你可以掷出{@dice d20}并查阅西墙遭遇表，或者选择一个你喜欢的遭遇。队伍可以通过DC13灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）群体检查成功来避免在西墙的随机遭遇。",

	"The characters draw the unwanted attention of the Bandersnatches, a gang of young, demon-worshiping drow who, in the wake of Demogorgon's attack, are eager to create further unrest in the city. Gang members send coded messages to one another by tapping hollow rocks together, creating eerie clicking sounds that echo throughout the otherwise quiet neighborhood. Initially, {@dice 1d4} drow {@creature Bandit||bandits} follow the party, scuttling through dark alleys and across web-strung rooftops while tapping their stones, urging more gang members to converge on the party's location. At the end of each round of clicking stones, another {@dice 1d4} drow {@creature Bandit||bandits} appear. If the number of gang members grows to twenty or more, the bandits surround the party and demand payment of 100 gp per party member for safe passage. If the characters kill four or more bandits, the rest flee before a drow patrol (see below) shows up.": "这些人物引起了Bandersnatches的注意。Bandersnatches是一帮年轻的、崇拜恶魔的乌鸦，在Demogorgon的攻击之后，他们急于在这个城市制造更多的动乱。帮派成员通过敲击空心石块来互相传递密码信息，创造出阴森的咔嚓声，在整个安静的街区回荡。起初，{@dice 1d4}乌鸦{@creature Bandit||bandits}跟随队伍，在黑暗的小巷中乱窜，穿过结网的屋顶，同时敲击他们的石头，敦促更多的帮派成员向队伍的位置聚集。在每一轮点击石头的过程中，会有另一个{@dice 1d4}乌鸦{@creature Bandit||bandits}出现。如果帮派成员的数量增加到20个或更多，土匪就会包围队伍，并要求为每个成员支付100金币的安全通行费。如果人物杀死了四个或更多的强盗，剩下的人就会在乌鸦巡逻队（见下文）出现之前逃走。",
	"The consequence of killing one or more bandits is retaliation. The gang organizes a hunting party to find and kill one party member for every gang member slain. This hunting party is bold enough to leave the West Wall district, and you might have the Bandersnatches try to ambush the characters as they make their way out of Menzoberranzan. The hunting party consists of the gang's leader, her {@creature quasit} advisor, and thirty drow bandits.": "杀死一个或多个匪徒的后果是报复。该团伙组织了一个狩猎队，每杀死一名团伙成员，就会找到并杀死一名党员。这支狩猎队敢于离开西墙区，你可能会让匪徒们在人物离开Menzoberranzan的时候试图伏击他们。狩猎队由该帮派的首领、她的（%0%）顾问和三十名乌鸦强盗组成。",

	"She wields a {@item scimitar of speed} and can make one attack with it as a bonus action on her turn.

	"Viln carries four daggers coated with {@item purple worm poison} (see \"{@book Poisons|DMG|8|Poisons}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}). The poison on a dagger's blade is good for one hit only, whether the poison takes effect or not.": "Viln携带四把涂有{@item purple worm poison}的匕首（见{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}第八章的\"{@book Poisons|DMG|8|Poisons}\"）。匕首刃上的毒药只对一击有效，无论毒药是否生效。",
	"She has a challenge rating of 5 (1,800 XP).": "她的挑战等级为5（1,800 XP）。",
	"The characters see a drow {@creature noble} flogging one of a handful of slaves ({@creature Commoner||commoners} of any race) while {@dice 1d4} {@creature bugbear} bodyguards keep an eye out for trouble. Unless the characters intervene, the merciless noble has the slave dragged to the Westrift and unceremoniously tossed into it. The poor slave falls {@dice 3d6 × 10} feet before being caught in a web and cocooned by a {@creature giant spider} (to be devoured later). If the characters come to the slave's defense, the bugbears attack them.": "角色们看到一个乌鸦人（%0%）在鞭打少数几个奴隶中的一个（{@creature Commoner||commoners}任何种族），而{@dice 1d4}{@creature bugbear}保镖在一旁注意着麻烦。除非人物介入，否则这位无情的贵族会把奴隶拖到西流河边，毫不客气地把他扔进河里。这个可怜的奴隶在被网抓住并被{@creature giant spider}茧住之前跌落了{@dice 3d6 × 10}英尺（稍后被吞噬）。如果人物来为奴隶辩护，虫子们就会攻击他们。",
	"As hostile as Menzoberranzan seems to outsiders, there are powerful figures within the city who want the demon lords expelled from the Underdark and are willing to help the characters accomplish this goal.": "在外人看来，门索伯兰赞是个敌对的地方，但在这个城市里，有一些强大的人物希望将恶魔领主从暗黑世界驱逐出去，并愿意帮助人物实现这一目标。",
	"The matron mother of House Baenre is the voice of Lolth in Menzoberranzan, and despite recent events, maintains absolute control of the city. Quenthel knows how Demogorgon made his way from the Abyss to the City of Spiders. She wasn't surprised to learn that her brother Gromph—the Archmage of Menzoberranzan—was behind it, for she's seen evidence of his growing unhappiness in recent months, and she also knows that Lolth was behind it. Quenthel assumes that Lolth is making some sort of power play in the Abyss.": "巴恩雷家族的母亲是洛尔思在门索布兰赞的代言人，尽管最近发生了一些事情，但她仍然保持着对这座城市的绝对控制。昆特尔知道德摩根是如何从深渊来到蜘蛛之城的。当她得知她的哥哥格罗夫--门索伯兰赞的大法师--是幕后黑手时，她并不感到惊讶，因为她看到了近几个月来他越来越不开心的证据，而且她还知道洛尔思是幕后黑手。昆特尔认为洛尔思在深渊中进行某种权力游戏。",
	"If Quenthel learns that adventurers are trying to rid the Underdark of its demon lord menace, she doesn't stand in their way (see \"{@adventure Private Meetings|OotA|14}\") and even allows them to travel through the city unmolested.": "如果昆特牌得知冒险者试图摆脱地下城的恶魔领主威胁，她不会阻拦他们（见\"（%0%）\"），甚至允许他们不受干扰地穿越城市。"
