	"\"Forgotten Relics\" is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in Sharn and serves as an introduction to the city. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges.": "\"被遗忘的遗迹 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合四到六个一级角色，在冒险结束时提升到二级。它的背景是沙恩，是对这个城市的介绍。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。",
	"Niho Koi, an imposing oni and Daask sub-boss in Sharn, ordered a half-ogre lieutenant named Garra to assemble a team and search the ruins of Old Sharn for arcane relics at the behest of someone much higher up in the organization. With a lot of ground to cover beneath the City of Towers, Garra kidnapped Caden d'Orien, the only son of Alden d'Orien, forcing Alden to use his position in his dragonmarked house to recruit out-of-work warforged—people no one would miss—to scour Old Sharn's ruins. Alden branded the work as a \"secret research-gathering mission\" for his house, paid the warforged workers for their silence, and signed them to binding contracts.": "Niho Koi是沙恩的一个威严的鬼魂和Daask副老板，他命令一个叫Garra的半鬼魂中尉组建一个团队，在组织中更高层的人的授意下，在旧沙恩的废墟中搜索奥术文物。由于塔楼之城下面有很多地方需要覆盖，Garra绑架了Alden d'Orien的独生子Caden d'Orien，迫使Alden利用他在龙纹之家的地位，招募失业的战争锻造者--没有人会错过的人--来搜寻旧沙恩的遗迹。奥尔登将这项工作打造成他家的 \"秘密研究-收集任务\"，为战神工人的沉默支付报酬，并与他们签订了具有约束力的合同。",
	"It took several weeks of dangerous exploring and a few deaths, but eventually the warforged workers found a library of arcane texts and schemas buried in the ruins. These items were moved to a Daask safe house in Tavick's Landing near the Terminus Lightning Rail station. The organization plans to smuggle the relics out Breland to Droaam with Alden's help.": "经过几周的危险探索和几人的死亡，最终战神工人发现了埋藏在废墟中的奥术文本和原理的图书馆。这些物品被转移到了塔维克兰丁（Tavick's Landing）靠近总站闪电铁路站的达斯克安全屋。该组织计划在奥登的帮助下，将这些遗物从布雷兰德偷运到德罗阿姆。",
	"Coal, a destitute warforged hired by Alden, witnessed her good friend Razor die, executed in the ruins of Old Sharn as an example to the other workers. Coal made an appointment to talk to Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, to report the shady operation, Razor's murder, and the kidnapping of the House Orien scion, Caden. Thanks to crooked members of the Sharn Watch in Daask's pocket, Garra found out about the appointment and dispatched killers to prevent Coal from ratting out the operation.": "煤，一个被Alden雇佣的穷困潦倒的战争锻造者，目睹了她的好朋友Razor的死亡，在旧沙恩的废墟上被处决，作为其他工人的榜样。寇尔约好与沙恩守望的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士谈话，报告这个不光彩的行动、雷泽的谋杀以及奥瑞恩家族的子孙凯顿被绑架。多亏了达斯克口袋里的沙恩看守所的腐败成员，加拉发现了这个约会，并派出杀手阻止煤老板告发这次行动。",
	"Germaine is also crooked, but she is on the payroll of the Boromar Clan crime syndicate, whose members are enemies of Daask. Not wanting to put the Sharn Watch or herself between two criminal organizations at war, Germaine called in a few old contacts to meet with Coal and find out what's going on.": "杰曼也是个骗子，但她受雇于博洛玛氏族犯罪集团，其成员是达斯克的敌人。杰曼不想把沙恩观察站或她自己置于两个处于战争状态的犯罪组织之间，她叫来了几个旧的联系人，与煤炭公司见面，了解情况。",

	"The adventure begins one evening in Upper Central Plateau, where the characters meet Sergeant Germaine Vilroy, who hires them to meet with a warforged named Coal, hear her out, and bring her back to Vilroy for further questioning. Coal has already been told to wait for the characters at the Cog Carnival, a warforged bar in the High Walls district of Lower's Tavick's Landing.": "冒险开始于上中央高原的一个晚上，人物在那里遇到了Germaine Vilroy中士，后者雇佣他们去见一个叫Coal的战地锻造者，听她说完，并把她带回Vilroy那里进一步审问。煤已经被告知在Cog Carnival等待他们，这是一家位于Lower's Tavick's Landing的High Walls区的warforged酒吧。",
	"After talking to Coal and learning her employer was Alden d'Orien, the characters are confronted by Daask forces sent to kill Coal. If they survive the fight, the characters can meet with Alden in the Mithral Tower district Upper Central Plateau. The scion stays tight-lipped, but Vishtai, Alden's kalashtar bodyguard, telepathically gives the characters directions to the Old Sharn ruin where Caden d'Orien is imprisoned.": "在与Coal交谈并得知她的雇主是Alden d'Orien后，角色们遇到了Daask派来杀死Coal的部队。如果他们在战斗中幸存下来，人物就可以在上中央高原的Mithral塔区与阿尔登见面。这个子孙保持沉默，但阿尔登的卡拉什塔保镖维斯塔伊（Vishtai）以心灵感应的方式向人物提供了前往旧沙恩废墟的方向，凯顿-德奥瑞恩就被囚禁在那里。",
	"If Caden is rescued and returned to his father, Alden shares what he knows of Daask's operation and tells the characters where to find {@creature Garra|ERLW}. The half-ogre knows the characters are coming for her. She tries to flee on a lightning rail while drawing them into a trap. If the characters chase down the half-ogre, she attempts to make a deal to keep her freedom, which they can either refuse or accept, setting the stage for further adventures.": "如果凯顿被救出并回到他父亲身边，奥登就会分享他所知道的达斯克的行动，并告诉人物在哪里可以找到（%0%）。半妖怪知道这些角色是来找她的。她试图乘着闪电轨道逃走，同时把他们引向一个陷阱。如果角色们追赶半妖，她就会试图做一个交易以保持她的自由，他们可以拒绝或接受，为进一步的冒险创造条件。",
	"Before the adventure begins, inform each character that they are an acquaintance of Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, a Brelish veteran of the Last War. Ask each character to come up with a friendly connection to Germaine, or have them choose or roll on the Germaine Connections table. If a rolled connection doesn't make sense with the character's background, simply roll for a new connection or choose one that seems appropriate.": "在冒险开始前，通知每个角色他们是沙恩守望的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士的熟人，他是最后一次战争中的布雷利什老兵。要求每个角色想出一个与杰曼的友好关系，或者让他们在杰曼关系表上选择或滚动。如果滚出的关系与角色的背景不相符，只需滚出一个新的关系或选择一个看起来合适的关系。",

	"An orange glow covers the top of Lyrandar Tower as the sun sinks in the sky. Above, the great airships of House Lyrandar float like leviathans surrounded by brilliant rings of elemental energy. Below, bridges crisscross at all levels of the city, connecting Sharn's great towers. The sounds of crying children, barking vendors, cursing skycoach drivers, and braying hippogriffs rise up to become a unique din that can only be heard in the City of Towers.": "当太阳沉入天空时，橙色的光芒覆盖了Lyrandar塔的顶部。在上面，Lyrandar家族的伟大飞艇像利维坦一样漂浮着，周围是灿烂的元素能量环。在下面，桥梁在城市的各个层面纵横交错，连接着沙恩的大塔。哭闹的孩子、叫卖的小贩、咒骂的空中巴士司机、咆哮的河马等声音此起彼伏，成为只有在塔楼之城才能听到的独特喧嚣。",
	"Each of you carries a letter from your acquaintance Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch that reads, \"I'm calling on you for a job.

	"Have the players introduce their characters to each other, if they aren't already acquainted. Ask characters who aren't from Sharn how they arrived, perhaps on an airship (likely paid for by Germaine whose Kundarak account is flush with Boromar gold) or a lightning rail.

	"This is also a good time for characters to make personal connections that might link them, such as having the same birthplace, fighting for the same side in the Last War, or having common backgrounds or interests. Once the characters' relationships to one another have been established, read or paraphrase the following boxed text to the players:": "这也是人物建立可能将他们联系起来的个人联系的好时机，例如有相同的出生地，在最后一次战争中为同一方作战，或者有共同的背景或兴趣。一旦人物之间的关系建立起来，就向玩家宣读或转述以下方框内的文字。",
	"As darkness descends on the city, you see windows light up the towers around you from bottom to top. A cool wind whisks between you, drowning out the other noises of the city.

	"It seems the Sharn Watch is outsourcing more and more of their jobs to contractors, also known as adventurers, also known as mercenaries, which is what these blood-soaked hirelings are. While many of these second-rate thugs act like they have the absolute authority of the Sharn Watch, know your rights! These sellswords can get away with atrocities, including murder, but only if such crimes are committed in the pursuit of their contracts. Should one of these ruffians steal from or harm you or your loved ones for no reason other than their barbaric attitudes, report them to the Watch and this publication immediately. The Sharn Watch is bound by law to arrest these hooligans when they show their criminal natures.": "似乎沙恩观察站正在将越来越多的工作外包给承包商，也被称为冒险家，也被称为雇佣兵，这就是这些沾满鲜血的雇佣兵。虽然这些二流打手中的许多人表现得好像他们拥有沙恩守望的绝对权威，但要知道你的权利! 这些雇佣兵可以逃脱暴行，包括谋杀，但前提是这些罪行是在履行合同的过程中犯下的。如果这些流氓中的一个人无缘无故地偷窃或伤害你或你的亲人，除了他们的野蛮态度之外，请立即向观察站和本出版物报告他们。根据法律规定，当这些流氓表现出他们的犯罪本性时，沙恩观察组织有义务逮捕他们。",
	"Germaine is gruff and doesn't like wasting time. She gives the characters the information she has and tries to send them on their way before they can ask questions about her involvement in the case. The sooner the characters solve her problem, the sooner she can get back to collecting extra money from the Boromar Clan for doing nothing other than ignoring their crimes.": "杰曼性格粗暴，不喜欢浪费时间。她把她所掌握的信息告诉了这些人物，并试图在他们问及她参与此案的问题之前就把他们送上路。角色们越早解决她的问题，她就能越早从博罗玛家族那里收取额外的钱财，因为她除了无视他们的罪行之外什么都没做。",
	"Germaine gives the characters the following information:": "杰曼给了这些人物以下信息。",
	"Germaine has an appointment to meet with a warforged named Coal, who claims to have knowledge of a crime being committed in Old Sharn.

	"Germaine tries to play up her concern for Coal as her reason for hiring the characters, but a character who succeeds on a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check contested by the Germaine's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check can sense that she's holding something back. A character who talks to Germaine privately and succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check gets her to reveal that she sometimes takes money from the Boromar Clan to look into crimes, and the family is interested in Coal's information (though Germaine also points out that the characters really are Coal's best shot at surviving this ordeal, what with Coal being caught between the two largest criminal syndicates in the city).": "Germaine试图将她对Coal的关心作为她雇佣这些人物的理由，但是一个通过智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查成功的人物，在Germaine的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查中可以感觉到她在隐瞒什么。一个与Germaine私下交谈并成功通过DC13魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查的角色可以让她透露，她有时会从Boromar家族那里拿钱来调查犯罪，而该家族对Coal的信息很感兴趣（不过Germaine也指出，这些角色确实是Coal在这场磨难中生存的最好机会，因为Coal被夹在城市中两个最大的犯罪集团之间）。",
	"If the characters have no place to stay in Sharn, Germaine puts them up at Ghallanda Hall in Middle Dura for the duration of their investigation.": "如果人物在沙恩没有地方住，杰曼就把他们安置在中杜拉的加兰达厅，供他们在调查期间居住。",
	"Sharn's neighborhood of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing is a district mostly enclosed by walls.
