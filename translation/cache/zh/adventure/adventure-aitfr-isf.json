	"Two Red Wizards of Thay have undertaken a secret mission into the High Moors east of the Sword Coast. They are searching for something or someone. Whatever their goal out there in the cold and windswept hills, if the Red Wizards want to keep it secret then it is probably best uncovered swiftly for the good of everyone else. Even the mercenaries who escorted them into the wilderness earlier agree: someone should stop them.": "泰伊的两名红袍巫师在剑海岸以东的高沼泽地区执行了一项秘密任务。他们在寻找一些东西或人。不管他们在寒冷和风吹日晒的山丘上的目标是什么，如果红袍巫师想要保密，那么为了其他人的利益，最好迅速揭开它。即使是先前护送他们进入荒野的佣兵也同意：应该有人阻止他们。",
	"Pursuing the Red Wizards leads the adventurers to a barrow mound in the wild grasses of the High Moors. At the barrow, they discover the remnants of a wizards' sanctum still being plundered. The fate of its lore and treasures is up to the characters. Without caution, things may get out of hand.": "追寻红袍巫师的过程中，冒险者们来到了高摩尔荒草丛中的一个荒冢。在荒冢中，他们发现了一个仍在被掠夺的巫师圣地的遗迹。它的传说和宝藏的命运取决于角色们。如果不谨慎的话，事情可能会变得一发不可收拾。",

	"A lone mage roams the land. He is a visitor from another world. He has come to the Sword Coast in pursuit of legends and lore, in the footsteps of others who came here long ago. He is called Tyreus, though few here know him by name.": "一个孤独的法师在这片土地上游荡。他是一个来自另一个世界的访客。他来到剑海岸，追寻传奇和传说，追随很久以前来到这里的其他人的脚步。他被称为提瑞斯，尽管这里很少有人知道他的名字。",
	"His explorations caught the attention of the Red Wizards of Thay, who dispatched a pair of their own wizards to find the roving mage. These searchers—Morwena and her apprentice, {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}—tracked the wizard to the High Moors east of the Sword Coast. They surmised (correctly) that their quarry was looking for a site of arcane power.": "他的探索引起了泰伊的红袍巫师们的注意，他们派出了一对自己的巫师去寻找这个流浪的法师。这些搜寻者--莫维娜和她的学徒，{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}--追踪该法师到了剑海岸以东的高沼泽。他们推测（正确），他们的猎物正在寻找一个奥术力量的场所。",
	"To find their way through the High Moors and stay on Tyreus's trail, the Red Wizards hired local mercenaries to guide them, led by a former bandit called Lothar.": "为了找到穿越高摩尔的道路，并保持泰勒斯的踪迹，红袍巫师们雇用了当地的雇佣兵来引导他们，领头的是一个叫洛萨的前强盗。",
	"When the Red Wizards drew close to their target at a site colloquially called the Wizard's Barrow, Lothar and his mercenaries abandoned the whole enterprise out of fear. They fled back to the village of Secomber, on the edge of the High Moors, where they tell anyone who will listen that bad things are afoot out at the Wizard's Barrow now. \"Wizards hunting wizards can lead to no good,\" Lothar says.": "当红袍巫师接近他们的目标--一个俗称为巫师之冢的地方时，洛萨和他的雇佣兵们因为恐惧而放弃了整个行动。他们逃回了高摩尔边缘的塞康伯村，在那里他们告诉任何愿意听的人，现在在巫师之冢有坏事发生。\"巫师猎杀巫师会导致不好的结果，\"洛萨说。",
	"The Wizard's Barrow started as a proper barrow and stood quietly in the High Moors for centuries before a sect of wizards moved in, plundered it for treasure, discarded the dead inside the barrow, and used their magic to reshape the place into a remote lair. For years, the wizards used this place as a sanctum, laboratory, library, and eventually a tomb for members of their small order. Whatever became of the final members of the order, they never returned to this place.": "巫师墓穴最初是一个合适的墓穴，在高摩尔地区静静地矗立了几个世纪，后来一个巫师教派搬了进来，在这里掠夺财宝，将死者丢弃在墓穴里，并用他们的魔法将这里重新塑造成一个遥远的巢穴。多年来，巫师们把这个地方用作圣地、实验室、图书馆，最终成为他们小团体成员的坟墓。无论这个教团的最后成员变成什么样子，他们都没有回到这个地方。",
	"For decades, it stood quietly.": "几十年来，它静静地站在那里。",
	"Then, a few days ago, Tyreus arrived with elementals in his service. The elementals dug into the ground near the barrow to get access to its lowest reaches. That created the sinkhole just east of the barrow, into area 15. From there, Tyreus and his minions stormed the library in area 14.": "然后，几天前，泰勒斯带着为他服务的元素人来了。元素们挖开了荒冢附近的地面，以获得进入其最底层的机会。这就形成了天坑，就在荒冢的东边，进入15号区域。从那里，泰勒斯和他的爪牙们冲进了14区的图书馆。",
	"For two days, Tyreus searched the library for items of value. When Morwena and {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} arrived, they confronted him in a brief skirmish of spells before choosing to parley.": "两天来，泰勒斯一直在图书馆里寻找有价值的物品。当莫维娜和{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}到达时，他们在短暂的法术冲突中与他对峙，然后选择了交涉。",
	"Morwena, intrigued by the roving wizard and hungry for the power he offered, chose to abandon her mission and join Tyreus. {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} thought it was a trick. It wasn't.": "莫维娜被这个游荡的巫师所吸引，渴望他所提供的力量，选择了放弃她的任务，加入了提瑞斯。{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}认为这是个骗局。其实不然。",
	"{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}, afraid and heartbroken, threatened them both but was no match for either. Struck by Tyreus's spells, he fled the library, deeper into the barrow, and collapsed on the verge of death. (He is likely still in area 13 when the adventurers arrive.)": "{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}，害怕和心碎，威胁他们两个，但都不是他们的对手。他被提瑞斯的法术击中，逃离了图书馆，深入到荒冢中，在死亡的边缘倒下了。(当冒险者们到达时，他可能还在13区。）",
	"Morwena suggested they let {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} go, as she wasn't worried about reprisal from the Red Wizards anymore. She and her new ally teleported away with their treasures, leaving the elemental minions to close up the barrow again and burn the library to cover their master's tracks.": "莫维娜建议他们放走（%0%），因为她不再担心红袍巫师的报复。她和她的新盟友带着他们的财宝传送走了，留下那些元素爪牙再次关闭荒冢，烧掉图书馆以掩盖他们主人的踪迹。",
	"The lead minion, a fire spirit called {@creature Exul|AitFR-ISF}, toils under a geas from the roving wizard. He has gathered and piled scrolls and books from the library to burn them but has stopped to read all he can before he destroys them.": "领头的奴才，一个叫{@creature Exul|AitFR-ISF}的火灵，在游荡的巫师的格言下苦苦挣扎。他收集并堆放了图书馆的卷轴和书籍，准备烧掉它们，但在毁掉它们之前，他停下来阅读所有能读的东西。",
	"Adventurers passing through the village of Secomber might hear about the Red Wizards and their mission by chance. For some adventurers, interfering with Red Wizards or uncovering lost treasure may be enough motivation to continue.": "路过塞康伯村的冒险者可能会偶然听到红袍巫师和他们的任务。对于一些冒险者来说，干扰红袍巫师或揭开丢失的宝藏可能是继续下去的足够动力。",
	"If coincidence isn't enough, consider the following adventure hooks and how they can get adventurers to Secomber.": "如果巧合还不够，可以考虑以下的冒险钩子，以及它们如何让冒险者到塞康伯。",
	"An ally or patron of the adventurers hears word that two Red Wizards have ventured toward the High Moors in search of something. Perhaps that ally has a fraught history with the Red Wizards; perhaps the adventurers already do too.": "冒险家的一个盟友或赞助人听到消息说，有两个红袍巫师冒险前往高摩尔寻找什么东西。也许这位盟友与红袍巫师有一段不解之缘；也许冒险者也已经知道了。",
	"A historian, sage, or other learned figure asks the adventurers to investigate the legends of the Wizard's Barrow in the High Moor. \"Start in the village of Secomber,\" they say. \"Someone there might remember rumors of wizards roaming the moors.\"": "一位历史学家、圣人或其他有学问的人物要求冒险者调查高沼泽地的巫师墓穴的传说。\"他们说：\"从塞科姆伯村开始。\"那里的人可能记得巫师在荒原上游荡的传闻。\"",
	"The village of Secomber sits with its back against a riverside cliff made of pink granite. The village center is mostly modest cottages and shops, with homes and farms lining the roads out of town and the top of the cliffs overlooking Hark River. Across the water, green hills rise to become the High Moors.": "塞孔伯村背靠着粉红色花岗岩制成的河边悬崖而坐。村中心大多是简陋的平房和商店，出城的道路两旁是住宅和农场，在悬崖顶上俯瞰哈克河。在水的对面，绿色的山丘升起，成为高沼泽。",
	"Whatever brings the characters to Secomber, they hear word of Lothar and his party's recent return from the High Moors. Whether he drinks nearby or tells his story out on the street, Lothar brags about how lucky he and his crew are to be alive \"after almost being murdered by Red Wizards.\"": "无论人物来到塞康伯，他们都听到了洛萨和他的队伍最近从高摩尔回来的消息。无论他是在附近喝酒还是在街上讲故事，洛萨都在吹嘘他和他的队员们 \"在几乎被红袍巫师杀害后 \"还能活着是多么幸运。",
	"Lothar Stoutsmark (male human, chaotic neutral, {@creature bandit captain}) is a forty-year-old braggart who values survival above all else. His \"gold\" teeth are fake. He and his crew (Gordo, Vic, and Rora) consider themselves adventurers but tend toward sordid work and skullduggery. Lothar is one lean month away from returning to highway robbery, and his allies (all {@creature spy||spies}) are one bad day from abandoning him, unbeknown to Lothar. Lothar knows the following information about the Red Wizards and their mission:": "Lothar Stoutsmark（男性人类，混乱中立，{@creature bandit captain}）是一个四十岁的吹牛者，把生存看得比什么都重要。他的 \"金 \"牙是假的。他和他的船员（戈多、维克和罗拉）认为自己是冒险家，但倾向于肮脏的工作和卑鄙的欺诈。洛萨还差一个月就能回到公路上抢劫了，而他的盟友（都是{@creature spy||spies}）还差一天就能抛弃他了，洛萨并不知道。洛塔尔知道以下关于红袍巫师和他们任务的信息。",
	"\"Those Red Wizards are called Morwena and {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}. He used to be her apprentice and she still puts him in his place, you know? He doesn't like it.\"": "\"那些红袍巫师叫莫维娜和（%0%）。他曾经是她的学徒，她仍然把他放在自己的位置上，你知道吗？他不喜欢这样。\"",
	"\"Morwena, she said the barrow they were looking for might contain great treasure. She seemed to doubt it was a barrow at all, though. She called it a ‘sanctum.'\"": "\"莫维娜，她说他们正在寻找的荒冢可能包含巨大的宝藏。不过，她似乎怀疑那根本不是一个荒冢。她称它为'圣地'。\"",
	"\"She maybe meant the Wizard's Barrow, which was used for strange rites for decades—thunder, lightning—but apparently never opened.\"": "\"她也许是指巫师的墓穴，几十年来，它被用来进行奇怪的仪式--雷电，但显然从未被打开过。\"",
	"\"Anyway, them Red Wizards, they're chasing someone. Another wizard, from a rival group, maybe? Sounded like they wanted him alive.\"": "\"总之，那些红袍巫师，他们在追赶某人。另一个巫师，也许是一个敌对团体的？听起来他们想让他活着。\"",
	"\"We made good time, crossing the hills. I know good trails. But one night, Morwena told {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} she didn't think they needed guides anymore. So we left, before they could kill us.\"": "\"我们取得了很好的时间，越过了山丘。我知道好的小路。但有一天晚上，莫维纳告诉（%0%）她认为他们不再需要向导了。所以我们离开了，在他们能杀死我们之前。\"",
	"Lothar can point the way to the Wizard's Barrow: it is a mere 6-hour hike into the High Moors, about 18 miles southeast of Secomber.": "洛塔尔可以指出通往巫师墓穴的道路：只需徒步6个小时就可以进入高沼泽，在塞孔伯东南约18英里处。",
	"When the adventurers arrive, the barrow has already been entered (twice) and partly plundered. The barrow's three levels, and a side view, are presented in the included maps (See Appendix).": "当冒险家们到达时，荒冢已经被进入（两次），并被部分掠夺。荒冢的三个层次和一个侧面图，在随附的地图中都有介绍（见附录）。",
	"The main entryway to the barrow was the only entrance into the site until Tyreus arrived. Located at the western end of the structure and marked by two large standing stones etched with faded spiral sigils, the entrance is a weather-worn set of stairs interrupted by an upright stone slab. It was never a door, but a seal.": "荒冢的主要入口是进入遗址的唯一入口，直到推罗来到这里。入口位于结构的西端，由两块刻有褪色的螺旋形符号的大立石标示，是一套风化的楼梯，被一块直立的石板打断。它从来不是一扇门，而是一个印章。",
	"Morwena and {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} forced the seal open when they arrived. Now the barrow stands open to the winds and gathering rains of the High Moors. Anyone can descend the steep, worn steps and enter.": "莫维纳和{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}到达时强行打开了封条。现在，这个墓穴敞开着，迎着高沼泽地的风和雨。任何人都可以沿着陡峭、破旧的台阶下去，然后进入。",
	"After its origins as a barrow grave in ancient times, the interior of the Wizard's Barrow has been refashioned with magic and more modern crafting techniques. The top level remains the oldest in fashion, combining original stone slabs with mortar and stones from about a century ago.": "在起源于古代的荒冢之后，巫师荒冢的内部已经用魔法和更多的现代工艺技术进行了重塑。顶层仍然是最古老的时尚，将原来的石板与大约一个世纪前的砂浆和石头结合在一起。",
	"The second and third levels of the site consist of gray, cut stones slowly giving way after decades without maintenance—made all the worse by side effects of the sinkhole opening up outside. Cracks and gaps now reach into the second level of the site. Some areas are in danger of collapsing into the library below. Clever adventurers may find a way to take advantage of these dangers; others may succumb to them.": "遗址的第二层和第三层由灰色的、被切割的石头组成，在几十年没有维护的情况下，慢慢地让步了，而外面的天坑所带来的副作用使情况更加糟糕。裂缝和空隙现在已经延伸到了第二层。有些地方有坍塌到下面图书馆的危险。聪明的冒险家可能会找到一种方法来利用这些危险；其他人可能会屈服于这些危险。",
	"Each level features rough, uneven ceilings about 8 feet high, left unfinished for cosmetic effect by the wizards of old.": "每一层都有粗糙、不平整的天花板，大约有8英尺高，是古代的巫师们为了美观而留下的未完成的天花板。",
	"On the first level, doors are ramshackle, rotten things, lightweight and easily opened or broken. Except where otherwise noted, doors of the lower two levels are sturdy but small for their frames, unlikely to stick in place even after all these years.": "在第一层，门是破烂不堪的东西，重量轻，很容易打开或损坏。除另有说明外，下面两层的门都很结实，但对其框架来说很小，即使过了这么多年也不可能粘在原地。",
	"The first level has no usable, surviving light sources. The second and third levels feature periodic wall sconces housing glassy stones magically enchanted to give off dim light. Most of them still work.": "第一层没有可用的、幸存的光源。第二层和第三层有定期的壁灯，里面的玻璃石被施了魔法，发出昏暗的光线。它们中的大多数仍在工作。",
	"The barrow would be silent if not for intruders. Since the sinkhole damaged the site, sound now carries from the second level to the third where the floors are cracked and giving way.": "如果不是因为有入侵者，这个荒冢将是无声的。由于天坑破坏了遗址，现在声音从第二层传到了第三层，那里的地板已经开裂，让路了。",
	"The wizards meant for this chamber to be a guard post, but rather than bring people out here who weren't wizards in their little sect, they later opted to trap the chamber with an experimental magic glyph. (The wizards mostly came and went by teleportation circles in the library anyway.)": "巫师们的意思是让这个密室成为一个岗哨，但他们不想把不是他们小教派中的巫师的人带到这里来，后来他们选择用一个实验性的魔法石刻困住这个密室。(反正巫师们大多是通过图书馆里的传送圈进出的。）",
	"The winds and the chill from outside make their way into this chamber. The remains of wooden stools and a rack of rotten spears suggest this was a guard station once. A squat stele, about three feet tall, stands in the center of the chamber now, marked with a single, deeply etched glyph of bright blue. A silver medallion hangs from the top of the stele, partly blocking the glyph.": "外面的风和寒气都进入了这个房间。木凳的残骸和一个腐烂的长矛架表明这里曾经是一个警卫站。一块约三英尺高的方形石碑现在矗立在密室的中央，上面刻着一个深深的亮蓝色字样。一块银色的奖章挂在石碑的顶端，部分地挡住了石刻。",
	"The stele is marked with a glyph akin to a glyph of warding, but it differs in important ways. Several of these trapped steles can be found throughout the barrow.": "这块石碑上有一个类似于守护石碑的字样，但它在重要的方面有所不同。在整个荒冢中可以找到几块这样的陷阱石碑。",
	"Wooden scraps or detritus in this chamber catch fire if the trap goes off, but the fire has nowhere to spread.": "如果陷阱爆炸，这个房间里的木屑或碎屑就会着火，但火却无处蔓延。",
	"The medallion was set on the stele long ago to prevent its trap from going off. The trap cannot see around the medallion. Removing the medallion makes the stele's trap active again, though whoever wears or carries the medallion does not trigger the trap.": "奖章是很久以前设置在石碑上的，以防止其陷阱爆炸。陷阱无法看到奖章的周围。移除奖章会使石碑的陷阱再次启动，尽管佩戴或携带奖章的人不会触发陷阱。",
	"Morwena and {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF} ignored the stele and the medallion in their rush to reach the library.": "莫维纳和{@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}在急于到达图书馆的过程中忽略了石碑和奖章。",
	"The barrow's trapped steles were crafted with effects not unlike a glyph of warding. However, the steles' glyphs are plain to see even in dim light. Each trapped stele can be activated multiple times; exactly how many depends on the individual stele. When the stele detects a trespasser in front of its glyph it immediately emits a stroke of lightning at the trespasser. If a targeted trespasser does not leave the area, the stele emits lightning again on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties).": "荒冢的被困石碑的制作效果与守护石刻不相上下。然而，即使在昏暗的光线下，这些石碑的字形也是清晰可见的。每块被困的石碑可以被激活多次；具体多少次取决于个别石碑。当石碑检测到在其石刻前有入侵者时，它会立即向入侵者发出一道闪电。如果目标入侵者没有离开该区域，石碑会在主动权计数20时再次发出闪电（失去主动权的平局）。",
	"Anyone not named when the stele was crafted is considered a trespasser unless they wear or carry a medallion of safe passage.": "任何在石碑制作时未被点名的人都被认为是闯入者，除非他们佩戴或携带安全通行的奖章。",
	"This trapped stele detects trespassers in a 30-foot cone in front of its glyph. It has a passive {@skill Perception} score of 18. To disarm or dispel the trap requires a successful DC 18 check. Any creature that triggers the trap and fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.": "这块被困的石碑可以探测到其石刻前30英尺范围内的入侵者。它的被动得分（%0%）为18。解除或驱散这个陷阱需要成功的DC18检查。任何触发陷阱的生物，在DC15的灵巧救赎失败后，会受到22({@damage 4d10})的雷电伤害，如果救赎成功，则会受到一半的伤害。",
	"The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of five times before becoming nothing more than inert stone.": "闪电会点燃该地区没有被佩戴或携带的易燃物。这个石碑在变成惰性石头之前，总共可以发出五次闪电。",
	"The medallion is silver-plated copper engraved with the same glyph as the stele, so the medallion appears coppery. Any creature wearing or visibly carrying one of these medallions does not trigger a trapped stele. The medallion is not magical. It is simply recognized by the steles, throughout the barrow, granting safe passage past their traps.": "奖章是镀银的铜，刻有与石碑相同的字形，所以奖章呈现铜色。任何佩戴或明显携带这种奖章的生物都不会触发被困的石碑。奖章没有魔法。它只是被整个荒冢的石碑所识别，给予安全通过它们的陷阱的权利。",
	"A few open crates, rotten sacks of grain, and scattered heaps of straw stand against the wall here. These supplies could've lasted weeks, once. An iron crowbar sits rusting atop the only closed crate.": "这里靠墙站着几个打开的箱子、腐烂的粮食袋和散落的稻草堆。这些物资曾经可以维持几个星期。在唯一一个封闭的板条箱上，有一根铁撬生锈了。",
	"The floor angles down here before leveling off in the passage and chambers. This room was once the supply cache and pantry for the site. Most of what was left here has rotted to waste.": "地板在这里向下倾斜，然后在通道和房间里变平。这个房间曾经是该地的补给库和储藏室。大部分留在这里的东西都已经腐烂浪费了。",
	"The closed crate contains five golden oil lamps, porcelain wares, and three copper ingots altogether worth 140 gp.": "封闭的箱子里有五盏金油灯、瓷器和三个铜锭，共值140克朗。",
	"Ornately woven red rugs cover much of the uneven floor of this chamber, held down by deep, leather chairs and a split, collapsed table. One wall boasts a goldpainted frame and a smoke-darkened painting of Sword Coast cliffs. The sideboard practically bows from the weight of silver goblets, tea pots, and more.": "这间屋子里不平整的地板上铺着华丽的红色地毯，由深色的皮椅和一张裂开的塌陷的桌子压着。一面墙上挂着一个金漆框架和一幅烟熏火燎的剑海岸悬崖画。边柜几乎被银质高脚杯、茶壶等的重量压弯了腰。",
	"This chamber was once a common room and dining area for the site. The furnishings that once made it comfortable are still here, caked with dust, damp, and debris.": "这个房间曾经是遗址的一个公共房间和用餐区。曾经让这里变得舒适的家具还在这里，被灰尘、潮湿和碎屑所覆盖。",
	"The silver wares, tea pots, and serving trays here are collectively worth 310 gp. The landscape painting is a lost work by a beloved Waterdhavian artist named Saraque Skyhill worth 1,200 gp if properly conserved.": "这里的银器、茶壶和餐盘共值310金币。这幅山水画是一位名叫萨拉克-斯凯尔的受人爱戴的沃特达威艺术家的失传作品，如果得到适当的保护，价值1,200GP。",
	"The air in here is damp and chill. It smells like hay left to rot.": "这里的空气是潮湿和寒冷的。闻起来就像干草腐烂的味道。",
	"Each of these chambers was a private room for a member of the sect who visited or worked on site regularly. Personal effects have mostly been removed, leaving these feeling more like cells than bedrooms. Forgotten bedrolls and empty, unlocked chests are all that remain in most rooms.": "这些房间中的每一间都是为定期访问或在现场工作的教派成员准备的私人房间。个人物品大多已被移走，使这些房间感觉更像牢房而不是卧室。大多数房间里只剩下被遗忘的床单和没有上锁的空箱子。",
	"This chamber hides a secret door leading to a hidden shrine.": "这个密室隐藏着一个秘密的门，通往一个隐藏的神殿。",
	"The secret door is little more than a hatch behind this room's empty chest, hidden by dried mud and a slab meant to look like part of the wall. The door can be spotted with a DC 13 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or passive score.": "这个秘密的门只是这个房间的空箱子后面的一个舱口，被干泥和一块看起来像墙的一部分的石板所隐藏。用DC13智力（（%0%））或智慧（（%1%））检查或被动得分可以发现这扇门。",
	"A little stone altar just two feet wide stands here buried in black dirt at the foot of a narrow chimney that seems to have fallen in. Something glints amid the dirt.": "一个只有两英尺宽的小石坛矗立在这里，被埋在黑色的泥土里，位于一个狭窄的烟囱脚下，似乎已经倒下了。有东西在泥土中闪闪发光。",
	"The hidden shrine itself is half-buried in dirt and loam at the bottom of a once-empty chimney, meant to allow the shrine to see the stars. Whatever deity was once honored here, all that remains are melted candles, 1 sp, and a medallion of safe passage.": "隐秘的神龛本身被半埋在泥土和黄土中，位于一个曾经空无一人的烟囱底部，目的是让神龛看到星星。不管这里曾经敬奉过什么神灵，现在只剩下融化的蜡烛、1个sp和一个安全通道的奖章。",
	"The north, east, and west walls are made of plaster adorned with colorful but smoke-faded murals. Each mural depicts figures in stark robes—some red, some green, some blue—painted as if they are part of a procession carrying trays of fire, lit incense, and silver toward the doorway to area 6.": "北面、东面和西面的墙壁是由石膏制成的，上面装饰着五颜六色但已被烟熏过的壁画。每幅壁画都描绘了身着鲜明的长袍的人物--有些是红色的，有些是绿色的，有些是蓝色的--仿佛他们是游行队伍的一部分，抬着装着火、点燃的香和银子的盘子，走向6区的门口。",
	"Murals along three walls portray figures in bright robes of green or red or blue marching in file through an abstract environment suggesting perhaps a bright garden and stained glass. These figures are all human in size but depicted in various fashions and styles beneath their robes. The south wall is bare, unfinished slabs of stone, marking the original outer edge of the barrow.": "沿着三面墙的壁画描绘了身穿绿色或红色或蓝色明亮长袍的人物，他们排着队穿过一个抽象的环境，也许是一个明亮的花园和彩色玻璃。这些人物都是人的大小，但在他们的长袍下被描绘成各种时尚和风格。南墙是光秃秃的，未完成的石板，标志着荒冢的原始外缘。",
	"The secret door to area 7 is a narrow wooden section hidden under the plaster, decorated by a figure in green robes with one hand over his eyes. The door can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "通往第7区的秘门是隐藏在石膏下的一个狭窄的木质部分，上面有一个身穿绿色长袍的人，一只手遮住眼睛。只要成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查就可以找到这扇门。",

	"The robed figures on these walls wear detailed, multi-colored robes with cuffs and hems adorned with magic words and sigils. Some of these figures wear long beards or long braids; others are clad in buckled bands of leather and sleek leggings. Each one is depicted carrying treasures or offerings toward the stairs that descend deeper ahead.": "这些墙上的长袍人物穿着细致的、多色的长袍，袖口和下摆都装饰着魔法文字和符号。其中一些人留着长胡子或长辫子；另一些人穿着带扣的皮革和光滑的紧身裤。每个人都被描绘成携带着宝物或供品，朝着前方更深的楼梯走去。",

	"Each mummy moves to escape its crypt and attack trespassers, whether that means the adventurers, elementals, {@creature Malivar|AitFR-ISF}, or anyone else. They return to their crypts if they cannot find targets within 100 feet of the crypts' secret door, returning as necessary to drive off intruders. They do not seal themselves in and do not open the door of their own accord.": "每个木乃伊都会行动起来，逃出自己的墓穴，攻击闯入者，不管是指冒险者、元素者、（%0%），还是其他任何人。如果它们在墓穴的暗门100英尺范围内找不到目标，它们就会返回墓穴，必要时返回以赶走入侵者。他们不会把自己封在里面，也不会主动打开门。",
	"The crypts are fairly sparely appointed, as the wizards interred here left their belongings to the library and their apprentices.

Area 16C includes a small obsidian statue of a medusa with emerald eyes worth 425 gp.": "墓穴的布置相当简陋，因为葬在这里的巫师将他们的物品留给了图书馆和他们的学徒。不过，这里还是可以找到一些银色的花瓶、金色的瓮和高脚杯，总共价值300金币。16C区包括一个小型的黑曜石雕像，是一个长着翡翠色眼睛的美杜莎，价值425金币。",
	"The adventurers may have treasure to sell and lore to lend, or questions in mind and wounds to tend. The aftermath of this adventure is a bundle of questions, so focus on the characters and what they want to do next, perhaps with downtime activities. If they want to chase down Tyreus and Morwena, that trail might simply go cold—for now. Their threads reappear in the next adventure: {@adventure The Hidden Page|AitFR-THP}.": "冒险者们可能有宝物要卖，有传说要借，或者有问题要问，有伤口要处理。这次冒险的后果是一堆问题，所以要关注人物和他们接下来想做的事情，也许可以用休息时间的活动。如果他们想追捕泰勒斯和莫维娜，那么这条线索可能就会暂时中断。他们的线索会在下一次冒险中重新出现：（%0%）。",
	"Gifting or selling the library's remains, and any other treasures, might occupy the adventurers until the next adventure. The barrow, or what's left of it, might be of interest to sages—or the adventurers might keep it for themselves.": "在下一次冒险之前，将图书馆的残骸和任何其他宝物赠与或出售，可能会让冒险者们感到满意。荒冢，或者它剩下的东西，可能会引起圣人的兴趣--或者冒险者们可能会把它留给自己。",
	"Investigations into the identities and fates of the barrow wizards doesn't reveal tremendous secrets but neither does it yield many answers. The following items of lore are important for the next adventure, but much about those old wizards is left for you to decide, customize, or leave in mystery.": "对荒冢巫师的身份和命运的调查并没有揭示出巨大的秘密，但也没有得出很多答案。以下是对下一次冒险很重要的传说，但关于这些老巫师的许多事情则留给你来决定、定制或留有神秘色彩。",
	"The leader of the barrow wizards' sect was a traveler from \"a faraway place\" or \"a distant world.\"": "荒冢巫师教派的领袖是一个来自 \"遥远的地方 \"或 \"遥远的世界 \"的旅行者。",

	"She lived in a townhouse in Waterdeep sometimes, but left it walled up when she returned to her homeland. The sect fell apart without her.": "她有时住在沃特迪普的一个联排别墅里，但当她回到故乡时，就把它围起来了。没有她，这个教派就散了。",
	"The teleportation circles in the library led to places helpful for the wizards' sect. One led to the attic of the master's boarded-up, derelict townhouse. The other is damaged and presumably not working—or you can use it to plug into your campaign elsewhere.": "图书馆里的传送圈通向对巫师教派有帮助的地方。其中一个通向主人的阁楼，阁楼上有木板，荒废的联排别墅。另一个已经损坏，估计不能用了，或者你可以用它来插入你在其他地方的活动。",

The adventurers haven't seen the last of them yet.": "泰勒斯和莫维娜神奇地被传送到泰勒斯的一个隐藏的圣地。泰勒斯从荒冢中得到了他想要的东西：一本魔法书，里面有一把隐藏的钥匙。现在，他和莫维娜正在研究他们的魔法，相互了解，并计划他们的下一步行动。冒险家们还没有看到他们的最后一面。",
