	"Decades ago, a wizard named Sylvene came to the Sword Coast from another plane of existence called Ravnica. While exploring Waterdeep and nearby lands, she met and fell in love with the father of her child. She built a refuge for them in a small demiplane of her own creation, but eventually she went home to Ravnica with her infant son and never returned.": "几十年前，一位名叫西尔维尼的巫师从另一个叫做拉夫尼卡的位面来到了剑海岸。在探索沃特迪普和附近的土地时，她遇到了她孩子的父亲并与之相爱。她在自己创造的一个小型半位面为他们建立了一个避难所，但最终她带着她的幼子回到了拉夫尼卡，再也没有回来。",
	"Now her grandson seeks to recover relics of her power by exploring Sylvene's history in the Realms—and he doesn't care who he hurts along the way. The consequences of his careless pillaging already ripple out to impact others.": "现在，她的孙子试图通过探索西尔维尼在王国中的历史来恢复她的力量的遗迹--他不在乎他在路上伤害了谁。他粗心大意的掠夺行为的后果已经波及到了其他人。",

	"This adventure begins when the characters discover a secret door and overcome the traps beyond it. The treasure within takes them to a strange island demiplane in Part 2. At the center of that island is the refuge of a vanished wizard, described in Part 3. The fate of the demiplane and its current inhabitants is ultimately in the adventurers' hands.": "当人物发现一扇秘密的门并克服门外的陷阱时，这场冒险就开始了。在第二部分中，里面的宝藏把他们带到了一个奇怪的岛屿半平面。在该岛的中心是一个消失的巫师的避难所，在第三部分中描述。半位面及其现有居民的命运最终掌握在冒险者的手中。",

	"A lone mage is at work enacting his villainous plan near the Sword Coast. He is a trespasser from another plane. He is here in pursuit of legends and lore, in the footsteps of his forebears who came here long ago. He is called Tyreus, though few here know him by name.": "一个孤独的法师正在工作，在剑海岸附近制定他的反派计划。他是一个来自另一个世界的闯入者。他在这里追寻传奇和传说，追寻他很久以前来到这里的祖先的足迹。他被称为提瑞斯，尽管这里很少有人知道他的名字。",
	"By ransacking and looting the past, Tyreus hopes to gather enough arcane power to create a powerful, important future for himself. In his view, that means having people bow to him. Tyreus seeks his own grandeur above all.": "通过洗劫和掠夺过去，泰勒斯希望收集足够的奥术力量，为自己创造一个强大、重要的未来。在他看来，这意味着让人们向他鞠躬。泰勒斯追求的是他自己的辉煌，而不是一切。",
	"While plundering the demiplane refuge of his grandmother, Sylvene, Tyreus makes enemies of Sylvene's old allies, who call out for help the only way they know how—through Sylvene's leftover magic. Their cries for help may be what draws adventurers to Sylvene's hidden refuge, thereby determining the fate of that demiplane and revealing Tyreus's dangerous plan for the future.": "在掠夺他祖母Sylvene的半位面避难所时，Tyreus与Sylvene的老盟友为敌，他们以他们知道的唯一方式--通过Sylvene遗留的魔法来呼救。他们的呼救声可能是吸引冒险家们前往西尔维尼的隐蔽避难所的原因，从而决定了该半位面的命运，并揭示了泰勒斯对未来的危险计划。",
	"Although he does not appear in person in this adventure, Tyreus casts a long shadow. The characters may not discover all the following information during the adventure, but it can be useful when foreshadowing Tyreus.": "虽然他在这次冒险中没有亲自出现，但泰鲁斯投下了一个长长的阴影。在冒险过程中，人物可能不会发现以下所有的信息，但在预示泰勒斯的时候，这些信息会很有用。",
	"The wizard who crafted the demiplane at the heart of this adventure—a female human mage called Sylvene—was an explorer from Ravnica who visited the Realms decades ago. She fell in love with a man who lost his life to misadventure in the High Moor. Sylvene was pregnant when he died, and she gave birth to their son, Tyberio, in Waterdeep. She eventually returned to Ravnica to raise him, and she passed away when Tyberio was twelve.": "这个冒险的核心是制作半位面的巫师--一个叫希尔文的女性人类法师--是一个来自拉夫尼卡的探险家，几十年前曾访问过这个王国。她爱上了一个在高沼泽误入歧途而丧生的男人。他死的时候希尔维尼已经怀孕了，她在沃特德普生下了他们的儿子泰贝里欧。她最终回到拉夫尼卡抚养他，并在泰贝里欧12岁时离开人世。",
	"Tyberio rebelled by refusing to study magic. He sought a quiet life as a craftsman and merchant but carried a certain bitterness and resentment toward the world. He always wanted to visit the land where his parents met, but never managed to.": "泰贝里欧因拒绝学习魔法而反叛。他寻求作为工匠和商人的平静生活，但对这个世界怀有某种苦涩和怨恨。他一直想去他父母相遇的地方，但从未成功过。",
	"Tyberio started a family with his wife, Ayraea, and had one son. In his bitterness, Tyberio forbade his son from studying magic—but it didn't work. Tyberio's teenaged son secretly began learning the ways of mages the same summer that, coincidentally, Tyberio and Ayraea passed away from a minor plague in Ravnica. Their son, furious over his parents' fears of magic, over their death, and over his own powerlessness, devoted his life to wizardry thereafter. That angry wizard is Tyreus.": "泰贝里欧与他的妻子阿伊拉亚组建了家庭，并有一个儿子。在他的痛苦中，泰贝里欧禁止他的儿子学习魔法--但这并不奏效。泰贝里欧的十几岁的儿子秘密地开始学习法师的方法，就在那个夏天，泰贝里欧和艾瑞亚因拉夫尼卡的一场小瘟疫而去世，这是个巧合。他们的儿子对他父母对魔法的恐惧、对他们的死亡、对他自己的无能为力感到愤怒，此后将他的一生都献给了巫师。这个愤怒的巫师就是泰鲁斯。",
	"The previous adventure in this series took place in an abandoned, secret sanctum on the High Moors of the Realms, buried in a place called the Wizard's Barrow. Tyreus ransacked that sanctum's library and left monsters behind to destroy what was left of it.": "这个系列的前一次冒险发生在王国的高沼泽地上一个被遗弃的秘密圣地，它被埋在一个叫做巫师之冢的地方。泰勒斯洗劫了那个圣殿的图书馆，并留下了怪物来摧毁它的遗迹。",
	"Sylvene was one of the wizards who taught and practiced magic in the Wizard's Barrow decades before. It was guarded by trapped steles not unlike the emitter stone in Part 1 of this adventure.": "西尔维尼是几十年前在巫师墓穴中教授和练习魔法的巫师之一。它由被困的石碑守卫，与本冒险第一部分中的发射器石块不一样。",
	"If the previous adventure isn't part of your campaign, this scenario can serve to involve your players' characters for the first time or provide a simple, standalone experience of magic and danger.": "如果前面的冒险不是你活动的一部分，这个场景可以让你的玩家的角色第一次参与进来，或者提供一个简单的、独立的魔法和危险的体验。",
	"Adventurers can become involved in this scenario in a number of ways—some of them seemingly coincidental. When the mysterious groundskeepers of Sylvene's refuge call out for help, those cries might manifest in the Realms in the subtlest ways.": "冒险家们可以通过多种方式参与到这一场景中来--其中一些看起来是巧合的。当希尔维尼避难所的神秘地勤人员呼救时，这些呼救声可能会以最微妙的方式体现在王国中。",
	"Adventurers looking into the origins and history of the Wizard's Barrow from the prior adventure discover an abandoned townhouse in Waterdeep. The building was once home to a wizard from afar but has been boarded up, is empty, and has been ransacked several times. Until now, no one has discovered the secret door that begins this adventure, but the cries of the keepers make it easier to locate now.": "冒险家们在调查之前的冒险中的巫师荒冢的起源和历史时，发现了沃特德普的一座废弃的联排别墅。这座建筑曾经是一个远道而来的巫师的家，但已经被木板封住，空无一人，并被洗劫过几次。直到现在，还没有人发现开始这次冒险的秘密之门，但守门人的呼喊使它现在更容易被找到。",
	"To draw the characters into this adventure (whether they've explored the Wizard's Barrow or not), place the secret door and hidden chambers that kick off this scenario into another adventure or short side trek, then follow the adventurers into the demiplanar refuge when they have the planar key.": "为了吸引角色进入这个冒险（无论他们是否探索过巫师的荒冢），将开启这个场景的秘密门和隐藏的房间放到另一个冒险或短途跋涉中，然后在冒险者拿到平面钥匙后跟随他们进入半平面避难所。",
	"The cries of the keepers can manifest in a telepathic emanation from the planar key itself, a wordless sense of desperate pleading for aid.": "守护者的呼喊可以表现为来自平面钥匙本身的心灵感应，一种无言的绝望求援的感觉。",
	"Perhaps the adventurers are hired to find and open the secret door by a sage attempting to learn the secret history of Sylvene and her former cadre of wizards, for posterity's sake. The sage sends the adventurers to Sylvene's abandoned townhouse, which has been well pilfered except for the previously undiscovered secret door in the cellar—made all the more obvious now by the cries of the keepers.": "也许冒险家们是受雇于一位圣人来寻找并打开这扇秘密的门，他试图了解西尔维尼和她以前的巫师队伍的秘密历史，以利于后人。圣人把冒险家们送到了西尔维尼被遗弃的镇守府，那里已经被偷得差不多了，只有地窖里那扇之前未被发现的暗门--现在看守人的哭声更加明显。",
	"At various points throughout play, the adventurers can discover lore about Tyreus, his plans, and the history of Sylvene's extraplanar refuge from the demiplane's keepers or from {@creature Morwena Veilmist|AitFR-THP}, whom Tyreus abandoned in the demiplane. Reveal lore in response to questions the adventurers ask of these NPCs or other suitable roleplaying cues. In general, though an NPC can reveal multiple pieces of lore at once, aim to reveal lore in the order listed.": "在整个游戏的不同阶段，冒险者可以从半位面的守护者或被泰勒斯遗弃在半位面的{@creature Morwena Veilmist|AitFR-THP}那里发现关于泰勒斯、他的计划以及希尔维尼星外避难所的历史的传说。根据冒险者向这些NPC提出的问题或其他合适的角色扮演线索来揭示传说。一般来说，虽然一个NPC可以同时揭示多个传说，但要按照列出的顺序来揭示传说。",
	"The keepers of the demiplane at the heart of this adventure know some things about Sylvene's history from conversing with her, decades ago, and they know all about her demiplane. They also know a bit about Tyreus after observing him on the island. The keepers share this lore with adventurers if they feel it is safe and wise to do so:": "这场冒险的核心是半位面的守护者，他们在几十年前与希尔维尼的对话中知道了一些关于希尔维尼的历史，而且他们知道她的半位面的所有情况。他们在岛上观察了泰瑞斯之后，也知道了一些关于泰瑞斯的情况。如果他们觉得这样做是安全和明智的，那么守护者会与冒险者分享这些传说。",
	"Sylvene was a wise and thoughtful human mage who combined adventurous explorations with an almost anthropological study of the Realms. She came from a place called Ravnica.": "希尔维尼是一位睿智而有思想的人类法师，她将冒险的探索与对王国的人类学研究相结合。她来自一个叫拉夫尼卡的地方。",
	"Sylvene fell in love with a human man from some village of the Sword Coast. They met in Secomber. She wouldn't say much about him except that he perished on an adventure.": "希尔维尼爱上了一个来自剑海岸某个村庄的人类男子。他们在塞孔伯相遇。她不愿意多说他的事，只说他在一次冒险中丧生。",
	"Sylvene brought her infant son, Tyberio, to the refuge several times before they inexplicably stopped coming back. That was decades ago, but the keepers don't keep careful track of time, so they can't be sure how long.": "西尔维尼带着她的幼子泰贝里欧来到避难所好几次，后来他们莫名其妙地不再回来。那是几十年前的事了，但看守人没有仔细跟踪时间，所以他们不能确定有多久了。",
	"Tyreus is a white, male human mage—an adventurer, not a scholar. He arrived with Morwena and a horrific shadow creature to ransack the refuge. Tyreus left with just an armful of books.": "泰勒斯是一个白人男性人类魔法师--一个冒险家，而不是一个学者。他和莫维娜以及一个可怕的影子生物来到这里，洗劫避难所。泰鲁斯离开时只带了一臂的书。",
	"Seero took the form of a middle-aged man to speak with Tyreus, but Tyreus flew into a rage, accusing Seero of \"wearing my father's face.\" The keepers are sure Seero had taken on the form of an adult Tyberio, who must be Tyreus's father. \"They both have Sylvene's eyes.\"": "西罗化身为一个中年男子与提瑞斯交谈，但提瑞斯飞快地发怒，指责西罗 \"戴着我父亲的脸\"。守护者们确信塞罗化身为成年的泰贝里欧，他一定是泰勒斯的父亲。\"他们都有希尔维尼的眼睛。\"",
	"Tyreus and Morwena argued about the fate of the refuge, and Tyreus stormed off, then teleported away without her.": "泰勒斯和莫维娜为避难所的命运争论不休，泰勒斯暴跳如雷，然后撇下她传送走了。",
	"Morwena knows things about Tyreus from time she spent with him since the previous adventure. She may be persuaded to share some or all of this lore with adventurers if she believes it is advantageous to her:": "莫维娜从上一次冒险后与提瑞斯相处的时间中知道一些关于提瑞斯的事情。如果她认为这对她有利，她可能会被说服与冒险者分享部分或全部这些传说。",
	"Tyreus believes power is the pinnacle quality of a mage and that power justifies itself. He doesn't care who he hurts if it empowers him.": "泰勒斯相信权力是法师的巅峰品质，而且权力可以证明自己是正确的。他不在乎伤害谁，只要能给他带来力量。",
	"Tyreus blames his parents for denying him his \"birthright\" of magical power, which he should have inherited from his grandmother, Sylvene.": "泰勒斯指责他的父母剥夺了他的魔法力量的 \"天赋权利\"，他本应从他的祖母西尔维尼那里继承这一权利。",
	"Tyreus is an angry and sometimes petulant person. He thinks if he gathers enough power, he can make a place for himself in the world where he can be strong and, finally, find happiness.": "泰勒斯是一个愤怒的人，有时还很娇气。他认为如果他聚集了足够的力量，他就能在这个世界上为自己谋得一席之地，在那里他可以变得强大，并最终找到幸福。",
	"When he looks at the Realms, Tyreus only sees a place to be conquered or plundered out of spite. Morwena tried (and failed) to convince him the Realms could make him powerful—that he could carve out a part of the Sword Coast for them to rule together—and that's when she knew Tyreus would not share power.": "当他看向王国的时候，提瑞斯只看到了一个可以被征服或出于怨恨而被掠夺的地方。莫维娜试图（但失败了）说服他王国可以使他强大--他可以在剑海岸划出一块地方让他们共同统治--这时她知道提瑞斯不会分享权力。",
	"Morwena and Tyreus argued, but Tyreus's anger wouldn't let him trust her. He abandoned her in the demiplane because she threatened him—and because he thought he might need her later.": "莫维娜和提瑞斯争吵起来，但提瑞斯的愤怒不让他相信她。他把她遗弃在半位面，因为她威胁了他--也因为他认为他以后可能需要她。",
	"Morwena won't help Tyreus again. \"He's only out for himself,\" she says. \"He's a powerful mage already, but he cannot see himself or others well enough to recognize how dangerous he is. What a waste.\"": "莫维娜不会再帮助泰勒斯。\"他只为自己着想，\"她说。\"他已经是个强大的法师了，但他不能很好地看清自己和别人，不能认识到自己有多危险。真是浪费。\"",
	"Remember that Morwena is willfully evil. All of the above is true to her experience with, and opinions of, Tyreus. Her thoughts may be influenced by her own lowered opinion of him, and he may now be more influenced by the time they spent together than he wanted to admit. But Morwena is done with Tyreus. His pursuit of personal grandeur is in the way of her own.": "记住，莫维娜是故意作恶的。以上都是她与提瑞斯的经历和对提瑞斯的看法。她的想法可能受到她自己对他的评价降低的影响，而他现在可能受到他们在一起的时间的影响比他想承认的要大。但莫维娜已经和提洛斯结束了。他对个人辉煌的追求妨碍了她自己。",
	"The adventure begins when the characters discover a secret door and the hidden chambers behind it. The exact location of this secret door can vary based on your campaign's needs. The hidden chambers are depicted in map 1.": "当角色们发现一扇秘密的门和门后隐藏的房间时，冒险开始了。这个秘密门的确切位置可以根据你的活动需要而变化。地图1中描述了隐藏的房间。",
	"These hidden chambers teem with dangerous traps meant to protect the book in area 6.": "这些隐蔽的房间里充满了危险的陷阱，旨在保护第6区的书。",
	"Marks of safe passage found in the Wizard's Barrow in the previous adventure also work here in areas 1, 2, and 3. Creatures wearing a medallion of safe passage do not trigger the traps installed in areas 1 and 3 but are vulnerable to their effects if those traps are triggered by others in those areas.": "在之前的冒险中，在巫师墓穴中发现的安全通道的标记在这里也能在1、2和3区发挥作用。戴着安全通道徽章的生物不会触发安装在1号和3号区域的陷阱，但如果这些区域的其他人触发了这些陷阱，则容易受到其影响。",
	"These hidden chambers are made of sturdy, grey stones, dry and dusty with age.": "这些隐蔽的房间是由坚固的灰色石头制成的，因年代久远而变得干燥和布满灰尘。",
	"The chambers have flat, 8-foot ceilings of stone.": "这些房间有平坦的8英尺高的石头天花板。",
	"These chambers are unlit and feature no sconces or fixtures for torches or lamps.": "这些房间没有灯光，也没有火把或灯具的壁炉或装置。",
	"At first, the chambers are silent. When the traps are activated, the place crackles with lightning and whirs with grinding metal joints and hinges even though the traps are mostly animated by magic.": "起初，这些房间是安静的。当陷阱被激活时，这个地方就会发出噼里啪啦的闪电声，并发出金属接头和铰链的摩擦声，尽管这些陷阱大部分是由魔法激活的。",
	"The secret door to Sylvene's hidden chambers has gone undetected and undisturbed for decades. The door itself is a collection of stones exactly matching the wall in which the door is set. It takes a successful DC 22 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to locate it.": "通往西尔维尼密室的秘密之门几十年来一直没有被发现，也没有被打扰。这道门本身是一组石头，与门所在的墙壁完全吻合。需要通过DC22智力（{@skill Investigation}）或智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查才能找到它。",

	"The door also opens if the keepers of Sylvene's magical refuge call out for help at the pillars on their island demiplane. Therefore it's possible for adventurers to find the door already ajar, making it easy to begin the adventure.": "如果西尔维尼的魔法避难所的守卫者在他们岛上的半位面的柱子前呼救，这扇门也会打开。因此，冒险者有可能发现这扇门已经打开了，这样就很容易开始冒险。",
	"Beyond the door, a wide corridor of stone leads to a dull, iron archway. The walls glitter and shine as if silver coins have been set into the walls at irregular intervals.": "门外，一条宽阔的石头走廊通向一个沉闷的铁拱门。墙壁闪闪发光，仿佛银币以不规则的间隔镶嵌在墙壁上。",
	"A dozen tiny mirrors are set into the walls in this area, seemingly at random. If any living creature casts a reflection in one of these mirrors, every intact mirror conjures a dart of magical force that flits wildly through the air at the end of that creature's turn, attacking up to 12 creatures in the corridor. Make a single attack roll per creature with a +8 bonus to hit, dealing 22 ({@damage 4d10}) force damage on a hit.": "十几面小镜子被镶嵌在这个区域的墙上，似乎是随机的。如果任何生物在其中一面镜子中投下倒影，每一面完整的镜子都会产生一个魔法力量的飞镖，在该生物的回合结束时疯狂地在空中飞舞，攻击走廊中最多12个生物。对每个生物进行一次攻击，命中率为+8，命中后造成22({@damage 4d10})的力量伤害。",
	"Mirrors can be removed with various tools and a successful skill check (DC 13) or attacked (AC 15, 2 hit points) to disable the trap. Each mirror disabled reduces the trap's attack bonus by 1.": "镜子可以用各种工具移除，成功的技能检查（DC13）或攻击（AC15，2点）可以使陷阱失效。每废掉一面镜子，陷阱的攻击力就减少1。",

Any creature in this area when the stele is triggered is subject to the lightning bolt fired by the stele, as described in area 3.": "这个区域的大部分都在走廊尽头的被困石碑所监督的区域内（区域3）。当石碑被触发时，任何在这个区域的生物都会受到石碑发射的闪电的影响，如区域3中所述。",
	"A wide, flat stele stands here, set into the mortar and etched with a one-foot-tall glyph of long, jagged lines. The glyph emits the faintest glow, like the wick of a blown-out candle.": "一块宽而平的石碑矗立在这里，镶嵌在灰泥中，上面刻着一个一英尺高的锯齿形长线石刻。这个石刻发出最微弱的光芒，就像吹灭的蜡烛的灯芯。",
	"The stele can detect trespassers out to a range of 60 feet in front of it, regardless of illumination. It has a passive {@skill Perception} score of 18. To disarm or dispel this trap requires a successful DC 18 check. When triggered, the trap emits a bolt of lightning the whole length of area 2.": "石碑可以探测到它前方60英尺范围内的入侵者，不受光照影响。它的被动（%0%）得分是18。拆除或驱散这个陷阱需要成功的DC18检查。当被触发时，陷阱会发出一道闪电，覆盖整个2号区域的长度。",

Its scything blades whirl and slice through the air, guided not by machinery but by magic.": "当镜面飞镖陷阱（区域1）或魔法石碑（区域3）被触发时，这个陷阱就会激活。一旦被激活，这个陷阱就会继续运作，直到失效。它的镰刀在空气中旋转和切割，不是由机械而是由魔法引导。",

	"The first trespasser is {@creature Morwena Veilmist|AitFR-THP}, once a Red Wizard of Thay and now Tyreus's abandoned accomplice. She is likely reading everything she can inside the refuge (in area 2).

	"Additionally, Tyreus brought a minion with him to the demiplane, in case he needed it to fight on his behalf. He left it here when he departed. It is a {@creature greater shadow horror|AitFR-THP} from Ravnica. It treats the cellar of the refuge (area 10) as its den and stalks the refuge by night to protect the keystone.": "此外，泰勒斯还带了一个奴仆到半位面，以备他需要它代表他战斗。他离开的时候把它留在了这里。它是一个来自拉夫尼卡的（%0%）。它把避难所的地窖（10号区域）当作自己的巢穴，并在夜间跟踪避难所以保护钥石。",
	"To leave this demiplane, Sylvene intended visitors to require the blessing of one of the {@creature usagt|AitFR-THP} keepers. Once, this simply required a conversation with the usagt in which they took the form of someone from the conversationalist's past and estimated whether Sylvene would prefer a guest to depart or an intruder to be stranded in the demiplane for later confrontation.": "要离开这个半位面，西尔维尼打算让游客需要得到其中一个（%0%）守护者的祝福。有一次，这只需要与守门人进行对话，他们会以对话者过去的某个人的形式出现，并估计西尔维尼是希望客人离开，还是希望入侵者滞留在半位面以便日后对质。",
	"In the current, fraught circumstances, the usagt want to keep adventurers around to deal with their situation, if possible. The usagt are not possessive creatures, so they don't necessarily object to adventurers leaving with treasure, either. The keepers sadly realize Sylvene isn't coming back.": "在目前这种混乱的情况下，如果可能的话，乌萨格特人希望把冒险者留在身边，以处理他们的情况。usagt人不是占有欲很强的生物，所以他们也不一定反对冒险者带着财宝离开。守护者们悲伤地意识到希尔维尼不会再回来了。",
	"Once their favor is earned, the usagt cast {@spell banishment} on visitors, then maintain concentration on the spell for 1 minute to ensure visitors leave for good. (The usagt know a variation of banishment that optionally transports targets to the previous plane they were on, so extraplanar characters can be returned to the Realms rather than their plane of origin.)": "一旦赢得了他们的好感，巫师就会对来访者施放（%0%），然后在1分钟内保持对咒语的专注，以确保来访者永远离开。(usagt知道一个放逐的变种，可以选择将目标传送到他们之前所在的位面，所以星外人物可以被送回王国而不是他们的起源位面）。",
	"If no one remains in the demiplane who is attuned to its keystone, the demiplane collapses over 10 ({@dice 1d10 + 5}) minutes. The sea overtakes the island and then gradually dissipates into nothingness. Creatures still in the demiplane in the last minute of the collapse are magically transported back to the plane from which they arrived. Objects like treasure, books, and furniture still in the demiplane are most likely lost or destroyed.": "如果没有人留在半位面中与它的基石相适应，半位面就会在10({@dice 1d10 + 5})分钟内坍塌。海水淹没了岛屿，然后逐渐消散成虚无。在崩塌的最后一分钟，仍在半位面的生物被神奇地传送回他们到达的那个位面。像宝藏、书籍和家具等仍在半位面的物品很可能会丢失或被摧毁。",
	"Removing the keystone from the demiplane also causes it to collapse. Once removed from the demiplane, the keystone's power dissipates and is lost forever.": "将钥石从半位面移除也会导致其崩溃。一旦从半位面移除，钥石的力量就会消散并永远消失。",
	"The wide, comfortable house at the heart of the island is easy to spot. Though it has been exposed to the island's weather for years with minimal maintenance, the elements have been kind and the house wears its age like a handsome patina. The house, the weather, and the island are all aspects of the same magic, after all; they were made for each other.": "位于岛屿中心的宽大舒适的房子很容易被发现。虽然它多年来一直暴露在岛上的天气中，很少维护，但元素一直很仁慈，房子的年龄就像一个英俊的铜锈。房子、天气和岛屿毕竟是同一个魔法的所有方面；它们是为彼此而生的。",
	"Sylvene etched her name for the refuge—The Hidden Page—into the wooden frames above the outer doors on the east and west sides of the building. She hoped to pass this place on to her son, Tyberio, one day. Even for mages, life seldom goes quite as planned.": "西尔维尼在建筑东西两侧外门上方的木框上刻下了她为避难所起的名字--隐秘之页。她希望有一天能把这个地方传给她的儿子泰贝里欧。即使对法师来说，生活也很少能按计划进行。",
	"In her absence, the keepers cleaned and maintained the place as best they could. Tyreus and Morwena have since searched through the place with little regard for its tidiness.": "在她不在的时候，看守人尽其所能地打扫和维护这个地方。此后，泰勒斯和莫维娜就一直在这里搜寻，很少考虑到这里的整洁度。",
	"The Hidden Page is made of thick wooden timbers and plastered stones, presented in a simple, bright style with a wide, flat roof. The layout of the place is depicted in map 3.": "隐秘之页是由厚厚的木头和抹灰的石头组成的，以简单、明亮的风格呈现，屋顶宽大、平整。该地的布局在地图3中描述。",
	"Each room features 10-foot ceilings with exposed wooden rafters and patterned plaster. The floors feature wide slate tiles and copious, lavish rugs.": "每个房间都有10英尺高的天花板，有裸露的木质椽子和有图案的石膏。地板上铺有宽大的石板砖和大量奢华的地毯。",
	"Security not being a major concern, the doors of the refuge are simple, lightweight wood with ornate fixtures and no locks.": "安全不是主要问题，避难所的门是简单的轻质木头，有华丽的装置，没有锁。",
	"High, wide windows sit just below the ceilings in most outer walls to allow ambient light. Lanterns and candles abound to supplement the fireplaces.": "大多数外墙的天花板下都有高而宽的窗户，以保证环境光线。灯笼和蜡烛比比皆是，以补充壁炉的不足。",
	"Normally, a serene quiet permeates the refuge, with the occasional sound of waves and wind.": "通常情况下，避难所里弥漫着一种宁静的气息，偶尔会有海浪和风声。",
	"This wide foyer is designed to practically bask in sunlight. The white plaster walls here amplify the glow from outside. The floor is made of tidy, slate tiles.": "这个宽阔的门厅被设计成几乎可以沐浴在阳光下。这里的白色石膏墙放大了外面的光亮。地板是由整洁的石板砖铺成的。",
	"Once, this room was intended to receive guests and be a place for people to doff sandy shoes. This is the main entrance used by the keepers, out of habit. A pair of sandals and a pair of boots, dried and almost rotten, stand near the outer doorway.": "曾经，这个房间是用来接待客人的，是人们脱沙鞋的地方。出于习惯，这是饲养员们使用的主要入口。一双凉鞋和一双靴子，已经风干，几乎腐烂，站在外门附近。",
	"Despite the glow of the fireplace, this room feels dark and cave-like, insulated by shelves and shelves of books—many of which lay in piles or heaps on the floor. The room smells like old books. Loose leaves of paper lay abandoned on the floor here and there, torn or fallen out of the collection. Whatever order these books might once have been in, they are in chaos now.": "尽管有壁炉的光芒，但这个房间给人以黑暗和洞穴般的感觉，被书架和书架上的书所隔绝，其中许多书成堆或成堆地躺在地上。房间里有一股旧书的味道。松散的纸叶被遗弃在地板上，在这里和那里，被撕碎或从藏书中掉落。无论这些书曾经是怎样的秩序，它们现在都是混乱的。",
	"This room housed Sylvene's mundane personal library, which only filled the shelves to about half capacity at the time of her last visit. Many volumes of history, natural history, poetry, religion, and other subjects have been stacked throughout this room by Tyreus and Morwena since they arrived. All of these books are from and about the Realms.": "这个房间里放着西尔维尼平凡的个人图书馆，在她上次来的时候，书架上只装了大约一半的内容。许多历史、自然史、诗歌、宗教和其他主题的书卷，自从泰勒斯和莫维娜来到这里后，已经堆满了整个房间。所有这些书都是来自王国和关于王国的。",

	"Near the west-facing fireplace, a life-size statue of a deerhound reclines like a dog by a fire. The skill displayed by its carving is exquisite.": "在朝西的壁炉附近，有一个真人大小的猎鹿犬雕像，像狗一样躺在火边。它的雕刻所表现出的技巧是非常精湛的。",
	"Speaking the proper command words within 30 feet of the deerhound statue activates the statue's magic and instantly casts {@spell Mordenkainen's faithful hound} centered on the statue. The faithful hound cannot be conjured again until 8 hours have passed.

During dawn and dusk hours, it stays close to the refuge. Its goal is to keep anyone, including Morwena, from interacting with the keystone, on Tyreus's orders. In its mind, Morwena is no threat unless she ventures into the cellar. (Thus, she doesn't.) The shadow horror is satisfied with keeping new trespassers, like the adventurers, away from the house—and just as happy to kill them.": "在白天的时候，（%0%）潜伏在这里。到了晚上，它更喜欢在岛上或避难所内游荡，边走边穿过门和墙。在黎明和黄昏时分，它呆在避难所附近。它的目标是阻止任何人，包括Morwena，在Tyreus的命令下与钥石互动。在它看来，除非莫维娜冒险进入地窖，否则她是没有威胁的。(因此，她没有。）影子恐怖满足于让新的闯入者，如冒险者，远离房子--而且也很高兴能杀死他们。",
	"The keystone is set in the center of the ceiling. It is a dark, jagged stone with veins of gold, all etched with arcane runes and sigils, very much out of place here. It's about the size of a loaf of bread and weighs about 10 pounds.": "钥石镶嵌在天花板的中央。它是一块深色的参差不齐的石头，上面有金色的纹路，都刻着奥秘的符文和符号，与这里非常不相称。它大约有一个面包的大小，重约10磅。",
	"Three bottles of fortified wine from the Sword Coast, never opened, still sit amid straw in a crate in the southeast corner of the cellar. Each bottle is now worth 70 gp.": "三瓶来自剑海岸的强化酒，从未打开过，仍然放在地窖东南角的箱子里的稻草中。每瓶现在价值70金币。",
	"The keystone Sylvene used to found and anchor her demiplane refuge was created by manipulating the magic imbued into the stone by a powerful artifact (detailed in subsequent adventures in this series). Sylvene's keystone was an experiment, both more potent and less flexible in its power than the artifacts soon to be discovered. If Sylvene kept detailed notes about the magical experiments that harnessed this power, those notes seem to be lost.": "希尔维尼用来建立和固定她的半位面避难所的钥石是通过操纵一个强大的神器（在本系列的后续冒险中详述）灌输到石头中的魔法而产生的。希尔维妮的基石是一项实验，与即将被发现的神器相比，它的力量既强大又不那么灵活。如果希尔维尼对利用这种力量的魔法实验做了详细的记录，这些记录似乎已经丢失了。",
	"The adventurers likely have new lore at hand and questions about what's next. The subsequent adventure's hooks take them back into the High Moors to seek a lost tomb, where Sylvene and old allies have been laid to rest and new secrets wait to be discovered.": "冒险者们很可能有新的传说在手，并对下一步有疑问。随后的冒险的钩子将他们带回高摩尔，寻找一个失落的坟墓，在那里，希尔维尼和老盟友已经安息，新的秘密等待着他们去发现。",
	"Soon, the full scope of Tyreus's villainous plan comes into view.": "很快，泰勒斯的反派计划的全部范围就显现出来。",
	"This section details game statistics for the key NPC, monsters, and magic items that interact with the adventurers in this scenario.": "本节详细介绍了在本剧情中与冒险者互动的关键NPC、怪物和魔法物品的游戏统计。",
	"The following entry describes a generalized version of the planar key found in this adventure. Each planar key is unique.": "下面的条目描述了在这次冒险中发现的平面钥匙的一般化版本。每个平面钥匙都是独一无二的。"
