	"Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom's borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown's wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom's attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.": "萨尔马什是一个不起眼的渔村，隐藏在基奥兰王国的南部海岸。几代人以来，Keoland是一个强大的军事力量。它优秀的骑兵和勇敢的骑士将王国的边界向北、向西、向东推进。每一次成功的战役都增加了王室的财富和权力，而每一次战役又将王国的注意力吸引到更远的北方。Keoland的南部沿海地区仍然是一个落后的地方。",
	"The crown's benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes' raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals' hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.": "王室的善意忽视使海盗和强盗行为得以猖獗。萨尔马什和类似的城镇一直在捕鱼，满足于保持低调，避免政府的纠缠。几十年前，在萨尔马什附近水域游荡的海盗们逐渐强大到足以创建自己的王国，一个松散的联盟，被称为 \"海王子之家\"。随着这个国家的崛起，对萨尔马什和其邻国的袭击也越来越多。海王子们的袭击船在海岸上掠夺更多的奴隶，以支持他们不断增长的王国，萨尔特马什遭受了严重的损失。那个时代的记忆深深地笼罩着这个地区，当地人对海王子的恨意也很深。",
	"In time, Keoland's victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes—but the conflict is by no means over.": "随着时间的推移，Keoland在北方的胜利让位于一连串的失败，它的邻国将王国逼回了它原来的边界。随着世界的逼近，国王金伯托斯-斯科蒂向南方看去，看到了不受控制的强盗行为和一个崛起的海盗国家。王室与北方的前敌人签订了和平条约，组建了海军，并对海王子的野心进行了猛烈的打击，但冲突还没有结束。",
	"King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.": "斯科蒂国王已经下令，必须镇压海盗，确保海上通道的安全，并培育贸易。如果基奥兰不能作为一支军事力量而繁荣，它就必须作为一个贸易中心而变得更加强大。",
	"Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king's plans. The crown's agents want to expand the village's port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves—bearing a decree from the king himself—have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village's—and, indeed, the entire region's—prosperity.": "萨尔马什，尽管它可能远离Keoland的权力中心，但随着对国王计划的反应，它的生活正进入一个新阶段。国王的代理人想扩大村庄的港口，使其成为与世界其他地方进行贸易的主要地点。在另一个最近的发展中，一队矮人--带着国王本人的命令--已经到达，并开始挖掘城镇附近的山丘和海边的悬崖，寻找贵重金属。如果他们的工作如期取得成果，该矿将成为该村--实际上是整个地区繁荣的一个主要因素。",
	"Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh's residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed. At the same time, as an undercurrent through all the goings-on, agents of the secretive and mysterious Scarlet Brotherhood work to thwart Keoland's ambitions while advancing their own.": "自然，并不是所有Saltmarsh的居民都对他们社区内和周围的最新发展有同样的感受，这也是影响他们生活和生计的关键问题。虽然最近的变化站在为该地区带来新的繁荣，但许多当地人并不希望看到他们的家园被改变。同时，作为贯穿所有事件的暗流，秘密和神秘的血色兄弟会的代理人努力挫败基奥兰的野心，同时推进他们自己的野心。",
	"Saltmarsh's future rests in the hands of three factions that compete for supremacy. Two of the factions represent the opposing sentiments that have grown in town in recent years. The third is a secret group that seeks to undermine Saltmarsh and seize control of the region. These factions' struggles play out in the day-to-day lives of the townsfolk and the political maneuvering of Saltmarsh's town council.": "萨尔马什的未来掌握在三个争夺霸权的派别手中。其中两个派别代表了近年来在镇上发展起来的对立情绪。第三个是一个秘密组织，试图破坏萨尔马什并夺取对该地区的控制权。这些派别的斗争在镇民的日常生活和萨尔马什镇议会的政治活动中得到了体现。",
	"The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes' raids and have no desire to see the crown's ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.": "传统派是由镇上著名的渔业家族和商人，以及依靠这些行业谋生的工人组成的联盟。传统派记得海王子突袭时的可怕时光，不希望看到王室的野心导致公开战争。在该地区经营的走私者往往是传统主义者。大多数人冒充商人，依靠他们在当地的关系，在不受城镇卫队或皇家特工干扰的情况下在该地区运输货物。走私长期以来一直是在萨尔马什赚钱的一个简单方法，当地人一般都睁一只眼闭一只眼，把它看作是一种无害的犯罪。",
	"The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves' mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh's dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.": "传统主义者希望看到矮人的采矿工作失败，来自北方的兴趣减弱，这样萨尔马什可靠的渔业贸易就能蓬勃发展，而该地区的走私者就不会受到影响。他们憎恨外来者的入侵，试图改造萨尔马什，无疑是将权力从渔民家庭中抽出，交给矮人和商人。",
	"This faction relies on two council members for representation. Eda Oweland leads the faction and can count on Gellan Primewater to back her up. Anders Solmor is young and unpredictable, but he has supported the traditionalists' viewpoint on most issues.": "这个派别依靠两名理事会成员来代表。艾达-奥维兰领导着这一派别，可以指望盖兰-普里姆沃特支持她。安德斯-索尔莫（Anders Solmor）年轻且难以预测，但他在大多数问题上都支持传统主义者的观点。",
	"At their best, traditionalists are community-minded folk who want Saltmarsh to return to its old way of doing things, arguing that the town has survived for a century by sticking to its original priorities. They suffered mightily due to the Sea Princes' depredations and remember the days when the crown turned a blind eye to their troubles. Their loyalty to the king runs second to their desire for peace and quiet.": "传统主义者最好是有社区意识的民间人士，他们希望萨尔马什恢复其旧有的行事方式，认为该镇通过坚持其原有的优先事项，已经生存了一个世纪。他们因海王子的掠夺而遭受了巨大的损失，并记得王室对他们的麻烦视而不见的日子。他们对国王的忠诚仅次于对和平与安静的渴望。",
	"Eda (CG female human {@creature noble}) is the current senior member of the town council, as well as the owner of three large fishing boats. She has lived in Saltmarsh all her life and has been elected to the council three times. She is a gruff, pragmatic woman whose graying hair is cut short and whose face bears the marks of a life lived outdoors. Eda is keenly interested in expanding Saltmarsh's fishing industry, her sights set on a wild section of the coast where she hopes to build a new dock. She is suspicious of the dwarves' mining enterprise and doubts it will amount to much.": "艾达（CG女性人类（%0%））是目前镇议会的高级成员，同时也是三艘大渔船的船主。她一生都生活在萨尔马什，曾三次当选为议会成员。她是一个粗暴、务实的女人，她的白发被剪短，脸上有户外生活的痕迹。艾达对扩大萨尔马什的渔业非常感兴趣，她的目光投向了海岸的一个荒芜地段，希望在那里建造一个新的码头。她对矮人的采矿业心存疑虑，并怀疑它是否会有什么结果。",
	"Eda swears like a sailor when she is frustrated or angry, and the folk in town who support her appreciate her willingness to stick up for them. Despite her temper, she respects those who keep their cool. Anyone who stands up to her wins her respect. Those who try to flatter her earn her contempt.": "艾达在沮丧或愤怒时像水手一样说脏话，镇上支持她的人很欣赏她愿意为他们撑腰。尽管她的脾气不好，但她尊重那些保持冷静的人。任何站在她面前的人都能赢得她的尊重。那些试图奉承她的人则赢得她的蔑视。",
	"If anyone in town needs help, Eda is the first to volunteer. She believes community binds people together and allows them to ride out the fiercest storm.": "如果镇上有人需要帮助，艾达是第一个志愿者。她相信社区将人们联系在一起，使他们能够度过最猛烈的风暴。",
	"Saltmarsh is Eda's home. She would protect it to her dying breath and wants its people to prosper.": "萨尔马什是艾达的家。她会誓死保护它，并希望它的人民能够繁荣。",
	"Eda is suspicious of outsiders, and she is too quick to trust those familiar to her.": "艾达对外人充满怀疑，她太急于相信她熟悉的人。",
	"Gellan (NE male human {@creature noble}) is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town, but he now faces an intractable problem. Gellan made his fortune through smuggling, his textile and lumber exports serving as a cover for his illegal activities. When Saltmarsh was a sleepy backwater, he could operate with impunity. Now that Saltmarsh has attracted attention from the outside world, he sees business growing more difficult and less profitable.": "盖兰（NE男性人类{@creature noble}）是一个能说会道、潇洒的老先生，有着修剪整齐的胡须和花哨的衣橱。凭借他狡猾的直觉，他将自己的家族定位为镇上最著名的商人，但他现在面临一个棘手的问题。盖兰通过走私发了财，他的纺织品和木材出口成为其非法活动的掩护。当萨尔马什还是一个沉睡的落后地区时，他可以肆无忌惮地经营。现在，萨尔马什已经吸引了外部世界的注意，他看到生意越来越难做，利润越来越低。",
	"Over the years, Gellan has cultivated relationships with a number of contacts among the Sea Princes. His ships move illicit goods, including slaves, between their realm and Keoland. Gellan takes care to keep this side of his business quiet, since any hint of involvement with slave traders would mean the end of his days in Saltmarsh, if not his life.": "多年来，盖兰与海族王子中的一些联系人培养了关系。他的船在他们的王国和基奥兰之间运送非法货物，包括奴隶。盖兰小心翼翼地对他的这部分业务保持沉默，因为任何与奴隶贩子有关的暗示都意味着他在萨尔马什的日子要结束了，如果不是他的生命。",
	"Gellan seeks to keep his smuggling cartel functioning with as little interference as possible. Having a seat on the council puts him in a perfect position to maintain his business while supporting all aspects of the traditionalists' agenda. His popularity in the faction is second only to that of Eda Oweland.": "Gellan试图在尽可能少的干扰下保持他的走私集团的运作。在议会中拥有一个席位使他处于一个完美的位置，既能维持他的生意，又能支持传统派的各方面议程。他在该派别中的声望仅次于艾达-欧文兰。",
	"Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He pretends to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind Eda's position. In truth, this deference is a ruse he uses to mask his efforts to shield his smuggling operation.": "由于盖兰是镇上最富有的人，他从许多宴会、娱乐活动和其他他用支出和捐款支持的娱乐活动中获得了大量的民众支持。他假装不关心议会的日常职能，默认自己支持艾达的立场。事实上，这种尊重是他用来掩盖他努力保护自己的走私活动的诡计。",
	"Gellan loves to play the role of the foppish dandy. He enjoys fine wine, good food, and the latest fashions. He is a patron of the arts and spends lavishly to support festivals, plays, and concerts.": "盖兰喜欢扮演轻浮的花花公子的角色。他喜欢美酒、美食和最新的时尚。他是艺术的赞助人，花钱大手大脚地支持节日、戏剧和音乐会。",
	"For Gellan, beauty and elegance are everything. He derives great enjoyment from watching the town enjoy his events.": "对盖兰来说，美丽和优雅就是一切。他从看着镇上的人享受他的活动中获得了极大的乐趣。",
	"Gellan values his reputation above all else. He wants to be admired by the people of Saltmarsh.": "盖兰把自己的声誉看得比什么都重要。他希望被萨尔马什的人们所敬仰。",
	"Greed colors every action Gellan takes. He can't turn down a chance to turn a profit, even if it means breaking the law. Gellan secretly believes that even if he is caught, he can spend his way back into the town's good graces by throwing the biggest, most extravagant festival Saltmarsh has ever seen.": "贪婪使盖伦的每一个行动都充满色彩。他不能拒绝赚钱的机会，即使这意味着违反法律。Gellan秘密地相信，即使他被抓，他也可以通过举办萨尔马什有史以来最大、最奢侈的节日来重新获得镇上的好感。",
	"The traditionalists simply want things to remain the same. If they had their way, the dwarves would go home, the guard would stick to dealing with monsters rather than hassling honest traders, and the crown would go back to dreaming of conquests in the north. The more things change, the more this faction resorts to open protest and resistance.": "传统主义者只是希望事情保持不变。如果他们有自己的方式，矮人就会回家，卫队就会坚持对付怪物而不是骚扰诚实的商人，而王室就会回去梦想在北方的征服。事情越是变化，这个派别就越是诉诸于公开抗议和抵抗。",
	"A group of fishers accosts dwarves and other outsiders, demanding they leave town or else.": "一群渔民与矮人和其他外来者搭讪，要求他们离开镇子，否则。",
	"Gellan Primewater imports a variety of exotic flowers that he uses to decorate the town, while also distributing fresh tropical fruit free of charge to the townsfolk.": "杰兰-普里姆沃特进口各种异国花卉，用来装饰小镇，同时还免费向镇民分发新鲜的热带水果。",
	"A fire breaks out in town, and Eda Oweland raises funds to support those who lost their homes.": "镇上发生了一场火灾，艾达-欧沃兰筹集资金以支持那些失去家园的人。",
	"A fishing boat goes missing with its crew. They were smuggling a haul of black pearls, and Gellan wants his treasure back without risking his cover.": "一艘渔船和它的船员失踪了。他们偷运了一批黑珍珠，盖兰想在不危及自己身份的情况下拿回他的财宝。",
	"A bountiful catch leads to a day of feasting and reconciliation, giving the factions a chance to make amends.": "丰富的收获导致了一天的盛宴与和解，给各派别一个弥补的机会。",
	"A bungled smuggling operation lands a few respected people in jail, leading to near riots as fishers gather in a huge mob to effect a breakout.": "一次失败的走私行动使一些受人尊敬的人被关进了监狱，导致渔民们聚集成巨大的暴徒来实现突围，从而导致了近乎暴乱。",
	"A horrible sea creature has been sighted, keeping many crews at the docks until it disappears. Anyone who tracks it down and slays it would be a hero. Gellan pledges a magic weapon to its slayer.": "有人发现了一种可怕的海洋生物，让许多船员在码头上呆着，直到它消失。任何追踪到它并杀死它的人都会成为英雄。Gellan将一件魔法武器承诺给它的杀手。",
	"Several fishing crews have gone missing. The locals demand that Keoland dispatch a squadron of ships to track down the slavers from the Sea Princes who surely kidnapped them.": "几名捕鱼人员失踪了。当地人要求Keoland派遣一个中队的船只去追踪肯定绑架了他们的海王子的奴隶主。",
	"The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The town guard, the dwarves, and the local farmers are generally loyalists.": "忠诚的人由从Keoland北部到达的新来者组成，他们忠于Kimbertos Skotti国王。他们认为该镇应该专注于成为王室的有用资产，并将王国的利益置于该地区的利益之上。镇上的卫兵、矮人和当地的农民一般都是忠诚的。",
	"The loyalists care about security. They want to keep Keoland's enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the Sea Princes at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.": "忠诚的人关心安全问题。他们希望在确保法律和秩序的同时，将Keoland的敌人挡在门外。他们认为走私是一个关键问题，因为它以皇家国库和诚实商人的努力为代价使海族王子发财。",
	"Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority.": "最重要的是，这个派别的成员把他们的信仰放在法律上。他们通过城镇警卫队施加影响，尽管他们仍在法律授权范围内。",
	"At their best, the loyalists want to grow Saltmarsh into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the Sea Princes are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, Saltmarsh can grow to become the envy of the world.": "在他们最好的情况下，忠诚者希望将萨尔马什发展成一个贸易中心，拥有更高的生活水平和更好的安全。如果海王子被控制住了，海上通道的威胁被清除了，萨尔马什可以发展成为世界上令人羡慕的地方。",
	"At their worst, the loyalists see the people of Saltmarsh as a barrier to growth. The locals are little more than allies of the Sea Princes, traitors who for too long have evaded the crown's notice. If they were to do as the loyalists tell them, then perhaps this {@creature fish|GoS}-reeking pile of a town could become something respectable.": "在他们最坏的情况下，效忠者将萨尔马什的人民视为发展的障碍。当地人只不过是海王子的盟友，是长期以来躲避王室注意的叛徒。如果他们按照效忠者的要求去做，那么这个{@creature fish|GoS}臭气熏天的小镇也许会成为一个值得尊敬的地方。",
	"Eliander (LN male human {@creature gladiator}) fought in the royal army of Keoland, where he earned a name driving the wild things of the Dreadwood away from the settled lands. Eliander suffered a tremendous injury to his leg in a battle against an owlbear and now walks upon a finely carved wooden peg. Despite his injury and advancing age, the burly captain of the Saltmarsh town guard remains an imposing figure. Eliander is a local celebrity thanks to his facility with languages, and he is often called upon by the town's various organizations to assist with translations. He is fully literate in Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elvish, and Halfling; he can also speak and understand Orc and Draconic.": "Eliander（LN男性人类（%0%））在Keoland的皇家军队中作战，在那里他赢得了将Dreadwood的野物从定居的土地上赶走的名声。在一次与猫头鹰熊的战斗中，埃利安德的腿部受到了巨大的伤害，现在他是在一个精雕细琢的木桩上行走的。尽管他的伤势和年龄不断增长，这位粗壮的萨尔马什镇卫队队长仍然是一个威严的人物。埃利安德是当地的名人，这要归功于他的语言能力，他经常被镇上的各种组织要求协助进行翻译。他精通普通话、矮人语、地精语、精灵语和半身人语；他还能说和听懂兽人语和龙语。",
	"In a crisis, Eliander Fireborn might put the good of the crown above local rule. He possesses a royal writ that allows him to seize authority over the town guard in case of an emergency. He is loath to use it, as the locals might react to his seizure of power with an open revolt.": "在危机中，埃利安德-弗尔邦可能会把王室的利益置于地方统治之上。他拥有一份皇室令状，允许他在紧急情况下夺取镇上卫队的权力。他不愿意使用它，因为当地人可能会对他夺取的权力做出公开的反应。",

He recognizes that Saltmarsh is on the verge of tremendous growth, but he sees the influence of the Sea Princes behind every stroke of misfortune. Slow and steady wins the day, as he likes to say.": "谨慎指导着埃利安德的思想和他的每一个行动。他认识到萨尔马什正处于巨大发展的边缘，但他看到每一次不幸的背后都有海王子的影响。正如他喜欢说的那样，缓慢而稳定地赢得今天。",

	"The leader of the newly established mining operation in Saltmarsh is an iron-willed dwarven woman named Manistrad (LN female dwarf {@creature veteran}). She runs the mining outfit from a small office near the edge of town. Manistrad is a competent leader, as well as a savvy miner with a knack for pulling off impossible jobs. She's convinced that the veins of silver found in the cliffs near Saltmarsh are indicative of more valuable stones deeper in the rock. She was once a fearsome warrior, and she's not above delivering a few well-placed blows to ensure her orders are followed.": "在萨尔马什新成立的矿业公司的领导人是一位意志坚定的矮人妇女，名叫玛尼斯特拉德（LN女矮人（%0%））。她在镇子边缘的一个小办公室里经营采矿业。玛尼斯特拉是一个称职的领导者，也是一个精明的矿工，擅长完成不可能完成的工作。她相信在萨尔马什附近的悬崖上发现的银矿脉表明在岩石深处有更有价值的石头。她曾经是一个可怕的战士，她也不忘给自己几下，以确保她的命令得到遵守。",
	"Manistrad occupies an awkward place on the council. She was placed in her position by royal decree; the crown decided that if Saltmarsh is to support a mining operation, the miners would need a political voice. A more diplomatic figure might have smoothed over the tension, but Manistrad has little patience and sees the rest of the council, save for Eliander, as rustic dullards.": "马尼斯特拉在议会中占据了一个尴尬的位置。她的职位是由皇家法令安排的；王室决定，如果萨尔马什要支持采矿作业，矿工就需要一个政治上的声音。一个更有外交手腕的人物可能会抚平紧张局势，但玛尼斯特拉却没有什么耐心，在她看来，除了埃利安德之外，议会的其他成员都是土里土气的呆子。",
	"Manistrad is a woman of few words. She is curt and quick, yet she gives every person who comes before the council a fair accounting. She's nobody's fool.": "马尼斯特拉是个寡言的女人。她说话客气而迅速，但她给每一个来到议会的人一个公平的交代。她不是任何人的傻瓜。",

	"Manistrad has little patience; she tends to push for quick results over a more measured approach.": "马尼斯特拉德没有什么耐心；她倾向于推动快速的结果，而不是更有分寸的方法。",
	"The loyalists are focused on two things: ensuring that the dwarven mine is a success, and clamping down on smuggling to keep the Sea Princes in check.

His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit.": "年轻的安德斯（LG男性人类（%0%））在他母亲佩特拉早逝后，最近继承了他家的渔船队。他是有史以来被选入议会的最年轻的人。安德斯是一个身材矮小的人，有着尖锐的特征和露齿的微笑。他最近对贸易的探索使他成为当地的名人。由于安德斯同时拥有一支捕鱼船队和几艘贸易船，他可以以极具竞争力的价格出售他的渔获。而且，他可以为镇上的其他渔民提供更好的价格，让他们卖给他，因为他的渔获带来了更多的利润。",
	"Everyone involved in the town's fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes' practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers' side.": "每个参与该镇渔业的人都支持安德斯，他的精力和雄心使他成为码头上的民间英雄。另一方面，他公开反对走私，憎恨海王子的奴隶制做法，使他成为走私者的眼中钉。",
	"Unbeknownst to Anders, his butler, Skerrin Wavechaser, is an agent for the Scarlet Brotherhood. He engineered the death of Anders' mother and has placed a number of Brotherhood agents in key positions in the Solmor fleet.": "安德斯不知道，他的管家Skerrin Wavechaser是猩红兄弟会的特工。他策划了安德斯母亲的死亡，并将一些兄弟会的特工安排在索尔摩舰队的关键位置。",
	"Anders is sunny and optimistic. He sees the potential for profit and opportunity in every challenge. Unfortunately, he is too young to temper his views with a realistic assessment of the risks.": "安德斯是阳光和乐观的。他在每一个挑战中都能看到利润和机会的潜力。不幸的是，他太年轻了，无法用对风险的现实评估来调整他的观点。",
	"Anders believes that freedom is the root of happiness. He pays his employees well and wants to help Saltmarsh grow into a prosperous town. Above all else, he hates the Sea Princes and wants to see their realm and its slave trade scoured from the earth.": "安德斯相信，自由是幸福的根源。他给员工的工资很高，希望帮助萨尔马什发展成为一个繁荣的城镇。最重要的是，他痛恨海族王子，希望看到他们的王国和奴隶贸易从地球上消失。",
	"Anders's mother Petra was the center of his life, and his sense of responsibility stems from her example. Every important decision he makes is guided by his desire to live up to her standards. If Skerrin is implicated in her murder, his hold over Anders would be shattered. For now, Skerrin uses Petra's memory to fan Anders's antipathy toward the Sea Princes.": "安德斯的母亲佩特拉是他生活的中心，他的责任感源于她的榜样。他所做的每一个重要决定都是以他希望达到她的标准为指导。如果斯凯林与她的谋杀案有牵连，他对安德斯的控制就会被打破。目前，斯凯林利用佩特拉的记忆来煽动安德斯对海族王子的反感。",
	"Due to a combination of his youth and his somewhat sheltered upbringing, Anders is naïve. He relied on his mother's expertise in most matters, which has allowed Skerrin to worm his way into Anders's confidence.": "由于年轻和他有些受庇护的成长经历，安德斯很天真。他在大多数事情上依赖他母亲的专业知识，这使得斯凯林能够以蠕虫方式进入安德斯的信心。",
	"Skerrin (LE male human {@creature assassin}) is secretly the head Brotherhood agent in town. Tall, lean, tan, with short silver hair, he speaks in precise, measured statements of a man who has a keen eye for detail. He is dispassionate and takes a protective stance toward Anders. To observers, he is nothing more than a faithful and trusted butler.": "斯凯林（LE男性人类（%0%））是镇上兄弟会的秘密头目。他身材高大，瘦削，皮肤黝黑，有一头银色的短发，说话准确，有分寸，是一个对细节有着敏锐洞察力的人。他是个冷静的人，对安德斯采取保护的态度。对于观察者来说，他只不过是一个忠实的、值得信赖的管家。",
	"Skerrin was renowned for his patience during his days as an assassin for the Brotherhood. Once, he hid himself in the attic above a noble's bedroom, waiting in a trance-like state for three days and nights until his target was positioned just below a small crack in the room's ceiling. Skerrin squeezed a single drop from a vial of poison he carried on to the noble's bald scalp. He waited in his hiding place for another full day until the contact poison killed the man.": "斯凯林在为兄弟会担任刺客的日子里，以其耐心而闻名。有一次，他把自己藏在一个贵族卧室的阁楼上，在恍惚的状态下等了三天三夜，直到他的目标被安置在房间天花板的一个小裂缝下面。斯凯林从他携带的一小瓶毒药中挤出一滴，滴在贵族的秃头皮上。他在藏身之处又等了一整天，直到接触性毒药杀死这个人。",
	"Skerrin is literally a man of two personalities. He appears to be a concerned, fatherly figure, a loyal retainer who worries about his young master. With a few moments of focus, however, he can shift to become a cold-blooded, patient killer.": "斯凯林简直是一个具有两种性格的人。他表面上是一个关切的、父亲般的人物，一个担心他的年轻主人的忠诚家臣。然而，只要稍加注意，他就能转变为一个冷血的、有耐心的杀手。",
	"When operating as Anders' servant, Skerrin believes that it is the duty of those with experience and wisdom to advise the young. As an assassin, he holds that those strong enough to survive flourish only by culling the weak.": "当作为安德斯的仆人时，斯凯林认为，那些有经验和智慧的人有责任为年轻人提供建议。作为一名刺客，他认为那些足够强大的人只有通过消灭弱者才能生存下去。",
	"Skerring's bond alternates between Anders and the Scarlet Brotherhood. He sees both as the best bets to bring order and security to the world.": "斯科林的纽带在安德斯和血色兄弟会之间交替出现。他认为两者都是为世界带来秩序和安全的最佳选择。",
	"Arrogance. Skerrin genuinely believes that if he had to, he could murder everyone of consequence in town in a single night and secure the place for the Scarlet Brotherhood. Sometimes he is tempted to do so, if only to prove himself right.": "傲慢。斯凯林真诚地相信，如果他不得不这样做，他可以在一个晚上杀死镇上所有重要的人，并为血色兄弟会确保这个地方。有时他很想这么做，如果只是为了证明自己是对的。",
	"The Scarlet Brotherhood is an opportunistic faction. It seeks to cause the maximum amount of disruption with the least amount of risk.": "猩红兄弟会是一个机会主义的派别。它寻求以最小的风险造成最大的破坏。",
	"The Brotherhood wants to tilt the town council in its favor and install Anders as the most prominent member. Their first goal is to find evidence of Gellan Primewater's involvement with the Sea Princes and implicate his participation in the slave trade. Such evidence is not hard to find once Gellan's dealings with the Sea Princes are revealed.": "兄弟会想让镇议会向其倾斜，并让安德斯成为最重要的成员。他们的第一个目标是找到盖兰-普里姆沃特与海王子的关系的证据，并牵扯出他参与奴隶贸易的事实。一旦盖兰与海王子的交易被揭露，这种证据并不难找到。",
	"The Brotherhood plans to use such accusations to increase tension in town between the traditionalists and the loyalists, ignite a civil war, assassinate leaders on both sides, and then use Anders as a peacemaker. Then the Brotherhood plans to assassinate Anders, frame the Sea Princes, and install Skerrin as his replacement as the town's foremost leader. Finally, Skerrin will agitate for war and continue to help Brotherhood agents infiltrate Keoland's towns in the south.": "兄弟会计划利用这样的指控来增加镇上传统派和忠诚派之间的紧张关系，点燃一场内战，暗杀双方的领导人，然后利用安德斯作为和平使者。然后，兄弟会计划刺杀安德斯，陷害海王子，并让斯凯林取代他成为镇上最重要的领导人。最后，斯凯林将鼓动战争，并继续帮助兄弟会的特工渗透到南部的基奥兰镇。",
	"If war does erupt, Brotherhood agents will work to ensure a long, drawn-out stalemate that grinds down both sides. Ideally, assassinations will pave the way for Brotherhood agents to assume high positions in both realms, but if necessary, the Brotherhood will engage armies of mercenaries, humanoid tribes, and fanatics it has gathered to finish the job. They hope that the Sea Princes can then be transformed into a puppet state, allowing the Brotherhood to turn their attention to the rest of Keoland.": "如果战争真的爆发了，兄弟会的特工将努力确保一个长期、持久的僵局，使双方都被拖垮。理想情况下，暗杀将为兄弟会特工在两个王国中担任高级职位铺平道路，但如果有必要，兄弟会将动用它所聚集的雇佣兵、人形部落和狂热者的军队来完成工作。他们希望海族王子能被改造成一个傀儡国家，让兄弟会把注意力转移到基奥兰的其他地方。",
	"The Brotherhood slips evidence of smuggling to the guard, causing several popular fishing boat owners to be arrested.": "兄弟会将走私的证据塞给警卫队，导致几个受欢迎的渔船主被逮捕。",
	"The Brotherhood's agents spread rumors that the mine is on the verge of failure and the crown plans to award the dwarves rulership of Saltmarsh as compensation.": "兄弟会的代理人散布谣言说，矿场濒临失败，王室计划授予矮人统治萨尔马什的权利作为补偿。",

	"Tainted grain delivered by a merchant in league with the Brotherhood leads to an outbreak of plague.": "一个与兄弟会结盟的商人运送的受污染的粮食导致了瘟疫的爆发。",
	"The Brotherhood uses kidnapping, blackmail, or other sinister means to turn an important member of another faction into an ally.": "兄弟会利用绑架、勒索或其他阴险手段，将另一派系的重要成员变成盟友。",
	"A small band of escaped slaves arrives in town. They claim that several sailors at the docks once worked as slave traders, prompting outraged calls for justice from Anders.": "一小群逃亡的奴隶来到了镇上。他们声称码头上的几个水手曾经是奴隶贩子，这引起了安德斯的愤怒，要求伸张正义。",
	"Pirate activity increases, bearing the unmistakable mark of the Sea Princes. The Brotherhood's ships adopt Sea Prince regalia to confuse the issue.": "海盗活动增加，带有明显的海洋王子的标志。兄弟会的船只采用海王子的服装来混淆视听。",
	"Skerrin, growing bored and overconfident, assassinates a prominent member of a faction and tries to frame the Sea Princes for the deed.": "斯凯林越来越无聊，也越来越自信，他刺杀了一个派别的重要成员，并试图将这一行为嫁祸给海王子。",
	"Saltmarsh's roughly five thousand residents are predominantly human, with the dwarven mining contingent of about two hundred workers the largest non-human faction in town. Elves and halflings draw no special notice, since the Silverstand hosts a wood elf enclave and a few halfling villages are tucked in the hills around town. The residents react to other visitors, especially tieflings and dragonborn, with a mixture of curiosity and fear.": "萨尔马什的大约五千名居民主要是人类，矮人采矿队的大约两百名工人是镇上最大的非人类派别。精灵和半身人没有引起特别的注意，因为银台有一块木精灵的飞地，而一些半身人的村庄就藏在镇子周围的山上。居民们对其他访客的反应，尤其是铁皮人和龙裔，是好奇和恐惧的混合。",
	"Saltmarsh is a bastion of civilization in the midst of an untamed region. Without its stout defenders, it might have long ago fallen to the depredations of outsiders.": "萨尔马什是野蛮地区中的一个文明堡垒。如果没有坚强的保卫者，它可能早就沦为外来者的掠夺品了。",
	"One hundred trained warriors serve in the town guard. Each of them wears studded leather armor marked with a town guard's badge—the green reed of Saltmarsh—and is armed with a club while patrolling in town. The guards work in pairs, operating from two guardhouses built near the road into Saltmarsh. A smaller station at the docks quells the fights that break out there nightly. The captain of the town guard is Eliander Fireborn.": "一百名训练有素的战士在镇卫队中服务。他们中的每一个人都穿着镶有钉子的皮甲，上面标有城镇卫队的徽章--萨尔特马什的绿色芦苇，在镇上巡逻时，他们都带着棍棒。卫兵们成双成对地工作，在进入萨尔马什的道路附近建造的两个卫兵室里工作。码头上有一个较小的站，负责平息每晚在那里发生的争斗。镇守卫队的队长是埃利安德-弗尔邦。",
	"The guard also patrols the area around Saltmarsh on horseback. Groups assigned to this duty are more heavily armed and armored; they wear chain mail and wield longswords and heavy crossbows.": "警卫队还在萨尔马什周围地区骑马巡逻。被分配到这一职责的群体拥有更多的武器和装甲；他们穿着链式盔甲，挥舞着长剑和重型弩箭。",
	"A militia of five hundred residents can be mustered to take up the defense of the town if it comes under attack. The militia members have undergone minimal training, since they are expected only to keep an enemy at bay until the king's forces arrive.": "一支由500名居民组成的民兵队可以在城镇受到攻击时承担起防御任务。民兵们接受了最低限度的训练，因为他们只被期望在国王的部队到达之前阻止敌人的入侵。",
	"A small force of marines watches over the docks and, if needed, can take to sea to meet the threat of a pirate ship or sahuagin incursion. The marines are hardened veterans of several battles against the Sea Princes. They are led by a married couple, Tom and Will Stoutly, veterans who have fought dozens of engagements against pirates, raiders, and monsters.": "一支小规模的海军陆战队监视着码头，如果需要，可以出海应对海盗船或萨瓦金人的入侵威胁。这些海军陆战队员都是在与海族王子的几次战斗中表现出色的老兵。他们由一对夫妇领导，汤姆和威尔-斯托特利，这些老兵曾与海盗、袭击者和怪物进行过数十次交战。",
	"The guard is seen as something of a meddlesome force, since most of its members are drawn from the military veterans who migrated here with the crown's blessing. Townsfolk tend to see them as brutish thugs, though they are quick to call them when trouble arises.": "警卫队被认为是一支爱管闲事的部队，因为它的大部分成员都是在王室的祝福下移民到这里的退伍军人。镇民们倾向于将他们视为野蛮的暴徒，尽管当麻烦出现时他们会迅速召集他们。",
	"The town guard arrests lawbreakers and imprisons them in the town jail. In most cases, criminals pay a fine and are let go. Those who cannot pay are required to work off their debt, usually put to work sweeping streets or helping with construction projects. If a crime requires a trial, the town council hears evidence and renders a verdict. Crime breaks down into three basic categories in Saltmarsh.": "镇上的卫兵逮捕违法者并将他们关进镇上的监狱。在大多数情况下，罪犯缴纳罚款后被释放。那些无力支付的人被要求以工代赈，通常被安排清扫街道或帮助建筑项目的工作。如果犯罪需要审判，镇议会将听取证据并作出裁决。在萨尔马什，犯罪可分为三个基本类别。",
	"Public unarmed brawling, pickpocketing, and other crimes that cause up to 50 gp in property damages are classified as petty crimes. The accused pays a fine of {@dice 2d6} gp, or one day of hard labor per gold piece owed.": "公共场合徒手斗殴、扒窃以及其他造成50金币以下财产损失的犯罪行为被归为轻罪。被告人要支付{@dice 2d6}金币的罚款，或者每欠一个金币要做一天的苦工。",
	"Armed assault, defined as any nonfatal attack made with a weapon, along with any other assault or property crimes that cause more than 50 gp in damages, but less than 250 gp, are minor crimes. The perpetrator must pay a fine of 100 gp and serve {@dice 1d4} years in prison or at forced labor.": "武装攻击，定义为任何用武器进行的非致命攻击，以及任何其他攻击或财产犯罪，造成的损失超过50戈比，但低于250戈比，都是轻罪。犯罪者必须支付100戈比的罚款，并在监狱或强制劳动中服刑（%0%）年。",
	"Crimes more severe than those outlined above, including murder, are major crimes. The criminal faces {@dice 2d10} years of imprisonment, though serious cases earn the death penalty. In most instances, these crimes are dealt with in Seaton, the provincial capital located east of Saltmarsh.": "比上述罪行更严重的罪行，包括谋杀，属于重大犯罪。罪犯将面临{@dice 2d10}年的监禁，尽管严重的案件会被判处死刑。在大多数情况下，这些罪行是在西顿处理的，西顿是位于萨尔马什东部的省会。",
	"Saltmarsh might be encrusted in sea salt and reek of rotting {@creature fish|GoS} guts, but there is gold aplenty in the coffers of its citizens. For more than a century, the ships of Saltmarsh have worked the rich fishing grounds along the coast. Trade ships from near and far have been using the docks to unload their goods, and lately more ships have come to call as the dwarven mining operation grows. Smuggling has also long been a profitable business here.": "萨尔马什可能被海盐包裹着，散发着腐烂(%0)的内脏的气味，但其公民的国库里有大量的黄金。一个多世纪以来，萨尔马什的船只一直在沿海丰富的渔场工作。来自远近的贸易船只一直在使用码头卸货，最近随着矮人采矿业的发展，更多的船只前来停靠。走私也一直是这里的一项有利可图的业务。",
	"The dwarven mining operation promises to bring about a rapid growth in Saltmarsh's fortunes. Whether that's a good or a bad thing depends on who you ask. The merchants look forward to more business, but the fishers don't see how the mines will do anything to enrich their coffers. If anything, they fear that competition for {@creature fish|GoS} will become more ferocious as the town grows.": "矮人的采矿作业有望为萨尔马什的财富带来快速增长。这到底是好事还是坏事，取决于你问谁。商人们期待着更多的生意，但渔民们不认为矿场会给他们的国库带来什么好处。如果有的话，他们担心，随着城镇的发展，对（%0%）的竞争会变得更加激烈。",
	"More folk in town work in the fishing industry than any other, and it has been the backbone of Saltmarsh for generations. The wealthier families own their own boats, while less well-to-do folk hire out to work as deckhands. The work is difficult and dangerous, but a smart deckhand can save money for several years and eventually buy their own boat. That promise of earned prosperity is important to the townsfolk, and they see newcomers as a threat to it.": "镇上从事捕鱼业的人比其他任何行业都多，而且世代都是萨尔马什的支柱产业。较富裕的家庭拥有自己的船，而不太富裕的人则雇人当水手。这项工作既困难又危险，但聪明的水手可以存几年钱，最终买下自己的船。赚取繁荣的承诺对镇民来说很重要，他们认为新来者是对它的威胁。",
	"The wealthiest families in town own large trading vessels that they use to ship goods across the Azure Sea. Saltmarsh exports other foodstuffs from the farms around town. Most manufactured goods, except for rope, nets, and other items created locally to support the fishing industry, are imported into town.": "镇上最富有的家庭拥有大型贸易船只，他们用这些船只将货物运过蔚蓝海。萨尔马什从镇子周围的农场出口其他食品。除了绳索、渔网和其他为支持捕鱼业而在当地创造的物品外，大多数制成品都是进口到镇上。",
	"As a sleepy backwater town, Saltmarsh has long been an ideal market for illegal goods. Pirates, agents of the Sea Princes, and Keoish nobles looking to evade the king's taxes have all helped fuel a bustling local black market. Some fishing boats meet ships at sea to load and unload illegal goods, while other cartels conduct business at isolated points along the shore near town. The locals see smuggling as a victimless crime and resent the crown's growing insistence on cracking down on it.": "作为一个沉睡的落后小镇，萨尔马什长期以来一直是非法货物的理想市场。海盗、海王子的代理人以及希望逃避国王税收的凯奥什贵族，都为当地热闹的黑市提供了帮助。一些渔船在海上与船只相遇，装卸非法货物，而其他卡特尔则在城镇附近的海岸边的孤立点进行交易。当地人认为走私是一种无害的犯罪，并对王室日益坚持打击走私的做法感到不满。",
	"The mine outside town is a new development. Despite the skepticism of the locals, the mine has started to yield silver in growing quantities, and the dwarves are convinced that the nearby cliffs are rich with gold. If the mine takes off, Saltmarsh could transform into a sprawling boomtown overnight.": "镇外的矿场是一个新的发展。尽管当地人持怀疑态度，但矿场已经开始产出越来越多的银，而且矮人相信附近的悬崖上有丰富的黄金。如果矿场起飞，萨尔马什可能在一夜之间转变为一个无垠的繁荣小镇。",
	"The docks of Saltmarsh are the beating heart of the town. The fishing trade and related commerce that keep the town alive are based here.": "萨尔马什的码头是该镇的心脏。保持小镇活力的渔业贸易和相关商业都在这里进行。",
	"The docks have recently undergone a series of expansions intended to lure larger merchant vessels into the port. Two primary piers are used to load and unload large ships, while a series of smaller ones accommodate humbler vessels.": "码头最近经历了一系列的扩建，旨在吸引大型商船进入港口。两个主要码头用于装卸大船，而一系列较小的码头则用于容纳较小的船只。",

Guarded warehouses are a common sight in this district, and it is considered suspicious behavior to walk near those places at night.": "萨尔马什的这一部分几乎一直都很繁忙；很少看到大型码头无人居住。守卫的仓库是这个地区常见的景象，晚上在这些地方附近行走被认为是可疑的行为。",
	"The docks are a hotbed of rumors and gossip. The sailors and laborers who frequent this area are bored, eager for news, and inclined to share what they have heard. A character who spends a few hours asking for news can learn the current scuttlebutt. The \"Dock Rumors\" table below can be an inspiration for the sort of whispers characters might hear.": "码头是谣言和八卦的温床。经常来这里的水手和工人都很无聊，渴望得到消息，并倾向于分享他们所听到的。一个花了几个小时打听消息的角色可以了解当前的小道消息。下面的 \"码头流言 \"表可以为角色可能听到的小道消息提供灵感。",
	"The crown dispatched a caravan with enough gold to commission six new warships. It went missing near the Hool Marshes.": "王室派遣了一支商队，带着足够的黄金来委托建造六艘新战舰。它在胡尔沼泽附近失踪。",

	"It's only a matter of time before the dwarves dig too deep and unleash something horrible.": "矮人挖得太深，释放出可怕的东西，这只是时间问题。",
	"Saltmarsh is a place of constant energy. Few of the common folk are so affluent that they can afford to sit idle. At sunrise, the docks bustle with fishers preparing to venture out for the day. When they return, they spend time unloading their catch, mending nets, and repairing their vessels. The merchants move their ships into the docks once the fishing fleet is out for the day, and dock workers rush to load and unload goods before the boats return.": "萨尔马什是一个能量不断的地方。很少有平民百姓能富裕到坐得住的地步。日出时分，码头上熙熙攘攘，渔民们准备出海捕鱼，度过一天。当他们回来时，他们会花时间卸下渔获物，修补渔网，并修理船只。一旦渔船队出海，商人们就把他们的船开进码头，而码头工人则赶在渔船返回之前装卸货物。",
	"The daily energy and bustle carries over into rowdy nights. The fishers chug ale and swap stories, each seeking to outdo the other with their tales of the sea. Fights erupt as rival crews cross paths, and the town guard keeps a high profile in hopes of maintaining the peace.": "每天的活力和喧嚣延续到了夜晚的狂欢。渔民们喝着啤酒，交换着故事，每个人都想用他们的海洋故事来超越对方。敌对的渔民们交头接耳，争吵不休，而镇上的卫兵则保持高调，希望能维持和平。",
	"The quantity and quality of the catch in recent days goes a long way toward determining the town's mood and general atmosphere. A bountiful catch for a few days in a row puts all the fishers in a celebratory mood, while a poor harvest that lasts more than a couple of days leads to frayed tempers and brawling.": "最近几天渔获的数量和质量在很大程度上决定了该镇的情绪和总体氛围。连续几天的丰收使所有渔民处于庆祝的情绪中，而持续几天的歉收则会导致脾气暴躁和争吵。",

	"Saltmarsh was built on the ruins of a much older settlement, sometimes called Old Saltmarsh or the Old Harbor. One sign of this is that the town has a small stretch of wall and a single town gate secured by two or three guards. The wall is old, crumbling, and badly worn by centuries of rain and wind coming in from the Azure Sea.": "萨尔马什建在一个更古老的定居点的废墟上，有时被称为老萨尔马什或老港。这方面的一个迹象是，该镇有一小段城墙和一个由两到三个卫兵把守的单一镇门。城墙很旧，摇摇欲坠，被几个世纪以来从蔚蓝海吹来的雨水和风严重磨损。",
	"The garrison at the gate consists of older guards, those nearing retirement and unwilling or unable to walk patrols. Their eyes are sharp, and they are prone to gossip. A pull from a flask of whiskey or a few silver pieces can persuade them to provide information on recent visitors.": "门口的守卫由年长的守卫组成，他们接近退休，不愿意或不能走动巡逻。他们的眼睛很敏锐，而且很容易说闲话。用一壶威士忌或几个银币就能说服他们提供关于最近访客的信息。",
	"Built on a low hill, the Saltmarsh barracks are also its jail. It is one of the few structures in Saltmarsh with an underground level. The jailer, Kraddok Stonehorn (LG male human {@creature gladiator}), is an old comrade of Eliander. He is a stickler for the rules, and Eliander trusts him with his life.": "萨尔马什军营建在一座低矮的山上，也是其监狱。它是萨尔马什为数不多的有地下一层的建筑之一。狱卒克拉多克-石角（LG男性人类（%0%））是伊莱恩德的一个老战友。他是个遵守规则的人，埃利安德把自己的生命托付给他。",
	"The jail in the cellar consists of two sections. A single large chamber holds drunks, brawling fishers, and other troublemakers who need to cool off for a few nights. The lock is high quality (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick), and the door is built of stout wood with a small window to allow guards to check in on their charges.": "地窖里的监狱由两部分组成。一个大房间关押着醉汉、争吵的渔民和其他需要冷静几晚的麻烦制造者。锁的质量很高（需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查才能撬开），门是用坚固的木头建造的，有一个小窗，可以让守卫检查他们的指控。",
	"A side passage holds six individual cells with higher-quality locks (each requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick) and solid doors that lack windows.

The jump is usually not fatal; the water below the Leap is free of rocks, and it is a short swim back to dry land.": "传统上，当有亲人在海上溺水时，萨尔马什的人们会从悬崖上跳到下面的水中。这一跳通常并不致命；跃下的水面上没有岩石，而且只要游回干地就可以了。",
	"Services at this long-standing sea god's temple are well attended. The congregation is led by a one-legged former whaler: Wellgar Brinehanded (CG male human {@creature priest}), an older human man with a sharp memory for every storm, lost ship, and enormous catch ever brought into Saltmarsh harbor. He knows many fanciful stories of shipwrecks, lucky escapes, and famous captains. Matters ashore rarely interest him, but the temple and its bell tower are also served by a half-dozen novitiates and laypeople who keep things running smoothly.": "在这个历史悠久的海神庙里，参加仪式的人很多。会众由一位独腿的前捕鲸者领导。韦尔加-布林德（CG男性人类{@creature priest}），一个年长的人类男子，对每一次风暴、失落的船只和曾经进入萨尔马什港口的巨大渔获都有着敏锐的记忆。他知道许多关于沉船、幸运逃脱和著名船长的奇特故事。他对岸上的事情很少感兴趣，但寺庙和它的钟楼也有半打的见习生和普通人，他们维持着事情的顺利进行。",

	"Procan's domain is the sea, and whatever the oceans touch, he bears witness to. His mood shifts to darkness as he witnesses a brutal murder on the docks of a squalid port, then lifts in pride as he watches a brave mariner leap into the sea and save a drowning child. Every story of the oceans courses through his mind, and he in each moment curses and blesses mortals for their endless follies, heroism, and hatreds.": "普罗坎的领域是海洋，无论海洋接触到什么，他都会见证。当他目睹一个肮脏港口的码头上发生的残酷谋杀案时，他的心情转为黑暗；当他看到一个勇敢的水手跃入海中，救起一个溺水的孩子时，他又升起了自豪感。海洋的每一个故事都在他的脑海中闪过，他在每一个时刻都在诅咒和祝福凡人的无尽的愚蠢、英雄主义和仇恨。",
	"When the sea reaches its limit at the shore, so too does Procan's power. His clerics and priests rarely venture inland, and he cares little for what happens beyond his waters. At sea, he expects sacrifices in the form of fine food, potent alcohol, or valuable treasures thrown overboard at the start of a voyage. Due to this ritual, Procan holds all treasures lost at sea as part of his domain. He curses those who plunder shipwrecks without the blessings of his clerics, dogging their steps with wretched weather until his attention is drawn elsewhere.": "当大海在岸边达到极限时，普罗坎的力量也达到了极限。他的神职人员和祭司很少到内陆去冒险，他也很少关心在他的水域之外发生的事情。在海上，他希望祭品的形式是精美的食物、烈性的酒，或者在航行开始时被扔到海里的贵重财物。由于这种仪式，普罗坎把所有在海上丢失的财宝都视为他的领域的一部分。他诅咒那些在没有他的神职人员的祝福下掠夺沉船的人，用恶劣的天气拖住他们的脚步，直到他的注意力被吸引到其他地方。",
	"Procan's clerics reflect their deity's chaotic nature. They seek omens of his moods in the weather and sky, and mirror their own demeanor to match their deity's.": "普罗坎的神职人员反映了他们神灵的混乱本性。他们从天气和天空中寻找他的情绪预兆，并以自己的行为举止来配合他们的神灵。",

Those hardy souls who have infrequently sought entry (pursuing rumors of a secret hoard of alchemical gold) all returned with naught save grim tales of decaying chambers presided over by monstrous perils.

It was a revelation at the time, marking the first appearance in a D&D adventure of a haunted house and a raid on a sailing ship. It also set the tone for TSR UK's subsequent output, which often featured strong, central narratives that challenged players to take a creative approach to problem solving. They usually included multiple, smaller locations to explore, lending a sense of variety to a single adventure.": "1981年由TSR的英国分部制作，{@i Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh}是由Dave J. Brown和Don Turnbull设计。它在当时是一个启示，标志着D&D冒险中首次出现了鬼屋和对帆船的袭击。它也为TSR英国的后续作品定下了基调，这些作品通常以强有力的中心叙事为特色，挑战玩家采取创造性的方法来解决问题。它们通常包括多个较小的探索地点，给单一的冒险带来多样性的感觉。",
	"In recent times, there have been reports of fearsome hauntings, horrible shrieks, and eerie lights emanating from the dismal place. Now, not even the bravest of the area's denizens dare to approach the house, let alone enter it. If the characters seek anyone in Saltmarsh who has been in the place, they initially find no one.

	"If the characters pursue their questioning, they might (at your discretion) find an aged poacher who, after suitable inducement (money, ale, or both), confesses to having wandered in the back door of the house a couple of years before, hoping to acquire some food. Encouraged by the prospect of free wine in the cellar, he started to descend the stairs, heard ghastly shrieks and piercing wails, and ran, frightened out of his wits. He knows where the back door is and also noticed a nearby well. He can vaguely describe the kitchen, the scullery, and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else about the layout of the place.": "如果人物继续追问，他们可能（由你决定）找到一个年老的偷猎者，在适当的诱导下（钱、酒或两者），他承认几年前曾徘徊在房子的后门，希望获得一些食物。在地窖里有免费酒的鼓励下，他开始下楼，听到可怕的尖叫声和刺耳的哀号声，吓得魂飞魄散，跑了出去。他知道后门在哪里，还注意到附近有一口井。他能模糊地描述厨房、洗碗间以及从后门通向它们的通道，但他对这个地方的其他布局一无所知。",
	"Furthermore, his memory of what frightened him has become exaggerated over the months, so he is likely to tell the party that a horde of ghosts came up the stairs to the scullery, or maybe it was a vampire with a swarm of rats. He discovered soon after his escapade that the telling of his tale, in ever more lurid detail, was an easy means of obtaining free ale foisted on him by appreciative listeners. Recently, however, none have asked him to tell the tale, so once his tongue is loosened, he is eager to restore some of his lost prestige. Apart from alerting adventurers to sinister and grave dangers of his own invention and telling them a little about the layout of the house, he provides no accurate or useful information.": "此外，几个月来，他对吓唬他的事情的记忆已经变得夸张了，所以他很可能会告诉大家，有一群鬼魂从楼梯上到了洗碗间，或者也许是一个吸血鬼带着一群老鼠来了。他在逃亡之后不久就发现，用越来越多的细节讲述他的故事，是获得欣赏他的听众强加给他的免费啤酒的一个简单手段。然而，最近没有人要求他讲述这个故事，所以一旦他的舌头松动，他就急于恢复他失去的一些威信。除了提醒冒险者注意他自己发明的险恶和严重的危险，以及告诉他们一些关于房子的布局，他没有提供准确或有用的信息。",
	"The secret of the haunted house is that it is not, in fact, haunted. It is the shore base for a band of smugglers led by a wizard named {@creature Sanbalet|GoS}. The eerie lights seen at night by onlookers are the smugglers' signals to a ship out at sea. The unearthly shrieks and other sounds are caused by {@spell magic mouth} spells strategically placed in the building. The smugglers, during their three years of successful operation, have through these tactics frightened away all local attempts at investigating their hideout.": "这座鬼屋的秘密在于，它其实并没有闹鬼。它是一伙走私者的岸上基地，由一个名叫（%%）的巫师领导。旁观者在夜间看到的阴森恐怖的灯光是走私者向海上的船只发出的信号。不合常理的尖叫声和其他声音是由放置在建筑物中的(1%)法术引起的。走私者在成功运作的三年里，通过这些策略吓跑了所有试图调查他们藏身之处的当地人。",

	"The characters discover a document that explains the signaling system used by the smugglers to indicate the ship has arrived; by deciphering and sending the proper return signal, they can put the crew at ease. By force or deception, the party boards the {@i Sea Ghost} and attempts to seize control. During this raid, the party encounters a captured sea elf named {@creature Oceanus|GoS} and a trio of lizardfolk warriors. The adventure concludes with signs that the lizardfolk are preparing for a raid, presumably on the town of Saltmarsh—though the truth, as outlined in the \"{@area Portents of War|0bb|x}\" section, is far more ominous.": "角色们发现了一份文件，其中解释了走私者用来表示船已抵达的信号系统；通过破译和发送正确的返回信号，他们可以让船员们放心。通过武力或欺骗，他们登上了{@i Sea Ghost}号，并试图夺取控制权。在这次突袭中，他们遇到了一个名叫（%%）的被俘海精灵和一群蜥蜴人战士。冒险结束时，有迹象表明蜥蜴人正在准备突袭，可能是对萨尔马什镇的突袭--尽管如\"{@area Portents of War|0bb|x} \"部分所述，事实远比这更不祥。",

	"Even to the pioneering folk of Q'barra, Saltmarsh is a frontier town. The lean-tos and shanties sprawl in the steaming eastern deltas of the Basura Swamp, and their inhabitants do their best to keep out of the affairs of the lizardfolk in the interior. An elf illusionist bearing the Mark of House Phiarlan leads the smugglers and seems bent on stirring up trouble.": "即使对Q'barra的开拓者来说，萨尔马什也是一个边陲小镇。在巴苏拉沼泽的东部三角洲，瘦小的帐篷和简陋的住所鳞次栉比，他们的居民尽力不参与内陆蜥蜴人的事务。一个带有皮亚伦家族印记的精灵幻术师领导着走私者，似乎一心想要挑起麻烦。",
	"Midway between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, the town of Saltmarsh and its hardy inhabitants endure both winter storms and the Mere of Dead Men to the south. Because of the politics churning in Thornhold on the far side of the marsh, help is often slow to come, and so the townsfolk have become quite self-reliant. The smugglers could be from Luskan, and their selling weapons to lizardfolk could be connected to deeper goals than simply lining their pockets.": "在Waterdeep和Neverwinter之间，Saltmarsh镇和它坚韧的居民要忍受冬季的风暴和南方的死人谷。由于沼泽远处的索恩霍尔德政治混乱，帮助往往姗姗来迟，因此镇民们已经变得相当自力更生。走私者可能来自卢斯坎，他们向蜥蜴人出售武器可能与更深层次的目标有关，而不仅仅是为了满足他们的口袋。",
	"Saltmarsh stands on the border between the Grand Duchy of Karameikos and the Five Shires, just inside the edge of the Blight Marsh.

	"A merchant in Saltmarsh who profits from the illegal activities of {@creature Sanbalet|GoS} has taken desperate action to ensure that the smuggling operation continues.

	"The alchemist lived a hermit's life, with few visitors and fewer friends. But a young messenger once emerged from the house with a story of a grand library containing countless tomes. Retellings of the messenger's tale have varied over the years, with the most popular versions suggesting that the alchemist had discovered a method of transforming base metals into gold.": "炼金术士过着隐士的生活，很少有访客，朋友也少。但有一次，一位年轻的信使从房子里走出来，说他有一个巨大的图书馆，里面有数不清的书本。多年来，关于这个使者的故事有不同的说法，最流行的版本是炼金术士发现了一种将贱金属转化为黄金的方法。",
	"It cannot stand! An unholy place so close to civilization. These accounts of wailing and flashing lights disturb the mind and heart.

A stiff wind blows in off the waves, carrying the briny stink of churning salt water.": "通往房子的道路蜿蜒穿过沿海的岩石地形，经常可以看到下面的大海。低沉的云层压在你身上；偶尔会有几片阳光出现在水面上。猛烈的风从海浪中吹来，带着盐水搅动的卤味气味。",
	"The house is located four miles up the coast from Saltmarsh and is accessible by an old road. Curious townsfolk might follow the party for part of their journey. These escorts engage the characters in conversation, ask about their intentions, and repeat the same rumors and stories heard in town.

Now, a few broken gardening tools and a tangle of weeds are all that remain. A single rosebush near the gate has overgrown the wall and choked out most of the other plants.

	"The glint inside the fireplace comes from a small crystal bauble (5 sp) that once belonged to the alchemist. The flat-bottomed crystal orb is pleasant to look at and tactilely satisfying to hold, but ultimately neither particularly valuable nor useful.

A character who carefully examines the window area and makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check discovers small clues to this fact: fresh scratches on the sill where the signaling lantern has been placed, scuffing of the floor dust immediately near the window, and so forth. These signs cannot be seen from the door; they require up-close observation to be discovered.": "房子的位置和悬崖的地形相结合，使得这个房间从房子的任何地方都能看到最好的海景，走私者就是在这里向他们在海上的同事发出信号。仔细检查窗户区域并成功通过DC12智力({@skill Investigation})检查的人物会发现一些小线索：放置信号灯的窗台上有新的划痕，紧挨着窗户的地板灰尘有擦痕，等等。这些迹象在门外是看不到的；它们需要近距离观察才能发现。",

	"Neither Ned nor his merchant mentor are fools, and they have given some thought to preparing this story—it is not possible for the characters to discern Ned's true motives.

	"A few days after their triumphant return from the destruction of the smugglers' ring at the haunted house, the characters are hastily summoned to an emergency meeting of the Saltmarsh Town Council. Here it is explained to them that, though the land-based operation of the smuggling ring has been quashed, there must be a seagoing vessel by which the contraband was originally conveyed, and this is still at large. The council, fearful that any surviving smugglers could seek to reestablish their operation from some other base, asks the characters to apprehend this vessel and put an end, once and for all, to the smuggling.": "在他们从鬼屋摧毁走私团伙胜利归来的几天后，这些人物被匆匆召集到萨尔马什镇议会的紧急会议上。在这里，人们向他们解释说，尽管走私团伙在陆地上的活动已经被粉碎，但一定有一艘最初运送违禁品的海船，而且它仍然在逃。议会担心任何幸存的走私者可能会从其他基地重新建立他们的行动，要求人物逮捕这艘船，一劳永逸地结束走私活动。",
	"A reward of 400 gp is offered to the characters for the successful conclusion of the mission.": "成功完成任务的人物可获得400金币的奖励。",
	"The council reasons that the smugglers on the vessel are, as yet, unaware of the capture or death of their land-based colleagues, and a return visit by them might well be expected. Since the last consignment was offloaded only a short while ago, another one is not expected for some time—perhaps during the next new moon, which begins in about two weeks' time.": "议会的理由是，船上的走私者还不知道他们在陆地上的同事被抓或死了，而且他们很可能会再次来访。由于最后一批货物是在不久前才卸下的，预计在一段时间内不会有另一批货物，也许是在大约两周后开始的下一个新月。",
	"The council arranges for members of the town guard to patrol the potential rendezvous points each night for the next two weeks in case the smugglers return earlier than expected. If the ship is sighted, the council is unwilling to risk the lives of volunteers by ordering them to take the ship and its crew by force. As soon as an approaching vessel is spotted, the council expects the characters to perform the actual task of boarding.": "议会安排镇上的卫队成员在接下来的两个星期里每晚在可能的集合点上巡逻，以防走私者比预期的更早返回。如果发现船只，议会不愿意让志愿者冒生命危险，命令他们用武力夺取船只和船员。一旦发现接近的船只，议会希望人物能够执行实际的登船任务。",
	"Once the characters accept the undertaking, the council puts a small fishing boat at their disposal and provides them with any reasonable amount of nonmagical equipment that they feel they require. The boat is large enough to accommodate the entire party plus two. The council also provides the services of two members of the guard to sail the boat for them when needed. They are not willing to board the {@i Sea Ghost} with the characters, though they defend themselves and the fishing boat if it is attacked.": "一旦人物接受了这项承诺，委员会就会将一艘小渔船交给他们使用，并为他们提供他们认为需要的任何合理数量的非魔法装备。这艘船足够大，可以容纳整个队伍加两个人。委员会还提供两名卫队成员的服务，在需要时为他们开船。他们不愿意和人物一起登上{@i Sea Ghost}，但如果渔船受到攻击，他们会保护自己和渔船。",
	"If the characters discovered the bullseye lantern and the parchment in {@area area 22|113|x} of the haunted house, they have a big clue to how the smugglers communicate. You might require the characters to make a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to determine how the system works—although certain facts are not written on the parchment. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to experiment with sending signals when the ship comes back.": "如果人物在鬼屋的（%0%）里发现了牛眼灯和羊皮纸，他们就有了走私者如何交流的重要线索。你可以要求人物成功地进行DC12智力（（%1%））检查，以确定这个系统是如何工作的--尽管羊皮纸上没有写某些事实。另外，你可以让角色们在船回来后试验一下发送信号。",
	"The signaling system utilizes the bullseye lantern to communicate the following messages by combining long and short flashes:": "该信号系统利用牛眼灯，通过长、短闪相结合的方式传达以下信息。",

	"{@b Long–long–long}: \"Ready to unload; come to the ship.\" (The ship confirms a reply with this signal.)": "{@b Long–long–long}: \"准备卸货；到船上来。\" (船方以这个信号确认回复)。",
	"The arrangement calls for someone aboard the ship to flash the first signal. The shore party replies by flashing the second signal, after which the third signal flashes from the ship. It drops anchor and waits for the arrival of a boat from shore. A small group of smugglers approaches the ship in a rowboat. When it arrives, the ship sends a boat in the other direction. These two vessels alternate in transferring contraband between the ship and the shore, with one of them remaining in the shore cave at the end of the operation.": "该安排要求船上的人闪烁第一个信号。岸上的人以闪动第二个信号作为回应，然后从船上闪动第三个信号。船只抛下锚，等待岸上的船只到来。一小群走私者乘坐划艇接近该船。当它到达时，该船向另一个方向派出了一艘船。这两艘船交替在船上和岸上转移违禁品，其中一艘在行动结束后留在岸上的洞穴里。",
	"It has been arranged (though this does not appear on the parchment) for the first signal to be repeated every 10 minutes for an hour. If the ship gets no response, it is assumed that there is some delay and the {@i Sea Ghost} sails away, returning the next night.": "已经安排好了（虽然羊皮纸上没有显示），每10分钟重复一次第一个信号，持续一个小时。如果船没有得到回应，就认为有一些延迟，{@i Sea Ghost}就会驶离，第二天晚上返回。",
	"The smugglers will drop anchor if the characters send any kind of return signal to the ship—not necessarily the correct one. The crew of the {@i Sea Ghost} is accustomed to seeing an improper signal from time to time, because the gang on the shore often operates the lantern clumsily. Just in case something has gone awry, however, the ship's crew will be on alert when the characters make their approach.": "如果这些人物向船上发出任何形式的返回信号--不一定是正确的信号，走私者就会抛锚。{@i Sea Ghost}号的船员已经习惯于时常看到不正确的信号，因为岸上的那帮人经常笨拙地操作灯笼。然而，为了防止出现问题，当这些人物靠近时，船上的船员会保持警惕。",
	"How long it takes the characters to reach the ship depends on what arrangements they have made beforehand. If, for example, it is arranged that the guard members, once they have seen the ship, row ashore and pick the characters up (say in the cave below the haunted house), that takes 15 or 20 minutes. The characters then board the fishing boat, which is rowed out toward the ship. The journey to the ship takes 30 minutes (20 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the {@i Sea Ghost} from the seaward side, another 5 minutes should be added. The ship is lying broadside to the coastline, the starboard side facing landward. If the characters approach it from this side, they are automatically seen when within 20 feet, even if they approach silently and without light.": "人物需要多长时间才能到达船上，这取决于他们事先做了什么安排。例如，如果安排警卫人员在看到船后，划船上岸并接上人物（比如在鬼屋下面的山洞里），这需要15或20分钟。然后人物登上渔船，向船的方向划去。到船上的旅程需要30分钟（两个以上的人划船需要20分钟），但如果船要从向海一侧接近（%0%），则应再加5分钟。该船宽躺在海岸线上，右舷朝向陆地。如果人物从这一侧接近它，他们在20英尺范围内就会被自动看到，即使他们无声无息地接近，没有灯光。",
	"If the characters approach silently from the port side, without using light sources, they will be totally unobserved—the smugglers on deck are watching the coast from the starboard side and do not see or hear intruders who don't give themselves away. Thus, whether the alarm is raised or not depends on a number of factors: from which direction the boat approaches the ship, whether the watchers on the ship are alerted to possible danger (a previous incorrect response to the signal), and whether the characters have taken all precautions to conceal their approach.": "如果人物从左舷悄悄接近，不使用光源，他们将完全不被观察到--甲板上的走私者从右舷观察海岸，看不到或听不到不暴露自己的入侵者。因此，警报是否发出取决于许多因素：船从哪个方向接近船只，船上的观察者是否对可能的危险有所警觉（之前对信号的错误反应），以及人物是否采取了一切预防措施来隐藏他们的接近。",
	"Between the extremes outlined above (automatic detection of a direct approach or no detection of a silent and dark approach from the seaward side), you must judge the circumstances, decide on the probability of detection, and determine the outcome.": "在上述两种极端情况（自动探测到直接接近或没有探测到从向海一侧无声无息的黑暗接近）之间，你必须判断情况，决定探测的概率，并确定结果。",
	"Though it is possible for the characters to capture the {@i Sea Ghost}, they also might choose to destroy it.": "虽然人物有可能捕捉到{@i Sea Ghost}，但他们也可能选择摧毁它。",
	"The {@i Sea Ghost} is mainly of wooden construction, so fire always presents a hazard. The ship could, with some difficulty, be set ablaze and burned down to the waterline. The vessel will not ignite readily, for its hull, rigging, spars, and sails are all damp with sea water.": "{@i Sea Ghost}主要是木质结构，所以火灾总是带来危险。这艘船可以在一定程度上被点燃，烧到水线。该船不会轻易被点燃，因为它的船体、索具、桅杆和船帆都被海水浸湿了。",
	"Deliberate attempts to set the ship ablaze can be undertaken only while aboard it. This involves the use of at least two flasks of oil applied to 2 cubic feet of dry, combustible material such as sacking, cloth, wool, or wood kindling, which is then set aflame. Bolts of silk soaked in brandy make excellent combustibles and do not require oil to be ignited. Use your discretion if the ship catches fire, but assume it burns to the waterline within 20 minutes.": "故意放火烧船的尝试只能在船上进行。这包括使用至少两瓶油涂抹在2立方英尺的干燥可燃材料上，如麻袋、布、羊毛或木柴，然后点燃。浸泡在白兰地中的丝线是很好的可燃物，不需要用油来点燃。如果船着火了，请酌情处理，但要假定它在20分钟内烧到水线。",
	"Attempts to hole the ship and sink it require the use of axes or similar implements applied with vigor. This undertaking takes 5 minutes, but the noise alerts the smugglers. Two of them are sent to investigate and raise the alarm. The rest of the crew rapidly converge on the area and attack any intruders. If the hole is completed, the ship takes on water and sinks after an hour if the hole remains unrepaired.": "试图在船上打洞并使其沉没，需要使用斧头或类似的工具，并大力使用。这项工作需要5分钟，但噪音惊动了走私者。他们中的两个人被派去调查并发出警报。其余的船员迅速向该地区集结，攻击任何入侵者。如果洞口完成，船就会进水，一小时后如果洞口仍未修复就会沉没。",
	"This area is not shown on the map but is—predictably—atop the mast, 40 feet above the main deck. Access to it is provided by a rope ladder whose lower end drops near the hatch on the main deck. The crow's nest is an open, wooden platform, 10 feet square with 3-foot-high wooden walls. Opening a 2-foot-square hatch in the floor lets out the rope ladder that descends to the main deck.": "这个区域在地图上没有显示，但可以预见的是，它位于桅杆顶部，比主甲板高出40英尺。通过一个绳梯可以进入，绳梯的下端落在主甲板的舱口附近。鸦巢是一个开放的木制平台，10英尺见方，有3英尺高的木墙。打开地板上的一个2英尺见方的舱门，就可以看到下降到主甲板上的绳梯。",
	"A single crew member ({@creature bandit}) occupies this area when the party approaches the ship. The crew member looks toward the house and awaits a signal. There is no chance that he detects the characters' approach to the ship or their boarding of the ship if the others on board below fail to do so—his gaze is fixed at a higher level.": "当队伍接近船只时，一名船员（{@creature bandit}）占据了这个区域。该船员看向房子，等待信号。如果下面的其他船员没有察觉到，他就没有机会察觉到人物的接近或他们的登船--他的目光被固定在更高的地方。",
	"If those on the deck below detect the characters' intrusion, the crew member's attention is attracted (even if his colleagues forget to alert him), and he descends with all speed to the deck to assist his mates. Otherwise, he is oblivious to the characters' intrusion unless someone climbs the rope ladder or the rigging to approach his position; he always detects such an approach when the climber is 15 feet below him, investigating and attacking if circumstances warrant it.": "如果下面甲板上的人发现了人物的入侵，船员的注意力就会被吸引（即使他的同事忘记提醒他），他就会全速下降到甲板上，协助他的同伴。否则，他对人物的入侵视而不见，除非有人爬上绳梯或索具接近他的位置；他总是在攀爬者低于他15英尺时发现这种接近，如果情况需要，他就会进行调查和攻击。",
	"If the characters make a direct approach, they can try to bluff their way aboard once they have been detected. For instance, they might say they are new recruits to the smuggling gang, unaccustomed to the codes and thus made a mistake with the signaling, or something of a similar nature.": "如果人物直接上船，一旦被发现，他们可以尝试虚张声势地上船。例如，他们可以说自己是走私团伙的新成员，不习惯使用密码，因此犯了一个信号错误，或类似性质的东西。",
	"If the story is reasonably convincing, allow the characters to make a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. If the check is successful, they are believed up to the point when the first three characters get aboard by means of a rope ladder lowered for them. Once the characters' approach is detected, the entire crew attempts to repel the characters with the utmost vigor while getting their vessel under way.": "如果故事相当有说服力，允许角色进行DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查。如果检查成功，他们就会被相信，直到前三个角色通过为他们放下的绳梯上船。一旦人物的接近被发现，全体船员就会试图用最大的力量击退这些人物，同时让他们的船开动。",
	"Climbing aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} undetected is no small feat. Keep in mind the following as the characters attempt to board:": "在不被发现的情况下爬上{@i Sea Ghost}号是一个不小的成就。当人物试图登船时，请牢记以下几点。",
	"{@skill Perception} checks that rely on hearing are made with disadvantage on the ship because of the sound of the waves and sea.": "{@skill Perception}依赖听觉的检查在船上是不利的，因为有海浪和大海的声音。",
	"The hull of the ship provides many handholds for climbing but is also very slippery. Climbing the hull without a rope or other device requires a successful DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. On a failed check, the climber falls into the water.": "船体提供了许多攀爬的抓手，但也非常滑溜。在没有绳索或其他装置的情况下攀登船体，需要成功地进行DC14力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查。如果检查失败，攀爬者会掉入水中。",
	"Aside from Captain Sigurd \"Snake Eyes\" ({@creature pirate captain|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}), the crew of the {@i Sea Ghost} consists of the following members:": "除了船长Sigurd \"Snake Eyes\"（{@creature pirate captain|GoS}；见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}），{@i Sea Ghost}号的船员包括以下成员。",

	"If the ship's captain, the first mate, the bosun, and the deck wizard are all killed or have fled, and if the characters then outnumber the surviving crew and lizardfolk combined, the smugglers offer to surrender the ship to the characters. They seek the most advantageous terms they can get, but their minimum requirements will be their lives and liberty, and the ship's jolly boat in which to flee. If the characters refuse these terms, the smugglers offer to trade information in exchange for treasure. Their minimum requirement, in this case, is 100 gp to disclose the whereabouts of the secret cache of weapons and the fact they were to deliver these arms to the lizardfolk. They do not know the exact location of the rendezvous point, only that it is about ten miles or so along the coast west of the haunted house, near the mouth of a small river. For a further amount of 50 gp, they reveal the presence of the sea elf prisoner in {@area area 14|16b|x}.": "如果船长、大副、水手和甲板上的巫师都被杀死或逃走了，而且如果这些人物的人数超过了幸存的船员和蜥蜴人的总和，那么走私者就会向这些人物提出投降。他们希望得到最有利的条件，但他们的最低要求是他们的生命和自由，以及乘坐船上的欢乐船逃离。如果人物拒绝这些条件，走私者就会提出用信息来换取财宝。在这种情况下，他们的最低要求是100金币，以透露秘密武器库的下落以及他们将把这些武器交给蜥蜴人的事实。他们不知道集合点的确切位置，只知道它在鬼屋以西的海岸线上约10英里处，靠近一条小河的河口。只要再付50金币，他们就会透露海精灵囚犯的存在（%0%）。",
	"The name of the vessel, {@i Sea Ghost}, is painted on both sides of the prow.

	"Of course, the characters do not know the truth behind the lizardfolk's need to purchase weapons. To learn the truth, more of the story must unfold. See chapter 3, {@adventure Danger at Dunwater|GoS|2}.": "当然，这些人物并不知道蜥蜴人需要购买武器背后的真相。要了解真相，必须展开更多的故事。见第三章，（%0%）。",
	"The smugglers are very successful. Their main source of income is the sale of stolen goods, especially those marked with a royal seal or similar identifier that would make dealing with legitimate merchants impossible. They also take in goods from ships they have waylaid, usually spices, weapons, poisons, and other contraband that is either illegal or heavily taxed in this region. Currently, the ship's hold is crowded with mining equipment and kegs of brandy stolen from a royal shipment meant for a crown-sponsored mining operation in this region, along with silks that were originally destined for a royal trade mission.": "走私者是非常成功的。他们的主要收入来源是销售赃物，特别是那些标有皇家印章或类似标识的货物，这样就不可能与合法商人打交道。他们也从他们劫持的船只上接收货物，通常是香料、武器、毒药和其他违禁品，这些货物在这个地区要么是非法的，要么是被征收重税的。目前，这艘船的船舱里挤满了采矿设备和从皇家运输中偷来的白兰地桶，这些白兰地是为皇家在这个地区赞助的采矿行动准备的，还有原本是为皇家贸易代表团准备的丝绸。",
	"If the characters break the smuggling ring, they are free to keep whatever other treasure they find without consequence, but the current contents of the hold must be handled carefully.": "如果人物打破了走私团伙，他们可以自由地保留他们找到的任何其他宝藏而不产生任何后果，但必须小心处理船舱中的现有物品。",
	"Representatives of the crown in Saltmarsh will pay 200 gp for the return of the silk and brandy stored under the house (in {@area area 27|128|x}) and 500 gp for the merchandise aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} (the goods in {@area area 11|15f|x} and the weapons in {@area area 15|170|x}).": "萨尔马什的王室代表将为归还存放在房子下面的丝绸和白兰地（在（%0%））支付200克普，为（%1%）船上的商品（（%2%）的货物和（%3%）的武器）支付500克普。",
	"Royal agents might also claim the smugglers' ship, but at your option, if the characters have proven eager to aid the crown, they are given the ship and pledged the service of a contingent of sailors to man it for one year.": "皇家特工也可能要求得到走私者的船，但根据你的选择，如果这些人物被证明渴望帮助王室，他们就会得到这艘船，并保证有一支水手队伍在一年内为其服务。",
	"If the characters keep the merchandise and try to sell it openly in the region, they find no buyers. Such an attempt earns them a poor reputation, the effect of which is up to you.": "如果这些人物保留商品并试图在该地区公开出售，他们会发现没有买家。这样的尝试会给他们带来不好的名声，其效果由你决定。",
	"The discovery that a colony of lizardfolk lies near the small fishing town of Saltmarsh and is purchasing weaponry considered sophisticated by lizardfolk standards has alarmed the Saltmarsh Town Council. Greatly troubled and filled with apprehension, the councillors call an emergency meeting.": "发现一个蜥蜴人的殖民地位于小渔镇Saltmarsh附近，并且正在购买以蜥蜴人的标准认为是先进的武器，这让Saltmarsh镇议会感到震惊。忧心忡忡的议员们召开了一次紧急会议。",
	"This adventure is designed for a group of four to six 3rd-level characters.": "这场冒险是为四到六个三级角色的小组设计的。",
	"Dave J. Brown and Don Turnbull continued the Saltmarsh series in this classic. Doubling down on TSR UK's penchant for exploration and interaction in their work, this scenario challenges the characters to act as ambassadors to a colony of lizardfolk.": "戴夫-J-布朗和唐-特恩布尔在这部经典作品中延续了《萨尔马什》系列。在TSR英国公司的作品中，他们对探索和互动的偏好得到了加倍的发挥，这个场景挑战人物作为大使前往蜥蜴人的殖民地。",
	"While such roleplay-focused adventures are the norm today, at the time of its publication (in 1982) this adventure was the first to make interaction an absolute requirement for success, rather than one option among many.": "虽然这种以角色扮演为重点的冒险在今天已经成为常态，但在其出版时（1982年），这个冒险是第一个将互动作为成功的绝对要求，而不是众多选项中的一个。",
	"The characters are not required to have finished {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1} before playing {@i Danger at Dunwater}. If they arrive in Saltmarsh after the events of the prior adventure, they learn the following information from the townsfolk:": "角色在玩{@i Danger at Dunwater}之前不需要完成{@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}。如果他们在之前的冒险事件之后到达萨尔马什，他们会从镇民那里得知以下信息。",
	"A smuggling ring operating out of an abandoned house has been disbanded.": "一个在废弃房屋内运作的走私团伙已被解散。",
	"The smugglers were slain or jailed.": "走私者被杀或入狱。",
	"The smugglers were supplying weapons to a tribe of lizardfolk that have established a colony near Saltmarsh.": "走私者向一个在萨尔马什附近建立了殖民地的蜥蜴人部落提供武器。",
	"When the councillors discover that a seasoned group of adventurers has arrived in town, they send a message to the characters inviting them to a meeting. The council hopes to hire them to investigate the lizardfolk lair and learn why the creatures are arming themselves. The council's main priority in the context of this adventure is to keep the town safe from a possible lizardfolk attack.": "当议员们发现一群经验丰富的冒险家来到镇上时，他们给这些人物发了一条信息，邀请他们参加一个会议。议会希望雇佣他们来调查蜥蜴人的巢穴，并了解这些生物为什么要武装自己。在这次冒险中，委员会的主要任务是保护小镇的安全，使其免受蜥蜴人的攻击。",
	"Judging from a crude map found aboard the smugglers' vessel and from information provided by the sea elf {@creature Oceanus|GoS}, it seems likely that the lizardfolk are preparing for war. The council members hope that the townspeople are not the intended target, but they greatly fear this possibility.": "从走私者船上发现的一张粗糙的地图和海精灵（%0%）提供的信息来看，蜥蜴人似乎正在为战争做准备。议会成员希望镇民不是预定目标，但他们非常担心这种可能性。",
	"The site of the lizardfolk colony has been tentatively identified as a coastal promontory adjacent to a small river, the Dunwater, some ten miles southwest of Saltmarsh. The council considers it essential that a scouting party be sent to reconnoiter the area and ascertain the strength and size of this colony, as well as the intentions of the lizardfolk. The characters (whether or not they are veterans of the previous adventure) are approached to undertake this mission.": "蜥蜴人聚居地的地点已被初步确定为一个海岸岬角，毗邻一条小河，即邓沃特河，位于萨尔马什西南约10英里处。议会认为有必要派遣一支侦察队来侦察该地区，并确定该殖民地的实力和规模，以及蜥蜴人的意图。角色们（无论他们是否是前一次冒险的老手）被邀请承担这项任务。",
	"The leader of the council impresses upon the characters that they are not required to act with hostile intent—in fact, quite the opposite. Their assignment is one of information gathering, with the additional hope that they can return with knowledge of what the lizardfolk are up to. A reward of 700 gp is offered for the successful completion of the mission.": "委员会的领导向这些人物强调，他们不需要带着敌意行事--事实上，恰恰相反。他们的任务是收集信息，并希望他们能带着关于蜥蜴人的知识回来。成功完成任务的人将获得700戈比的奖励。",
	"The people of Saltmarsh, and of course the characters, are unaware of the true situation as the adventure gets under way. The lizardfolk are not preparing for war against Saltmarsh, but against a much more sinister presence: the sahuagin.": "萨尔马什的人们，当然还有人物，在冒险开始时并不知道真实情况。蜥蜴人不是在准备对萨尔马什的战争，而是在准备对付一个更邪恶的存在：萨瓦金。",
	"Just over a year ago, a colony of lizardfolk were driven from their home by an invasion of sahuagin. Forced to find a temporary home, they restored an old lizardfolk stronghold that had been abandoned for decades.": "就在一年多以前，一个蜥蜴人的聚居地被萨瓦金人的入侵赶出了他们的家园。他们被迫找到一个临时的家，恢复了一个被遗弃了几十年的古老蜥蜴人的据点。",
	"Determined to recapture their home, the lizardfolk have been busily purchasing arms and negotiating an alliance with other nearby aquatic races. The lizardfolk's main purpose is to form an army to expel the sahuagin from the area. In so doing, they hope to discourage the sahuagin from ever again intruding on the region.": "蜥蜴人决心夺回自己的家园，一直在忙着购买武器，并与附近的其他水生种族谈判结盟。蜥蜴人的主要目的是组建一支军队，将萨瓦金人驱逐出该地区。这样做，他们希望能阻止萨瓦金人再次侵入该地区。",
	"The lizardfolk have not approached Saltmarsh with an offer to join the alliance because {@creature Othokent|GoS}, their queen, considers humans and other land-dwelling races as of little use in a battle to be fought largely underwater.": "蜥蜴人没有向萨尔马什提出加入联盟的建议，因为他们的女王（%0%）认为人类和其他陆上居住的种族在一场主要在水下进行的战斗中没有什么用。",
	"Ambassadors from the koalinth, the locathah, and the merfolk are present in the lizardfolk lair. The sea elves were not invited to join the alliance because of long-standing disputes between them and the koalinth—even in the face of the sahuagin threat, no cooperation is possible between these two peoples. The lizardfolk, concluding that the koalinth are the stronger tribe, invited them to participate rather than the elves.": "来自考林斯、洛萨塔和人鱼族的大使都在蜥蜴人的巢穴中。海精灵没有被邀请加入联盟，因为他们和koalinth之间有长期的争端--即使面对sahuagin的威胁，这两个民族之间也不可能合作。蜥蜴人得出结论，考林斯是更强大的部落，因此邀请他们参加而不是精灵。",
	"Members of these four races have come together, overlooking their previous rivalries and differences, to negotiate an agreement of cooperation. But even as the lizardfolk strive to hold their alliance together in the face of a common foe, the bonds are beginning to fray.": "这四个种族的成员走到一起，忽略了他们以前的竞争和分歧，谈判达成了合作协议。但是，即使蜥蜴人在面对一个共同的敌人时努力维持他们的联盟，这种联系也开始出现裂痕。",
	"How the characters perform their mission, and what sort of relationship they establish with the lizardfolk on behalf of Saltmarsh, will determine if the coalition has any chance of success.": "人物如何执行任务，以及他们代表萨尔马什与蜥蜴人建立什么样的关系，将决定联盟是否有成功的机会。",
	"If the characters freed {@creature Oceanus|GoS} from his cell aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} in {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}, the elf offers to join them in their expedition to the lizardfolk lair. His skills in combat and knowledge of the seas and the dark things that dwell there might prove invaluable to the party. He recognizes and identifies the sahuagin remains in the lair. He takes an equal share of both treasure and experience points.": "如果人物在(2%)的(1%)号上把{@creature Oceanus|GoS}从他的牢房中释放出来，这个精灵就会主动加入他们对蜥蜴人巢穴的远征。他的战斗技巧以及对海洋和居住在那里的黑暗事物的了解，可能会证明对他们来说是无价的。他认出并确认了巢穴中的萨瓦金人遗体。他在财宝和经验值方面都占有同等份额。",
	"Alternatively, {@creature Oceanus|GoS} might have allied with the town council previously and offers to join the characters as they embark for the lizardfolk lair.": "另外，{@creature Oceanus|GoS}可能之前已经与镇议会结盟，并提出在他们前往蜥蜴人巢穴的时候加入角色。",
	"{@creature Oceanus|GoS} wants to discover the truth behind the lizardfolk's purchase of smuggled weapons and armor. Like the town council, he initially sees the lizardfolk as a potential threat.": "{@creature Oceanus|GoS}想要发现蜥蜴人购买走私武器和盔甲的真相。和镇议会一样，他最初也认为蜥蜴人是一个潜在的威胁。",
	"Two political groups operate in the social structure of the lizardfolk lair. On the one hand are the dominant progressives led by the queen, {@creature Othokent|GoS}, who is supported by a subchief named Irhtos, several officers, and many warriors. Her progressive stance is inspired and driven by wisdom of the aged lizardfolk minister, {@creature Sauriv|GoS}.": "在蜥蜴人巢穴的社会结构中，有两个政治团体在运作。一方面是由女王（%0%）领导的占主导地位的进步派，她得到了一个名叫伊尔托斯的副酋长、几个军官和许多战士的支持。她的进步立场受到年老的蜥蜴人部长（1%）的智慧的启发和推动。",
	"Opposing that group (mostly covertly, for the rule of the queen remains absolute) are the traditionalists, led by the shamans. The shamans believe that allying and intermingling with other races is contrary to the divine will of their god, Semuanya, and that no good can come of it. Consequently, the shamans hate and distrust the minister, {@creature Sauriv|GoS}, whom they consider to be the prime instigator of these efforts that go against nature. They dare not move openly against him, however, since he enjoys the trust and favor of the queen.": "反对这一群体的是以萨满为首的传统派（主要是隐蔽的，因为女王的统治仍然是绝对的）。巫师们认为，与其他种族结盟和交融是与他们的神Semuanya的神圣意志相违背的，而且不会有好结果。因此，巫师们憎恨和不信任部长（%0%），他们认为部长是这些违背自然的努力的主要煽动者。然而，他们不敢公开反对他，因为他得到了女王的信任和青睐。",
	"If the lizardfolk queen is killed in the course of this adventure, she is succeeded by the subchief. If the subchief is also killed, the succession goes to one of the warrior officers. If all of these are slain, then succession falls to the most senior surviving shaman. In this event, the shaman denounces the alliance, pulls the lizardfolk out of it, sacrifices the aged lizardfolk minister to the lizardfolk deity Semuanya, and leads the remainder of the tribe into the depths of the marsh beyond the reach of the sahuagin. If all the lizardfolk notables are slain, surviving members of the tribe simply drift away into the marsh, taking all their possessions with them. There will then be no chance of an alliance against the sahuagin that involves the lizardfolk.": "如果蜥蜴人女王在这次冒险过程中被杀，她将由副酋长继承。如果副首领也被杀了，那么继承权就会落在一个武士官身上。如果所有这些人都被杀了，那么继承权就落在幸存的最高级萨满身上。在这种情况下，萨满会谴责联盟，把蜥蜴人从联盟中拉出来，把年老的蜥蜴人部长献给蜥蜴人神Semuanya，并带领部落的其余成员进入萨瓦金人无法到达的沼泽深处。如果所有蜥蜴人的重要人物都被杀了，幸存的部落成员就会带着他们所有的财产漂流到沼泽里。这样一来，就没有机会与蜥蜴人结盟对抗萨瓦金人了。",
	"Ideally, when the characters learn the truth about the lizardfolk and the sahuagin, they have done so before causing irreparable harm to the occupants of the lair and the lizardfolk's plans for the alliance against the sahuagin. For their mission to have any chance of succeeding, the characters must eventually gain—or be forcibly prodded into—an audience with the queen. Even if her initial reaction is not a friendly one, the characters might still have a chance of winning over the lizardfolk and making them receptive (if the characters suggest as much) to admitting Saltmarsh into the alliance.": "理想的情况是，当人物了解到蜥蜴人和萨瓦金的真相时，他们在对巢穴的居住者和蜥蜴人对抗萨瓦金的联盟计划造成不可挽回的伤害之前就已经这样做了。为了使他们的任务有任何成功的机会，这些人物最终必须获得--或者被强行催促--与女王会面。即使她最初的反应并不友好，角色们仍然有机会赢得蜥蜴人的好感，让他们接受（如果角色们建议的话）接纳萨尔马什加入联盟。",
	"Handling the interaction between the two sides against the backdrop of the first contact between the lizardfolk and potentially friendly humans can be difficult. Though it's always possible to let roleplaying take its course, particularly if the characters refrain from combat and make a good first impression, things might not play out quite that simply. Here are some guidelines on how to handle this aspect of the adventure.": "在蜥蜴人和潜在的友好人类首次接触的背景下，处理双方的互动可能是困难的。尽管总是有可能让角色扮演顺其自然，特别是如果角色避免战斗并给人留下良好的第一印象，但事情可能不会那么简单。这里有一些关于如何处理这个方面的冒险的指南。",
	"The lizardfolk start out indifferent toward the characters and, by extension, Saltmarsh. To track the attitude of the lizardfolk, use points to record the characters' progress toward sealing an alliance. The characters begin the adventure with 0 points. That score is adjusted every time they interact with lizardfolk, but the results only become apparent when the characters meet the lizardfolk queen. They can then earn more points through diplomacy and by improving the tribe's strength and safety.": "蜥蜴人开始时对这些角色无动于衷，并延伸到萨尔马什。为了跟踪蜥蜴人的态度，可以用积分来记录人物在缔结联盟方面的进展。冒险开始时，人物的积分为0。每当他们与蜥蜴人互动时，这个分数就会被调整，但结果只有在人物遇到蜥蜴人女王时才会显现。然后，他们可以通过外交手段和提高部落的实力和安全来获得更多的分数。",
	"The alliance is sealed if the characters reach or exceed 50 points, at which point the lizardfolk become friendly to them. They are invited to see the queen a second time, and during this session the groundwork for Saltmarsh's inclusion in the alliance can be laid.": "如果角色达到或超过50分，联盟就会被封存，此时蜥蜴人会对他们友好。他们会被邀请去见女王第二次，在这个环节中，可以为萨尔马什加入联盟奠定基础。",
	"The lizardfolk become irrevocably hostile if the characters' total number of points drops to 0 or lower even after the queen offers them chances at diplomacy and ways to improve their standing. If this happens, after the lizardfolk give them a second chance, the characters' mission ends in failure.": "如果角色的积分总数下降到0或更低，甚至在女王为他们提供了外交机会和改善他们地位的方法之后，蜥蜴人也会变得不可逆转的敌对。如果发生这种情况，在蜥蜴人给他们第二次机会后，角色的任务就会以失败告终。",
	"The point system starts working when the adventure begins, but its ramifications aren't apparent until the PCs meet the queen for the first time. This most likely occurs after they engage a group of lizardfolk without fighting them, whereupon they are put in custody and taken to her. When this happens, determine the characters' current point total by using the Initial Attitude table, giving them benefits and penalties according to what they have done so far. The characters might have a negative score at this point if they were hostile toward the lizardfolk prior to their audience.": "积分系统在冒险开始时就开始工作了，但是它的影响在NPC第一次见到女王之前并不明显。这很可能发生在他们与一群蜥蜴人交战而没有战斗之后，在那里他们被关押并被带到女王面前。当这种情况发生时，通过使用初始态度表来确定人物当前的积分总数，根据他们到目前为止所做的事情给予他们好处和惩罚。如果人物在听众面前对蜥蜴人有敌意，那么他们在这一点上可能会有负分。",
	"{@creature Othokent|GoS} is worldly for a lizardfolk. In her youth, she spent several years exploring the nearby marshes. She found human society interesting and observed caravans and villages in secret. She knows about the outside world but feigns ignorance in an attempt to catch the characters in a lie. She respects those who show her respect and treat her people as their equals, rather than as primitive fools to be mocked or patronized. Her experience with humans tells her that they can be useful allies, but she also knows that they can be duplicitous.": "{@creature Othokent|GoS}对蜥蜴人来说是个世故的人。在她年轻的时候，她花了几年时间探索附近的沼泽地。她发现人类社会很有趣，并秘密地观察商队和村庄。她知道外面的世界，但她假装无知，试图在谎言中抓住人物。她尊重那些对她表示尊重的人，把她的族人当作平等的人，而不是把他们当作原始的傻瓜来嘲弄或袒护。她与人类打交道的经验告诉她，他们可以成为有用的盟友，但她也知道，他们可能是两面派。",
	"During this meeting, the queen makes it clear how she feels about the characters' behavior so far. She gives them a lot of credit for not killing any lizardfolk (if that's the case), or she chastises them for taking the lives of lizardfolk unnecessarily. If hatchlings are among the characters' victims, the queen is close to outrage and makes no secret of it. Conversely, if the characters arrive with hatchlings in tow, her estimation of them rises steeply.": "在这次会议上，女王清楚地表明了她对这些人物迄今为止的行为的看法。她为他们没有杀死任何蜥蜴人而大加赞赏（如果是这样的话），或者她责备他们不必要地夺走蜥蜴人的生命。如果人物的受害者中有幼崽，女王就会接近于愤怒，并且毫不掩饰。相反，如果人物带着幼崽来到这里，她对他们的评价就会急剧上升。",
	"If the characters have accumulated any treasure while in the lair, either from victims or from unoccupied areas, the queen demands its return. She doesn't hold a grudge as long as the characters give it back.": "如果角色在巢穴中积累了任何财宝，无论是从受害者身上还是从未被占领的区域，女王都会要求他们归还。只要角色归还，她就不会记恨。",
	"If the mission isn't ruined by how they conduct themselves prior to this first audience, the queen allows the characters to circulate through the lair for a brief time to give all the occupants a chance to pass their own judgment. Beyond this point, the only ways the characters can improve their score hereafter are by succeeding on Charisma checks (see \"{@area Goodwill Tour|182|x}\" below) and perhaps tipping the scales by offering the queen some of their valuables or the use of their services.": "如果任务没有被他们在第一次觐见之前的行为所破坏，女王会允许角色在巢穴中短暂停留，让所有的人都有机会通过自己的判断。在这之后，人物可以提高他们的分数的唯一方法是通过魅力检查（见下面的\"{@area Goodwill Tour|182|x}\"）和也许通过向女王提供一些他们的贵重物品或使用他们的服务来使天平倾斜。",
	"Killed lizardfolk adults": "杀死蜥蜴人的成年人",
	"−1 per victim": "每个受害者-1",
	"Killed hatchlings": "被杀死的幼虫",

	"Arrived accompanied by hatchlings": "伴随着孵化出的幼鸟到来",
	"After the characters meet the queen, she gives them 24 hours to prove their worth and win the lizardfolk's trust by visiting and interacting with occupants of the lair. Successful Charisma checks during this activity can add to the characters' points and help sway the lizardfolk into an alliance with Saltmarsh. For the best possible outcome, the characters must win over most or all the occupants of the lair, including its two most important individuals.": "在人物见到女王后，女王给他们24小时来证明他们的价值，并通过访问和与巢穴中的居民互动来赢得蜥蜴人的信任。在这个活动中，成功的魅力检查可以增加角色的积分，并帮助动摇蜥蜴人与Saltmarsh的联盟。为了获得最好的结果，人物必须赢得巢穴中大部分或所有的人，包括两个最重要的人。",
	"To earn the trust of an NPC ({@creature Sauriv|GoS} or {@creature Othokent|GoS}) or a group ({@creature Lizardfolk Commoner|GoS|commoners}, {@creature Lizardfolk Shaman||shamans}, other lizardfolk, locathah, or merfolk), one or more characters must display their good intentions to that individual or group consistently for at least 3 hours. At the end of that time, a character can then attempt a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check against a DC that depends on the group or individual in question (see the table below). On a successful check, the characters earn progress toward achieving the alliance. On a failed check, they don't lose any ground, but the character who made that check, along with any who helped on the check, cannot try to gain that group's or individual's trust again.": "为了赢得一个NPC（{@creature Sauriv|GoS}或{@creature Othokent|GoS}）或一个团体（{@creature Lizardfolk Commoner|GoS|commoners}、{@creature Lizardfolk Shaman||shamans}、其他蜥蜴人、Locathah或merfolk）的信任，一个或多个角色必须向该个人或团体持续展示他们的好意，至少3小时。在这段时间结束时，一个角色可以尝试进行魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，检查的DC取决于相关的团体或个人（见下表）。如果检定成功，角色就会在实现联盟的过程中获得进展。如果检定失败，他们不会失去任何优势，但进行检定的角色，以及任何帮助检定的人，都不能再尝试获得该团体或个人的信任。",

If they fall short at the end of the 24 hours, there are a couple of other ways (see below) that they can get to the required number.": "如果角色能够通过足够数量的成功检查将他们的分数提高到50分，那么他们与蜥蜴人的关系就会变得友好，联盟就可以正式建立。如果他们在24小时结束时没有达到要求，还有其他一些方法（见下文）可以使他们达到所需的数字。",
	"If the characters have exhausted their opportunities to impress the lizardfolk but don't have the needed 50 points, {@creature Othokent|GoS} might be willing to cooperate if the characters offer her tribute from their personal treasures (not including loot from the lair). For every 10 gp in coins, gems, and other valuables they offer, the characters gain 1 point. Consumable magic items earn 5 points and permanent ones 10 points, provided that the items have direct application for battling the sahuagin.": "如果角色已经用尽了讨好蜥蜴人的机会，但没有所需的50分，（%0%）可能会愿意合作，如果角色从他们的个人财物（不包括巢穴的战利品）中向她进贡。他们每提供10戈比的硬币、宝石和其他贵重物品，人物就会获得1分。消耗性的魔法物品可获得5分，永久性的可获得10分，只要这些物品能直接用于与萨瓦金人作战。",
	"Another way the characters can earn points is by defeating monsters in the marsh that threaten the lizardfolk, demonstrating both their skill and their good intentions.": "人物获得积分的另一种方式是击败沼泽中威胁蜥蜴人的怪物，既展示他们的技能，也展示他们的善意。",
	"In particular, the great crocodile called {@creature Thousand Teeth|GoS} is an ongoing problem for the tribe.

Stage encounters in the marsh as you see fit, involving trolls, ogres, or bullywugs. The characters earn {@dice 2d6} points for every troll slain, {@dice 1d6} for each ogre, and {@dice 1d6} for every three bullywugs.": "蜥蜴人在沼泽中还有其他敌人。如果角色们认真地试图成功完成任务，但却落入了一些坏运气（骰子低），你可以安排他们通过寻找和击败这些其他生物来获得一些最后的分数。在沼泽地上演你认为合适的遭遇战，涉及巨魔、食人魔或恶霸。每杀死一个巨魔，人物就能获得{@dice 2d6}分；每杀死一个食人魔，人物就能获得{@dice 1d6}分；每杀死三个恶霸就能获得{@dice 1d6}分。",

	"The influence of the aged lizardfolk minister has kept the tribe from fracturing because of ideological differences (see \"{@area Politics Among the Lizardfolk|17e|x}\" above). If the characters kill him instead of trying to communicate with him, they are set upon by the rest of the tribe just as if they had killed the queen. After the intruders are put down or chased off, the tribe succumbs to infighting as the shamans try to muster more support for their point of view. There is no longer a chance of Saltmarsh becoming allied with the lizardfolk, and if the shamans succeed in their takeover they will withdraw the tribe from any discussions of alliance with other races as well.": "年迈的蜥蜴人部长的影响使部落没有因为意识形态的差异而分裂（见上文\"（%0%）\"）。如果角色们杀了他，而不是试图与他沟通，他们就会被部落里的其他成员陷害，就像他们杀了女王一样。在入侵者被放倒或赶走之后，部落就会陷入内讧，因为巫师们试图为自己的观点争取更多支持。萨尔马什不再有机会与蜥蜴人结盟，如果巫师们的接管成功，他们也会让部落退出与其他种族结盟的讨论。",
	"This adventure provides the characters with opportunities for extensive interaction with a variety of lizardfolk. The lizardfolk are generally wary of strangers, but are of neutral alignment and are far from dimwitted or bloodthirsty. Here are a few resources you can use to add flavor to the party's experiences with the lizardfolk by giving depth and dimension to the occupants of the lair. They are designed to help you with adventure preparation and to enable you to create distinctive lizardfolk NPCs on the spot.": "这次冒险为人物提供了与各种蜥蜴人广泛交流的机会。蜥蜴人通常对陌生人有戒心，但他们是中立的，而且远非愚蠢或嗜血的。这里有一些资源，你可以通过赋予巢穴中的居民以深度和维度，来增加派对与蜥蜴人的经验。它们旨在帮助你进行冒险准备，并使你能够在现场创建独特的蜥蜴人NPC。",
	"To customize the lizardfolk in the lair, use the personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws from the character backgrounds in {@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Backgrounds} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} as a starting point. The acolyte background is ideal for shamans, the soldier background for warriors, and the hermit and outlander backgrounds for commoners. If the result of a die roll seems inappropriate, such as the \"Raised by wolves\" trait in the outlander background, roll again.": "要定制巢穴中的蜥蜴人，请使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的角色背景中的个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷作为起点。圣徒背景非常适合萨满，士兵背景适合战士，而隐士和外乡人背景适合平民。如果掷骰子的结果看起来不合适，比如外乡人背景中的 \"被狼养大 \"的特征，就再掷一次。",
	"In addition, you can use the Lizardfolk Quirks table below to determine a personality quirk for a lizardfolk character or to inspire a unique mannerism.": "此外，你可以使用下面的蜥蜴人怪癖表来确定蜥蜴人角色的个性怪癖，或激发出独特的举止。",

	"You enjoy eating your food while it's still raw and wriggling.": "你喜欢在食物还未成熟和蠕动的时候吃它。",
	"Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as \"axe,\" a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means \"green,\" to describe how she blends into the foliage. Young lizardfolk are often given a name by one of the community's elders, but take an adult name not long after reaching their first decade.": "蜥蜴人的名字来自于德拉克斯语。他们使用部落根据个人的显著事迹或行动而授予的简单描述。例如，加鲁特（Garurt）被翻译成 \"斧头\"，这个名字是给一个打败兽人并夺取敌人武器的蜥蜴人战士的。一个喜欢在伏击动物前躲在芦苇丛中的蜥蜴人可能被称为Achuak，意思是 \"绿色\"，以描述她如何融入树叶中。年轻的蜥蜴人通常由社区的一位长者给他们起一个名字，但在他们到达第一个十年后不久就会取一个成年的名字。",
	"Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and female in their naming conventions, and any number of individuals can have the same name. The Lizardfolk Names table includes a number of examples, all of which are used for either gender.": "蜥蜴人在他们的命名惯例中不区分男性和女性，任何数量的个体都可以有相同的名字。蜥蜴人的名字表包括一些例子，所有这些名字都可以用于任何性别。",
	"Because each name has meaning beyond its use as an identifier, you can use an individual's name as a starting point for its description. (Each name's meaning in Common is given in parentheses.) Someone named Kosj might be exceptionally scrawny, while a lizardfolk dubbed Usk might wear scraps of plate armor scavenged from a foe.": "因为每个名字都有其作为识别符以外的意义，你可以用一个人的名字作为描述的起点。(括号内为每个名字的通用含义。)名为Kosj的人可能特别瘦弱，而被称为Usk的蜥蜴人可能穿着从敌人身上搜来的板甲碎片。",

The characters enter the lair and explore it.": "角色们与萨尔马什镇议会会面，议会雇佣他们去调查蜥蜴人的巢穴。通过海路或陆路，人物前往海角，到达蜥蜴人的巢穴。角色们进入巢穴并进行探索。",
	"Through interaction with the lizardfolk or their guests, the characters can earn either the lizardfolk's enmity or their respect. If they proceed cautiously and without violent intent, they will likely be taken to an audience with the queen, {@creature Othokent|GoS}. Depending on how they have conducted themselves to that point, the characters might be able to improve their reputation with the tribe by using their diplomatic skills.": "通过与蜥蜴人或他们的客人互动，人物可以赢得蜥蜴人的敌意或尊重。如果他们谨慎行事，没有暴力倾向，他们可能会被带去见女王，（%0%）。根据他们在这一点上的表现，人物可能会通过外交技巧提高他们在部落的声誉。",
	"The best possible outcome is for the characters to befriend the lizardfolk and for {@creature Othokent|GoS} to invite them (and Saltmarsh) to join the alliance. If the characters can't accomplish this through acts of contrition and persuasion, they might be able to salvage the situation by offering the lizardfolk treasure. In addition, the tribe has a big problem out in the marsh, and the characters might be able to prove themselves by taking care of things, thus earning {@creature Othokent|GoS}'s gratitude.": "最好的结果是人物与蜥蜴人交好，并且（%0%）邀请他们（和萨尔马什）加入联盟。如果人物不能通过忏悔和劝说的行为来实现这一目标，他们也许可以通过向蜥蜴人提供财宝来挽救局面。此外，部落在沼泽地有一个大问题，角色们也许可以通过处理事情来证明自己，从而赢得（%%）的感激。",
	"In the Greyhawk campaign setting, where the town of Saltmarsh is located, the lizardfolk lair is a coastal promontory adjacent to the Dunwater River.": "在灰鹰（Greyhawk）战役的设定中，萨尔马什（Saltmarsh）镇的所在地，蜥蜴人的巢穴是一个毗邻邓沃特河的海岸岬角。",
	"The appearance of lizardfolk near Saltmarsh in the Basura Swamp endangers the town's access to profitable masthin shoots and dragonshards. The uneasy peace threatens to break down, renewing the conflict between settlers and lizardfolk. An alliance in Q'barra can involve disparate factions, as complex agendas bring together the Cyran diaspora, dragonmarked houses, and even the Inspired.": "蜥蜴人出现在巴苏拉沼泽的萨尔马什附近，危及到该镇对有利可图的马辛笋和龙须菜的获取。不安的和平有可能被打破，定居者和蜥蜴人之间的冲突再次爆发。Q'barra的联盟可能涉及到不同的派别，因为复杂的议程将Cyran的散居者、有龙纹的房子，甚至是启发者联系在一起。",
	"A lizardfolk lair has been discovered close to the town of Saltmarsh, threatening the town and traffic on the High Road. The dwarves of Thornhold at the southern end of the Mere of Dead Men might be concerned allies or remain distant and cautious, more wary of the machinations of the Margaster family in Waterdeep than of a few lizardfolk in the swamps. A marsh encounter with the undead of the Mere of Dead Men could replace the bullywug ambush. As an alternative location, Daggerford to the south of Waterdeep works because it already has a history with the lizardfolk.": "在靠近萨尔马什镇的地方发现了一个蜥蜴人的巢穴，威胁着该镇和公路上的交通。位于死人谷南端的索恩霍尔德的矮人可能会成为相关的盟友，或者保持距离和谨慎，他们对水底世界的玛格丽特家族的阴谋比对沼泽里的几只蜥蜴人更加警惕。在沼泽地与死人谷的亡灵相遇，可以取代恶霸的伏击。作为一个替代地点，沃特德普南部的达格福德（Daggerford）也可以，因为它已经有了与蜥蜴人的历史。",
	"Lizardfolk have been discovered in the Blight Marsh of Karameikos. Because the marsh sits on the border of the Five Shires, the halfling folk might play a larger role in the alliance. Baron von Hendriks of Fort Doom might be aware of the lizardfolk, even indirectly supporting them. As an alternative, set the adventures in Darokin's other port. Port Tenobar is larger than Saltmarsh but a good deal seedier, and the vast Malpheggi Swamp is an excellent location for lizardfolk and other creatures to hide.": "在卡拉米科斯的枯萎沼泽中发现了蜥蜴人。由于沼泽位于五郡的边界，半身人可能在联盟中发挥更大的作用。杜姆堡的冯-亨德利克斯男爵可能知道蜥蜴人，甚至间接支持他们。作为替代方案，将冒险设定在达洛金的另一个港口。特诺巴港比萨尔特马什港大，但也是个好地方，广阔的马尔菲吉沼泽是蜥蜴人和其他生物的绝佳藏身之地。",
	"Be sure not to prematurely reveal to the characters that the lizardfolk do not constitute a real threat to Saltmarsh or its inhabitants, or that the newly purchased weaponry is not for use against humanity and its allies. The characters are expected to discover the real intentions of the lizardfolk from the various clues in the adventure as they play through it. Unless their mission turns into an utter failure, they must eventually become aware that there is a war brewing between the lizardfolk (and their allies) and the sahuagin.": "请注意不要过早向人物透露蜥蜴人并不构成对萨尔马什或其居民的真正威胁，也不要透露新购买的武器不是用来对付人类及其盟友的。角色们应该在冒险过程中从各种线索中发现蜥蜴人的真正意图。除非他们的任务彻底失败，否则他们最终必须意识到蜥蜴人（和他们的盟友）与萨瓦金人之间正在酝酿一场战争。",
	"Unless indicated otherwise in a particular encounter area, the characters must not be informed about the name or nature of the sahuagin. Rather, you should provide only a general physical description of these creatures when an encounter occurs. If {@creature Oceanus|GoS} is with the party, on the other hand, he recognizes any sahuagin on sight. He has general (biased) knowledge as to their nature, and he readily identifies such creatures to the characters.": "除非在某一特定的遭遇区中另有说明，否则人物不得被告知萨瓦金的名称或性质。相反，你应该在遭遇时只提供这些生物的一般身体描述。另一方面，如果{@creature Oceanus|GoS}和队伍在一起，他能一眼认出任何萨瓦金人。他对这些生物的性质有一般的（偏颇的）了解，而且他很容易向人物识别这些生物。",
	"The inset on map 3.1 shows the location of the lizardfolk colony and features in the vicinity. (Even if the characters have not been through {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}, they still receive the map—it was given over to the town council by the individuals who defeated the smugglers.)": "地图3.1上的插图显示了蜥蜴人聚居地的位置和附近的特征。(即使人物没有通过{@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}，他们仍然会收到地图--它是由击败走私者的个人交给镇议会的。)",
	"The party can choose between two methods of traveling to the lair.": "当事人可以选择两种方法前往巢穴。",
	"The distance from Saltmarsh to the lair is about ten miles as the crow flies, and a sea journey would take about three hours in normal conditions.": "从萨尔马什到巢穴的距离，从鸦片上看大约是10英里，在正常情况下，海上航行大约需要三个小时。",
	"If the characters want to travel by sea, the council places at their disposal a modified {@vehicle keelboat} with two pairs of oars and a step-down mast, large enough to accommodate the characters and any reasonable amount of equipment they want to take with them. Navigation and propulsion of the craft is handled by two members of the town guard ({@creature Guard||guards}), who are assigned by the council to sail or row the boat. The guards do not disembark when the characters reach their destination, instead staying with the boat to keep it under their control and guard the party's return trip.": "如果人物想走海路，议会就会为他们安排一艘改装过的{@vehicle keelboat}，上面有两对船桨和一根向下的桅杆，大到足以容纳人物和他们想带的任何合理数量的装备。这艘船的航行和推进由两名镇上的卫兵（{@creature Guard||guards}）负责，他们被议会指派来开船或划船。当人物到达目的地时，卫兵并不下船，而是留在船上，将其置于自己的控制之下，并保护当事人的回程。",
	"While they are at sea, as their boat approaches the promontory, the characters see a well-traveled and relatively dry track (at the point marked {@i A} on the map) leading from the coast. It disappears into the marshland interior.": "当他们在海上时，当他们的船接近海角时，人物看到一条走得很好的、相对干燥的小路（在地图上标有（%0%）的位置）从海岸线上通向。它消失在了沼泽地的内部。",
	"Once they are within 40 feet of the promontory's northern coastline, the party spies another track running up to the middle elevations of the promontory, where it disappears behind a clump of tall grasses and brightly flowering shrubs (leading to the hidden entrance marked {@i D} on the map).": "一旦他们进入海角北部海岸线的40英尺范围内，他们就会发现另一条通往海角中间高地的轨道，它在一丛高大的草和开着鲜艳花朵的灌木后面消失了（通往地图上标有（%0%）的隐藏入口）。",
	"They also note, as they approach by sea, a 15-foot wide, 6-foot high sea cave entrance on the northeastern tip of the promontory (marked {@i E} on the map). A careful approach to the sea cave goes unnoticed until after the characters disembark and enter the entrance tunnel. Once inside {@area area 49|233|x}, they are likely to be discovered immediately.": "当他们从海上接近时，还注意到在海角的东北端有一个15英尺宽、6英尺高的海洞入口（地图上标有（%0%））。小心翼翼地接近海洞，直到人物上岸并进入入口通道后才被注意到。一旦进入（%1%），他们很可能立即被发现。",
	"The overland journey is longer because of the {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Dozens of trails follow a route roughly parallel to the coast and 100 to 400 yards away from it. Because of the terrain, it will take the party about 12 hours to travel from Saltmarsh to the ford over the Dunwater River (marked {@i B} on the map). This time does not account for resting but does allow for slow movement at times when the mist inhibits visibility. As long as the characters move at this rate, the route is easily followed—there is no risk of straying in a wrong direction.": "由于{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的原因，陆路行程更长。几十条小路沿着与海岸线大致平行的路线，离海岸线有100到400码的距离。由于地形的原因，队伍从萨尔马什到邓沃特河上的岔口（地图上标有（%%1%））大约需要12小时。这个时间不包括休息时间，但允许在雾气阻碍视线的时候缓慢移动。只要人物以这样的速度前进，路线就很容易遵循--没有走错方向的风险。",
	"From the ford, the characters can see in the distance the entrance to the cave of the giant lizards (marked {@i C} on the map, {@area area 22|1e2|x} of the lair).": "从岔路口，人物可以看到远处巨蜥洞穴的入口（在地图上标有（%0%），（%1%）的巢穴）。",
	"If the characters' route takes them through the marsh, they eventually pass close to the temporary lair of a band of bullywugs. Bullywug scouts patrol the area and, unless spotted, return to the larger group after identifying the adventurers to organize an ambush.": "如果角色们的路线是穿过沼泽地，他们最终会靠近一伙恶霸的临时巢穴。恶霸哨兵在该地区巡逻，除非被发现，否则在确定冒险者的身份后会返回大队，组织一场伏击。",
	"The bullywugs are a roving band but they have set up a defensive camp here because they have happened upon a considerable treasure. Rather than risk traveling through the swamp with their discovery, thus making themselves vulnerable to bandits or brigands, they made camp to guard the treasure until their great king could travel here from their lair ten miles away, deep in the swamp. The bullywugs dared make no move regarding the items they have found until he gives his decision on the matter.": "小霸王是一支游荡的队伍，但他们在这里建立了一个防御性营地，因为他们偶然发现了一个相当大的宝藏。他们不愿意冒险带着他们的发现穿越沼泽，从而使自己容易受到土匪或强盗的攻击，而是扎营守卫宝藏，直到他们伟大的国王从十英里外的沼泽深处的巢穴来到这里。恶霸们不敢对他们发现的物品采取任何行动，直到他对此事做出决定。",
	"The king, Gulpa'Gor, arrived the night before the party struck out into the marsh. He and his advisor, Arrp, inspected the treasure. When the king learns of the party's presence, he and Arrp stage a competition to see who can waylay the tasty interlopers.": "国王Gulpa'Gor在队伍出发到沼泽地的前一天晚上到达。他和他的顾问Arrp检查了宝藏。当国王得知队伍的存在时，他和Arrp举行了一场比赛，看谁能骗过这些美味的插队者。",
	"The party is assaulted by three waves of bullywugs:": "队伍遭到了三波恶霸的袭击。",

	"{@b Wave 2}. Arrp ({@creature bullywug croaker|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) and two {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} arrive shortly after the first wave is defeated. They make a grand show of battling the characters, and Arrp grins at the king whenever he is effective in combat.": "{@b Wave 2}. Arrp({@creature bullywug croaker|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10})和两个{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}在第一波被打败后不久就到了。他们大张旗鼓地与这些人物作战，每当国王在战斗中取得成效时，亚尔普就会对他咧嘴笑。",
	"{@b Wave 3}. Gulpa'Gor ({@creature bullywug royal|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) arrives mounted on a {@creature giant toad} shortly after Arrp and his guards are slain.": "{@b Wave 3}. Gulpa'Gor ({@creature bullywug royal|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10})在Arrp和他的卫兵被杀后不久骑着{@creature giant toad}到达。",
	"The king tries to communicate with the party with harsh croaks and aggressive gestures, boasting of his prowess in battle. A dozen more bullywugs appear at the edge of the battlefield but do not approach. An equally aggressive response from the characters, verbally or through gestures, and a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) or Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check convinces the king to retreat and take his remaining warriors with him.": "国王试图用刺耳的呱呱声和咄咄逼人的手势与队伍交流，吹嘘自己的战斗力。还有十几只恶霸出现在战场边缘，但没有靠近。角色们通过口头或手势做出同样积极的回应，并成功通过DC16魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）或魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，说服国王撤退并带着他剩下的战士一起撤退。",
	"If the king is attacked or goaded into battle (on a failed check), the other bullywugs do not interfere. His steed is trained in combat, and when allowed to act independently, it attacks the nearest enemy. Gulpa'Gor tries to skewer the characters from astride the toad's back, commanding it to move when necessary, but mostly letting it do as it pleases. The remaining bullywugs flee into the marsh if their leader dies.": "如果国王被攻击或被怂恿参加战斗（在检查失败的情况下），其他恶霸不会干预。他的骏马受过战斗训练，当被允许独立行动时，它会攻击最近的敌人。Gulpa'Gor试图从蟾蜍的背上串联起这些人物，必要时指挥它移动，但大多数时候让它随心所欲。如果它们的首领死了，剩下的恶霸蟾蜍就会逃到沼泽地里。",
	"The bullywugs' treasure consists of 325 pp and a {@item helm of underwater action|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix B|GoS|9}) in which the loose coins are contained.

	"The lizardfolk in this colony are more developed than others of their kind, as demonstrated by their ability to use sophisticated weaponry and their readiness to ally with other races when necessity dictates. They still lag behind more intelligent races, however. The construction of their lair is simplistic, employing only basic materials; most floors, walls, and ceilings are of rammed earth, and the furnishings are spartan.": "这个殖民地的蜥蜴人比其他同类更发达，这表现在他们有能力使用复杂的武器装备，并在必要时准备与其他种族结盟。然而，他们仍然落后于更多的智能种族。他们的巢穴建造得很简单，只使用了基本材料；大多数地板、墙壁和天花板都是用夯土建造的，家具也很简陋。",

They jab their weapons toward the characters threateningly and attack within 2 rounds unless the characters can convey their nonhostile intentions. If the characters can't communicate verbally, they might accomplish this with placating gestures, such as sheathing their weapons. They will certainly get their point across if they throw down their weapons in a convincing gesture of submission. In that case, the characters are bound and taken as prisoners, to await an audience with the queen.": "蜥蜴人对入侵者并不欢迎。除非队伍中有人会说Draconic语，或者角色遇到会说普通话的住户，否则蜥蜴人不会浪费时间去想角色在他们的巢穴中做什么。他们威胁性地将武器刺向角色，并在2个回合内发动攻击，除非角色能表达他们的非敌对意图。如果角色不能进行口头交流，他们可以通过安抚性的手势来实现这一目的，例如将他们的武器出鞘。如果他们扔下武器，做出令人信服的屈服姿态，他们肯定会明白自己的意思。在这种情况下，这些人物就会被捆绑起来，作为囚犯，等待女王的接见。",

Years ago, his contacts in the southern jungles reported that he could monopolize trade in rare spices and herbs by making heavy investments in the area.

He sold off many of his assets and converted the proceeds to property deeds and promissory notes, then secured that portable wealth aboard {@i Emperor of the Waves}, the foremost ship in his fleet.": "然而，奥布赖克的成功也许来得太快、太容易了；尽管他的利润最终稳定下来，但他的野心却不断扩大。几年前，他在南部丛林的联系人报告说，他可以通过在该地区进行大量投资，垄断稀有香料和药材的贸易。奥布赖克认为这个机会是肯定的，并跃跃欲试，想借此机会变得更加富有。他变卖了许多资产，并将所得款项转为财产契约和期票，然后将这些可移动的财富放在他的舰队中最重要的一艘船上（%0%）。",
	"Aubreck's plan was to convert these notes back into cash when the ship reached its destination in the south, but fate introduced a cruel twist, and {@i Emperor of the Waves} disappeared.

	"In time, the island's population became fractured into two factions, each of which tried to exterminate the other. One group claimed custody of the ship and used it as a headquarters, stocking it with supplies and defending it from assaults by the enemy group. When the war entered its final throes, the ship was in danger of being overrun by the land-based forces. In response, rather than staying and fighting it out, the cultists aboard the ship pulled up anchor—and thanks to an offshore wind, they rode the waves and left the island far behind.": "随着时间的推移，岛上的居民开始分裂成两派，每派都试图消灭对方。其中一派声称拥有这艘船，并将其作为总部，为其储备物资，并保护其免受敌方集团的攻击。当战争进入最后阶段时，这艘船面临着被陆军占领的危险。作为回应，船上的邪教徒们没有留下来战斗，而是拔起了锚--多亏了海上的风，他们乘着海浪，把这个岛远远地抛在了后面。",
	"Fifteen days ago, Aubreck received word that {@i Emperor of the Waves} had been spotted adrift in the southern sea, apparently a ghost ship.

	"{@i Salvage Operation} starts as an investigation adventure, in which the characters board {@i Emperor of the Waves} and explore its upper decks.

Characters who survive those threats and push on find the lowest holds flooded with seawater and infested with undead.": "{@i Salvage Operation}开始时是一个调查冒险，人物登上{@i Emperor of the Waves}并探索其上层甲板。当他们冒险进入船的下层时，这个场景变得更像是在狭窄、危险的空间里爬行，害虫会在近距离内攻击。在这些威胁中幸存下来并继续前进的角色发现最底层的船舱被海水淹没，并有亡灵出没。",
	"As the characters fight their way forward in search of Aubreck's goal, the perils of the sea finally take their delayed claim on the {@i Emperor}, in the form of a hungry elder octopus.

	"Aubreck has charged his half-orc butler Vertheg with finding a suitable band of adventurers for his urgent mission.

He says that the ship was recently spotted adrift, approximately five days out from land.": "奥布雷克解释说，船上有一个魔盒，里面有总价值100,000金币的期票和财产契约。他向人物提供了10%的费用（10,000金币）来收回它。为了表示诚意，他向他们提供了200gp的预付款。(即使他们尽力了，但还是没能找回盒子，奥布赖克也不能再付给他们什么了。) 他说最近有人发现这艘船在漂流，离陆地大约五天。",
	"The noble is worried that someone else might claim the ship's goods as salvage if he doesn't act quickly.

	"The sahuagin strike first at any sentries. Typically, {@dice 1d4 + 4} dwarves from the crew are stationed on the deck at night as lookouts.

	"Manned by a crew of sturdy dwarves, {@i Soul of Winter} is a sailing ship run by her captain, Wolgar Windrune (LN male dwarf {@creature veteran}). To keep the characters from impeding his crew, he insists that they remain in their quarters, a cramped chamber below deck, during the voyage. The crew consists of thirty dwarf {@creature Guard||guards}, all of whom remain aboard {@i Soul of Winter} during the adventure, since they have not been paid for anything other than transport.": "{@i Soul of Winter}是一艘由强壮的矮人船员驾驶的帆船，船长是沃尔加-温德鲁恩（LN男矮人{@creature veteran}）。为了不让人物妨碍他的船员，他坚持让他们在航行中呆在自己的住处--甲板下一个狭窄的房间。船员们由30个矮人（%2%）组成，他们在冒险期间都留在船上（%3%），因为他们除了运输之外没有得到任何报酬。",

	"After several days at sea, {@i Soul of Winter} comes in sight of the looming, shattered hulk of the derelict {@i Emperor of the Waves}. Wolgar Windrune brings {@i Soul of Winter} within 500 feet of the derelict along its starboard side, close enough to make out its major external features. Its masts have been shorn off, but the upper deck appears clear of debris, as if whatever hit the ship was strong enough to carry off the masts, sails, and rigging. Its figurehead, once a majestic angel in flight, has been hacked and disfigured.": "在海上航行数日后，{@i Soul of Winter}看到了被遗弃的{@i Emperor of the Waves}残破的船体。沃尔加-温德鲁恩（Wolgar Windrune）沿着右舷把{@i Soul of Winter}带到离废弃船500英尺以内的地方，近到足以看清它的主要外部特征。它的桅杆已经被砍掉了，但上层甲板上似乎没有碎片，仿佛不管是什么东西撞击了这艘船，都足以把桅杆、船帆和索具带走。它的头像，曾经是一个雄伟的飞行天使，已经被砍掉了，毁坏了。",
	"Captain Wolgar and the sailors aboard {@i Soul of Winter} express amazement that the {@i Emperor} is still afloat.

The vessel lists noticeably to port, evidence that the {@i Emperor}'s ballast has shifted, though the incline doesn't appear severe enough to make moving around on deck hazardous. The ship rides low in the water, implying that the bilge and possibly even the lowest deck are flooded. If no characters have the appropriate background or proficiency, Wolgar can point these facts out. The captain also makes it clear that he suspects the ship is likely to sink during the ten days it would take to tow it back to port.": "沃尔加船长和{@i Soul of Winter}号上的水手们对{@i Emperor}号仍然漂浮在海上表示惊讶。任何有水手背景或精通水上交通工具的人物都会注意到，这艘船的上层甲板遭受了严重的损坏，与台风或潮汐的影响一致。这艘船明显向左倾斜，证明(2%)的压舱物已经移位，虽然倾斜度似乎没有严重到让人在甲板上移动的地步。这艘船在水中的位置很低，这意味着底舱甚至是最低的甲板都被淹没了。如果没有角色有相应的背景或熟练程度，沃尔加可以指出这些事实。船长还明确表示，他怀疑这艘船有可能在将其拖回港口的十天内沉没。",

	"Over the past three months, the evil clerics of Abbey Isle have quarreled violently with a large band of local pirates. Their struggle seems to have left the island uninhabited. The pirates burned the abbey to the ground, but they suffered so many casualties that they were destroyed in turn by the local mariners' guild.": "在过去的三个月里，修道院岛的邪恶教士与当地一大群海盗发生了激烈的争吵。他们的斗争似乎让这个岛变得无人问津。海盗们把修道院烧成了灰烬，但他们伤亡惨重，以至于被当地的海员公会反过来消灭。",

	"The isle has long been a source of trouble for the region's mariners' guild.

Use either of the following additional hooks to strengthen the characters' motivation to succeed.": "该岛长期以来一直是该地区航海家协会的麻烦来源。居住在岛上修道院的神职人员被证明是他们领土的有力捍卫者--在海盗最近的成功之前，公会所有将神职人员驱逐出岛的尝试都失败了。使用以下任何一个附加钩子来加强人物的成功动机。",
	"The clerics of the abbey would not build such a defense to guard musty tomes and simple acolytes. Something precious rests in the belly of that place: a golden statue, a staff made from rubies, or a fountain lined with pearls and rare stones.

With both pirates and clerics out of the picture, only a few undead stand in the way of untold riches.": "修道院的教士们不会为了守护发霉的书本和简单的圣徒而建造这样的防御。那地方的腹地里安放着一些珍贵的东西：一尊金色的雕像，一根由红宝石制成的法杖，或者一个衬有珍珠和稀有宝石的喷泉。那些无助的海盗们开辟了一条道路，但没有发现任何宝藏。随着海盗和神职人员的退出，只有一些亡灵挡在了难以计数的财富面前。",
	"The stretch of water near Abbey Isle is treacherous. The thick fog that rolls through this region sends even the most steadily steered ships veering off course.

	"On Khorvaire the isle is located on the north coast of Karrnath. The local mariners are keen to have a bastion against Lhazaar pirates, but the gold they offer comes, indirectly and deniably, from the coffers of King Kaius.

Entanglement with the Order of the Emerald Claw will surely follow.": "在Khorvaire，该岛位于Karrnath的北海岸。当地的水手们非常希望有一个对抗拉扎尔海盗的堡垒，但他们提供的黄金是间接地、不可否认地来自凯乌斯国王的国库。国王很想摆脱沃尔之血的影响。摧毁岛上的邪教肯定会引起深红圣约的注意，甚至可能是埃兰迪斯-德-沃尔本人。与翡翠之爪骑士团的纠葛肯定会随之而来。",
	"Abbey Isle lies off the west coast of the Dragon Reach, and a mariners' guild from the Dalelands would like to control the island to help them defend against raiders from Pirate Isle in the Sea of Fallen Stars.

If the cult is routed from the island, the characters might gain unwanted attention from what remains of Netheril.": "阿比岛位于龙脉的西海岸，一个来自达利兰的水手公会希望控制该岛，以帮助他们抵御来自堕落星海的海盗岛的袭击者。一个致力于Shar的邪教组织，是尼瑟斯人占领时期的一个孤立的残余，已经在岛上生活了一段时间。如果这个邪教组织被击溃，人物可能会从尼瑟尔的遗迹中获得不必要的关注。",
	"The Minrothad Guilds are always interested in consolidating their power on the sea and would be glad to wrest control of the island away from the cult that holds it. Due to interference from the Thieves' Guild, the scholars of North Isle have had little luck convincing the guilds to help. As a result, they have hired mercenaries to remove the threat on the Abbey Isle, located between North Isle and Fire Island. The cult could be followers of Alphaks, inspiring Thyatian privateers to set out from Terentias and brave Minrothad territory to wipe out the renegade cult.": "Minrothad行会总是对巩固他们在海上的权力感兴趣，并且很乐意将岛屿的控制权从掌握它的邪教手中夺过来。由于盗贼公会的干扰，北岛的学者们在说服公会帮忙方面运气不佳。因此，他们雇佣了雇佣兵来消除位于北岛和火岛之间的修道院岛的威胁。该邪教可能是阿尔法克斯的追随者，激发了蒂亚特的私掠者从泰伦提斯出发，勇敢地前往明罗萨德的领地消灭这个叛逆的邪教。",
	"The actual jumping-off point for the mission is an island located up the coast. Getting there in the rowboat takes about six hours. This island has a lighthouse that the characters can use as a safe place when they want to rest, reequip, or regroup. Abbey Isle is another two hours beyond the lighthouse.": "任务的实际跳伞点是位于海岸线上的一个岛屿。乘坐划艇到达那里大约需要六个小时。这个岛有一个灯塔，当他们想休息、重新装备或重新组合时，可以把它作为一个安全的地方。艾比岛在灯塔之后还有两个小时。",
	"The lighthouse where the characters begin the adventure is manned by a retired officer named Major Ursa. The major (LG male human {@creature veteran}) is a huge, barrel-chested man with a bright red beard and a circlet of thin red-gray hair on his balding head. His usual garb is a gaudy red and yellow kilt with his warhammer and dagger hanging from a broad leather belt.": "人物开始冒险的灯塔由一位名叫乌尔萨少校的退休军官看守。少校（LG男性人类{@creature veteran}）是一个巨大的、桶状胸膛的男人，留着鲜红的胡须，秃顶的头上有一圈稀疏的红灰色头发。他通常的服装是一件艳丽的红色和黄色的短裙，宽大的皮带上挂着他的战斧和匕首。",
	"The major now lives, and enjoys, the solitary life of a lighthouse keeper. He is a respected member of the mariners' guild. If the major is attacked by the party, the local citizenry rallies to his defense. The mariners' guild quickly places a bounty on the party, and the adventurers become hunted criminals. The major does not have the guild's reward money or anything of value (other than food, drink, and nautical equipment) at the lighthouse.": "少校现在过着并享受着灯塔看守人的孤独生活。他是一个受人尊敬的航海家协会成员。如果少校受到党的攻击，当地的公民会团结起来保卫他。海员公会很快就对这支队伍进行了悬赏，而冒险者们也成了被追捕的罪犯。少校在灯塔里没有公会的赏金或任何有价值的东西（除了食物、饮料和航海设备）。",

	"\"The only safe place to get ashore on the reef-ringed, rocky little island is a large sandy beach known as the Skull Dunes.

	"\"The pirates got ashore somehow. There's probably a path through the undead, but finding it's the problem. We didn't catch up with the pirates till after they'd left the island. They'd taken as good as they gave. They were a miserable, sorry lot when we attacked and routed what was left of them. One shipload escaped, but we sank the others. The sea and the sharks got the survivors, so we never got a firsthand account of what happened on the island or of how the pirates got through the dunes.\"": "\"海盗们不知怎么上岸了。可能有一条穿过亡灵的道路，但找到它是个问题。我们是在海盗离岛后才追上他们的。他们取之不尽，用之不竭。当我们攻击并击溃他们剩下的部分时，他们是一个可怜的、令人遗憾的群体。有一船人逃脱了，但其他的都被我们击沉了。大海和鲨鱼抓住了幸存者，所以我们从来没有得到关于岛上发生的事情或海盗如何穿过沙丘的第一手资料。\"",
	"\"As for the abbey, who knows for sure? We never got anywhere near the place. Smoke rose from the island for days after the pirates attacked. Maybe that means the island's been abandoned, or maybe the abbey burned and the clerics are waiting to rebuild. I don't know.

	"Major Ursa serves as a conduit when you want to give information to the players, particularly if they retreat from the Skull Dunes and return to the lighthouse. The major can offer suggestions and occasional helpful hints. These hints should not be given on demand, and the major might not have advice on every subject. The major's suggestions concerning the tactical situation on the island depend on how much information the party gives him about the island, its inhabitants, and its traps and monsters.": "当你想给玩家提供信息时，尤其是当他们从骷髅沙丘撤退并返回灯塔时，乌尔萨少校会充当一个渠道。少校可以提供建议和偶尔的有用提示。这些提示不应该按要求提供，而且少校不一定对每个问题都有建议。少校关于岛上战术情况的建议取决于党派给他提供了多少关于这个岛、岛上的居民以及陷阱和怪物的信息。",
	"For example, questions such as \"How do we get through the tunnels underneath the ruins?\" are inappropriate because the major has no way of knowing about the tunnels under the abbey. The party must first describe the tunnels (see \"{@area The Winding Way|2da|x}\") and the situation there before the major can help them.": "例如，诸如 \"我们如何通过废墟下的隧道？\"这样的问题是不合适的，因为少校没有办法知道修道院下的隧道。当事人必须首先描述隧道（见\"（%0%）\"）和那里的情况，然后少校才能帮助他们。",

	"The island is little more than a slab of rock rising from the ocean. The sea has battered its crumbling cliffs so that almost the entire island is surrounded by dangerous rocky shoals. The waves crashing and splashing over the jagged rocks make it obvious, even to landlubbers, that any attempt to navigate the shoals can only end in disaster.": "该岛只不过是一块从海洋中升起的岩石板。海水冲击着破碎的悬崖，所以几乎整个岛屿都被危险的岩石滩涂所包围。海浪在嶙峋的岩石上拍打和飞溅，即使对内陆人来说，也很明显，任何试图在浅滩上航行的尝试都只能以灾难告终。",
	"In fact, there is no reason to pass through the dangerous rocks, because the granite cliffs beyond them rise directly out of the water, offering no place to land or come ashore. Only the sandy area at the southernmost tip of the island offers a safe place to land a boat (see \"The Skull Dunes\").": "事实上，没有理由通过这些危险的岩石，因为岩石之外的花岗岩悬崖直接升出水面，没有地方可以登陆或上岸。只有岛的最南端的沙地提供了一个安全的地方让船登陆（见 \"骷髅沙丘\"）。",
	"The island has little wildlife but is covered in grass, small flowering plants, and a few gnarled, stunted trees and shrubs. What few animals there are on the island were imported by the clerics, either deliberately or accidentally, when they arrived and built the abbey. Some other more dangerous creatures have also come ashore recently.": "岛上没有什么野生动物，但却长满了草、小花草，以及一些参差不齐的矮树和灌木。岛上为数不多的动物是教士们来到这里建造修道院时有意或无意地引进的。最近还有一些更危险的生物也上岸了。",
	"The Skull Dunes (see map 5.2) lie beyond a beach of coarse brown sand at the southern end of the island. The dunes are desolate; only an occasional bit of scraggly grass grows here and there in the sandy hollows. When the abbey was built, the evil clerics populated the dunes with hundreds of skeletons brought from the mainland for the defense of the island. The overlord of the abbey carried a special scepter that allowed its holder to safely pass through the dunes, but this scepter was destroyed in the fire that razed the abbey.": "骷髅头沙丘（见地图5.2）位于岛的南端粗棕色沙子的海滩之外。沙丘很荒凉；只有在沙地的凹陷处偶尔长出一点乱七八糟的草。修道院建成后，邪恶的教士们在沙丘上摆放了数百具从大陆带来的骷髅，用于防御岛屿。修道院的霸主带着一根特殊的权杖，允许持有者安全通过沙丘，但这根权杖在夷平修道院的大火中被毁。",
	"The skeletons now form an uncontrolled minefield of undead. When anyone passes near, the undead rush up out of the sand and attack. The skeletons are impossible to avoid by stealth because they can detect intruders by noise, vibrations caused by movement, and pressure on the sand. When the pirates landed here, the skeletons made them pay dearly, but the pirates eventually cleared a path through the undead and pushed on to the abbey.": "这些骷髅现在形成了一个不受控制的亡灵雷区。当有人走近时，亡灵就会从沙地里冲出来，进行攻击。骷髅不可能通过隐身来躲避，因为它们可以通过噪音、运动引起的振动和沙地上的压力来探测入侵者。当海盗们在这里登陆时，骷髅让他们付出了惨重的代价，但海盗们最终在亡灵中开辟了一条道路，并继续向修道院推进。",
	"When the characters enter the dunes, use the map to keep track of their location. Assume that the party lands at the southernmost tip of the dunes (in the square south of the number 12) unless the characters decide otherwise. When the characters first come ashore, the hills of sand are smooth and trackless, and the loose sand counts as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. As the characters soon discover, the dunes are filled with skeletons that awaken and attack when anything treads on the sand above them.": "当人物进入沙丘时，使用地图来追踪他们的位置。假设一行人在沙丘的最南端（数字12以南的方块）登陆，除非人物另有决定。当人物刚上岸时，沙丘是光滑的，没有痕迹，松散的沙子算作（%0%）。角色们很快就发现，沙丘上到处都是骷髅，只要有东西踩到上面的沙子，它们就会被唤醒并攻击。",
	"Use the following rules to play out the Skull Dunes encounter with the help of the map, using a single token or miniature to represent the characters in the square they occupy. Each square is 150 feet on a side. Moving between squares can be done only across sides and not on a diagonal path.": "在地图的帮助下，使用以下规则来进行骷髅沙丘的遭遇战，用一个令牌或小模型来代表他们所占方格中的角色。每个方格的边长为150英尺。方块之间的移动只能跨边进行，不能走对角线。",
	"Before they start moving, the characters can attempt to find the clear path. The party must select one character to lead the way. That character makes a single Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. The check result is the number of squares along the pirates' path that the characters travel. After that many squares, the characters stumble into a randomly determined square with skeletons in it. Choose a random, skeleton-occupied square that has a side in common with the last safe square the characters entered. If the party navigates its way across the dunes and slays fewer than twenty skeletons while doing so, the adventurers arrive safely on the north edge of the map.": "在他们开始行动之前，人物可以尝试找到清晰的道路。队伍必须选择一个角色来带路。该人物进行一次智慧（（%0%））检查。检查的结果是人物沿着海盗的道路所走的格子数。在走了这么多格子之后，角色们会偶然进入一个随机确定的有骷髅的格子。选择一个随机的、被骷髅占据的方格，该方格与角色进入的最后一个安全方格有一个共同的边。如果一行人顺利穿过沙丘，并且在此过程中杀死了少于20个骷髅，那么冒险者就会安全到达地图的北边。",
	"If the characters enter an unmarked square, nothing happens. If they enter a square marked with a number, they are immediately attacked by that number of {@creature Skeleton||skeletons}. To begin an encounter, the skeletons rise from the sand, expending half of their movement on their first turn. They are encrusted with sand but unhindered by it, so they retain their normal speed while in the dunes.": "如果人物进入一个没有标记的方块，就不会发生任何事情。如果他们进入一个标有数字的方格，他们会立即受到该数字（%0%）的攻击。为了开始一场遭遇战，骷髅们从沙地上爬起来，在他们的第一个回合中消耗一半的移动量。它们被沙子包裹着，但不受沙子的阻碍，所以它们在沙丘中时保持正常的速度。",
	"For example: The characters enter a numbered square marked \"7.\" Seven skeletons rise and defend that square until they are destroyed. Once all the skeletons in a square have been destroyed, that square is cleared of buried skeletons (but other skeletons could still pursue the party into that square).": "比如说。人物进入一个标有 \"7 \"的数字广场。七个骷髅升起并保卫该广场，直到它们被摧毁。一旦一个广场上的所有骷髅被消灭，该广场上的埋葬的骷髅就被清除了（但其他的骷髅仍然可以追击进入该广场的队伍）。",
	"The characters continue to move, one square at a time, awakening skeletons and defending themselves until they navigate their way across the dunes to safety, or slay twenty or more skeletons. Once they slay twenty or more skeletons, phase two begins.": "角色们继续移动，一次一个方格，唤醒骷髅并保护自己，直到他们穿过沙丘到达安全地带，或者杀死20个或更多的骷髅。一旦他们杀死了20个或更多的骷髅，第二阶段就开始了。",
	"All the skeletons within 2 squares of the party animate and attack. Rather than assail the characters individually, half the risen skeletons form three {@creature Skeletal Swarm|GoS|skeletal swarms} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}), while the other half coalesce into a {@creature skeletal juggernaut|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}). The swarms begin combat within 60 feet of the party, while the juggernaut begins combat 240 feet from the party.

	"The skeletal guardians of the Skull Dunes do not pursue characters into water deeper than 3 feet. Seawater does them no harm—they have simply not been ordered to defend that area. Thus, characters who decide to come ashore and then wade around the shore in the area of the dunes might be able to avoid the skeletons, or at least minimize their contact with them.": "骷髅沙丘的骷髅守护者不会追击水深超过3英尺的人物。海水对他们没有任何伤害--他们只是没有被命令去保卫那个区域。因此，决定上岸后在沙丘区域的岸边涉水的角色可能会避开这些骷髅，或者至少将与它们的接触降到最低。",
	"If the characters try to circumvent the Skull Dunes altogether by scaling the cliffs, they find plenty of natural footholds and handholds that climbers can use when making their ascent. The danger comes from the slick mixture of water and algae coating the face of the cliff. The top of the cliffs is 45 feet from the water. Climbing a 15-foot section of the cliff requires a successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check; a failed check means a creature falls into the jagged rocks along the shore, taking falling damage as normal, and additional slashing damage from the sharp rocks equal to the falling damage.": "如果人物试图通过攀登悬崖来完全绕过骷髅沙丘，他们会发现有很多天然的立足点和抓手，攀登者在上升时可以使用。危险来自涂在悬崖表面的水和藻类的滑腻混合物。悬崖的顶部离水面有45英尺。攀登悬崖的15英尺部分需要成功地进行DC12力量（（%0%））检查；检查失败意味着生物会掉入岸边的锯齿状岩石中，受到正常的坠落伤害，以及来自尖锐岩石的相当于坠落伤害的额外砍伤。",
	"The skeletons of the Skull Dunes wait for the characters to make the first aggressive move. If you see fit, use the table below to introduce additional menace.": "骷髅沙丘的骷髅们等待着人物做出第一个攻击性动作。如果你认为合适，可以使用下表来引入额外的威胁。",
	"Three {@creature Manticore||manticores} that lair on a nearby coast swoop down to attack. They use the skeletons to help finish off land-based prey by landing in a square infested with them, then flying off as they emerge.": "三只（%0%）在附近的海岸上筑巢，俯冲下来攻击。它们利用骷髅来帮助解决陆地上的猎物，在有骷髅出没的地方降落，然后在它们出现时飞走。",
	"The surge of necromantic energy caused by the skeletons' awakening draws {@dice 4d10} {@creature Zombie||zombies} of slain pirates out of the waters and toward the beach.": "骷髅的苏醒所带来的澎湃的亡灵能量，将被杀死的海盗从水中吸引出来，并向海滩移动。",

	"The pirate attack on the abbey came as a complete surprise to the clerics, since the pirates and clerics were previously in league with each other. The pirates fenced much of their booty through the clerics, who shipped the goods to distant temples where they could be sold without being recognized as stolen merchandise.": "海盗对修道院的袭击让神职人员完全感到意外，因为海盗和神职人员之前是相互勾结的。海盗们通过神职人员将他们的大部分战利品销赃，而神职人员则将货物运到遥远的寺庙，在那里出售，不会被人认出是赃物。",
	"The Abbey Isle clerics often cheated the pirates on these clandestine deals. The pirates grumbled about the poor treatment they received, but they issued no ultimatums to alter the arrangements. Although the two groups had their differences, the clerics never expected the pirates to rebel, confident in their undead defenses even if they did.": "阿贝岛的神职人员经常在这些秘密交易中欺骗海盗。海盗们对他们受到的恶劣待遇怨声载道，但他们没有发出最后通牒来改变这些安排。虽然这两个团体有分歧，但教士们从未指望海盗们会反叛，即使他们反叛，他们也对自己的不死防线充满信心。",
	"Unfortunately for the clerics, the pirates had enough numbers to barely make it through the skeleton horde. After suffering considerable losses against the undead, they proved to be in such a vengeful mood that they set fire to the abbey. With the structure aflame, they didn't bother looting the building or searching for the cellars being buried by the burning debris.": "对教士们来说，不幸的是，海盗们的人数足以勉强通过骷髅部落。在对阵亡灵时遭受了相当大的损失后，他们证明了自己的复仇心态，他们放火烧了修道院。随着建筑被烧毁，他们没有费心去抢劫建筑，也没有去寻找被燃烧的瓦砾掩埋的地窖。",
	"After the battle, the pirates gathered what loot they could and abandoned the ruins, unaware that they were leaving survivors behind. When the smoldering wreckage cooled, the survivors made their way out through the rubble.": "战斗结束后，海盗们收集了他们所能得到的战利品并放弃了废墟，他们没有意识到他们留下了幸存者。当冒烟的残骸冷却后，幸存者从废墟中走了出来。",
	"A few of the abbey's clerics and guards survived the pirate attack and now live a spartan life in the ruins. They made rough accommodations in the abbey's cellars. The abbey's vegetable garden and a few barrels of salted pork also survived the pirate attack. The survivors {@creature fish|GoS} from the lower cliffs and raise buckets of seawater up the cliffs by rope. By casting {@spell purify food and drink} on the seawater, the abbey's clerics create enough water for their drinking, cooking, washing, and gardening needs.": "修道院的少数教士和卫兵在海盗袭击中幸存下来，现在在废墟中过着简朴的生活。他们在修道院的地窖里做了粗糙的住宿。修道院的菜园和几桶咸猪肉也在海盗袭击中幸存下来。幸存者{@creature fish|GoS}从较低的悬崖上，用绳子把一桶桶海水提升到悬崖上。通过对海水施放{@spell purify food and drink}，修道院的神职人员创造了足够的水来满足他们的饮用、烹饪、洗涤和园艺需求。",
	"The survivors have no boat and no means of building one. The island's few stunted trees and gnarled bushes are incapable of supplying the wood for even a crude canoe or raft. The survivors have no control over the undead of the Skull Dunes and would have to fight their way through the skeletons to launch a boat (they are unaware of the path made by the pirates).": "幸存者没有船，也没有办法建造一艘船。岛上为数不多的发育不良的树木和参天的灌木丛无法提供木材，甚至无法建造一个粗糙的独木舟或筏子。幸存者无法控制骷髅沙丘上的亡灵，他们必须在骷髅堆里拼命挣扎才能下船（他们不知道海盗开出的道路）。",
	"The survivors keep a low profile. They stay close to the ruins of the abbey and keep out of sight of passing boats. They do not hail ships or light signal fires. Trapped on the island since the pirate attack, they are unaware that the pirates have been destroyed. They are therefore hesitant to make their presence known for fear the pirates will return and finish them off.": "幸存者们保持低调。他们紧贴着修道院的废墟，避开过往船只的视线。他们不呼唤船只或点燃信号火。自从海盗袭击后，他们被困在岛上，不知道海盗已经被消灭。因此，他们不愿意让人知道他们的存在，因为他们担心海盗会回来把他们干掉。",
	"Even though the survivors desperately want to leave the island, their superiors would not approve of their abandoning the island to the mariners. The clerics and the surviving guards would be severely punished (perhaps by death) if they left. Therefore, they have resolved to capture or kill anyone coming to the island. If any of the characters are captured, they are kept alive only if they can be used in negotiations to extract a ransom. Ransom demands are likely to include a boat or at least transportation to the mainland.": "尽管幸存者急切地想离开这个岛，但他们的上级不会同意他们把这个岛抛弃给海员。如果他们离开，神职人员和幸存的卫兵将受到严厉的惩罚（也许是死亡）。因此，他们决心抓捕或杀死任何来到岛上的人。如果有任何人物被抓，只有在他们能被用于谈判以获得赎金的情况下，他们才会被保留生命。赎金要求很可能包括一艘船或至少是前往大陆的交通工具。",
	"The survivors' main goal is to get word to their superiors while still retaining possession of the island. They have sent missives by means of {@spell sending} and {@spell animal messenger} spells (using seagulls), but they have received no response. Nonetheless, they still hope to be sent reinforcements, laborers, and material for rebuilding the abbey.": "幸存者的主要目标是将消息传给他们的上级，同时仍然保持对该岛的占有。他们通过{@spell sending}和{@spell animal messenger}的法术(使用海鸥)发送了信件，但他们没有收到任何回应。尽管如此，他们仍然希望能得到增援、劳工和重建修道院的材料。",
	"They typically keep watch on the Skull Dunes during the day, but have grown lax in that duty as boredom and hunger overtake them. Therefore, there is a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance that the characters will land unseen at the Skull Dunes during the day. The survivors do not keep watch at night, meaning that the party has a {@chance 100|100 percent} chance of landing unnoticed when it's dark.": "他们通常在白天对骷髅沙丘进行监视，但由于无聊和饥饿，他们对这一职责越来越松懈。因此，有百分之零点几的几率，角色会在白天不被发现地降落在骷髅沙丘上。幸存者们在晚上不守夜，这意味着在天黑时，队伍有{@chance 100|100 percent}的机会在无人注意的情况下登陆。",
	"During the day, the survivors might be above ground getting water, fishing, or gardening, or they might be in {@area area 2|2bf|x} of the ruins. At night they stay in their rooms.": "白天，幸存者可能在地面上取水、捕鱼或园艺，也可能在（%0%）的废墟中。晚上，他们呆在自己的房间里。",
	"The major personalities among the survivors are detailed below.": "幸存者中的主要人物详见下文。",
	"Ozymandias (NE male human {@creature priest}) barely survived the battle against the pirates because he tried to rescue important books and scrolls from the burning abbey, and a collapsing hall closed a doorway behind him. He was forced to abandon the written works, and he escaped only after a wall collapsed and provided him with an escape route.": "奥兹曼迪亚斯（NE男性人类（%0%））在与海盗的战斗中勉强活了下来，因为他试图从燃烧的修道院中拯救重要的书籍和卷轴，而坍塌的大厅在他身后关闭了一个门洞。他被迫放弃了这些书面作品，在一堵墙倒塌并为他提供了一条逃生通道后，他才得以逃脱。",
	"Ozymandias is now the highest-ranking cleric and the leader of the survivors. He is a capable administrator, but he does not inspire loyalty or trust in those under him. Underlings obey him because of the hierarchical structure of the abbey's chain of command, not because he shows any strong leadership. If attacked, he defends himself to the best of his abilities. If the characters attempt to negotiate, Ozymandias is treacherous and unlikely to keep any agreement (except at sword point). He wants to get word of the abbey's destruction to the mainland, and he hopes to hold the island until help arrives.": "奥兹曼迪亚斯现在是最高级别的教士，也是幸存者的领袖。他是一个有能力的管理者，但他并没有激发手下人的忠诚和信任。下属服从他是因为修道院指挥系统的等级结构，而不是因为他表现出任何强有力的领导。如果受到攻击，他就会尽其所能地保护自己。如果人物试图进行谈判，奥兹曼迪亚斯是个奸诈的人，不太可能遵守任何协议（除了在剑尖上）。他想把修道院被毁的消息传到大陆，他希望能守住这个岛，直到救援到来。",
	"Ozymandias wears a special golden medallion (see the sidebar) that allows safe passage through the undead guardians of the Winding Way (the tunnels below the abbey ruin). As the highest-ranking cleric on the island, Ozymandias wears the medallion as a symbol of his faith, but he doesn't know about its special property or about the dangers of the Winding Way.": "奥兹曼迪亚斯佩戴着一枚特殊的金色徽章（见边栏），可以安全通过蜿蜒之路（修道院废墟下面的隧道）的亡灵守护者。作为岛上地位最高的教士，奥兹曼迪亚斯将这枚徽章作为自己信仰的象征来佩戴，但他不知道这枚徽章的特殊属性，也不知道蜿蜒之路的危险性。",
	"This medallion is a golden disk inscribed with complex geometric designs, worth 30 gp. It is not magical, but undead of the Winding Way recognize it and allow anyone who possesses the medallion, plus their companions, to pass safely unless the undead are attacked. Only the undead guardians recognize the medallion, and it cannot be used for safe passage past traps or other guardians in the Winding Way, or for protection from any other undead on or off the island. The undead do not obey orders from a character who wears the medallion.": "这个奖章是一个刻有复杂几何图案的金色圆盘，价值30金币。它没有魔力，但是蜿蜒之路的亡灵会认出它，并允许任何拥有徽章的人，加上他们的同伴，安全通过，除非亡灵受到攻击。只有亡灵守护者认识这个徽章，它不能用于安全通过陷阱或绕道中的其他守护者，也不能用于保护岛内或岛外的任何其他亡灵。亡灵不服从戴着徽章的角色的命令。",
	"Odium (NE male human {@creature cult fanatic}) was visiting the abbey on business when the pirates attacked. He gave a brave account of himself during the battle, though he survived by sheer chance. He ran through the burning building to save his spell scrolls and other valuables. As the flames mounted, Odium was forced to retreat to the cellars with his rescued goods.": "Odium (NE男性人类{@creature cult fanatic})在海盗袭击时正在修道院出差。他在战斗中勇敢地讲述了自己的情况，尽管他纯粹是靠运气活下来的。他跑过燃烧的建筑，以拯救他的法术卷轴和其他贵重物品。随着火焰的加剧，奥姆被迫带着他救出的货物退到地窖里。",
	"He is a grumbler and annoys everyone with his constant griping. Odium and Ozymandias dislike each other intensely. If one gets into trouble, the other will do nothing to help.": "他是个爱抱怨的人，不断地发牢骚让大家都很烦。奥迪姆和奥兹曼迪亚斯非常不喜欢对方。如果一个人遇到了麻烦，另一个人就会袖手旁观。",
	"Odium desperately wants to leave the island and get on with his life. If the characters do not attack Odium immediately, they might be able to strike a deal with him. He will draw a rough map of the abbey ruins in return for 200 gp and safe passage off the island. (If this occurs, you should provide only a rough map of the cellars without including the Winding Way.) Odium refuses to join the party in a fight against the other survivors.": "Odium急切地想离开这个岛，继续他的生活。如果角色们不立即攻击奥姆，他们也许能与他达成交易。他将绘制一张修道院废墟的粗略地图，以换取200金币和离开该岛的安全通道。(如果出现这种情况，你应该只提供地窖的粗略地图，而不包括蜿蜒之路。) 奥伊姆拒绝加入派对与其他幸存者的战斗。",
	"Bayleaf (LE male elf {@creature bard|VGM}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) is a mercenary who works for the highest bidder. He was hired by the abbey as a training instructor for the guards. If the party does not attack him immediately, negotiation is possible. Bayleaf can be bought off for 500 gp and safe passage off the island. He does not draw a map for the party or help them attack his former employers, but he does tell them there are treasure-filled tunnels beneath the abbey. If pressed, Bayleaf admits that the treasure is guarded (true) and claims it is worth 10,000 gp (false).": "贝利夫（LE男精灵{@creature bard|VGM}；见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）是一个为出价最高者工作的雇佣兵。他被修道院雇用为卫兵的训练教官。如果当事人不立即攻击他，可以进行谈判。贝利夫可以用500金币和安全通道离开该岛来收买他。他没有为队伍绘制地图，也没有帮助他们攻击他的前雇主，但他确实告诉他们在修道院下面有充满宝藏的隧道。如果被追问，贝里夫承认宝藏被看守着（真），并声称它价值10,000金币（假）。",
	"Bayleaf is an excellent swordsman and an above-average tactician in small skirmishes. Ozymandias placed him in charge of defending the cellars. If Bayleaf is captured, killed, or bribed, defense of the cellars becomes a hectic, haphazard affair.": "贝利夫是一个优秀的剑客，在小规模的冲突中是一个高于平均水平的战术家。奥兹曼迪亚斯让他负责保卫地窖的工作。如果贝利夫被抓、被杀或被收买，地窖的防卫就会变成一件忙碌而杂乱无章的事情。",
	"Ogmund (CE male human {@creature gladiator}) is a huge, stupid, mean-spirited fighter. In battle he is awesome, wielding his spear untiringly. During the battle with the pirates, a blow from a warhammer knocked him unconscious. He was left for dead and later dragged to safety by clerics retreating to the cellars. He is embarrassed that he did not die in the battle and will not make that mistake twice.": "奥格蒙德（CE男性人类（%0%））是一个巨大、愚蠢、刻薄的战士。在战斗中他很厉害，不知疲倦地挥舞着他的长矛。在与海盗的战斗中，战锤的一击把他打晕了。他被丢在一边等死，后来被撤退到地窖的神职人员拖到了安全地带。他为自己没有在战斗中死去而感到尴尬，不会再犯这种错误了。",
	"There is no negotiating with Ogmund. His demands are simple: surrender or fight. As a tactician, Ogmund is wholly wanting. He is likely to overlook the simplest of ambush opportunities, and his only offensive tactic is a headlong frontal attack. Ogmund believes he should oversee the defense of the island and resents Bayleaf's presence. He gladly leaves the elf in the lurch if the chance to do so arises.": "与奥格蒙德没有谈判的余地。他的要求很简单：投降或战斗。作为一个战术家，奥格蒙德是完全不合格的。他可能会忽略最简单的伏击机会，而他唯一的进攻策略就是正面进攻。奥格蒙德认为他应该监督岛屿的防御，并对贝利夫的存在感到不满。如果有机会的话，他很乐意把精灵留在身边。",
	"The remnants of the abbey's faithful (two {@creature Acolyte||acolytes} and two {@creature Cultist||cultists}) are not a particularly spirited lot. After the devastating loss to the pirates, they are not eager to join battle with anyone. These low-level clerks and helpers survived the battle and the burning of the abbey by hiding in the cellars. Although the heat, smoke, and lack of fresh air might have killed the disciples in a well-sealed room, the cellars of the abbey are riddled with small rat passages and ventilation shafts that pulled air in from the outside, keeping the heat and smoke radiating upward and permitting the disciples and their guards to survive the flames.": "修道院的残余信徒（两个{@creature Acolyte||acolytes}和两个{@creature Cultist||cultists}）并不是一个特别有精神的人。在遭受海盗的破坏性损失后，他们并不急于与任何人加入战斗。这些低级文员和帮手躲在地窖里，在战斗和烧毁修道院的过程中幸存下来。虽然高温、浓烟和缺乏新鲜空气可能会让门徒们在一个密封良好的房间里丧命，但修道院的地窖里布满了小老鼠通道和通风井，从外面把空气拉进来，让高温和浓烟一直向上辐射，允许门徒们和他们的卫兵在火焰中生存。",
	"The disciples perform only the functions needed for the survival of the group. They fight only if necessary and surrender at the first opportunity if any fight turns against them. If questioned, they know very little about the island and the abbey.": "门徒们只履行团体生存所需的职能。他们只在必要时战斗，如果任何战斗转向对他们不利，他们会在第一时间投降。如果被问起，他们对这个岛和修道院的情况知之甚少。",
	"These three disciplined warriors ({@creature Veteran||veterans}) are the last of the abbey guards. All were dying of their wounds when they were found and healed by the clerics. Ozymandias has ordered them to obey Bayleaf, but the guards prefer Ogmund as their leader because he is one of them and not a hired sword. They will fight to the death to save the clerics.": "这三位纪律严明的战士({@creature Veteran||veterans})是最后的修道院守卫。当他们被神职人员发现并医治时，都因伤势过重而奄奄一息。奥兹曼迪亚斯命令他们服从贝利夫，但卫兵们更喜欢奥格蒙德作为他们的领袖，因为他是他们中的一员，而不是一把雇佣的剑。他们将为拯救神职人员而战斗到死。",
	"The survivors in the abbey provide many potential social interactions and combat encounters. Use the following guidelines to decide how the survivors react to the characters' actions.": "修道院里的幸存者提供了许多潜在的社会互动和战斗遭遇。使用以下准则来决定幸存者对角色的行动如何反应。",
	"If the characters enter the abbey with swords drawn and spells blazing, the survivors believe the pirates have returned and mount a solid defense.": "如果人物进入修道院时拔出剑，施展法术，幸存者就会认为海盗已经回来了，并展开稳固的防御。",
	"Once combat begins, the survivors fight to the death except for Bayleaf. He fights hard, but as the lone nonbeliever he is not ready to die for his employer.": "一旦战斗开始，幸存者就会拼命战斗，除了贝利夫。他奋力战斗，但作为唯一的非信徒，他还没有准备好为他的雇主而死。",
	"Ogmund, the acolyte, and the cultist call for help and attempt to delay the PCs.": "奥格蒙德、圣徒和邪教徒呼救，并试图拖延NPC。",
	"The rest of the cultists rush to attack. They all rush forward, open the door to their chambers, and join in the fray.": "其余的邪教分子急于进攻。他们都冲上前去，打开寝室的门，加入到战斗中。",
	"The cultists try to attack the characters from multiple directions. The acolytes and cultists throw themselves into the fight without regard for their safety. All of the cultists target clerics, wizards, and other casters in the group first, since they know well that a spell or two can offset their numerical advantage.": "邪教分子试图从多个方向攻击这些人物。圣徒和邪教徒们不顾自身的安全，奋不顾身地投入战斗。所有的邪教徒都首先以牧师、巫师和其他施法者为目标，因为他们清楚地知道，一两个法术就能抵消他们的人数优势。",
	"Ozymandius and Odium try to remain in their rooms while casting spells through the doorway. Odium uses {@spell hold person} to shut down potent warriors, while Ozymandius relies on {@spell spirit guardians} and {@spell spiritual weapon} to wear down the characters.": "Ozymandius和Odium试图留在他们的房间里，同时通过门缝施法。奥姆使用（%0%）来关闭强大的战士，而奥兹曼迪厄斯则依靠（%1%）和（%2%）来消磨人物。",
	"The veterans try to keep Ozymandius safe, possibly by standing in the doorway to his chamber. Odium shrinks back in his room, trying to stay clear of the fight. The rest of the cultists don't particularly like him, and none rush to defend him. If a character moves into his room, however, the cultists might try to corner that character.": "老兵们试图保护奥兹曼迪乌斯的安全，可能是站在他房间的门口。奥伊姆缩在他的房间里，试图避开这场战斗。其余的邪教徒并不特别喜欢他，也没有人急于保护他。然而，如果有人物进入他的房间，邪教分子可能会试图把这个人物逼到墙角。",
	"Bayleaf cares only about survival. He uses his shortbow to fire from his room, and employs his magic and abilities to hinder the characters. He keeps one 2nd-level slot in reserve for {@spell invisibility} to disappear from view as the fight winds down. Once {@condition invisible}, he sneaks away if the characters seem treacherous, or offers to negotiate if they seem honorable and willing to uphold any bargains they make with him.": "贝利夫只关心生存。他在房间里用短弓射击，并运用他的魔法和能力来阻碍人物。他保留了一个二级槽，以便在战斗结束时从视野中消失（%0%）。一旦{@condition invisible}，如果角色看起来很奸诈，他就会偷偷溜走；如果他们看起来很正直，愿意坚持与他达成的任何交易，他就会提出谈判。",
	"Parleying with the survivors is difficult, because Ogmund is one of the first occupants the characters meet. He is spoiling for a fight, but might be willing to talk as a delaying tactic while the other survivors mobilize.": "与幸存者进行谈判是很困难的，因为奥格蒙德是角色们最先遇到的住户之一。他很喜欢战斗，但在其他幸存者动员起来的时候，他可能会愿意谈谈，作为一种拖延战术。",
	"Ogmund keeps the characters talking until the rest of the survivors enter the room. He then attacks, unless Ozymandius orders him to stand down.": "奥格蒙德让这些人物一直说话，直到其他幸存者进入房间。然后他发动攻击，除非奥兹曼迪乌斯命令他退下。",
	"Ozymandius is the first named NPC to arrive, followed by the veterans from areas 5, 7, and 8, and the acolyte from area 6. If the characters appear to offer a way of getting off the island, Ozymandius orders Ogmund to keep his hands off his weapons.": "奥兹曼迪乌斯是第一个到达的命名NPC，然后是5、7、8区的老兵，以及6区的圣徒。如果这些人物出现，提供了离开岛屿的方法，奥兹曼迪乌斯命令奥格蒙德不要碰他的武器。",
	"Odium, Bayleaf, and the cultist from area 10 arrive next. Odium begs the characters to take him with them, even offering to join them in battle against the characters. Bayleaf keeps an eye on the situation. If the party appears powerful and confident, he turns {@condition invisible} as soon as he can and slips away to escape.": "Odium、Bayleaf和第10区的邪教徒接下来到达。奥姆乞求这些人物带他一起走，甚至提出要和他们一起战斗，对抗这些人物。Bayleaf一直关注着局势。如果队伍显得强大而自信，他就会尽快转身（%0%），溜走逃跑。",
	"Ozymandius drives the negotiation. He settles for nothing less than passage to the mainland for him and two of the veterans so that he can get help to fortify the island and rebuild. He offers the characters a place of honor in the cult.": "奥兹曼迪厄斯推动了谈判。他的条件是让他和两名退伍军人前往大陆，这样他就可以得到帮助来加固岛屿并进行重建。他为这些人物提供了一个在邪教中的荣誉地位。",
	"The characters might try to trick the survivors into splitting their numbers. Ozymandius refuses to abandon the island, because doing so is deserving of a death sentence in the eyes of his superiors. The rest of the residents can be persuaded to leave peacefully, however, especially if the characters create a ruse to make it appear that Ozymandius or the cult leaders have given permission for them to do so.": "这些人物可能会试图欺骗幸存者，让他们分开人数。奥兹曼迪厄斯拒绝放弃这个岛，因为在他的上级眼中，这样做是应该被判处死刑的。然而，其余的居民可以被说服和平地离开，特别是如果角色创造了一个诡计，让人觉得奥兹曼迪厄斯或邪教领袖已经允许他们这样做。",
	"If a fight does break out after negotiation, most of the survivors are not eager to die. If Ozymandius and Ogmund are defeated, the veterans will surrender if Bayleaf is alive and capable of counseling them to do so. He also throws down his weapons or attempts to flee.": "如果谈判后确实爆发了战斗，大多数幸存者并不急于求死。如果奥兹曼迪厄斯和奥格蒙德被打败，如果贝利夫还活着并且有能力劝说他们投降，老兵们就会投降。他也会扔下武器或试图逃跑。",
	"The Winding Way, a series of trapped passages leading to the abbey's treasure chamber, is a well-kept secret. The senior clerics were slain by the pirates, and with them went knowledge of the abbey's riches. Now only Bayleaf knows about the Winding Way. He was informed of the tunnels by the overlord who led the abbey, who wanted him ready to defend them if needs arose. The elf does not know the actual layout of the place, nor does he know about its guardians. He uses his knowledge of the place's existence as a bargaining chip for getting off the island. Bayleaf has not told any of the other survivors about the Winding Way.": "蜿蜒之路 \"是一系列通往修道院藏宝室的通道，是一个保守的秘密。高级教士被海盗杀死了，随之而来的是对修道院财富的了解。现在只有贝里夫知道 \"蜿蜒之路\"。他是被领导修道院的霸主告知这些隧道的，霸主希望他准备好在需要时保卫他们。这个精灵不知道这个地方的实际布局，也不知道它的守护者。他用他对这个地方存在的了解作为离开该岛的筹码。贝利夫没有告诉任何其他幸存者关于蜿蜒之路。",

	"All that remains of the abbey is a great square of stones filled with burned and blackened rubble. As you approach the sooty stones, it is obvious someone has been sorting through the debris. Assorted oddments are piled inside the scorched square of the foundation stones. Ruined cooking utensils, crushed pots and pans, mangled kettles, and less identifiable metal objects lie in one pile. Broken crockery, platters, plates, porcelain, and pottery are heaped in another.": "修道院只剩下一个巨大的石头广场，上面堆满了烧焦和发黑的瓦砾。当你走近这些烟熏火燎的石头时，很明显有人在整理这些残骸。各种各样的零碎物品都堆在基石烧焦的广场上。被毁坏的炊具、被压碎的锅碗瓢盆、残缺不全的水壶和不太容易辨认的金属物品堆在一起。破碎的陶器、盘子、碟子、瓷器和陶器则堆放在另一堆。",
	"A great deal of wood has been sorted into one large mound of badly burned scraps. In the center of the ruins is an opening, and as you move nearer, you see a stone staircase leading down into darkness.": "大量的木材被分拣成一大堆严重烧毁的废品。在废墟的中央有一个开口，当你走近时，你看到一个石阶通往黑暗中。",
	"If the characters investigate the piles of rubbish, they find nothing of value. The survivors have sorted through the remains of the abbey, and all valuable or usable objects have been removed.

	"This combination dining hall and gambling den reeks of greasy, soured food. The main feature of the room is a makeshift table made of burned planks supported at either end by upended barrels. Beneath the table are several small kegs that serve as chairs.

A creature standing in front of the chest's locking mechanism when the needle fires must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 ({@dice 4d8}) poison damage.": "如果在保险箱被打开之前没有被解除，或者解除保险箱的尝试失败，那么陷阱就会触发。当陷阱触发时，一根毒针会射出。当毒针射出时，站在箱子的锁定装置前的生物必须做一个DC14的灵巧救赎，否则会受到18({@dice 4d8})的毒药伤害。",

	"This room is a large square whose ceiling is held up by two massive gray granite pillars. The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of shiny black iron, and several bags, chests, and urns lie scattered about. You notice a shimmer in the air, like heat rising from a fire.": "这个房间是一个大广场，其天花板由两根巨大的灰色花岗岩柱子撑起。墙壁、地板和天花板都是由闪亮的黑铁制成，周围散落着几个袋子、箱子和骨灰盒。你注意到空气中有一种光泽，就像从火中升起的热量。",
	"Suddenly, the shimmering passes between you and one of the pillars, and you see two humanoid forms made of the same iron as the walls.": "突然，闪光从你和其中一根柱子之间穿过，你看到两个与墙壁一样由铁制成的人形。",

	"The statues have been constructed purely as fighting machines. Their heads are smooth, featureless iron balls. Their torsos are short and broad, and their legs are thick and stumpy. The right forearm of each one is a razor-sharp sword blade, and the left arm ends in a hammer head instead of a hand.": "这些雕像纯粹是作为战斗机器建造的。他们的头是光滑的、没有特征的铁球。他们的躯干短而宽，腿粗而短。每个人的右前臂是一把锋利的剑刃，左臂的末端是一个锤头，而不是一只手。",
	"Treasure. If the characters overcome the statues and search the bags, chests, and urns, they find 480 gp and 1,200 sp. Another 1,000 gp in gems and jewelry can be found in the urns. A large chest in the northwest corner contains five bolts of rare silk worth 100 gp each, two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}, a {@item bag of holding}, and a suit of Medium {@item mithral armor} (your choice of type).": "宝藏。如果人物克服了雕像，并搜查了袋子、箱子和瓮，他们会发现480金币和1,200英镑。另外，在瓮中可以找到1,000金币的宝石和珠宝。西北角的一个大箱子里有五条稀有的丝绸，每条价值100金币，两件（%0%）、一件（%1%）和一套中等（%2%）的衣服（你选择的类型）。",
	"If the characters cannot reach the abbey and are forced to retreat, they receive nothing from the mariners' guild other than the return of deposits on borrowed equipment.

	"Once the mariners take control of the island, it is unlikely that the cult that built the abbey tries to retake it. Doing that would require a much larger force than they are capable of mustering at present. The cult will certainly not forget about the island or the characters, though.": "一旦水手们控制了该岛，建造修道院的邪教组织就不太可能试图夺回它。这样做将需要一支比他们目前所能召集的更大的部队。不过，邪教肯定不会忘记这个岛或这些人物。",

	"Some weeks ago, the town council of Saltmarsh hired a party of adventurers to investigate mysterious goings-on in the decaying, supposedly haunted mansion on the cliff top near the town. These adventurers discovered that the alleged haunting of the house was a ruse devised by a gang of smugglers importing contraband. The adventurers overcame the smugglers in the house, then boarded their ship and routed the rest of the gang. The smuggling operation quashed, the adventurers were rewarded by the grateful Saltmarsh authorities.": "几周前，萨尔马什镇议会雇佣了一队冒险家，调查镇子附近悬崖顶上那座腐朽的、据说是闹鬼的宅子里的神秘事件。这些冒险家发现，所谓的闹鬼的房子是一帮进口违禁品的走私者设计的诡计。冒险家们战胜了房子里的走私者，然后登上他们的船，击溃了这伙人中的其他人。走私行动被粉碎，冒险家们得到了感恩的萨尔马什当局的奖励。",
	"But even after the smugglers were routed, a danger remained. The adventurers told the town council that they discovered evidence that the smugglers had been selling weapons to a nearby colony of lizardfolk. Their deduction was corroborated by {@creature Oceanus|GoS}, a sea elf who was being held prisoner aboard the smugglers' ship when the adventurers made their assault.": "但是，即使在走私者被击溃后，仍然存在着危险。冒险家们告诉镇议会，他们发现了走私者向附近的蜥蜴人殖民地出售武器的证据。他们的推断得到了{@creature Oceanus|GoS}的证实，这个海精灵在冒险者发动攻击时被囚禁在走私者的船上。",
	"Now fearful that the lizardfolk planned to assault Saltmarsh, the town council asked the adventurers to seek out the lizardfolk lair and deal with the threat. The adventurers journeyed to the lair, but they discovered that there was no threat to Saltmarsh—at least not from the lizardfolk. In fact, the lizardfolk were preparing to go to war against a tribe of sahuagin, a brutal horde that a year ago drove the lizardfolk from their original home. Determined to regain their ancestral home, the lizardfolk had begun purchasing weapons and were negotiating alliances against the sahuagin with the merfolk and the locathah in the region; the koalinth were also approached but refused to join the alliance. The lizardfolk hoped not only to expel the sahuagin and regain their home, but also to deal the sahuagin enough of a blow to discourage them from further aggression.": "现在，由于担心蜥蜴人计划袭击萨尔马什，镇议会要求冒险家们寻找蜥蜴人的巢穴并处理这一威胁。冒险家们前往巢穴，但他们发现萨尔马什并没有受到威胁--至少没有受到蜥蜴人的威胁。事实上，蜥蜴人正准备与萨瓦金部落开战，这个残暴的部落一年前把蜥蜴人赶出了他们原来的家园。蜥蜴人决心重新获得他们的祖先的家园，他们已经开始购买武器，并与该地区的merfolk和locathah协商结盟对抗sahuagin；koalinth也被接触过，但拒绝加入联盟。蜥蜴人希望不仅能驱逐萨瓦金人，夺回他们的家园，还能给萨瓦金人以足够的打击，使他们不敢再进行侵略。",
	"After discovering the intentions of the lizardfolk and realizing that the sahuagin were the true threat to Saltmarsh, the adventurers escorted two lizardfolk officers back to meet with the town council and ask the aid of the humans of Saltmarsh in the battle to come.": "在发现蜥蜴人的意图并意识到萨瓦金人是对萨尔马什的真正威胁后，冒险者们护送两名蜥蜴人军官回去与镇议会会面，并请求萨尔马什的人类在接下来的战斗中提供援助。",
	"Now, with the sahuagin threat revealed and new alliances formed, the town council of Saltmarsh once again needs heroes—those accomplished enough to infiltrate the sahuagin stronghold and return with knowledge that will bring about the downfall of the final enemy.": "现在，随着萨瓦金人威胁的暴露和新联盟的形成，萨尔马什镇议会再次需要英雄--那些有足够成就的人潜入萨瓦金人的据点，并带着能使最终敌人垮台的知识回来。",

Unless the party's actions in the previous adventure drove away any potential allies, the following representatives are present (with others in the vicinity).": "参加会议的还有与萨尔马什结盟对抗萨瓦金的各派系的几名成员。除非党派在之前的冒险中的行动赶走了任何潜在的盟友，否则以下代表都会出席（还有附近的其他人）。",
	"Two {@creature Lizardfolk Scaleshield|GoS|lizardfolk scaleshields} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) named Garurt and Vyth represent their queen's interests.

Assuming the lizardfolk are present at the meeting, they provide precious information to the council about their former lair (see \"A Great Gift\").": "两名{@creature Lizardfolk Scaleshield|GoS|lizardfolk scaleshields}（见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）名为Garurt和Vyth的人代表他们女王的利益。他们是严厉的、不苟言笑的士兵。蜥蜴人在萨尔马什（Saltmarsh）外建立了一个营地，那里驻扎了十几名战士，而且还有可能会有更多的人前来。假设蜥蜴人出席了会议，他们会向议会提供关于他们以前的巢穴的宝贵信息（见 \"一份伟大的礼物\"）。",
	"A single {@creature merfolk salvager|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) named Aryn represents her colony in the meeting. She dislikes being on land and has trouble moving across the cobbled streets of Saltmarsh. Aryn is one of six merfolk occupying a kelp bed near the docks of Saltmarsh.": "一个叫Aryn的单身（%0%）（见（%1%））代表她的殖民地参加会议。她不喜欢呆在陆地上，在萨尔马什的鹅卵石街道上行动不便。艾琳是占据萨尔马什码头附近的海带床的六个人鱼之一。",

	"At the meeting, the head of the council explains that a combined force from all the allied species is being assembled to strike the sahuagin fortress. Before this attack can be correctly planned and executed, a small group is needed to make a preliminary excursion into the fortress. The information gained by this reconnaissance team (see \"{@area The Mission|309|x}\") will allow the allies to plan a proper attack. The full assault will be launched fourteen days after the reconnaissance team returns, assuming the mission succeeds at least in part. The council's hope is that the characters will accept this assignment.": "在会议上，委员会的负责人解释说，来自所有联盟物种的联合部队正在集结，以打击萨瓦金要塞。在这次攻击能够被正确计划和执行之前，需要一个小队对要塞进行初步的考察。这个侦察小组获得的信息（见\"{@area The Mission|309|x}\"）将使盟国能够计划一次适当的攻击。假设任务至少部分成功，全面攻击将在侦察队返回后的14天内展开。议会希望这些人物能够接受这项任务。",
	"Assuming the {@creature Lizardfolk Scaleshield|GoS|lizardfolk}, Garurt and Vyth, are present at the meeting, they produce a crude map that identifies the location of the sahuagin stronghold. It occupies an island in the estuary of the Javan River, some fifty miles west and south of Saltmarsh. A coastal headland covers one flank of the island, which is connected to the mainland by a stone causeway.": "假设{@creature Lizardfolk Scaleshield|GoS|lizardfolk}、Garurt和Vyth都出席了会议，他们制作了一张粗糙的地图，确定了萨瓦金人据点的位置。它占据了爪哇河河口的一个岛屿，在萨尔马什以西和以南约50英里处。一个沿海岬角覆盖了该岛的一侧，该岛由一条石堤与大陆相连。",
	"The lizardfolk explain that this site is their former lair, and it consists of a series of natural passages and caves honeycombing the interior of the island. You should give players information about the former lizardfolk lair and the surrounding area, including but not limited to the following details:": "蜥蜴人解释说，这个地方是他们以前的巢穴，它由一系列天然的通道和洞穴组成，蜂拥在岛屿的内部。你应该给玩家提供关于前蜥蜴人巢穴和周围地区的信息，包括但不限于以下细节。",

	"If the characters want to travel by sea, the council provides them with a modified {@vehicle keelboat} with two pairs of oars, two rowboats, and a step-down mast, large enough to accommodate the characters and any reasonable amount of equipment. Navigation and propulsion of the craft is handled by two members of the town guard ({@creature Guard||guards}), who pilot the boat but do not disembark when the characters reach their destination. (If the characters experienced {@adventure Danger at Dunwater|GoS|2}, this boat is of the same sort as the one they used in that adventure.)": "如果人物想走海路，议会为他们提供一艘改装过的{@vehicle keelboat}，上面有两对船桨、两艘划艇和一个降级桅杆，大到足以容纳人物和任何合理数量的装备。这艘船的航行和推进由两名镇上的卫兵（（%%1%））负责，他们驾驶这艘船，但在人物到达目的地时并不下船。(如果人物经历了{@adventure Danger at Dunwater|GoS|2}，那么这艘船与他们在那次冒险中使用的船是同一种类型。）",
	"Upon arriving near the stronghold, the characters must decide where to disembark and how best to approach the fortress itself. If the lizardfolk are present, they recommend a daylight landing at the river mouth. In any event, the keelboat will not come ashore or drop anchor anywhere near the island. The characters are expected to use the rowboats to get to shore while the keelboat sails well out of view of the fortress for the duration of the party's mission. At a predetermined signal or after some period of time, the keelboat will return to see if the characters are ready to be collected.": "到达据点附近后，人物必须决定在哪里上岸，以及如何最好地接近据点本身。如果蜥蜴人在场，他们建议在河口的白天登陆。在任何情况下，龙骨船都不会在岛屿附近上岸或抛锚。角色们应该使用划艇上岸，而龙骨船则在团队任务期间航行在堡垒的视野之外。在一个预定的信号下或一段时间后，龙骨船会返回，看看这些人物是否准备好了。",
	"The characters are considered an elite team that can bring back the needed information. They will likely need to fight some of the sahuagin, but must remain quiet as often as possible to avoid becoming overwhelmed. If they can achieve the mission goals without combat, they're playing smart and well. The intent is to get the players to think tactically and avoid unnecessary fights against a superior foe. Reward the characters' efforts to move past areas filled with sahuagin undetected, but do not hesitate to have the sahuagin react if the characters behave carelessly.": "这些人物被认为是一个精英团队，可以带回所需的信息。他们很可能需要与一些萨瓦金人战斗，但必须尽可能地保持安静，以免被淹没。如果他们能在不战斗的情况下实现任务目标，他们就玩得很聪明，很好。其目的是让玩家从战术上思考，避免与优势敌人进行不必要的战斗。奖励人物在未被发现的情况下走过布满萨瓦金人的区域的努力，但如果人物行为不慎，请不要犹豫，让萨瓦金人做出反应。",
	"The fortress and former home to the lizardfolk is a rocky island located at the mouth of the Javan River. When the lizardfolk laired there, the island was almost entirely above sea level. Thadrah, the sahuagin high priestess of Sekolah, worked ritual magic that sank the island by lowering the seabed.": "蜥蜴人的堡垒和以前的家是一个岩石岛，位于爪哇河口。当蜥蜴人居住在那里的时候，这个岛几乎完全在海平面以上。塞科拉的萨瓦金女祭司塔德拉（Thadrah）施展了仪式魔法，通过降低海床使岛屿沉没。",
	"The cave entrance that once provided the lizardfolk access to the lowest level of the island caves has been submerged in 80 feet of water.

	"The fortress depicted in this adventure is not a typical sahuagin settlement. This is a singular situation—an experimental, fortified base in coastal waters from which sahuagin forces can exert an iron hand of domination over all races inhabiting the adjacent waters and coastal region. If this experiment proves successful, the sahuagin plan to construct more bases of this sort until their control over all waters and coasts is complete, and maritime commerce is at their mercy.": "这个冒险中描述的要塞不是一个典型的萨瓦金人定居点。这是一个奇特的情况--在沿海水域的一个实验性的强化基地，萨瓦金人的部队可以从这里对居住在邻近水域和沿海地区的所有种族施加铁的统治。如果这个实验被证明是成功的，萨瓦金人计划建造更多这样的基地，直到他们完成对所有水域和海岸的控制，而海上贸易则任其摆布。",
	"The sahuagin have renovated the fortress to conform with their plans. The two lower levels of the fortress have been completed, with work on the uppermost level still in process.

Twenty or thirty days after the adventure takes place, the sahuagin plan to mount their first offensive—and Saltmarsh is indeed their target.": "萨瓦金人对要塞进行了翻新，以符合他们的计划。堡垒的两个低层已经完成，最上层的工作仍在进行中。进一步降低海床和最后的内部整顿将完成准备工作。在冒险发生的二三十天后，萨瓦金人计划发动他们的第一次进攻--萨尔马什的确是他们的目标。",
	"If the characters enter the fortress through area 1 (and if they deal with the guards in areas 1 and 2 without drawing attention), they find most of the upper level empty and bare. Construction is still going on in area 19, and the noise of that work echoes through some of the level. Anywhere between area 19 and the points marked with a † symbol in the corridors on the map, the characters can hear faint chinking, banging, and tapping noises if they stop to listen, and these noises become progressively louder as the listeners approach area 19.": "如果人物通过1号区域进入要塞（如果他们在1号和2号区域对付守卫而不引起注意），他们会发现上层的大部分地方都是空的，没有任何东西。19区仍在施工，施工的噪音在部分楼层中回荡。在19区和地图上的走廊上标有†符号的任何地方，如果他们停下来听，都能听到微弱的叮当声、敲击声，而且这些声音会随着听者接近19区而逐渐变大。",
	"The other two levels of the fortress are underwater. To achieve their objectives, the adventurers must use magical means to navigate these areas.": "堡垒的另外两层是在水下。为了实现他们的目标，冒险家们必须使用魔法手段在这些区域航行。",
	"The work carried out by the sahuagin and their slaves on the fortress interior shows expert craftsmanship. The rock is clean and dressed; all surfaces are smooth, all corners are near-perfect right angles, and all floors are level (except in the cave portion of cave 60, which has been left natural, and parts of area 19). The uppermost dry level has an eerie, clinical air.": "萨瓦金人和他们的奴隶在要塞内部进行的工作显示了专业的工艺。岩石干净整齐；所有的表面都很光滑，所有的角落都是近乎完美的直角，所有的地板都是平整的（除了第60窟的洞穴部分，它被保留为自然状态，以及第19区的部分）。最上层的干燥层有一种阴森的临床空气。",
	"The sahuagin are cruel and vicious in equal measure. Although they are humanoid in form, they have a mindset closer to that of predatory sharks than the outlook of humans or other land dwellers.": "萨瓦金人是残酷的，也是恶毒的。虽然他们是人形，但他们的心态更接近掠夺性的鲨鱼，而不是人类或其他陆地居民的前景。",
	"Like sharks, sahuagin are at their most aggressive when their prey spills blood in the water. Their Blood Frenzy trait represents this increased ferocity. Though it can prove a significant edge in a fight, it also saddles them with a critical tactical challenge. Sahuagin affected by Blood Frenzy are at best reluctant to disengage from combat. Rather than withdraw in the face of defeat and find reinforcements, they might instead press the attack.": "像鲨鱼一样，当猎物在水中溢出血液时，萨瓦金人的攻击性最强。他们的 \"血液狂热 \"特质代表了这种凶猛程度的提高。虽然这可以证明它们在战斗中的重要优势，但它也给它们带来了关键的战术挑战。受 \"血之狂热 \"影响的萨瓦金人充其量只是不愿意脱离战斗。他们不愿意在失败的情况下撤退并寻找援军，反而会继续进攻。",
	"As an optional rule to reflect this ferocity, a sahuagin that comes within 30 feet of a hostile creature that doesn't have all its hit points must use an action to make a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the sahuagin's Blood Frenzy takes over as normal, and the creature either stands its ground or advances to attack in melee. On a successful save, the sahuagin retreats or escapes if possible, temporarily fighting off the influence of the trait. If the sahuagin's move takes it farther than 30 feet from all hostile creatures, the situation resets, and another saving throw is called for whenever it again comes within 30 feet of an injured enemy.": "作为反映这种凶猛程度的可选规则，一个萨瓦金人如果在30英尺范围内遇到一个没有全部命中率的敌对生物，必须用一个行动来做一个DC13智力救赎动作。如果救赎失败，萨瓦金的 \"血之狂热 \"就会像往常一样发挥作用，而该生物要么站在原地，要么前进到近战中进行攻击。如果救赎成功，萨瓦金人就会撤退，或者在可能的情况下逃跑，暂时抵制该特性的影响。如果萨瓦金的行动使它远离所有敌对的生物超过30英尺，那么情况就会重置，而且每当它再次进入受伤的敌人的30英尺范围内时，就会要求再次进行蓄力攻击。",

But the horror of the drowned ones' attack shattered his sanity, so that at best he can recount only that the attackers came from the sea, were humanoid in appearance, and had glowing eyes and rotting flesh.": "在以前的生活中，菲尔珀特大部分时间都是在乌斯卡恩村贫民窟，靠市民的施舍过活。加入观火岛隐修院后，他终于找到了平静。但溺水者的恐怖袭击粉碎了他的理智，所以他最多只能叙述袭击者来自大海，外表是人形，眼睛发亮，肉体腐烂。",
	"Uskarn is a small fishing village of nine hundred souls. Though the place is primarily a human settlement, a handful of elves, dwarves, and gnomes have also made their homes here.": "乌斯卡恩是一个有九百个灵魂的小渔村。虽然这个地方主要是人类定居点，但少数精灵、矮人和侏儒也在这里安家。",
	"Most of Uskarn's inhabitants earn a living fishing in the shallows of the adjacent bay or venturing farther out to sea if they're after more impressive catches. The village boasts an unusually large port for its size, used both for its own fishing boats and for the trading vessels and naval ships that frequently stop here on their way through the area.": "乌斯卡恩的大多数居民都在邻近海湾的浅滩上捕鱼为生，如果他们想获得更多令人印象深刻的渔获，可以到更远的海上去捕鱼。该村拥有一个不同寻常的大港口，既用于自己的渔船，也用于贸易船和海军舰艇，它们在经过该地区时经常停在这里。",
	"An extended stay in the village isn't required to complete this adventure, but the characters are likely to visit—if only to secure passage to Firewatch Island by way of the small ferry that runs from the village.": "完成这次冒险并不需要在村子里停留很长时间，但人物很可能会去拜访--如果只是为了确保通过从村子里开出的小渡船前往观火岛的话。",
	"Characters who do spend time in the village might be drawn to the popular tavern known as the Fog and Frog, a large warehouse converted into a drinking establishment with a dozen modest rooms to rent in the back. The tavern is run by council member Skeldruff Plenk, who brews a much-lauded lager called Plenk's Plenk.": "在村子里呆上一段时间的人物可能会被称为 \"雾与蛙 \"的流行酒馆所吸引，这是一个由大仓库改造成的饮酒场所，后面有一打简陋的房间供出租。酒馆由议会成员斯凯德鲁夫-普伦克（Skeldruff Plenk）经营，他酿造了一种广受赞誉的啤酒，叫做普伦克的普伦克。",
	"If the characters ask about Philpert in Uskarn, the villagers know him by description. Anyone can tell the characters about Philpert's history in the village, and most residents know he had been living at the Firewatch Island hermitage for the past several months. The people of Uskarn are understandably concerned if one of the peaceful hermits of the island has turned up dead. Though they have no money to offer as incentive, the villagers are quick to ask the characters to check on the hermitage to make sure everything is all right.": "如果人物在乌斯卡恩问起菲尔珀特，村民们会通过描述知道他。任何人都可以告诉人物关于菲尔珀特在村子里的历史，大多数居民知道他在过去几个月里一直住在观火岛的隐居地。如果岛上和平的隐士之一出现了死亡，乌斯卡恩的人们的担忧是可以理解的。虽然他们没有钱作为奖励，但村民们还是很快要求这些人物去检查隐居地，以确保一切正常。",
	"If the characters spend any time in Uskarn other than the minimum required to use it as a jumping-off point for the adventure, the following details about prominent people and other background information might come in handy.": "如果人物在乌斯卡恩停留的时间，除了将其作为冒险的跳板所需的最少时间外，以下关于杰出人物的细节和其他背景信息可能会很有用。",

	"Although the council steers the village's economy, the true power in Uskarn lies in the hands of Feldrin Kane (LN male human {@creature knight}), an intimidating bailiff who ensures that the independent-minded natives don't stray too far from his own vision of good government. His taciturn agent Merrick (N male halfling {@creature veteran}) commands a small force of deputies and officers who maintain order in the village, and who look poorly on foreign troublemakers. Visitors are likely to receive a visit from Merrick or one of his officers soon after arriving, the official offering a cool welcome along with questions about their business in town and intended length of stay.": "虽然议会引导着村庄的经济发展，但乌斯卡恩的真正权力却掌握在费尔德林-凯恩（LN男性人类（%0%））手中，他是一个令人生畏的执法官，确保思想独立的当地人不会偏离他自己的良好治理理念太远。他的沉默寡言的代理人梅里克（N男半身人（%1%））指挥着一小队副手和官员，维持村里的秩序，并对外国麻烦制造者看不顺眼。游客到达后不久就会收到梅里克或其官员的拜访，官员会冷淡地欢迎他们，并询问他们在镇上的业务和打算停留的时间。",
	"Though the village is small and unassuming overall, it's also the site of a smuggling operation run out of Uskarn's large port district. Several of Merrick's deputies are in the pocket of Griff Talsin (CE male human {@creature bandit captain}), ostensibly a maritime merchant who trades in fine cloth and dry goods. Talsin is actually a black-hearted privateer who gets most of his wares from illegal raids against coastal villages across the bay. Any trouble with Talsin attracts the attention of his more powerful pirate allies, which could lead to or connect with further adventures.": "虽然这个村子整体上很小，也很不起眼，但它也是乌斯卡恩大港口区的走私活动场所。梅里克的几个副手都在格里夫-塔尔辛（CE男性人类（%0%））的口袋里，他表面上是一个从事高级布匹和干货交易的海商。塔尔辛实际上是一个黑心的私掠者，他的大部分货物来自于对海湾对面沿海村庄的非法袭击。塔尔辛的任何麻烦都会引起他更强大的海盗盟友的注意，这可能会导致或连接到进一步的冒险。",

	"The tiny island, 800 feet long by 400 feet wide, is a mixture of scrubby woodland and rocky hills. Three stony peaks rise above the grass and shrubs. The tallest stands more than 400 feet high along the southern coast of the island, while the other two are 300 and 100 feet high respectively.": "这个小岛长800英尺，宽400英尺，是灌木丛生的林地和岩石山丘的混合物。三座石峰耸立在草地和灌木丛中。最高的一座沿着岛的南部海岸矗立，高度超过400英尺，而另外两座分别为300和100英尺高。",
	"Aside from the hermits, the island is normally home to only vermin, rats, a variety of noisy birds, and various tide pool creatures. But now the stink of corpses in area 14 has drawn additional scavengers from the surrounding waters and the mainland—including a dangerous monster.": "除了隐士之外，岛上通常只有害虫、老鼠、各种嘈杂的鸟类和各种潮池生物。但现在，第14区的尸体臭味吸引了来自周围水域和大陆的额外清道夫--包括一个危险的怪物。",
	"Chief among the creatures drawn to the scent of death on the island is a {@creature monstrous peryton|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) known as Rasp. This creature has long hunted across the region, searching for fishing boats or passenger ships to attack. The locals watch for and fear Rasp, and they know that it has several lairs along the coast. None who have tried to hunt the creature have returned.": "在被岛上的死亡气息所吸引的生物中，最主要的是一种被称为Rasp的（%0%）（见（%1%））。这种生物长期以来一直在整个地区狩猎，寻找渔船或客船进行攻击。当地人注意并害怕Rasp，他们知道它在沿海地区有几个巢穴。试图猎杀这种生物的人都没有回来。",
	"The peryton makes frequent passes over the island nowadays, hoping to spot survivors of the recent attack that it can devour. If the characters arrive by day, Rasp welcomes them with its claws and beak. It is smart enough to not fight to the death, though, and it leaves the island to return to one of its mainland lairs if reduced to half its hit points or fewer.": "如今，peryton频繁地经过该岛，希望能发现最近袭击事件的幸存者，以便将其吞噬。如果人物在白天到达，拉斯普会用它的爪子和喙欢迎他们。不过，它很聪明，不会去拼命，如果命中率降到一半或更低，它就会离开这个岛，回到它在大陆的一个巢穴。",
	"If Rasp reduces a character to 0 hit points, it attempts to pick the character up and fly back to its newly claimed lair in {@area area 24|464|x}.": "如果Rasp将一个角色的命中率降到0，它就会试图把这个角色拿起来，在（%0%）内飞回它新认领的巢穴。",

	"A small keelboat makes the three-mile journey south from Uskarn to Firewatch Island at first light each day, delivering supplies and bringing passengers back and forth from the hermitage. A one-way trip costs 5 sp. The ferry is mastered by Ulder Raserhill (LN male half-orc {@creature commoner}), a short-tempered individual who begrudges his fate as a backwater sailor. If the characters request him to wait for them (or if he thinks the characters are rich), he asks for an extra payment of as much as 50 gp.": "每天天一亮，一艘小龙骨船就会从乌斯卡恩向南行驶三英里到观火岛，运送物资，并把乘客从隐居地带回。渡船由乌尔德-雷瑟希尔（LN男性半兽人（%0%））掌握，他脾气暴躁，不甘心自己是个落后的水手。如果人物要求他等待他们（或者他认为人物很有钱），他就会要求额外支付多达50戈比的报酬。",

	"If the characters have their own ship it's easy for them to reach Firewatch Island. Keep in mind that having access to their own ship makes escaping the island easy, but if the characters flee, then they might have no way of tracking the undead back to the Pit of Hatred.": "如果角色们有自己的船，他们就很容易到达观火岛。请记住，有了自己的船，逃离该岛就很容易了，但如果人物逃离，那么他们可能就没有办法追踪亡灵回到仇恨之坑了。",
	"Characters who make their own way to the island can start the adventure by landing at any point along its shore.

	"In good weather, the journey to Firewatch Island takes an hour. As the characters approach, they can hear the faint sound of a large bell being rung, seemingly coming from the island. But the sound fades quickly and is not heard again. (One of the survivors at the hermitage rang the bell when he saw the characters' vessel approaching, but he was waylaid thereafter; see {@area area 24|464|x} for more information.)": "在天气良好的情况下，前往观火岛的路程需要一个小时。当人物接近时，他们可以听到微弱的大钟敲击声，似乎是从岛上传来的。但这声音很快就消失了，再也听不到了。(隐居地的一名幸存者在看到人物的船只接近时敲响了钟，但他随后被拦截了；更多信息请参见{@area area 24|464|x}。",

A bell tower rises an additional two stories above the rest of the building, and a low stone wall surrounds part of the complex.": "阳光使海浪闪闪发光，观火岛完全进入视野。三座荒芜的山丘是它最引人注目的地标，在狭窄的岩石海滩和小的毛茸茸的灌木上耸立着，否则就是稀疏的景观。在这些高点之间，可以看到一个小堡垒和信标塔。这座建筑是由石头制成的，看起来有两层。一座钟楼比建筑的其他部分又高了两层，一道低矮的石墙环绕着建筑群的一部分。",

But then as the first glow of dawn showed at the cleft in the wall there, it suddenly fled.\"": "\"我看到一具尸体，湿漉漉的，干瘪的，变色的，好像长期浸泡在海里。它径直走进房间，开始搜索，于是我把门封上。神奇的是，它没有发现我们的藏身之处，尽管它一直在地板上乱抓，似乎能感觉到我们在下面。但是，当黎明的第一道曙光出现在墙的裂缝处时，它突然逃走了。\"",
	"By peering through the crevice to the south, the survivors witnessed the undead gathering the slain residents into nets. The monsters walked back into the sea, dragging several of the nets behind them. More than a dozen corpses remain to be salvaged from the grotto, waiting for the undead to return.": "通过向南面的裂缝望去，幸存者目睹了亡灵将被杀的居民集中到网里。这些怪物走回海里，把几张网拖在身后。还有十几具尸体有待从石窟中打捞出来，等待亡灵们的归来。",
	"At dawn, Aaron went up and out to search for survivors. Finding none, he remained outside to keep watch for passing ships. He planned on ringing the bell to draw their attention. In the meantime, he tried to fortify the place as well as he could.": "黎明时分，亚伦起身出去寻找幸存者。没有找到，他就留在外面监视过往船只。他计划敲响钟声以吸引他们的注意。同时，他试图尽可能地加固这个地方。",
	"Having witnessed the undead at their work, the survivors are convinced they will be back—perhaps as early as tonight, after the sun sets.": "在目睹了亡灵的工作后，幸存者们相信他们会回来--也许最早在今晚，太阳落山后。",
	"If the characters haven't identified the ruined map found in {@area area 13|442|x}, Janore can confirm that it shows Firewatch Island, the local coastline, nearby settlements, and the invaders' plans for an assault against those settlements. If the characters haven't already done so, she guesses that the undead are still following the orders they were under when {@i Tammeraut} was sunk. They intend to seize the hermitage and destroy its last defenders, then use the island as a staging ground for attacks against the settlements of the coast.": "如果角色们还没有确认在{@area area 13|442|x}发现的废墟地图，亚诺尔可以确认它显示了观火岛、当地的海岸线、附近的定居点，以及入侵者对这些定居点的攻击计划。如果角色们还没有这样做，她猜测亡灵们仍在遵循{@i Tammeraut}被击沉时的命令。他们打算夺取隐居地并消灭其最后的守卫者，然后将该岛作为攻击沿海定居点的集结地。",
	"With both Morley and Barrett sickened, Janore doesn't know what to do. Aaron was supposed to check on the status of the boat kept in {@area area 14|446|x}, and since he failed to return Janore has been afraid to investigate further. Until the characters appeared, the survivors believed that they had been abandoned, and that the only way off the island is the ferry. But even if the characters have the means of leaving the island immediately, or they can repair the hermitage's boat with {@spell mending}, the knowledge that the drowned ones mean to use Firewatch Island as a base from which to launch further mayhem across the region should give them pause.": "由于莫里和巴雷特都生病了，亚诺尔不知道该怎么办。亚伦应该去检查保存在{@area area 14|446|x}的船的状况，由于他没有回来，亚诺尔一直不敢进一步调查。在人物出现之前，幸存者认为他们被遗弃了，离开岛屿的唯一途径是渡船。但是，即使人物有办法立即离岛，或者他们可以用{@spell mending}修复隐修院的船，但知道被淹死的人意在利用观火岛作为基地，在整个地区发动进一步的混乱，应该让他们暂停。",
	"An undead assault against the coast could come at any number of locations and be all but impossible to defend against. Because the drowned ones are able to add to their undead ranks, each successful attack would increase the size of their army. But knowing that the undead likely plan to return to Firewatch Island to destroy its last survivors gives the characters a single chance for a controlled fight. Destroying the drowned ones before they capture the hermitage might be the only way to end their threat.": "亡灵对海岸的攻击可能来自任何地点，而且几乎不可能抵御。因为被淹死的人能够增加他们的亡灵队伍，每次成功的攻击都会增加他们的军队规模。但是，知道这些亡灵很可能计划返回观火岛，消灭岛上最后的幸存者，就给了角色们一次控制战斗的机会。在他们占领隐居地之前消灭溺水者可能是结束他们威胁的唯一方法。",
	"If the characters decide to stay and await the fall of night, Janore and the others insist on remaining in the bolt-hole—it's been safe so far and they're not eager to risk compromising their sanctuary. None of the survivors know exactly how many drowned ones there are, but they believe that securing all the entrances to the hermitage would be beneficial. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check calms the survivors enough that they agree to leave the bolt-hole, and they can help the characters barricade the hermitage, set up traps, and otherwise prepare to face the undead.": "如果角色们决定留下来等待夜幕降临，亚诺尔和其他人坚持留在螺栓孔里--到目前为止是安全的，他们不急于冒险破坏他们的避难所。幸存者们都不知道到底有多少被淹死的人，但他们相信保护好隐居地的所有入口会有好处。一个在DC15魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中成功的角色可以让幸存者平静下来，以至于他们同意离开栓子洞，他们可以帮助角色们封锁隐居地，设置陷阱，并以其他方式准备面对亡灵。",
	"The hermitage offers an abundance of tactical opportunities to defend against the coming attack. Invite the players to concoct a plan to reinforce the old fortress, and to decide on a course of action for when the drowned ones breach the defenses.": "隐居地提供了大量的战术机会来抵御即将到来的攻击。请玩家们制定一个计划来加强这个古老的堡垒，并决定当被淹死的人突破防线时的行动方案。",

	"Among the tactics the players might come up with, you can help steer them toward the following options.": "在玩家可能想出的战术中，你可以帮助引导他们走向以下选项。",
	"The second level of the hermitage features numerous arrow slits looking onto the exterior of the building. Characters who specialize in ranged attacks and magic can use the arrow slits to launch arrows, bolts, and spells at the drowned ones as they approach.": "隐修院的第二层有许多望向建筑外部的箭缝。擅长远程攻击和魔法的角色可以利用这些箭缝向接近的溺水者发射箭矢、炮弹和法术。",
	"The assassin vines growing near {@area area 15|44a|x} can be moved elsewhere in their pots, as long as their murderous nature is temporarily quelled.

	"There are five entrances into the hermitage—the double doors at the front ({@area area 4|421|x}), two doors at the back of the fortress ({@area areas 11|43b|x} and {@area 12|43e}), the door leading in from the rampart ({@area area 17|451|x}), and the watchtower door ({@area area 21|45b|x}).": "进入隐居地有五个入口--前面的双门（（%0%）），堡垒后面的两个门（（%1%）和（%2%）），从城墙进来的门（（%3%）），以及瞭望塔门（（%4%）。",
	"Enough wood and nails can be found inside the hermitage to reinforce all the doors. The main obstacle is time. It takes a character 1 hour to gather the required materials and reinforce one door. The time is cut in half if another character (including one of the survivors) helps.": "在隐修院内可以找到足够的木材和钉子来加固所有的门。主要的障碍是时间。一个角色需要1小时来收集所需的材料并加固一扇门。如果有其他角色（包括幸存者之一）帮忙，时间就会缩短一半。",
	"A reinforced door cannot be broken through with a Strength check, but must be battered down (AC 15, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage). This fact helps slow the undead, since they are forced to fight their way through doors.": "强化的门不能用力量检查来突破，而必须被打倒（AC15，30点命中，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）。这一事实有助于减慢亡灵的速度，因为它们被迫在门中战斗。",
	"The aging slate tiles on the roof can be easily rigged to collapse. This tactic is especially useful if the victim falls some distance into an area where the characters have open space to make attacks ({@area area 7|42a|x}, for example).": "屋顶上陈旧的石板瓦可以很容易地被操纵而倒塌。如果受害者跌落到一个人物有开放空间进行攻击的区域（比如说（%0%）），这种战术就特别有用。",
	"If the characters have discovered this magic oil in {@area area 12|43e|x} or {@area area 22|45e|x}, it can be applied in front of entry points, on stairs, or anywhere they want to slow the undead down.": "如果人物在{@area area 12|43e|x}或{@area area 22|45e|x}发现了这种魔油，就可以在入口前、楼梯上或任何他们想减缓亡灵速度的地方使用。",
	"As soon as the sun sets, the drowned ones begin their underwater trek from the Pit of Hatred to the shores of Firewatch Island. They arrive at the island about an hour after sundown. If the characters are still on the island at sundown and are observing the shoreline, you can foreshadow the undead assault:": "太阳一落山，被淹死的人就开始从仇恨之坑的水下跋涉到观火岛的海岸。他们在日落后一小时左右到达岛上。如果人物在日落时仍在岛上，并且正在观察海岸线，你就可以预示亡灵的攻击。",
	"As the last rays of the evening sun slant across the dark waters of the bay, you catch movement from the corner of your eye along the beach—a dark humanoid form standing silently in the surf. You are positive it wasn't there a moment ago. With the next crashing breaker, you lose sight of the intruder in the deepening darkness. When the spray clears, the figure is gone. Night has fallen.": "当傍晚的最后一缕阳光斜射在海湾的黑暗水面上时，你从眼角的余光看到了海滩上的动静--一个黑暗的人形静静地站在冲浪中。你肯定它刚才不在那里。随着下一次破浪声的响起，你在越来越深的黑暗中失去了入侵者的踪影。当水花散去，那个人影也不见了。夜幕已经降临。",
	"The undead assault against the hermitage can be played out in two broad scenarios. Both offer roughly the same challenge but provide different experiences for the players and characters. Choose the experience you think your players will enjoy the most, or create your own, incorporating any of the following elements and information you desire.": "亡灵对隐居地的攻击可以在两个广泛的场景中进行。两者都提供了大致相同的挑战，但为玩家和角色提供了不同的体验。选择你认为你的玩家最喜欢的体验，或者创造你自己的体验，包括以下任何你想要的元素和信息。",

	"Having explored the hermitage and taken on its varied threats, the characters have had a busy day. Thanks to the hags, rats, giant snakes, and the monstrous peryton, their resources might be depleted. The challenge of the drowned ones' attack is thus amplified by the fact that the characters can take only a short rest before the assault begins. Adjust the difficulty of the attack as you see fit, depending on the party's available resources and the measure of your mercy.": "在探索了隐居地并应对了各种威胁之后，这些人物度过了忙碌的一天。多亏了女巫、老鼠、巨蛇和畸形的peryton，他们的资源可能被耗尽了。因此，在攻击开始之前，人物只能进行短暂的休息，这就放大了被淹没者的攻击的挑战。根据党的可用资源和你的怜悯之心的尺度，按你认为合适的方式调整攻击的难度。",
	"Use this scenario if the characters have prepared well for the onslaught. If the undead arrive and are not slowed by reinforced doors, traps, and attacks made against them through arrow slits, the characters have little chance of survival.": "如果角色们已经为攻击做好了充分的准备，就使用这个场景。如果亡灵到达后没有被加固的门、陷阱和通过箭缝对他们进行的攻击所减缓，那么人物几乎没有生存的机会。",
	"The drowned ones arrive as a single mass, trying to overwhelm the defenders with sheer numbers. The intention with this scenario is to make the players and the characters feel as though the island teems with undead. An epic battle ensues, and if that battle is won, no further attacks come.": "被淹死的人作为一个整体来到这里，试图用纯粹的数量来压倒防御者。这个场景的目的是让玩家和角色感觉到这个岛充满了亡灵。一场史诗般的战斗接踵而至，如果这场战斗胜利了，就不会有进一步的攻击了。",
	"When the undead arrive, they attempt to batter down the doors of the hermitage, intent on entering and slaying any mortal defenders. Have the drowned ones assault the doors leading into the different areas of the fortress using the following guidelines.": "当亡灵到达时，他们试图撞开隐修院的大门，打算进入并杀死任何凡人的守卫者。让淹死的人用以下准则来攻击通往堡垒不同区域的门。",
	"The zombies amble near the indicated doors but do not attack them. They enter the hermitage only after the doors are breached by the drowned ones.": "僵尸们埋伏在指定的门附近，但没有攻击他们。只有在门被淹死的僵尸攻破后，它们才会进入隐居地。",

	"The drowned ones arrive in three waves, each increasing in difficulty. If the characters aren't sufficiently challenged by a particular wave, add more monsters to that part of the fight in the form of late reinforcements to help make a wave into a greater threat.": "淹死的人分三波到达，每波的难度都在增加。如果角色在某一波中没有受到足够的挑战，可以在该部分的战斗中加入更多的怪物，以后期增援的形式帮助将一波变成更大的威胁。",
	"Each new wave arrives approximately 30 minutes after the previous wave.

	"Once the undead are dealt with, the coming of the dawn's first light means that the characters can finally rest with no fear of another assault. Raserhill's ferry returns about an hour after sunrise, on its normal schedule, but the craft carries no new passengers and departs again quickly unless the characters hail it. (If Raserhill stuck around the island and was driven off or killed by the monstrous peryton, another boat from Uskarn will set out eventually to investigate the characters' fate.)": "一旦解决了亡灵，黎明的第一道曙光就意味着角色们终于可以休息了，不用担心再受到攻击了。日出后约一小时，雷瑟希尔的渡船按正常时间表返回，但这艘船没有载新的乘客，除非人物呼唤它，否则很快又会离开。(如果雷瑟希尔坚持在岛上，并被怪兽peryton赶走或杀死，那么另一艘来自Uskarn的船最终会出发，调查人物的命运)。",

It waddles closer, gazing intelligently at you with weak, rheumy eyes.": "闷热的日子里，除了海的声音，一片寂静。一只孤独的鸟在头顶的天空中懒洋洋地盘旋。最后，它降落下来，在附近的岩石上停了下来。这是一只海鸥，而且是一只老海鸥，它的嘴破损了，稀疏的羽毛上缺了几块。它蹒跚着走近，用虚弱、风湿的眼睛聪明地凝视着你。",
	"This ancient gull is Virgil, formerly the familiar of Archais, Firewatch Island's wizard.

It has avoided the hermitage residents and was largely ignored by them.": "这只古老的海鸥是维吉尔，以前是守火岛的巫师阿凯斯的熟人。维吉尔在十年前的驻军屠杀中幸存下来，并从那时起就一直住在岛上，在巫师的塔楼房间里筑巢。它一直避开隐居地的居民，基本上被他们忽略了。",
	"Virgil fled the island the previous night when the drowned ones attacked, but now that the characters have seemingly defeated them, the gull has returned to its home. It continues to watch the party despite any attempts to shoo it away.

	"If a character is able to speak with animals, Virgil is friendly. (The scroll found in {@area area 9|433|x} will be useful in that regard if none of the characters have this ability.)

	"The interior of the sunken ship is a ruin. The decks have all but collapsed, creating a tangled maze where ooze and muck cling to sundered timbers and beams. An eerie, many-colored light pulses from the depths of the hull.": "这艘沉船的内部是一片废墟。甲板已经全部坍塌，形成了一个纠结的迷宫，渗出物和淤泥附着在被破坏的木头和梁上。一道阴森的、多色的光从船体的深处跳动。",
	"The rotten tangles of timbers and bulkheads are weak after ten years underwater and can be pushed through with relative ease.": "腐烂的木材和舱壁的纠结在水下十年后是很脆弱的，可以相对容易地被推开。",
	"A large hole in the buried stern of the wreck allows easy access to a darkened cavern that opens up beneath broken slabs of stone—the remains of the seals that once blocked the opening of the pit.": "在沉船的船尾有一个大洞，可以很容易地进入一个黑暗的洞穴，在破碎的石板下面打开，这是曾经堵住坑口的封条的遗迹。",
	"As the characters enter the wreck, a number of drowned ones that stayed behind from the most recent assault on Firewatch Island take notice. Three {@creature Drowned Blade|GoS|drowned blades}, one {@creature drowned ascetic|GoS}, and one {@creature drowned assassin|GoS} lurk inside the ruined {@i Tammeraut} and attack as soon as the characters enter. The undead do not pursue fleeing characters beyond the 300-foot hemisphere of dark energy that surrounds the rift.": "当角色们进入沉船时，一些在最近一次袭击观火岛时留下的被淹死的人注意到了。三个（%0%）、一个（%1%）和一个（%2%）潜伏在废墟（%3%）内，在角色进入后立即发动攻击。亡灵不会追赶逃亡的角色到围绕着裂缝的300英尺的黑暗能量半球之外。",
	"A pulsating light composed of unnatural colors permeates this underwater cavern. The stern of the ship has broken through the cavern's fifteen-foot-high ceiling near the center of the area. The nauseating light reveals a hideous array of piled bones, many of which clearly once belonged to humanoids—far more bones than could be accounted for by the crew of a single sunken ship.": "一种由非自然色彩组成的脉动光线弥漫在这个水下洞穴里。船尾已经冲破了洞穴中靠近中心地带的15英尺高的天花板。令人作呕的光线显示出一系列可怕的堆积的骨头，其中许多显然曾经属于人类--远比一艘沉船的船员所能说明的骨头要多。",
	"A shallow alcove opens up to the north, with a rotting sea chest set before it, leaning against the rough stone wall. Within the alcove, a funnel-shaped hollow in the cavern floor terminates at a narrow hole in the bedrock below. The pulsing light emanates from this hole.": "一个浅浅的凹洞向北打开，一个腐烂的海柜摆在面前，靠在粗糙的石壁上。在凹洞内，洞底有一个漏斗状的空洞，尽头是下面基岩上的一个窄洞。脉动的光线就是从这个洞里发出来的。",
	"This cavern is all that remains of what was once a jagged chasm in the seafloor. The mound of bones represents both the crew of {@i Tammeraut} and others who have succumbed to the ocean's perils, all preserved by the rift's dark magic. The hollow to the north is the access point to the ancient evil that has imbued the Pit of Hatred with its sinister aura.": "这个洞穴是海底曾经的一条锯齿状鸿沟的全部遗迹。尸骨堆代表着{@i Tammeraut}的船员和其他屈服于海洋危险的人，他们都被裂缝的黑暗魔法保存下来。北面的空洞是通往古代邪恶的入口，它使仇恨之坑充满了邪恶的气息。",
	"{@i Tammeraut}'s captain, Syrgaul Tammeraut, resides in this chamber—transformed into a twisted monster known as a {@creature drowned master|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}). Syrgaul is the conduit through which the pit's evil essence once again spreads its dark influence into the world. Feeding off the captain's rage and hate as he died, the energy of the rift animated {@i Tammeraut}'s crew and turned them into drowned ones. Though the drowned ones can range abroad, Syrgaul is forever trapped within the rift near the source of his dark unlife.": "{@i Tammeraut}的队长Syrgaul Tammeraut就住在这个房间里--变成了一个被称为{@creature drowned master|GoS}的扭曲的怪物（见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）。Syrgaul是一个管道，通过这个管道，深坑的邪恶本质再次将它的黑暗影响传播到这个世界。裂缝的能量以船长死亡时的愤怒和仇恨为食，将{@i Tammeraut}的船员变成了溺水者。虽然被淹没的人可以到国外去，但西尔格却永远被困在裂缝中，靠近他黑暗的生命之源。",
	"As the characters explore this area, Syrgaul and one {@creature drowned blade|GoS} rise from the pile of bones and attack.": "当角色们探索这个区域时，西尔格和一个（%0%）从骨头堆里站起来并发动攻击。",
	"The treasure carried on {@i Tammeraut} has been placed in front of the north alcove by the drowned ones, as an offering to the great sleeping evil below. A rotting sea chest holds 5,000 sp, 1,850 gp, 75 pp, and ten masterfully cut pieces of jade depicting various sea animals (100 gp each).": "携带的财宝（%0%）被淹死的人放在北面的凹槽前，作为对下面沉睡的大恶魔的供奉。一个腐烂的海箱里有5,000英镑、1,850金币、75页纸，以及十块精心切割的描绘着各种海洋动物的玉石（每块100金币）。",
	"The funnel-shaped hollow to the north of the hull is 3 feet in diameter and descends 2 feet to a 1-inch-wide vent at the bottom. In addition to being the source of the pulsating light, the vent is the center and source of the area's dark {@spell hallow} effect. This narrow opening continues down for hundreds of feet beneath the ocean bottom, never widening.": "船体北部的漏斗状空洞直径为3英尺，下降2英尺，底部有一个1英寸宽的通风口。除了是脉动光的来源外，这个通风口是该地区黑暗（%0%）效应的中心和来源。这个狭窄的开口在海底下持续了数百英尺，从未扩大。",
	"Sealing this vent is the only way to lay Syrgaul's spirit to rest. Doing so also prevents the evil from further corrupting those who drown in the area. One easy method of sealing it is to use the flask of {@item sovereign glue} from the hermitage to affix a plug over the opening (the substance hardens even underwater). Spells such as {@spell stone shape} can also seal off the vent. When the vent is sealed, the {@spell hallow} effect surrounding the rift immediately ends.": "封闭这个通风口是让赛尔高的灵魂安息的唯一方法。这样做还可以防止邪恶进一步腐蚀那些在这里溺水的人。封闭它的一个简单方法是用隐修院里的（%0%）的瓶子在开口处贴上一个塞子（这种物质在水下也会变硬）。诸如（1%）之类的法术也能封住通风口。当通风口被封住时，围绕着裂缝的{@spell hallow}效应立即结束。",
	"If the characters accomplish all their objectives—rescuing the surviving hermits, destroying the drowned ones and their leader, and sealing the opening in the Pit of Hatred—things soon return to normal on Firewatch Island and the communities of the nearby coast. The surviving hermits abandon the island, but a new group settles there before long. Or, Feldrin Kane, the Uskarn bailiff, might deed the island and fortress to the characters as a reward for ending the threat of the drowned ones. Of course, such a reward comes with the expectation that the characters would use the place to protect and defend the settlements of the nearby coast.": "如果角色们完成了他们所有的目标--解救幸存的隐士，消灭淹死的隐士和他们的首领，并封住仇恨之坑的开口--观火岛和附近海岸的社区很快就恢复了正常。幸存的隐士们放弃了这座岛，但不久后又有新的团体在那里定居。或者，乌斯卡恩的执法官费尔德林-凯恩（Feldrin Kane）可能会把这个岛和堡垒作为结束被淹死者威胁的奖赏给这些人物。当然，这样的奖励是以人物会利用这个地方来保护和捍卫附近海岸的定居点为前提的。",
	"If the characters depart Firewatch Island before nightfall and the drowned ones' second attack, the undead become a greater threat. Now that they've exhausted the nearby prey, the undead make it to the mainland in their nightly wanderings. Attacks on coastal roads and villages become more common—with the drowned ones adding all their victims to their growing horde—and unless they are somehow checked, Syrgaul's forces become the scourge of both land and sea in the entire region.": "如果角色们在夜幕降临和被淹没者的第二次攻击之前离开观火岛，亡灵就会成为更大的威胁。现在，他们已经耗尽了附近的猎物，亡灵们在夜间的游荡中来到了大陆。对沿海道路和村庄的攻击变得更加普遍--溺水者将他们所有的受害者都加入到他们不断增长的队伍中--除非他们以某种方式被遏制，否则锡尔戈尔的部队将成为整个地区陆地和海洋的祸害。",
	"Even if the characters turn back the drowned ones' assault but fail to close the rift, the evil influence of the pit strengthens and begins to extend outward. All those who have drowned in the bay are gradually harvested by the remaining drowned ones and transformed into undead, until Syrgaul has an army of drowned corpses at his command. What terrible atrocities the undead captain might visit upon the nearby settlements are up to you.": "即使角色们击退了溺水者的攻击，但未能关闭裂缝，坑洞的邪恶影响也会加强并开始向外延伸。所有淹死在海湾里的人都会逐渐被剩余的溺水者收割，变成亡灵，直到Syrgaul拥有一支听从他指挥的溺水者军队。亡灵队长可能会对附近的居民区实施什么可怕的暴行，就看你了。",
	"Even with the rift closed off, the Pit of Hatred might continue to be a lurking threat. With the seal restored, the evil beyond is left to fester—frustrated and perhaps seeking ways to break free, stronger and more deliberate than before.": "即使裂缝被关闭，仇恨之坑也可能继续是一个潜伏的威胁。随着封印的恢复，外面的邪恶被留了下来--感到沮丧，也许在寻求挣脱的方法，比以前更强大，更有目的性。",
	"Above all, the question remains: what is the source of the rift's evil? Perhaps the characters will return to the pit as more accomplished adventurers, seeking some way to descend the vent, find out what presence is down there, and destroy it once and for all.": "最重要的是，问题仍然存在：裂缝的邪恶之源是什么？也许这些角色会以更有成就的冒险家的身份回到深坑，寻求某种方法来下降通风口，找出下面的存在，并一劳永逸地摧毁它。",
	"{@i Tammeraut's Fate} gives the characters a chance to foil an incursion by Orcus and his minions before it can take root. The deep regions of the sea are fertile ground for those demons and cultists who can take advantage of it. Far from the blinding light of the sun and overlooked by many of the demons' traditional foes, a deep-sea portal to the Abyss can spawn many demons and warp the world around it to an irreparable degree before it is discovered.": "{@i Tammeraut's Fate}让人物有机会在奥库斯和他的爪牙扎根之前挫败他们的入侵行为。对于那些能够利用它的恶魔和邪教徒来说，大海的深处是一片肥沃的土地。远离刺眼的阳光，被许多恶魔的传统敌人所忽视，一个通往深渊的深海入口可以催生许多恶魔，并在被发现之前将周围的世界扭曲到不可挽回的程度。",
	"Pirates and similar outlaws are fertile ground for worshipers, and those captains who achieve success and infamy might draw the eye of any number of Abyssal patrons. As befits their chaotic nature, demon lords tend to offer power and impart blessings as the opportunity presents itself rather than create a comprehensive, long-term plan.": "海盗和类似的亡命之徒是崇拜者的沃土，而那些获得成功和恶名的船长可能会吸引任何数量的深渊赞助者的目光。与他们混乱的本性相称，恶魔领主倾向于在机会出现时提供权力和传授祝福，而不是制定一个全面、长期的计划。",
	"If you want to extend the concept presented in this adventure to cast a longer shadow over your campaign, the following notes provide some guidance and ideas for what might come next.": "如果你想扩展这个冒险中提出的概念，在你的活动中投下更长的阴影，下面的说明为接下来可能出现的情况提供了一些指导和想法。",
	"The capacity for undead creatures to survive deep underwater makes Orcus and his cult well suited for plaguing the seas. Orcus offers undeath to his mortal followers as a lure to bring them deeper into his power while unleashing them as a terror of the waves.": "亡灵生物在水下深处的生存能力使奥库斯和他的邪教很适合在海洋中作乱。奥库斯向他的凡人追随者提供不死之身作为诱饵，使他们更深入地融入他的力量，同时释放他们作为海浪的恐怖。",
	"The scheme showcased in {@i Tammeraut's Fate} is a good example of how Orcus and his minions take advantage of the sea. They march along the seabed to strike at coastal villages and recruit more living dead to their legions. Although the characters might have slain Syrgaul and destroyed the Pit of Hatred, Orcus and his followers continue to plot and plan.": "{@i Tammeraut's Fate}中展示的计划是一个很好的例子，说明了奥库斯和他的爪牙是如何利用海洋的。他们沿着海床行进，袭击沿海村庄，并招募更多的活死人加入他们的军团。尽管角色们可能已经杀死了西尔格，并摧毁了仇恨之坑，但奥卡斯和他的追随者们仍在继续策划和计划。",
	"The events of {@i Tammeraut's Fate} can serve as the flash point for a major event in your campaign. In the years that Syrgaul's crew spent toiling at the ocean's floor, they might have been directed by Orcus or Syrgaul to launch other sinister plans. A search of the location of the wrecked ship can turn up clues to further plots.": "{@i Tammeraut's Fate}的事件可以作为你的战役中一个重大事件的爆发点。在赛尔高的船员们在海底劳作的这些年里，他们可能受到了奥库斯或赛尔高的指示，启动了其他邪恶的计划。搜索失事船只的位置可以发现进一步阴谋的线索。",
	"The following adventures seeds form a story arc that you might use as individual episodes or as the outline of a grand plot to overwhelm the region with undead and call Orcus into the world.": "下面的冒险种子构成了一个故事弧，你可以将其作为单独的剧情，也可以作为一个大阴谋的大纲，用亡灵压倒这个地区，并将奥库斯召唤到这个世界。",

	"In this continuation of the story, a powerful priest of Orcus forms a network of allied pirate captains. The ship crews are augmented by zombies and skeletons, and, unknown to the pirates, the priest can spy through the undead. Captains who prove treacherous are quickly slain and replaced with more amenable allies.": "在这个故事的续篇中，一个强大的奥库斯牧师形成了一个由海盗船长组成的联盟网络。船员们都是由僵尸和骷髅组成的，海盗们不知道，牧师可以通过亡灵进行监视。那些被证明背信弃义的船长很快就会被杀死，并被更多的盟友所取代。",
	"As the pirates gain control of the seas, the priest is free to establish a domain of Orcus with a great portal to the Abyss at its center. It's up to the characters to track down and defeat the pirate fleet.": "随着海盗们获得了对海洋的控制权，牧师可以自由地建立一个Orcus的领地，其中心是一个通往深渊的巨大门户。追踪并击败海盗船队的任务就交给了这些人物。",
	"The Pit of Hatred is but one example of the planar sigils that followers of Orcus can use to bolster their power. Off the coast, near heavily trafficked sea lanes, cultists of Orcus create a gateway on the seabed that links to the Abyss. The water above swirls and plunges downward, creating a whirlpool that devours ships and sea life.": "仇恨之坑只是奥库斯的追随者用来增强其力量的平面标志的一个例子。在沿海地区，靠近交通繁忙的海路，奥库斯的崇拜者在海床上创造了一个连接深渊的通道。上面的水旋转着向下坠落，形成一个漩涡，吞噬船只和海洋生物。",
	"Living creatures pulled to the bottom of the whirlpool are slain, warped with Abyssal energy, and unleashed into the sea as undead creatures. Unless someone finds the gate, slips through it into the Abyss, and destroys the unhallowed site found on the other side, the whirlpool will unleash a horde of undead sailors and sea creatures that can transform the region around it into a dead zone.": "被拉到漩涡底部的生物会被杀死，被深渊的能量扭曲，并作为不死生物被释放到海里。除非有人找到这扇门，通过它溜进深渊，并摧毁在另一边发现的不被允许的场所，否则漩涡将释放出大量的不死水手和海洋生物，可以将它周围的地区变成一个死区。",
	"Far out to sea, a mass of bones culled from the seabed rises and coalesces into a new island—a sinister place cloaked in necrotic energy. This place, the Island of Bones, serves as a port of call for pirates serving Orcus.": "在遥远的海面上，一群从海底捞起的骨头升起并凝聚成一个新的岛屿--一个笼罩着坏死能量的邪恶之地。这个地方，即骨头岛，是为奥库斯服务的海盗们的停靠港。",
	"The island swarms with undead creatures that perform repairs on ships, unload loot, and protect the place from attack. More important, it serves as the center of an unholy theocracy founded by priests of Orcus and dedicated to calling their master to the Material Plane.": "岛上聚集了大量的不死生物，他们为船只进行维修，卸下战利品，并保护这里不受攻击。更重要的是，它是一个由奥库斯（Orcus）祭司建立的邪恶神权的中心，致力于将他们的主人召唤到物质世界。",

	"With a fleet of pirate captains at their call and the devouring gyre cutting off sea travel, the priests of Orcus threaten to overwhelm the region with their undead hordes. Their efforts, of course, are resisted by the characters and whatever forces the locales can muster.": "在海盗船长们的号召下，在吞噬旋风的阻隔下，奥库斯的牧师们威胁要用他们的亡灵群来淹没这个地区。当然，他们的努力受到了这些人物和当地能够动员的任何力量的抵制。",
	"A series of mysterious murders shakes the downtrodden folk of the Styes—a decaying port fallen on hard times and slowly being reclaimed by the sea.

	"Richard Pett conjured this ghastly sea port for Dungeon 121 in 2005. \"The Styes\" feels like it was pulled straight from the mind of H. P. Lovecraft, but in Richard Pett's capable hand we're treated to perhaps the most memorable depiction of both a cunning aboleth plot and a sinister cult of Tharizdun. Many adventures are set aboard a ship at sea. Can you name another that challenges you to infiltrate a moldering ship held aloft by a crane, above the streets of a slowly dying city?": "Richard Pett在2005年为Dungeon 121创作了这个可怕的海港。\"The Styes \"感觉像是直接从H.P.Lovecraft的脑海中拉出来的，但在Richard Pett的能干的手中，我们看到的也许是对狡猾的aboleth阴谋和邪恶的Tharizdun邪教的最难忘的描述。许多冒险都是在海上的船上进行的。你能说出另一个挑战吗，即潜入一艘由起重机高高举起的正在腐烂的船，在一个逐渐消亡的城市的街道上？",
	"There exists an underwater abyss known as the Endless Nadir—a haunted place shunned by the aquatic races of the region, for this realm is the site of a submerged city of aboleths. For the most part, the alien denizens of this city are content to plot and lurk in the depths of the ocean trench. But a few of them are cursed with curiosity. One such creature is Sgothgah, a scholar, crafter, and explorer—and an outcast among its kind.": "有一个被称为 \"无尽的纳迪尔 \"的水下深渊--一个被该地区的水生种族所回避的鬼地方，因为这个领域是一个被淹没的亚博尔斯城市的所在地。在大多数情况下，这座城市的外星居民满足于在海沟的深处策划和潜伏。但其中有几个人被诅咒了，他们的好奇心很强。斯戈特加就是这样一个生物，他是一个学者、手工业者和探险家，也是同类中的一个弃儿。",
	"Sgothgah's life changed forever when it encountered and consumed a cult of lunatics who worshiped Tharizdun, an ancient deity of darkness. As it read the minds of its victims as it devoured them, some of what it gleaned of Tharizdun—between their screams and their unheeded pleas for mercy—found purchase in Sgothgah's mind. For centuries, the aboleth mulled over the concept of Tharizdun in idle moments, and eventually those thoughts flowered into something alien and repulsive to most aboleths: religious faith.": "当斯哥特加遇到并吞噬了一个崇拜古代黑暗之神塔里兹敦的疯子邪教时，它的生活从此改变。当它在吞噬受害者时，它读懂了他们的思想，在他们的尖叫声和无人理睬的求饶声中，它收集到的一些关于塔里兹敦的信息在斯戈特加的脑海中找到了答案。几个世纪以来，亚伯拉罕人在闲暇的时候思考着塔里兹敦的概念，最终这些想法变成了对大多数亚伯拉罕人来说陌生而厌恶的东西：宗教信仰。",
	"To hide its burgeoning devotion to a non-abolethic entity from the prying telepathic abilities of its kind, Sgothgah relocated its lair to the edge of the Endless Nadir. There, in the solitude of the inky deep, the aboleth made a second astounding discovery: a juvenile kraken with an unlikely, circular scar on its head, a wound earned in battle against a giant shark years ago. Even such a strange scar would normally be little more than a curiosity, but Sgothgah saw a pattern in this one that evoked thoughts of Tharizdun's dark madness. The aboleth took this event as a sign that Tharizdun had gifted it with the task of nurturing the kraken until it was fully grown.": "为了隐藏它对一个非abolethic实体日益增长的献身精神，不被它的同类的心灵感应能力所窥探，Sgothgah把它的巢穴迁到了无尽的Nadir边缘。在那里，在墨色深渊的孤独中，阿博勒特有了第二个惊人的发现：一只幼年克拉肯，头上有一道不太可能的圆形伤疤，这是多年前与巨鲨战斗时留下的伤口。即使是这样一个奇怪的疤痕，在通常情况下也不过是一种好奇，但斯戈特加在这个疤痕中看到了一种模式，唤起了人们对塔里兹敦的黑暗疯狂的思考。Aboleth把这一事件看作是塔里兹敦赋予它培育克拉肯的任务的标志，直到它完全长大。",
	"Sgothgah knew the kraken could never be raised to maturity in the Endless Nadir—even in Sgothgah's remote corner of it—without risking discovery by the other aboleths. So Sgothgah fled the abyss, taking with it the juvenile kraken and a number of loyal aquatic minions. It headed for coastal waters that the aboleths avoided because of the humanoids that dwelled there, trusting that other aboleths wouldn't follow it or even care that it had left.": "斯戈特加知道，在无尽的纳迪尔，即使是在斯戈特加的偏远角落，也不可能把克拉肯养大到成熟，否则就有可能被其他亚博体育登录入口发现。因此，斯戈特加逃离了深渊，带着幼年的克拉肯和一些忠诚的水生奴仆。它向沿海水域进发，因为那里居住着人类，所以海怪们都避而远之，它相信其他海怪不会跟踪它，甚至不会在意它的离开。",
	"Purely by chance, the oceanic immigrants came to a stretch of water where the once-notable port district of a minor city had fallen into decay and corruption. Known as the Styes, the district was only a wretched shadow of what it had once been. But the aboleth found a perfect location to hide the kraken—a sunken temple to the west of the district, known to the locals as Landgrave's Folly. Sgothgah quickly established mind control over a local cadre of fishers and sailors, sending them to infiltrate every corner of the ruined district. And to the aboleth's surprise and unnatural delight, it discovered an active cult of Tharizdun in the Styes.": "纯粹是一个偶然的机会，海洋移民来到了一片水域，那里曾经是一个小城市的著名港口区，已经陷入了衰败和腐败。这个地区被称为 \"Styes\"，只是它曾经的一个悲惨的影子。但亚伯拉罕找到了一个藏匿海怪的完美地点--位于该区西部的一座沉没的神庙，当地人称之为 \"土地公爵的愚蠢\"。斯哥特加很快就对当地的渔民和水手骨干建立了精神控制，派他们渗透到这个废墟区的每个角落。而令阿波利特惊讶和不自然的是，它在斯蒂尔斯发现了一个活跃的塔里兹敦崇拜者。",
	"Led secretly by one of the Styes' own ruling councillors—an inhuman creature that calls itself \"{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}\"—this cult of Tharizdun has thrived in the decay of the Styes for decades. Through enslavement and telepathy, Sgothgah forged an alliance with the cultists, always taking care to conceal its true identity. The cultists knew Sgothgah only as \"the Whisperer,\" and they quickly came to regard their hidden ally as a powerful messenger of Tharizdun. To this day, only {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} suspects the truth.": "在斯蒂尔人自己的统治者之一--一个自称\"{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} \"的非人生物--的秘密领导下，这个塔里兹敦的邪教在斯蒂尔人的衰败中繁荣了几十年。通过奴役和心灵感应，斯戈特加与邪教徒们结成了联盟，始终注意隐瞒自己的真实身份。邪教徒们只知道斯哥特加是 \"低语者\"，他们很快就把他们隐藏的盟友视为塔里兹敦的强大信使。时至今日，只有（1%）的人怀疑真相。",
	"To feed the growing kraken's ravenous hunger, Sgothgah has coerced its cultist allies into supplying the beast with beggars, drunks, urchins, and other sweepings from the alleys of the Styes that no one will miss. At the same time, the aboleth transformed the underwater pit where the kraken rests into a conduit for dark magic, fashioned to capture the plentiful negative emotions of the residents of the Styes. For months now, all their fear, sadness, despair, hatred, and anger has been focused into the pit to enhance and accelerate the kraken's growth.": "为了满足日益增长的海怪的饥渴，斯哥特加胁迫其邪教盟友向海怪提供乞丐、酒鬼、顽童和其他从斯蒂尔斯巷子里扫出来的东西，没有人会错过。同时，亚伯拉罕将海怪休息的水下坑道变成了一个黑暗魔法的通道，用来捕捉冥河居民丰富的负面情绪。几个月来，他们所有的恐惧、悲伤、绝望、仇恨和愤怒都被集中到坑里，以加强和加速克拉肯的成长。",
	"To maximize the effect of that emotional darkness, the aboleth chose a local human fisher named Jarme Loveage to be an instrument of murder and fear. Sgothgah enslaved the young man and has compelled him to commit brutal murders, fueling dread in the district. Jarme carries a lantern on all his grisly nocturnal harvests, and his horrible work has long been attributed to a faceless terror called \"the Lantern Ghost.\"": "为了使这种情感上的黑暗效果最大化，阿博尔特选择了当地一个名叫贾梅-洛瓦格的人类渔夫作为谋杀和恐惧的工具。斯戈特加奴役了这个年轻人，并迫使他实施残酷的谋杀，在该地区加剧了恐惧。贾梅带着灯笼在夜间进行可怕的收割，他的可怕工作长期以来被归因于一个被称为 \"灯笼鬼 \"的无名恐怖。",
	"As the killings mounted, residents of the Styes grew increasingly frightened. Jarme retained little knowledge of his foul work. He awoke exhausted, haunted by vague memories of horrible nightmares, but hasn't connected the vague horrors of his sleep with the very real horror occurring in the shadowy, mist-drenched alleys of his home.": "随着杀戮的增加，斯蒂尔斯的居民越来越感到害怕。贾梅对他的犯规工作几乎没有保留任何知识。他疲惫地醒来，被可怕的噩梦的模糊记忆所困扰，但还没有把他睡眠中的模糊恐怖与发生在他家阴暗的、被迷雾笼罩的小巷中的非常真实的恐怖联系起来。",
	"Seven days ago, Jarme was captured by a nighttime patrol with a bloody knife in his hands. The confused fisher professed his innocence, but his dreams became suddenly clear. In his mind, he saw ravenous, tentacled creatures devouring the Styes and the city beyond, and he scrawled these images onto the walls of his cell in the asylum where he spent his last days. Not even the pleas of his sister and a local priest named {@creature Master Refrum|GoS|Refrum} were enough to save him. Only yesterday, Jarme Loveage dangled from the executioner's noose.": "七天前，贾梅被一支夜间巡逻队抓获，手里拿着一把血淋淋的刀。这个困惑的渔夫声称自己是无辜的，但他的梦境突然变得清晰起来。在他的脑海中，他看到贪婪的、有触角的生物在吞噬着斯蒂尔斯和城市，他把这些图像涂抹在精神病院的牢房墙上，他在那里度过了最后的日子。甚至他的姐姐和当地一位名叫（%0%）的牧师的恳求也不足以拯救他。就在昨天，Jarme Loveage被吊在刽子手的绞索上。",

	"The story begins in part 2, \"{@area Murder Mystery|4b7|x},\" when the characters meet with {@creature Master Refrum|GoS}, an inventor-priest who dwells in the Alchemists' Quarter of the Styes. Refrum is convinced that a young man named Jarme Loveage was wrongfully executed for the killings attributed to the Lantern Ghost. As proof, he points to the fact that another murder has occurred since the execution, and in the same style as the previous murders. The priest believes that Jarme was framed by some sinister conspiracy, and he asks the characters to clear his friend's good name.": "故事从第二部分\"{@area Murder Mystery|4b7|x} \"开始，人物与{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}见面，他是一位居住在斯蒂尔斯炼金术士区的发明家牧师。Refrum确信，一个名叫Jarme Loveage的年轻人因为归咎于灯笼鬼的杀戮而被错误地处决。作为证据，他指出，在处决后又发生了一起谋杀案，而且与之前的谋杀案风格相同。牧师认为贾梅是被一些邪恶的阴谋所陷害的，他要求这些人物为他的朋友洗脱罪名。",
	"During their investigation, the characters visit Hopene'er, the asylum where Jarme was held. They learn that {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}, a prominent member of the community, has some odd connections to Jarme's case, and might find clues hinting to broader connections to the recent murders. In part 3, \"{@area Hemlock Pit|4b8|x},\" the characters seek the councillor out at his warehouse and the home he keeps behind it—a ship held aloft by a crane over a muddy flat. A confrontation takes place, and it's discovered that {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} is a devotee of Tharizdun blessed with power granted by Sgothgah. After defeating the aberration, the characters discover manic drawings of a gargantuan squid-like demon of the deep, just like those seen in Jarme's cell.": "在调查过程中，这些人物访问了关押贾梅的精神病院Hopene'er。他们了解到，社区的一位知名人士{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}与贾梅的案件有一些奇怪的联系，并可能发现暗示与最近的谋杀案有更广泛联系的线索。在第三部分\"{@area Hemlock Pit|4b8|x} \"中，人物在议员的仓库和他在仓库后面保留的房子里找到了他--一艘由起重机吊在泥泞的平地上的船。一场对峙发生了，人们发现{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}是塔里兹敦的一个信徒，被斯戈特加赋予了力量。打败反常者后，角色们发现了一个巨大的深海乌贼般的恶魔的狂热图画，就像在贾梅的牢房里看到的那样。",
	"In part 4, \"{@area The Lamp's Shadow|4b9|x},\" these clues lead the characters to a hidden temple to Tharizdun, where they are attacked by chuuls that dwell there. At the climax of this battle, the Whisperer appears from the polluted sea to attack the heroes—hoping to enslave them to its own dark purposes.": "在第四部分\"{@area The Lamp's Shadow|4b9|x} \"中，这些线索将人物引向一个隐藏的塔里兹敦神庙，他们在那里遭到了居住在那里的楚尔人的攻击。在这场战斗的高潮部分，\"低语者 \"从被污染的海中出现，袭击了英雄们--希望能将他们奴役到自己的黑暗目的中。",
	"In the aftermath of that battle, the characters learn of how the Whisperer has used the gloom and despair of the Styes as an incubator for the juvenile kraken it keeps to the west of the district. Part 5, \"{@area Tharizdun's Progeny|4ba|x},\" takes place in the partially collapsed husk of the temple housing the kraken, where the heroes face a pair of aboleths that were sent to kill Sgothgah—and then must destroy the kraken before it can escape into the world.": "在那场战斗之后，角色们了解到低语者是如何利用冥河的阴暗和绝望作为孵化器，将幼年的克拉肯保存在该区的西部。第五部分，\"{@area Tharizdun's Progeny|4ba|x}\"，发生在容纳海怪的神庙的部分坍塌的外壳中，英雄们在那里面对一对被派来杀死斯哥特加的阿波利斯，然后必须在海怪逃到这个世界之前消灭它。",
	"This adventure presents the Styes as an old district in a port city or large port town. Making the Styes part of a larger, thriving settlement gives the characters plenty of potential reasons to visit the area, with the overall settlement ideally located in a nation that's fallen on hard times. Alternatively, the district could be part of a free city that has fallen into despair and decay. In the world of Greyhawk, the city of Prymp in Ahlissa is an excellent choice. In the Forgotten Realms, the Styes fits nicely into the city of Marsember. In Eberron, the Styes could be a district in Rekkenmark or any of the other coastal settlements that haven't fully recovered from the ravages of the Last War.": "这场冒险将Styes作为港口城市或大型港口城市的一个老区。让斯蒂尔斯成为一个更大的、繁荣的定居点的一部分，给了人物很多潜在的理由来访问这个地区，整个定居点最好是位于一个陷入困境的国家。另外，该区也可以是一个陷入绝望和衰败的自由城市的一部分。在格雷霍克的世界里，阿利萨的普莱姆城是一个很好的选择。在《被遗忘的领域》中，Styes很适合于Marsember城。在《Eberron》中，Styes可以是Rekkenmark的一个区，或者其他任何一个尚未从最后一次战争的破坏中完全恢复的沿海定居点。",
	"Alternatively, you could set the Styes up as a small, stand-alone port town. This approach has the advantage of limiting characters to the Styes' squalid confines. They can't retreat to a nicer part of the city when they want a clean inn, a healthy place to eat, or a wholesome temple for healing or other aid. As a stand-alone town, the Styes can be added to your campaign world at the mouth of any river. You might have a hard time attracting the characters to such a dismal location, however, without drawing on the Styes' reputation for its alchemists and potion factories.": "另外，你也可以把Styes设置为一个独立的小港口城市。这种方法的好处是将人物限制在斯蒂尔斯的肮脏范围内。当他们想找一家干净的旅馆、一个健康的地方吃饭、或一个健康的寺庙进行治疗或其他援助时，他们不能撤退到城市中较好的地方。作为一个独立的城镇，斯蒂尔斯可以被添加到你的战役世界中，位于任何河流的入口处。然而，如果不利用斯蒂尔斯的炼金术士和药水工厂的声誉，你可能很难吸引人物到这样一个令人沮丧的地方。",
	"This adventure assumes that the characters have recently arrived in the Styes or the city it's a part of. If the characters aren't based locally, they might be traveling to the city to obtain a rare ingredient from the Alchemists' Quarter, or to speak to someone who retired or fled to the Styes to hide from their enemies. Alternatively, the characters might simply be passing through the Styes when one of the following occurrences attracts their attention.": "这个冒险假设人物最近来到了斯蒂尔斯或其所属的城市。如果人物不在本地，他们可能是为了从炼金术士区获得一种罕见的原料而前往该城市，或者是为了与某个退休或逃到冥河区躲避敌人的人交谈。另外，人物可能只是路过冥河，而以下的事件引起了他们的注意。",
	"The characters' arrival in the environs does not go unnoticed—far from it. Any adult townsfolk recognize the party as a group of seasoned adventurers. By engaging the residents in conversation, the characters can quickly find out that the Styes is a place in turmoil—a murderer was caught and executed just the previous day, yet another citizen was found dead from foul play when the sun rose today.": "角色们的到来并没有被忽视--远非如此。任何成年的镇民都能认出这支队伍是一群经验丰富的冒险家。通过与居民的交谈，人物很快就能发现斯蒂尔斯是一个动荡不安的地方--前一天刚刚抓到并处决了一个杀人犯，而今天太阳升起时又发现另一个市民死于非命。",
	"The adventure hooks described below represent three different ways of getting the characters involved in the story. All hooks lead to a session with {@creature Master Refrum|GoS} at his workshop in part 2, \"{@area Murder Mystery|4b7|x},\" which kicks off the action.": "下面描述的冒险钩子代表了让角色参与故事的三种不同方式。所有的钩子都指向第二部分\"{@area Murder Mystery|4b7|x} \"中与{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}在他的工作室进行的会谈，该会谈为行动揭开序幕。",
	"Shortly after their arrival in town, the characters come upon a dozen children chasing and tormenting an elderly male human—{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}. The victim feebly brandishes a holy symbol of good at them, but the children and onlookers alike simply taunt him. They then turn to pelting Refrum with stones as they accuse him of being a friend to murderers.": "在他们到达镇上后不久，他们遇到了十几个孩子在追赶和折磨一个老年男性人类--{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}。受害者无力地对他们挥舞着一个神圣的善的象征，但孩子们和围观者都只是嘲弄他。然后他们转而用石头砸向雷弗伦，指责他是杀人犯的朋友。",
	"If the characters step in, the children run away and the onlookers rapidly lose interest. {@creature Master Refrum|GoS|Master Refrum} (LG male human {@creature priest}) introduces himself, thanks the characters for saving him from a humiliating fate, and asks them to escort him back to his home. He provides the basic facts about the recent murders if the characters haven't learned them from a passerby before now.": "如果人物介入，孩子们就会跑开，围观者也会迅速失去兴趣。{@creature Master Refrum|GoS|Master Refrum}（LG男性人类{@creature priest}）自我介绍，感谢人物把他从屈辱的命运中解救出来，并要求他们护送他回自己家。他提供了最近谋杀案的基本事实，如果人物在此之前没有从路人那里得知的话。",
	"If the characters don't intervene, {@creature Master Refrum|GoS} protects himself by casting {@spell sanctuary}, then using {@spell thaumaturgy} to frighten away the children and any onlookers with terrifying roars and ground tremors. He still speaks to the characters afterward, recognizing them as adventurers as he asks for help clearing Jarme's name. He pleads for the characters to accompany him to his workshop to get the details of the situation.": "如果人物不干预，{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}就会通过施放{@spell sanctuary}来保护自己，然后用{@spell thaumaturgy}来吓走孩子和任何围观者，发出可怕的吼声和地面震动。之后，他仍然和这些人物说话，认出他们是冒险者，并要求他们帮助清除贾梅的名字。他恳求这些人物陪他到他的工场去了解情况的细节。",
	"It might be that something one of the characters did in the past impressed a local female human by the name of Eleanor Loveage (N female human {@creature commoner}). She could be the relative of someone a party member saved in a previous adventure, or she might have heard of the characters' prior good deeds. She is also Jarme's sister, and she can't believe that her brother could have done the terrible deeds for which he was executed.": "可能是某个角色过去所做的事情打动了当地一个名叫Eleanor Loveage的女性人类（N个女性人类（%0%））。她可能是党员在以前的冒险中救过的人的亲戚，或者她可能听说过人物以前的善举。她也是贾梅的妹妹，她不相信她的哥哥会做出他被处决的可怕行为。",
	"In her desperation, she approaches the characters for help (explaining the situation if need be) and asks them to meet her at {@creature Master Refrum|GoS}'s workshop in the Alchemists' Quarter of the Styes, where she promises they will learn more.": "在绝望中，她向这些人物寻求帮助（如果需要的话，解释一下情况），并要求他们在Styes的炼金术士区的{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}作坊见她，她承诺他们会在那里学到更多东西。",
	"If the characters are less likely to get involved in the adventure out of altruism, they can be approached by a mysterious, handsome, well-groomed human female dressed in black-and-red leather armor. She declines to give the characters her name, but asks whether they're interested in a well-paying job. If the characters haven't learned about the murders yet, she provides them a summary of those events. She then goes on to say that she believes Jarme Loveage was innocent, and that the real killer is still out there. She recommends that they meet with {@creature Master Refrum|GoS}, who has much more information about Loveage and the murders, and offers the characters a reward of 500 pp if they can find the real murderer and bring the culprit to justice.": "如果人物不太可能出于利他主义而参与冒险，可以由一个神秘的、英俊的、穿着黑红色皮甲的人类女性来接近他们。她拒绝告诉人物她的名字，但问他们是否对一份高薪工作感兴趣。如果角色们还没有了解到谋杀案，她会向他们提供这些事件的摘要。她接着说，她相信Jarme Loveage是无辜的，而真正的凶手仍在逍遥法外。她建议他们去见{@creature Master Refrum|GoS}，他对Loveage和谋杀案有更多的了解，如果他们能找到真正的凶手并将罪犯绳之以法，她会给他们提供500 pp的奖励。",
	"The mysterious contact is one of the councillors of the Styes, named Thornwell (LE female human {@creature mage}). She has discovered hints of {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}'s association with the cult of Tharizdun, which she suspects is also involved in the murders. Thornwell has wanted to be rid of Dory ever since she came to believe that her fellow councillor was responsible for the death of one of her allies. But she doesn't want to jeopardize her standing on the council by taking direct action against Dory, so she has decided to try using the characters as her tool.": "这位神秘的联络人是斯蒂尔斯的议员之一，名叫索恩威尔（LE女性人类（%0%））。她发现了{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}与Tharizdun邪教的联系，她怀疑该邪教也与谋杀案有关。自从索恩威尔相信她的同僚对她的一个盟友的死亡负有责任后，她就想摆脱多里。但她不想通过对多里采取直接行动来危及她在议会中的地位，所以她决定尝试利用人物作为她的工具。",
	"Thornwell suspects that Dory is the actual murderer (though she hasn't an inkling of {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}'s true nature), and she secretly hopes the characters end up killing him. She never mentions her fellow councillor by name, though, instead making cryptic statements such as: \"You must follow the facts wherever they lead, even if that includes the halls of power.\"": "索恩韦尔怀疑多莉是真正的凶手（尽管她对{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}的真面目还一无所知），她暗地里希望这些人物最终能杀死他。不过，她从来没有提到她的同僚议员的名字，而是做出了一些隐晦的声明，例如。\"无论事实指向何处，你都必须遵循事实，即使这包括权力的大厅\"。",
	"Even before they spend a lot of time in the Styes, the characters are quick to note its visible squalor. The haze of smoke hanging over the district is visible for miles, and its stench travels far downwind. Water flowing out the river mouth carries reeking sewage, streaks of dye, and islands of floating garbage far out to sea.": "甚至在他们在斯蒂尔斯花了很多时间之前，这些人物就已经迅速注意到其明显的肮脏。笼罩在该区上空的烟霾在数英里外都能看到，其臭味在下风口处传得很远。流出河口的水带着发臭的污水、条纹状的染料和漂浮的垃圾岛，远远地流向大海。",
	"As the characters enter the district, the view only gets worse. All of the Styes appears to have one foot in the grave.": "当人物进入该区时，景色只会变得更糟。所有的斯蒂尔人似乎都有一只脚在坟墓里。",
	"This is the Styes, the decaying remains of a once-notable port district. Under bent gables, the carcasses of its houses lean against each other—languid, broken, and awaiting the peace of collapse. Door frames sag, dislocated from sod walls heavy with mildew, while splintering timbers support rotting boardwalks like broken limbs, disappearing into the thick, rancid water of the harbor below. In numerous places, sections of the boardwalks have fallen away completely, leaving broad holes that expose polluted water.": "这就是斯蒂尔斯，一个曾经著名的港口区的衰败遗迹。在弯曲的屋檐下，房屋的尸体相互倚靠--无精打采，支离破碎，等待着倒塌的平静。门框下垂，从长满霉菌的草皮墙上脱臼，而劈裂的木材像断裂的肢体一样支撑着腐烂的木板路，消失在下面港口厚重的馊水里。在许多地方，木板路的部分已经完全脱落，留下宽大的洞，暴露出被污染的水。",
	"Once, the Styes was a marvelous port district. Its magnificent buildings crowned an artificial island that was the centerpiece of a broad bay, held aloft on great oak pilings. Those huge beams supported great facades of marble grandeur, connected by boardwalks that thronged with richly clothed merchants, exotic travelers, and the passing palanquins of nobility. Known as the Island of Pleasures, the site was a destination for rich and decadent folk up and down the coast.": "曾经，斯蒂尔斯是一个令人惊叹的港口区。它的宏伟建筑为一个人工岛加冕，这个人工岛是一个宽阔海湾的中心，由巨大的橡木桩支撑着。这些巨大的梁柱支撑着大理石的宏伟外墙，由木板路连接，上面挤满了衣冠楚楚的商人、异国的旅行者和路过的贵族的轿子。这个地方被称为 \"快乐之岛\"，是沿海地区富裕和颓废的人们的目的地。",
	"Time can be cruel, however. Warfare, corruption, famine, and natural disaster ruined many who loved the Island of Pleasures, and as their resources dwindled, so did this once-magnificent district. But even as fortune turned and the region rebuilt from devastation, the Island of Pleasures became an unneeded luxury. New people called the district home: poor, desperate folk crowded beneath fallen gables in hovels tattooed by mildew and damp rot. On their heels came folk whose trade was scorned elsewhere. Alchemists fouled the air and water with poisonous concoctions from failed experiments. Sweat-shop manufactories set up in the Styes and all but enslaved their desperate workers. Tanners and millers and dyers and butchers invaded the district, scraping every penny out of their businesses with no concern over the impact their toxic operations had on their neighbors or the environment. The district bears little evidence of its former glory as it daily sinks deeper into the muck.": "然而，时间可能是残酷的。战争、腐败、饥荒和自然灾害毁掉了许多热爱欢乐岛的人，随着他们的资源减少，这个曾经辉煌的地区也在减少。但是，即使在命运的转折和该地区从破坏中重建的过程中，欢乐岛也成为一种不需要的奢侈品。新的人们把这个地区当成了自己的家：贫穷、绝望的人们挤在倒塌的屋檐下，住在被霉菌和潮湿腐烂的小屋里。紧随其后的是那些在其他地方被蔑视的行业的人。炼金术士们用实验失败后的有毒混合物污染了空气和水。血汗工厂在斯蒂尔斯建立起来，几乎奴役了他们绝望的工人。制革师、磨坊主、染色师和屠夫侵入该区，从他们的业务中榨取每一分钱，而不关心他们的有毒业务对邻居或环境的影响。该地区几乎没有任何证据表明它曾经的辉煌，因为它每天都在泥潭中越陷越深。",
	"The current population of the Styes is a little under twelve thousand residents, but they're packed into an area that might house half that number in a more prosperous settlement. Four-fifths of the district's residents are human, with the remainder split between gnomes, dwarves, halflings, half-orcs, half-elves, and a smattering of other humanoids.": "斯蒂尔斯目前的人口不到一万两千人，但他们挤在一个地区，在一个更繁荣的定居点可能会容纳一半的人数。该地区五分之四的居民是人类，其余的是地精、矮人、半身人、半兽人、半精灵，以及其他一些人形生物。",
	"The Styes is ruled by a group of four corrupt officials called \"the council.\" The four councillors are {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}), Rashlen (NE male elf {@creature assassin}), Sliris (NE female {@creature wererat}), and Thornwell (LE female human {@creature mage}; also see \"{@area Thornwell's Offer|4a5|x},\" above). The district is policed by a poorly trained militia consisting of some two hundred {@creature Guard||guards} (LE humans) led by ten officers (LE human {@creature Bandit Captain||bandit captains}) and one commander (LE human {@creature veteran}). The militia patrols in groups of at least ten, for their own protection more than anything. Larger groups of twenty or more usually include an officer.": "斯蒂尔斯由四个腐败的官员组成的小组统治，称为 \"议会\"。这四位议员分别是{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}（见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）、Rashlen（东北男性精灵{@creature assassin}）、Sliris（东北女性{@creature wererat}）和Thornwell（LE女性人类{@creature mage}；另见上文\"{@area Thornwell's Offer|4a5|x}\"）。该区由一支训练有素的民兵维持治安，民兵由十名军官（LE人类（%7%））和一名指挥官（LE人类（%8%））领导，大约有200名（%6%）（LE人类）。民兵们至少以十人为一组进行巡逻，更多的是为了保护他们自己。20人以上的大队通常包括一名军官。",
	"Unless you used Thornwell as a hook, the only councillor who takes an active role in this adventure is {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}. Anyone who talks of Dory describes him as a longtime resident of the Styes and a wealthy warehouse owner, and mentions the tragic skin condition that requires the councillor to take regular immersion in water for relief.": "除非你用索恩威尔作为钩子，否则唯一在这次冒险中发挥积极作用的议员是（%0%）。任何谈到多里的人都会描述他是斯蒂尔斯的长期居民和富有的仓库老板，并提到悲惨的皮肤病，需要议员定期浸泡在水中来缓解。",
	"The rest of the councillors are occupied with other concerns. If one of their fellow councillors is slain, however, or the balance of power in the Styes is seriously upset, the surviving councillors will almost certainly make sure that the characters responsible don't get to walk away from the district. The timing and details of their revenge are left up to you.": "其余的议员则忙于处理其他问题。然而，如果他们中的一位议员被杀，或者斯蒂尔斯的权力平衡被严重破坏，幸存的议员们几乎肯定会确保负责任的人物不会从这个地区走开。他们复仇的时机和细节由你决定。",
	"The adventure presents only those encounters and events that drive the plot, but any character who spends time in the Styes is bound to have additional unpleasant interactions. As the characters are exploring and following up leads, feel free to spice up their time in the district with one of the following encounters.": "这场冒险只介绍了那些推动剧情发展的遭遇和事件，但任何在斯蒂尔斯待过的角色都必然会有额外的不愉快的互动。当人物在探索和追踪线索时，请随意用以下的遭遇来调剂他们在该地区的时间。",
	"The characters are swarmed by {@dice 3d6} urchins ({@creature Commoner||commoners}), who beg for coins and food, offer their services as guides or baggage porters, or pluck clumsily at the characters' unsecured items. The young urchins can be hired as unreliable guides or for any simple job for 1 cp each, but they run away the moment they're paid.": "角色们被{@dice 3d6}的顽童({@creature Commoner||commoners})所包围，他们乞讨硬币和食物，提供向导或行李搬运工的服务，或者笨拙地抢夺角色们没有安全保障的物品。这些年轻的顽童可以被雇为不可靠的向导，或者做任何简单的工作，每个人只需花1cp，但他们一拿到钱就会跑掉。",
	"A pack of {@dice 2d6} beggars ({@creature Commoner||commoners}) gathers around the characters. Each cries out loudly for alms, food, or spare clothing. Though the beggars aren't thieves, some of them clutch at the characters' sleeves and hands in a way that might be misinterpreted as attempts at picking a pocket or purse. If they're given food or a few coins, any of the beggars can answer basic questions about the Styes and specific locations in the district.": "一群{@dice 2d6}的乞丐({@creature Commoner||commoners})聚集在人物周围。每个人都大声呼喊着要施舍、食物或多余的衣服。虽然这些乞丐不是小偷，但他们中的一些人紧紧抓住人物的袖子和手，可能会被误解为试图偷窃口袋或钱包。如果他们得到了食物或几个硬币，任何一个乞丐都可以回答有关斯蒂尔人和该地区特定地点的基本问题。",
	"A group of {@dice 2d6} pickpockets ({@creature Spy||spies}) gathers around the characters, appearing to be beggars but trying to steal anything they can from pouches and backpacks. Any pickpocket that snatches something flees into the crowd, while the others get in the way to prevent pursuit. Attacking or killing an unarmed pickpocket gets the characters in trouble with the law. It also guarantees that they are bedeviled by vengeful pickpockets everywhere they go in the Styes.": "一群{@dice 2d6}扒手({@creature Spy||spies})聚集在人物周围，看起来像是乞丐，但却试图从口袋和背包里偷取任何东西。任何抢到东西的扒手都会逃到人群中，而其他人则会挡在前面，防止追击。攻击或杀死一个手无寸铁的扒手会使人物陷入法律的困境。这也保证了他们在冥界所到之处都会被复仇的扒手缠住。",
	"A pair of shills ({@creature Commoner||commoners}) in fine clothes approach the characters with guarantees that they know where to find the best deals on food, drink, rooms, potions, merchandise, magic items, or absolutely anything else. The shills lead characters to shops and inns that pay them a kickback, so prices are actually 5 to 10 percent higher than normal—and the quality of goods is typically subpar. If the shills are chased away with threats or violence, they look for opportunities to cause trouble later.": "一对穿着漂亮衣服的骗子({@creature Commoner||commoners})接近人物，保证他们知道哪里可以找到最优惠的食物、饮料、房间、药水、商品、魔法物品或其他任何东西。骗子将人物引向付给他们回扣的商店和旅馆，因此价格实际上比正常情况下高出5%到10%，而且商品的质量通常不合格。如果骗子被威胁或暴力赶走，他们就会寻找机会在以后制造麻烦。",
	"A militia patrol (seven {@creature Guard||guards} and one {@creature bandit captain}) approaches the characters to demand they pay an entrance tax of 10 gp each—a simple shakedown of out-of-towners. The \"tax\" can be negotiated down to 5 gp per character. If they are paid, the militia members laugh and stroll away. If the characters attack, the militia retreat if any of them are killed or at the end of the second round of combat. If any militia members are killed, the characters are immediately attacked by any other militia patrols they encounter, and they get no cooperation from any member of the militia in their investigation (including Constable Jute).": "一支民兵巡逻队（7人（%0%）和1人（%1%））接近这些人物，要求他们每人支付10戈比的入场税--这是对外地人的简单敲诈。这笔 \"税款 \"可以通过谈判降到每个角色5戈比。如果他们付了钱，民兵们就会大笑着走开。如果角色发动攻击，如果他们中有人被杀，或者在第二轮战斗结束时，民兵们就会撤退。如果有任何民兵成员被杀，角色会立即被他们遇到的任何其他民兵巡逻队攻击，而且他们在调查中不会得到任何民兵成员的合作（包括朱特警员）。",
	"A press gang (two {@creature Veteran||veterans} and eight {@creature Thug||thugs}) attempts to kidnap the characters and sell them as deckhands to the captain of an under-crewed ship. This attack might happen openly, or the gang might wait until the characters are separated or sleeping before attacking. They have no qualms about following the party to (or entering) their seedy lodgings.": "一个记者团伙（2人（%0%）和8人（%1%））试图绑架这些人物，并将他们作为甲板工人卖给船员不足的船只的船长。这种攻击可能会公开发生，或者这帮人可能会等到人物走散或睡觉后再进行攻击。他们会毫无顾忌地跟踪聚会到（或进入）他们肮脏的住处。",
	"In better days, the fact that the Styes was sheltered from offshore winds was one of its more desirable qualities. Now, the Alchemists' Quarter spews a permanent miasma of acrid, rancid yellow vapor that hangs above the district and coats its walls and roofs with a greasy film. The dense population of the decaying district makes the waters around the port swirl with sewage, blood and offal from butchers, lye and fur from tanners, and indescribable chemical mixtures from alchemists. In the eastern portion of the Styes, the pollution is so bad that the river's flow has been diverted, leaving a large portion of the district's boardwalks suspended over a wallow of rancid mud.": "在更好的日子里，斯蒂尔斯可以避开海上的风，这是它比较理想的品质之一。现在，炼金术士区长期喷出刺鼻的黄色蒸汽瘴气，悬挂在该区上空，在墙壁和屋顶上涂上一层油腻的薄膜。腐烂区密集的人口使港口周围的水域被污水、屠夫的血液和内脏、制革工人的碱液和毛皮以及炼金术士的难以描述的化学混合物所包围。在斯蒂尔斯河的东部，污染是如此严重，以至于河水被改道，使得该区的大部分木板路都悬浮在腐烂的泥土上。",
	"Most items for sale in the Styes can be had for standard prices, but they are of noticeably substandard quality. Anyone who walks around in fancy clothing, brightly colored accessories, flashy jewelry, or with expensive weapons or armor on display is bound to attract unwanted attention from thieves, opportunistic merchants, and any local willing to commit a crime of opportunity (which is to say most of them). Bartering is common in the district, and characters will find it difficult if not impossible to sell anything with a value over 75 gp for cash. Local merchants don't have that much coinage on hand, or won't admit it if they do.": "在斯蒂尔斯出售的大多数物品都可以以标准价格买到，但它们的质量明显不达标。任何人如果穿着华丽的衣服、戴着色彩鲜艳的配饰、佩戴华丽的珠宝，或者展示昂贵的武器或盔甲到处走动，必然会引起小偷、投机商人和任何愿意趁机犯罪的当地人（也就是大多数人）不必要的注意。在这个地区，以物易物是很常见的，人物会发现要把价值超过75金币的东西以现金形式出售是很困难的，甚至是不可能的。当地商人手上没有那么多硬币，或者即使有也不会承认。",
	"Taverns are everywhere in the Styes, ranging from large public houses to holes-in-the-wall with two tables and nothing but acrid, home-brewed rotgut on tap. The clientele are uniformly glum and morose, and brawls and fights are common. The best taverns in the Styes would be considered dives in most cities—and its inns are no better. Visitors are advised to bring their own bedding to avoid bugs, and to move the bed in front of the door to keep out burglars and unscrupulous innkeepers.": "在斯蒂尔斯，酒馆随处可见，从大型公共场所到只有两张桌子的墙洞，除了刺鼻的自酿腐乳，什么都没有。客人们的情绪都很低落，斗殴和打架很常见。斯蒂尔斯最好的酒馆在大多数城市都会被认为是小酒馆，其旅馆也不例外。建议游客自带被褥以避免虫子，并将床搬到门前以防止小偷和无良旅馆老板。",
	"Though religion is important to many of the Styes' citizens, no public temples operate in the district. This is partially because the councillors impose steep taxes on the faithful, to prevent religious leaders from becoming too popular and eroding the council's authority. But beyond this, even the most dedicated members of the clergy are eventually overwhelmed by the region's emotionally fatiguing problems.": "虽然宗教对许多斯蒂尔斯的公民来说很重要，但该地区没有公共寺庙运作。部分原因是议员们对信徒征收高额税款，以防止宗教领袖变得太受欢迎并侵蚀议会的权威。但除此之外，即使是最敬业的神职人员也最终被该地区的情感疲劳问题所淹没。",
	"Disease, famine, cruelty, and brutality weigh so heavily on the Styes that well-meaning clerics are driven to despair. Small temples dedicated to gods of healing and charity operate quietly in nondescript buildings, and tiny shrines can be found in alleys and cul-de-sacs all over the district. Beyond these, only one organized faith exists in secret in the Styes, and it plays a central role in the adventure—the cult of Tharizdun.": "疾病、饥荒、残忍和暴行对斯蒂尔人的影响如此之大，以至于好心的神职人员都被逼到了绝境。献给治疗和慈善之神的小型寺庙在不显眼的建筑中安静地运作，在该地区的小巷和死胡同里可以找到小小的神龛。除此以外，只有一种有组织的信仰在斯蒂尔斯秘密存在，它在冒险中起着核心作用--塔里兹敦的崇拜。",
	"Disease and infection are real concerns in the Styes. Most residents suffer from some form of debilitating condition brought on by the poisonous waste flowing and billowing out of the Alchemists' Quarter, or from the polluted water of the river and harbor. The adventurers are no exception. Anyone who visits the Styes is exposed to a disease known as redface. This affliction causes itching and painful inflammation all over the face, and especially around the eyes.": "疾病和感染是斯蒂尔斯的实际问题。大多数居民都患有某种形式的衰弱症状，这些症状是由炼金术士区流出来的有毒废物，或者由被污染的河水和港口带来的。冒险者们也不例外。任何到过冥河的人都会接触到一种被称为红脸的疾病。这种病会导致全脸发痒和疼痛的炎症，尤其是眼睛周围。",
	"The effects of redface are identical to those of sight rot (see \"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), but it's caused by pollutants in the air rather than contaminated drinking water, making it difficult to avoid. {@disease Sewer plague} (also described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) is common in the Styes as well, but avoiding contact with the district's ubiquitous rodents and vermin is usually sufficient protection against it.": "红脸病的影响与视力腐烂相同（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第八章的\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"），但它是由空气中的污染物而不是受污染的饮用水造成的，因此很难避免。{@disease Sewer plague}（也在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述）在斯蒂尔斯也很常见，但避免与该地区无处不在的啮齿动物和害虫接触，通常就足以保护它。",
	"Map 8.1 shows the layout of the district and the locations of important buildings and land features. The islands that support the buildings are almost all artificial. Some were created by ancient spells used to lift the floor of the bay above the water. Others consist entirely of huge boardwalks supported above the brackish water by decaying pilings.": "地图8.1显示了该区的布局以及重要建筑和土地特征的位置。支撑建筑物的岛屿几乎都是人工的。有些是由古代的法术创造的，用来把海湾的地面抬高到水面之上。其他的则完全由巨大的木板路组成，由腐烂的木桩支撑在咸水之上。",
	"The district is made up of four quarters. Travel from one to the other is either by foot over rickety walkways or by skiff. Local fishers often supplement their income by renting their skiffs as crude water taxis. Most trips cost 1 cp, but a skiff ride to a dangerous section of town usually brings 1 gp or more.": "该区由四个区组成。从一个区到另一个区的旅行，要么是在摇摇欲坠的人行道上步行，要么是乘坐小艇。当地渔民经常通过出租他们的小艇作为粗糙的水上出租车来增加收入。大多数旅行的费用是1cp，但乘坐小艇到城镇的危险区域通常需要1gp或更多。",
	"Also known as Flotsam, the northwest section of the Styes consists mainly of slum tenements, dubious taverns, rickety warehouses, hovel-crowded alleys, and decommissioned ships converted into buildings. This entire area is slowly sinking into the sea. As old buildings become unlivable, new ones are built atop them, and the tangle of structures is four or five stories deep in some places. Many of the lower structures are completely walled off from the outside, making them ideal places for hidden temples and black markets. Swaying rope bridges provide the best avenues between the blocks of this quarter, since the old boardwalks are sinking like everything else.": "冥河的西北部地区也被称为弗洛萨姆（Flotsam），主要由贫民窟的租房、可疑的酒馆、摇摇欲坠的仓库、拥挤的小巷和退役的船只改造成的建筑组成。整个地区正在慢慢沉入大海。随着老建筑变得无法居住，新的建筑就建在它们上面，纠结的结构在某些地方有四、五层楼那么深。许多较低的建筑与外界完全隔绝，使它们成为隐藏的寺庙和黑市的理想场所。摇曳的绳索桥为这一地区的街区之间提供了最好的通道，因为旧的木板路像其他东西一样正在下沉。",
	"The Alchemists' Quarter is the northeast section of the Styes. Long ago, it was the seat of the district's scholastic and religious leadership, but its once-fine temples and universities have long been dismantled for construction materials, or converted into dim, smoky factories and noxious laboratories owned by shady alchemists.": "炼金术士区是斯蒂尔斯的东北部地区。很久以前，这里是该区学术和宗教领袖的所在地，但它曾经的精美的寺庙和大学早已被拆除以获取建筑材料，或被改造成昏暗、冒烟的工厂和由阴暗的炼金术士拥有的有毒的实验室。",
	"With no regulation to speak of in the Styes, alchemists are free to conduct whatever dangerous experiments they like, and to cut corners on safety and quality control. Iron chimneys belch smoke and foul vapors into the air, while liquid and solid waste are dumped into the water around the quarter.": "由于斯蒂尔斯没有任何监管可言，炼金术士可以自由地进行他们喜欢的任何危险实验，并在安全和质量控制方面偷工减料。铁烟囱向空气中喷出浓烟和臭气，而液体和固体废物则被倾倒在该地区周围的水中。",
	"A large part of this area has become so clogged and befouled with refuse that the water now moves only along shallow, sluggish channels that snake through the reeking expanse of mud. Still, it's common to see desperate scavengers wallowing in the filth, scrounging for anything of value that a distracted alchemist might have carelessly tossed out with the trash.": "这片区域的很大一部分已经被垃圾堵塞和玷污，以至于水现在只能沿着浅浅的、迟缓的渠道流动，蜿蜒穿过散发着恶臭的大片泥地。不过，经常可以看到绝望的拾荒者在污秽中沉湎，搜寻任何有价值的东西，而这些东西可能是一个心不在焉的炼金术士不小心扔出去的垃圾。",
	"The seat of local government in better days, this quarter is the southeast section of the Styes. Most of the buildings here were once municipal offices, but only a few are still in operation. All the rest are either deserted or have been rented to strange and furtive eccentrics.": "在较好的时期，这个街区是地方政府的所在地，是斯蒂尔斯的东南区。这里的大多数建筑都曾是市政办公室，但只有少数仍在运作。其余的要么被遗弃，要么被租给了奇怪的、鬼鬼祟祟的怪人。",
	"This section of the district is the least populated, and its often-empty streets and boardwalks are in stark contrast to the crowds that frequent the other three quarters. Militia patrols are common here, but guards in the High Quarter are universally corrupt, accepting bribes from nobles, bureaucrats, and powerful merchants, and extorting protection money from everyone else.": "这个区是人口最少的地方，其经常空荡荡的街道和木板路与其他三个区经常出现的人群形成了鲜明的对比。民兵巡逻在这里很常见，但高区的守卫普遍腐败，他们接受贵族、官僚和有权势的商人的贿赂，并向其他人敲诈保护费。",
	"The southwest section of the Styes hosts most of the district's industry and mercantile efforts. Most of the community's fishers live here, and numerous warehouses line the edges of the quarter. Most of these places are either abandoned and boarded up, or serving as flophouses. Of the four quarters, the Merchants' Quarter is the most welcoming to visitors—though that's not saying much. It's also said to be the healthiest part of the district—but that's not saying much, either.": "斯蒂尔斯的西南区承载了该区大部分的工业和商业努力。社区的大多数渔民都住在这里，无数的仓库分布在该区的边缘。这些地方中的大多数要么被遗弃，要么被封起来，要么被当作食客的房子。在四个区中，商人区是最欢迎游客的地方--尽管这并不意味着什么。据说这里也是该区最健康的地方，但这也说明不了什么。",
	"The most notable buildings in the Styes are described here. A few of these locations are detailed later, but most are left for you to develop as you see fit.": "这里描述了斯蒂尔斯地区最引人注目的建筑。后面会详细介绍其中的几个地点，但大多数是留给你的，你可以根据自己的需要进行开发。",
	"These two stone buildings on a small island in the Merchants' Quarter are the base of operations for Harbor Master Tak Merakin (NE female half-orc {@creature bandit captain}) and her constables (twelve NE human {@creature Thug||thugs}). Tak is profoundly lazy, and as long as merchants and fishers pay their dues without complaining, she doesn't interfere with business on the water. She reacts only to obvious threats such as fires, riots, and storms—and even then, she displays an infuriating lethargy.": "这两座位于商人区的小岛上的石头建筑是港务局局长德-梅拉金（东北半兽人女性，占0%）和她的捕快们（12名东北人类，占1%）的行动基地。塔克非常懒惰，只要商人和渔民不抱怨地支付他们的费用，她就不会干涉水上的生意。她只对明显的威胁做出反应，如火灾、暴乱和风暴--即使如此，她也表现出令人气愤的昏昏欲睡。",
	"This decommissioned stone lighthouse was once a proud beacon welcoming ships, but it functions now as nothing more than a sad Flotsam landmark. When the last caretaker died in a loud argument at a nearby tavern, no one took up her mantle, and the light has fallen into disrepair. After a few more decades of slowly sinking into the soggy seabed, it might end up consumed by shanties and other buildings built atop its corpse.": "这座退役的石灯塔曾经是欢迎船只的骄傲灯塔，但它现在的功能不过是一个悲伤的弗洛萨姆地标。当最后一位看守人在附近的酒馆大声争吵中死去后，没有人接过她的衣钵，这盏灯也就年久失修了。再过几十年，它慢慢沉入潮湿的海底，最终可能会被建在它尸体上的棚屋和其他建筑所吞噬。",
	"This large, open space serves as the primary market for the Styes. The area is always crowded, but the goods for sale here are of low quality and dubious origin.": "这个大型的开放空间是斯蒂尔人的主要市场。这里总是很拥挤，但这里出售的货物质量低下，来源可疑。",
	"This three-story stone building houses the district's militia (some two hundred LE {@creature Guard||guards}, ten {@creature Bandit Captain||bandit captains}, and one {@creature veteran}) in crowded conditions more like a prison than a barracks. A handful of the guards are honest, but they are the exceptions. Most of the militia members are youths who needed a job, and whose ambition was satisfied by becoming paid thugs. The guards' patrol routes are determined entirely by who pays the largest fees for protection. The gallows in front of the garrison seldom lies unused for more than a few days.": "这座三层楼的石头建筑容纳了该区的民兵（约200名LE（%0%）、10名（%1%）和1名（%2%）），拥挤的环境更像是监狱，而不是军营。少数守卫是诚实的，但他们是例外。大多数民兵是需要工作的年轻人，他们的野心通过成为有偿打手而得到满足。卫兵的巡逻路线完全由谁支付最大的保护费来决定。驻军前面的绞刑架很少闲置超过几天的时间。",
	"This once-elegant structure is the traditional seat of the council in the Styes, which is a part of the larger city government in name only. Today, the four councillors who run the district spend most of their time in their own homes and businesses. A small staff of clerks works here, and the councillors hold town meetings in the hall once or twice a month, but most of this structure's other rooms have sat unused for decades.": "这个曾经优雅的建筑是斯蒂尔斯区议会的传统所在地，名义上是大市政府的一部分。今天，管理该区的四位议员大部分时间都在自己的家中和企业中度过。一小部分文员在这里工作，议员们每月在大厅里举行一到两次市政会议，但这个结构的其他房间大多已闲置了几十年。",
	"This modest wood and brick building along the edge of the Alchemists' Quarter is the home of {@creature Master Refrum|GoS} (LG male human {@creature priest}).

	"The lack of a strong religious presence in the Styes means that the task of dealing with the dead falls to the mortuary. This large building is surrounded by a disused graveyard, but the district's dead have long been universally cremated. Those who operate the mortuary are rumored to be thieves, undead, or wererats. The truth is a combination of all three. The master of this morbid structure is Sliris (NE female {@creature wererat}), a devious and secretive member of the council.": "斯蒂尔斯地区缺乏强大的宗教存在，这意味着处理死者的任务落在了停尸房上。这座大型建筑的周围是一个废弃的墓地，但该区的死者早已普遍被火化了。那些经营停尸房的人被传言是小偷、亡灵或狼人。事实是这三者的结合。这个病态结构的主人是斯里里斯（NE女性（%0%）），一个狡猾而神秘的议会成员。",

	"Refrum has few friends in the district, and he is eager to enlist the characters' aid in clearing Jarme Loveage's name. Refrum attended Jarme's execution the previous day, and the memory pains him. Because Jarme spent so much of his time alone, he had no alibi for the murders, but Refrum insists that his friend was a kind and honest man. (If Jarme's sister, Eleanor, is present, she supports Refrum's testimony with tears and pleading.)": "Refrum在这个地区没有什么朋友，他渴望得到这些人物的帮助，以洗刷Jarme Loveage的罪名。Refrum参加了前一天对Jarme的处决，这段记忆让他很痛苦。由于Jarme花了很多时间独处，他没有谋杀的不在场证明，但Refrum坚持认为他的朋友是一个善良和诚实的人。(如果贾梅的姐姐埃莉诺在场，她会用眼泪和恳求来支持雷弗伦的证词）。",
	"Refrum is angry about how Jarme was never properly put on trial. When he tried to meet with Jarme in his cell at Hopene'er Asylum, he was denied access by the militia (secretly paid off by {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}). Faced with this challenge, Refrum launched his own investigation into the Lantern Ghost killings. He describes how the killer had been on the prowl for half a year, striking intermittently and leaving mutilated victims in public locations to be discovered at dawn. He also describes how singularly inept the militia were in their efforts to track down the killer, and how the slayings had pushed the Styes to the brink of chaos.": "Refrum对Jarme从未被适当审判感到愤怒。当他试图在霍普内尔精神病院的牢房里与贾梅见面时，他被民兵（由{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}秘密买通）拒绝了。面对这一挑战，雷弗伦对灯笼鬼杀人事件展开了自己的调查。他描述了凶手是如何潜伏了半年之久，断断续续地出手，将被肢解的受害者留在公共场所，在黎明时分被发现。他还描述了民兵在追踪凶手的过程中是如何的无能为力，以及这些杀戮是如何将Styes推到混乱的边缘的。",
	"Jarme's arrest came after he was found looming over the body of a victim, a dagger clutched in his bloodstained hands. Refrum can't dispute this evidence, but he talks of how Jarme went to the gallows professing to have no memory of any slayings. After the execution, Refrum offered his ability to cast {@spell speak with dead} to learn the truth, but was told by the militia that the case was closed. He was then threatened with incarceration in Hopene'er if he didn't leave the matter alone.": "贾梅的被捕是在他被发现在一具受害者的尸体旁徘徊，沾满血迹的手中紧握着一把匕首之后。雷夫伦对这一证据没有异议，但他谈到贾梅在上绞刑架时自称对任何杀人事件都没有记忆。处决后，雷弗伦提供了他的施法能力（%0%）以了解真相，但被民兵告知此案已经结束。然后，他被威胁说，如果他不放过这件事，就会被关进霍皮内尔监狱。",
	"Part of what drives Refrum's need to exonerate Jarme is his belief that the Lantern Ghost is still killing. Rumors already spreading through the Styes talk of a young fisher named Raif turning up dead the morning after Jarme's execution. The authorities were quick to ship the body to the mortuary for cremation, as if trying to cover up the event—and Refrum sees this as evidence that a sinister conspiracy in the Styes has some connection to the Lantern Ghost killings.": "促使雷弗伦需要为贾梅开脱罪责的部分原因是，他相信灯笼鬼仍然在杀人。已经在斯蒂尔家族中传播的谣言说，在贾梅被处决的第二天早上，一个名叫雷夫的年轻渔民死了。当局很快就把尸体运到停尸房火化了，似乎想掩盖这一事件--雷弗伦认为这就是证据，证明斯蒂尔斯的一个邪恶阴谋与灯笼鬼杀人事件有某种联系。",
	"The priest suspects that agents of this conspiracy used enchantments to control Jarme, forcing him to commit one or more of the murders. When Jarme was caught, they used their influence to have him executed quickly. Now Refrum fears that the conspirators are not only free to continue their work—but that they know he's onto them.": "牧师怀疑这个阴谋的代理人用魔法控制了贾梅，迫使他犯下一个或多个谋杀案。当贾梅被抓后，他们利用自己的影响力迅速将其处决。现在Refrum担心这些阴谋者不仅可以继续他们的工作，而且他们知道他已经发现了他们。",
	"Refrum believes that the authorities are watching him. Moreover, his notoriety as a thorn in the side of the council means that many people are afraid to talk to him. As such, he believes that the characters will be able to gain access to information and witnesses that he can't. The priest suggests that they start their investigation at Hopene'er Asylum ({@area area 11|4c0|x} and below), where Jarme was held for a few days after his capture. Refrum also recommends that the characters track down and speak with Constable Jute, the militia guard who found Jarme crouched over his victim. She can be contacted at the district garrison ({@area area 4|4b9|x} and below).": "Refrum认为，当局正在监视他。此外，他作为议会的眼中钉的恶名意味着许多人都害怕与他交谈。因此，他认为这些人物将能够获得他无法获得的信息和证人。牧师建议他们从霍皮内尔庇护所（{@area area 11|4c0|x}及以下）开始调查，贾梅被抓后曾在那里被关押了几天。Refrum还建议他们追踪并与朱特警员交谈，她是发现贾梅蹲在受害人身上的民兵警卫。可以在地区驻军（{@area area 4|4b9|x}及以下）与她联系。",
	"Refrum intends to leave the Styes and spend a few weeks in hiding for his own safety.

	"When Trantor first meets the characters, she is harried and protests that she has no time for long conversations or prying questions. But as soon as any character mentions Jarme or the Lantern Ghost killings, her attitude changes to one of concern for a lost patient.": "当特兰托第一次见到这些人物时，她很苦恼，并抗议说她没有时间进行长谈或打听问题。但只要有任何人物提到贾梅或灯笼鬼杀人事件，她的态度就会转变为对一个迷路的病人的关心。",
	"Trantor describes Jarme as a quiet sort who was resolute in his claims of innocence. Though the physician has no reason to doubt the evidence suggesting that the fisher committed the murder he was arrested for, she describes Jarme's remorse as far more compelling—and far more believable—than that of any other troubled person she has ever worked with.": "特兰托形容贾梅是个安静的人，他坚定地声称自己是无辜的。尽管医生没有理由怀疑表明渔民犯下了他被逮捕的谋杀案的证据，但她描述贾梅的悔意比她曾经接触过的任何其他问题人物的悔意都更有说服力，也更值得相信。",
	"If the characters ask about visitors during Jarme's short stay at Hopene'er, Trantor tells them that only one person was permitted to see him, on the militia's orders. That visitor was the councillor {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}, whose presence at the asylum struck the physician as both unsettling and odd.": "如果人物问起贾梅在霍皮内尔短暂逗留期间的访客情况，特兰托告诉他们，根据民兵的命令，只有一个人被允许见他。那位访客是议员（%0%），他在精神病院的出现让医生感到不安和奇怪。",

She is noticeably nervous and reticent when first asked about the Lantern Ghost case, as a result of the warnings that she and the other members of the militia have received.

The door can also be smashed open by making a successful DC 18 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check and a lot of noise.": "一条走道环绕着仓库的最高层，现在只作为通往{@dice D5}区的通道。通往(1%)区域的门是铁制的，一直锁着。多里和他所有的卫兵都带着一把钥匙，否则就可以用盗贼的工具，通过DC15的灵巧检查来打开这扇门。也可以通过成功的DC18力量（%2%）检查和大量的噪音来砸开这扇门。",
	"A narrow, rotting walkway with missing boards and no railing surrounds the rusting bulk of this ancient crane. The hull of the ship dangles from the crane's arm, fifty feet above the broad mud pool below.

Steam rises from the hulk, and rivulets of water spill out from between the planks of the hull, raining down to the mud below.": "一条狭窄的、腐烂的人行道，缺少木板，没有栏杆，围绕着这个古老的起重机的生锈的躯体。船体悬在起重机的臂上，离下面宽阔的泥潭有50英尺高。一个木槽将船与附近的水塔连接起来，而悬挂在起重机和船的甲板之间的一座简陋的桥，预示着将有一个危险的攀登。蒸汽从船体上升起，小河水从船体的木板之间溢出，雨点般地落在下面的泥土上。",
	"The walkway around the crane is rickety but is more solid than it looks. The real danger on the walkway and the bridge comes from their uneven surface and the lack of a railing. A character who moves no more than 10 feet per turn and devotes all their attention to watching where they place their feet is in no danger while moving through this area. But a character who moves more quickly or who performs any other action in addition to moving must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}. If the saving throw fails by more than 5, the character slips and falls 60 feet. The fall deals only 10 ({@dice 3d6}) bludgeoning damage because of the soft, deep mud below, but the mud is contaminated. Anyone who falls in must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or contract {@disease sewer plague} (see \"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).": "起重机周围的人行道摇摇欲坠，但比看起来更坚固。人行道和桥的真正危险来自于其不平整的表面和缺乏栏杆。一个角色如果每回合移动不超过10英尺，并把所有的注意力都放在观察他们的脚的位置上，在通过这个区域时就不会有危险。但是如果一个角色移动得更快，或者除了移动之外还做了任何其他的动作，就必须在DC13的灵巧救赎上取得成功，否则就会摔倒（%0%）。如果蓄力动作失败超过5次，角色就会滑倒并跌落60英尺。由于下面是柔软的深泥，坠落时只造成10({@dice 3d6})的重击伤害，但泥浆是被污染的。任何掉入其中的人都必须在DC11宪法救赎中获得成功，否则就会受到{@disease sewer plague}（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的第8章\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"）。",

They confront anyone who tries to cross the footbridge to the ship, simultaneously calling out to alert the ship's occupants.

	"The decrepit-looking hull of a ship is suspended from the crane by massive chains, all of which creak and groan ominously as the ship shifts in the wind. The only apparent access to the vessel's interior is near the bow on the port side.

	"Many of the compartments of this decommissioned hull have been flooded with water so that its aquatic occupants can move about more easily.

	"As the characters move around on the hulk, stress the ominous creaking and groaning from the chains holding it aloft. These chains are solidly attached and there's no danger of the ship crashing to the ground, but it should feel like a dangerous environment. The grate through which water flows into area {@dice D7} isn't locked or trapped, but lifting it open creates a lot of noise unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check while doing so. Once the grate is open, characters can drop down into area {@dice D7}.": "当人物在废船上走动时，强调不祥的吱吱嘎嘎的呻吟声来自高举的铁链。这些铁链连接得很牢固，船没有坠落到地面的危险，但它应该感觉是一个危险的环境。水流进入{@dice D7}区域的栅栏并没有被锁住或困住，但把它掀开会产生很大的噪音，除非有人在掀开时成功地进行DC15灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）的检查。一旦闸门被打开，人物就可以下降到区域（%2%）。",
	"The chains holding the ship aloft are too sturdy to be broken by any quick or simple method.

Clouds of smoke rise and escape through the grate above, billowing from a pair of roaring boilers near the bow, bolted to the deck and walls on either side of a large pool of steaming water. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the compartment are thick and shiny with condensation and mildew.": "这个船舱里的空气是令人压抑的湿热。烟云从上面的炉排升起并逸出，从船头附近的一对咆哮的锅炉中飘出，这些锅炉用螺栓固定在一个大的蒸水池两边的甲板和墙壁上。船舱的墙壁、地板和天花板都被冷凝水和霉菌弄得又厚又亮。",

	"The water in areas {@dice D7}, {@dice D8}, and {@dice D9} isn't boiling, but it is uncomfortably hot and exceedingly foul.

	"Harid is cunning and clever. If combat breaks out here, he remains hidden in the water while the skum do the fighting. He makes a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check in an attempt to hide. As long as he remains unnoticed, his first attack can still benefit from the Assassinate trait after the first round of the fight.": "哈里德很狡猾，很聪明。如果战斗在这里爆发，他将隐藏在水中，而斯库姆人则进行战斗。他做了一个灵巧（（%0%））的检查，试图隐藏。只要他不被注意，他的第一次攻击在战斗的第一轮后仍然可以受益于刺杀特性。",
	"On the Whisperer's orders, Harid offered his services to {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}. But his actual purpose here is to keep an eye on Dory, whom the Whisperer does not trust. Dory suspects this subterfuge, of course, and so he keeps Harid confined to this compartment. Because Harid has no loyalty to Dory, he might stay hidden in the murky water if the skum are dispatched quickly. Then after everyone else leaves the ship, he'll eventually make his way back to the temple of Tharizdun to rejoin his master.

Several of the Tharizdun cultists were turned to skum to better serve Sgothgah, but Dory was too clever and important to be reduced to a simple thrall. Sgothgah granted him superior durability, along with magical talents, but at the cost of his partial transformation into a creature similar to a skum. Dory maintains his outwardly human appearance, but he must spend as much time as possible in a hot, wet environment to maintain his physical form. Otherwise, he develops lesions as the aboleth's magic causes his body to rot away. After a few minutes away from a wet environment, his skin takes on a waxy sheen, while boils and ulcers form on his body. Anywhere other than the Styes he would have been ostracized long ago, but in this squalid, lawless place he has managed to turn his new talents to his advantage.": "关于多莉可怕的皮肤状况的传闻有一部分是真的。有几个塔里兹敦的崇拜者被变成了斯哥特加的人，以便更好地服务于斯哥特加，但多里太聪明太重要了，不能沦为一个简单的侍从。斯哥特加赋予他超强的耐久性，以及魔法天赋，但代价是他部分变成了类似于斯库姆的生物。多里保持着他外在的人类外表，但他必须尽可能多地呆在湿热的环境中以保持他的身体形态。否则，他就会出现病变，因为aboleth的魔法导致他的身体腐烂。离开潮湿的环境几分钟后，他的皮肤就会呈现出蜡质光泽，同时在他的身体上形成疖子和溃疡。在斯蒂尔斯以外的任何地方，他早就被排斥了，但在这个肮脏的、无法无天的地方，他成功地把他的新天赋变成了自己的优势。",
	"Any intrusion into this area draws an immediate attack from {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}), who has likely been alerted by fighting elsewhere. The aberration does not fight alone. Sgothgah recently bestowed another gift on the councillor—a unique {@creature flesh golem} made from {@creature fish|GoS}, monstrous lobsters, sharks, and octopi, and with the head of a humanoid female. Dory keeps the golem in this chamber as a guardian, concealed under the water.": "任何对这个区域的入侵都会引来{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}（见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）的立即攻击，他很可能已经被其他地方的战斗所惊动。反常者并不单独作战。斯戈特加最近又给议员送了一份礼物--一个独特的{@creature flesh golem}，由{@creature fish|GoS}、畸形的龙虾、鲨鱼和章鱼制成，并有一个人形女性的头。多里把这个石像放在这个房间里作为守护者，隐藏在水底。",
	"If Dory is aware of the characters' approach, he casts {@spell invisibility} on himself before they arrive here. While the golem holds intruders at bay, Dory retreats to the far corner of the room and uses Eye of Corruption to weaken the most threatening character. He then follows up with {@spell cloudkill}, catching the victim of Eye of Corruption. He uses {@spell fear} to drive the characters away from him and, with luck, into the lingering {@spell cloudkill} spell. Finally, he mixes {@spell fireball} and his melee attacks to finish off the party.

That doesn't mean he won't nurse his grudge for a few months, then come back seeking revenge against the characters for ruining his fun.": "多里愿意放弃这些信息，因为他知道它在斯蒂尔斯的时间即将结束--他想尽可能多地引发最后的混乱。如果他不能利用邪教来达到自己的目的，他希望人物能够寻找并屠杀其成员。但这并不意味着他不会在几个月内怀恨在心，然后回来寻求对人物的报复，因为他们破坏了他的乐趣。",
	"The wicker plate on the desk is heaped with strange and hideous {@creature fish|GoS}, their bodies burst as if from internal pressure.

Four {@creature Chuul||chuuls} have also become haunted by the dark god's sendings, and were driven to seek out the cult in the Styes. Being near the temple soothes their psychic torment, so they spend most of their time hidden in a secret, submerged grotto beneath areas T4 and T5.

	"The aboleth doesn't reveal its presence unless a tempting target approaches within its 10-foot reach of the flooded stairwell. It can also use its Enslave attack from under the water against a creature it can see.": "除非有诱人的目标接近它在被淹没的楼梯间的10英尺范围内，否则aboleth不会暴露它的存在。它也可以从水底对它能看到的生物使用奴役攻击。",
	"If all four chuuls are killed and the characters are aware that their real enemy is in the water, Sgothgah awaits the characters in the submerged chamber below this area.": "如果四个丘尔都被杀死了，而且角色们意识到他们真正的敌人在水中，斯哥特加就会在这个区域下面的潜水室中等待角色们。",
	"Sgothgah recognizes that accomplished adventurers would be highly useful servants in its conflict against the aboleths sent from the Endless Nadir, and it tries to keep at least three of the characters alive if it can. If the battle appears to be turning against the characters, Sgothgah contacts one of them telepathically (without identifying itself) to demand their surrender. If that demand is refused, the aboleth softens it to a request that they accept a temporary truce and agrees to answer a few questions.": "Sgothgah认识到，在与无尽纳迪尔派来的aboleths的冲突中，有成就的冒险者将是非常有用的仆人，如果可以的话，它试图让至少三个人物活着。如果战斗看起来对角色不利，斯哥特加会用心灵感应联系其中一个角色（不表明自己的身份），要求他们投降。如果这个要求被拒绝，阿布雷斯就会软化为要求他们接受临时停战，并同意回答几个问题。",
	"The aboleth has no intention of dealing with the characters honestly, since inferior beings don't merit such treatment. Using its Probing Telepathy, it discerns each character's greatest desire, then uses this information against the party, promising each character what it knows the character wants in exchange for nothing more than being allowed to spend a few more months in the temple. After that time, Sgothgah promises, it will return to the unfathomable depths of the ocean and never bother humanity again.": "Aboleth并不打算诚实地对待这些角色，因为低等生物不值得这样对待。它用它的探知心灵感应，发现了每个角色的最大愿望，然后用这些信息来对付党，向每个角色许诺它知道该角色想要的东西，换来的只是被允许在神庙中多呆几个月。Sgothgah承诺，在那之后，它将回到深不可测的海洋深处，不再打扰人类。",
	"If the characters have put together a sense of the aboleth's plots, Sgothgah admits that it is raising a kraken, but it claims that the creature is meant to be used against its enemies in an ongoing civil war between opposing factions of the aboleth civilization. It claims that those enemies are already probing the aboleth's defenses around the Styes, and are just as much a threat to the district and its people as to it. If the characters are so inclined, Sgothgah says, it could use their help in driving them off—concocting some far-flung suicide mission for them on the spot.": "如果人物对aboleth的阴谋有了感性的认识，Sgothgah承认它正在养一只克拉肯，但它声称这种生物是为了在aboleth文明的对立派别之间的持续内战中用来对付它的敌人。它声称，这些敌人已经在试探阿波利斯人在斯蒂尔斯周围的防御，而且对该地区及其人民的威胁与它一样大。Sgothgah说，如果这些人物有这样的倾向，它可以利用他们的帮助把他们赶走--当场为他们安排一些远距离的自杀任务。",
	"Sgothgah freely weaves lies, truths, half-truths, and the characters' desires into the conversation. As long as doing so is believable, Sgothgah offers and promises anything—because the cunning creature has no intention of ever delivering. All it wants is for at least three promising victims to come close enough to the pool for it to use a lair action to send forth a grasping tide, pulling the characters into the water in an attempt to infect and enslave them.": "斯戈特加自由地将谎言、真相、半真半假和人物的欲望编入对话。只要这样做是可信的，斯戈特加提供和承诺任何东西--因为这个狡猾的生物无意于兑现。它只想让至少三个有希望的受害者靠近水池，让它用一个巢穴动作发出抓人的潮水，把人物拉到水中，试图感染和奴役他们。",
	"The shark hanging above the stairs serves as the altar in this evil place. The cult routinely kidnaps beggars, vagrants, and lost children and sacrifices them to the dark god, saving their heads and affixing them to the shark. Eventually, the carcass will rot to the point where it tears loose from the ropes and falls into the water to be eaten by scavengers. When that happens, the cult members celebrate the occasion, hunt down a replacement shark, and start the cycle again.": "悬挂在楼梯上方的鲨鱼是这个邪恶地方的祭坛。邪教组织经常绑架乞丐、流浪者和迷路的孩子，并将他们献给黑暗之神，保存他们的头颅并将其贴在鲨鱼身上。最终，尸体会腐烂到从绳索上扯下来，掉入水中被食腐动物吃掉。当这种情况发生时，邪教成员会庆祝这一时刻，追捕一条替代鲨鱼，并再次开始循环。",

	"Also inside the hollow is an object sealed inside a tightly sewn oilcloth—an {@item Instrument of the Bards, Cli Lyre||instrument of the bards (Cli lyre)} found by a cultist years before. The lyre is the cult's greatest treasure, and has been kept as a gift for the leader that the cultists hoped would someday come to them. (They offered the lyre to Sgothgah, but the aboleth had no use for it.)": "在这个空洞里，还有一个被封在缝得严严实实的油布里的东西--一个多年前由一个邪教徒发现的（%0%）。这把琴是邪教的至宝，一直被作为礼物送给邪教成员希望有一天能来到他们身边的领袖。(他们把琴声献给了斯哥特加，但阿波利斯人对它没有用处）。",
	"The submerged tunnel snakes westward for nearly a mile, and is flooded along its entire length.

	"If the characters return to the Styes without exploring the area further, any of the folk in the Styes can tell the story of Landgrave's Folly (as detailed in the next section) in response to hearing about the spire that the characters spotted jutting out of the waves. If the characters investigate the temple and take on the final section of the adventure immediately, the background story of Landgrave's Folly can be filled in after they return to the Styes.": "如果角色们没有进一步探索该地区就返回冥河，那么冥河中的任何一个人都可以在听到角色们发现的突出于海浪的尖顶后讲述土地公爵的愚蠢的故事（详见下一节）。如果角色们调查了神庙并立即进行了冒险的最后一节，那么土地公爵的愚蠢的背景故事就可以在他们回到斯蒂尔斯之后补上。",
	"At the height of the Styes' long-ago glory, a local eccentric noble named Bryson Landgrave announced his intention to discover what lay on the underside of the world. To that end, he ordered the digging of a great pit that would eventually lead to whatever was there. Locals dismissed the effort as mad, but the noble was rich, and no one complained about the wages he offered to diggers.": "在斯蒂尔家族长期以来的辉煌时期，当地一位名叫布赖森-兰特公爵的古怪贵族宣布，他打算探索世界底层的东西。为此，他下令挖掘一个大坑，最终将通向那里的任何东西。当地人认为这种努力是疯狂的，但这位贵族很富有，没有人抱怨他给挖掘者的工资。",
	"For reasons no one could comprehend, Landgrave chose to excavate down through the solid rock beneath a small islet a mile or so west of the Styes. The work went well at the start. But then workers began to perish in bizarre or mysterious accidents. In an attempt to counter his ill luck, the noble commissioned the construction of a temple (using material removed from the hole) at the dig site to confer blessings on his work. As Landgrave's luck would have it, on the night the temple was to be consecrated, a violent earthquake struck the islet, which sank into the sea and took the pit, the temple, all but a handful of workers, and Landgrave himself with it. Only the temple's spire is still visible above the waves as a testament to what becomes of rich fools, and the site became known as Landgrave's Folly.": "由于没有人能够理解的原因，Landgrave选择在冥河以西一英里左右的一个小小岛下面通过坚固的岩石向下挖掘。工作开始时很顺利。但随后工人们开始在离奇或神秘的事故中丧生。为了消除他的厄运，这位贵族委托在挖掘现场建造了一座寺庙（使用从洞中取出的材料），以赐予他的工作以祝福。就像Landgrave的运气一样，在神庙即将举行仪式的那天晚上，一场剧烈的地震袭击了小岛，小岛沉入海中，将坑、神庙、除少数工人外的所有工人和Landgrave本人一起带走。只有神庙的尖顶还能在海浪上看到，作为有钱的傻瓜的证明，这个地方被称为 \"土地公爵的愚蠢\"。",
	"Landgrave's Folly is where Sgothgah has hidden the growing kraken, in the pit at the bottom of the flooded, ruined temple.

	"As the characters approach Landgrave's Folly after either defeating Sgothgah, making a deal with the aboleth, or succumbing to its enslavement, the two aboleths from the Endless Nadir are arguing over what is to be done with the kraken.

Neither of them understands the juvenile kraken's intentions or suspects that a party of determined adventurers is about to interrupt their plans.": "当角色们在击败斯哥特加、与阿波勒斯达成交易或屈服于它的奴役之后，接近陆上公爵府时，来自无尽纳迪尔的两个阿波勒斯正在争论如何处理克拉肯的事。一个人想奴役它，另一个人认为它必须被摧毁。他们都不了解幼年海怪的意图，也没有怀疑一队坚定的冒险家即将打断他们的计划。",
	"The temple at Landgrave's Folly, shown in map 8.4, is in ruins and under 40 feet or more of water, though its weed-encrusted spire extends above the ocean surface even at high tide.

	"Below the water looms the dark bulk of a sunken temple. Looming up and out of the briny murk is the temple's spire, which appears to have been struck by more than one unfortunate ship, judging by the chunks missing from it. The temple lists toward the north, its roof and walls draped with seaweed and festooned with barnacles. The building's facade is a mess of partially collapsed walls and ruined scaffolding, making it appear as though the site was still under construction when it sank. But it's hard to tell which parts weren't finished and which parts were damaged by the collapse.": "水面下隐约可见一座沉没的寺庙的黑体。寺庙的尖顶在盐水的浑浊中若隐若现，从其上缺失的大块头来看，它似乎已经被不止一艘不幸的船撞击过了。寺庙朝北排列，其屋顶和墙壁上挂满了海藻，并有藤壶。建筑物的外墙是由部分倒塌的墙壁和毁坏的脚手架组成的，这使它看起来好像在沉没时该地仍在施工。但是很难说哪些部分没有完工，哪些部分被坍塌损坏。",
	"Most of the roof is gone from the belfry beneath the upthrust spire, but portions of the walls and their arched windows remain. A seaweed-tangled staircase descends deeper into the flooded tower.": "上升的尖顶下的钟楼的大部分屋顶已经消失，但部分墙壁及其拱形的窗户仍然存在。一条被海藻缠住的楼梯深入到被水淹没的塔楼中。",
	"Sgothgah's advanced magical knowledge has allowed it to set up dozens of wards to protect the temple, each treated as a casting of {@spell glyph of warding} using the explosive runes option.

A fight isn't inevitable, however.": "对于无尽的纳迪尔的代理人来说，失败是不可能的，如果到了那个时候，亚博拉斯人就会拼死一搏。这里不是这些生物的巢穴，所以它们不能使用巢穴行动或区域效果。如果角色们在战斗中需要一些帮助，其中一个亚博莱思可能会离坑太近而被{@creature juvenile kraken|GoS}拉进去；更多信息见下一节。然而，战斗并不是不可避免的。",
	"These aboleths have two goals: to kill Sgothgah and to deal with the kraken, either by destroying it or capturing it. If the characters don't instantly jump to the attack and can demonstrate that they aren't enslaved by Sgothgah—or, better yet, that they have killed the rogue aboleth—they can engage these aboleths in diplomacy regarding their desire to kill or enslave the kraken.": "这些aboleths有两个目标：杀死斯哥特加和对付克拉肯，要么毁掉它，要么抓住它。如果角色们没有立即跳出来攻击，并且能够证明他们没有被斯哥特加奴役，或者，最好是，他们已经杀死了流氓亚博体育官网，他们就可以就他们想要杀死或奴役克拉肯的愿望与这些亚博体育官网进行外交谈判。",
	"The aboleths might respond to a number of different arguments:": "Aboleths可能会对一些不同的论点作出回应。",
	"Even if the aboleths can enslave the kraken now, the creature is still growing and will eventually break free of their control. Even a gang of aboleths is no match for a full-grown kraken, so the creature should be destroyed for the aboleths' own safety.": "即使波利士现在能奴役克拉肯，这个生物仍在成长，最终会挣脱他们的控制。即使是一帮海洋生物也不是成年海怪的对手，所以为了海洋生物的安全，应该消灭这个生物。",
	"The kraken's substantial intellect has been hopelessly tainted by exposure to Sgothgah's religious beliefs. All gods are anathema to aboleths, so the kraken should be destroyed before its poisoned thoughts can influence others.": "由于接触到斯哥特加的宗教信仰，克拉肯的实质性智力已经无可救药地被玷污了。所有的神都是亚伯拉罕人的禁忌，所以应该在这只克拉肯被毒害的思想影响他人之前将其消灭。",
	"Nothing in the sea can match the strength of a kraken, and the aboleths might never again have the opportunity to take control of such a weapon in their fight against the gods. The creature must be enslaved and forced to serve them.": "海中没有任何东西能与海怪的力量相提并论，而亚伯拉罕人可能再也没有机会在与诸神的斗争中控制这样一种武器了。这种生物必须被奴役，被迫为他们服务。",
	"If the players would rather not roleplay a telepathic argument with highly intelligent alien minds, they can lead the aboleths toward one option or the other with a successful DC 20 group Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If negotiations break down or if the characters give the aboleths a reason to be paranoid (which is easy to do, given their natural inclinations), these creatures attack.": "如果玩家不愿意扮演与高智商的外星头脑进行心灵感应的争论，他们可以通过成功的DC20团体魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查来引导boleths走向一个选项。如果谈判破裂，或者如果角色们给boleths一个偏执的理由（考虑到它们的自然倾向，这很容易做到），这些生物就会发动攻击。",
	"The light that fills the pit originates in the flicker of intricate magical sigils that cover its top edge and the upper twenty feet of its walls. Those sigils are woven into a complex tapestry of magical light, undulating and writhing like an obscene carpet of snakes. Below their pulsing glow, the pit descends into utter darkness.": "充满深坑的光线来自于覆盖深坑顶部边缘和墙壁上部20英尺的复杂的魔法符号的闪烁。这些符号被编织成一个复杂的魔法光织锦，像一条淫秽的蛇毯一样起伏蠕动。在它们脉动的光芒之下，深坑陷入了彻底的黑暗。",
	"Landgrave's dedication to his mad goal is demonstrated by the success of his doomed digging effort. The pit that opens up inside the temple is hundreds of feet deep and pitch black below the uppermost 20 feet. But the creature that lurks within is much closer than that.": "Landgrave对他的疯狂目标的执着表现在他注定要失败的挖掘工作的成功上。寺庙内开出的深坑有数百英尺深，最上面的20英尺以下漆黑一片。但潜伏在里面的生物却比这更接近。",
	"The {@creature juvenile kraken|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) normally lurks several hundred feet down in the pit, but its hunger has steadily drawn it up higher. Its progress is slow because it must acclimate to the decreasing pressure as it rises. It now lurks 40 feet below the edge of the pit, concealed in the inky-dark water. If it senses activity in the water above or at the lip of the pit, it races up and strikes.": "{@creature juvenile kraken|GoS}（见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}）通常潜伏在几百英尺深的坑里，但它的饥饿感将它不断地吸引到高处。它的进展很慢，因为它必须适应上升过程中不断降低的压力。它现在潜伏在坑的边缘以下40英尺，隐藏在墨色的水中。如果它感觉到上方或坑口的水里有活动，它就会飞快地跑上去，进行攻击。",
	"Although still immature, the kraken is already monstrous to behold, with oily, dark green flesh, 20-foot-long arms, and a ravenous mouth lined with hundreds of dagger-like teeth. Its enormous eyes are surrounded by an aura of red energy, the mark of the power channeled into it. The glyph with which Sgothgah branded the creature takes the form of a blue-black mark resembling the spiral sign of Tharizdun. The flesh surrounding the spiral is scarred by ulcers and sores; the energy channeled into it sometimes erupts spontaneously and rots away its flesh.": "虽然还没有成熟，但克拉肯已经是个怪物了，它有油腻的深绿色肉体，20英尺长的手臂，以及一张长着数百颗匕首般的牙齿的贪婪的嘴。它巨大的眼睛被红色能量的光环所包围，这是注入它的力量的标志。斯戈特加给这个生物打上的字形是一个蓝黑色的标记，类似于塔里兹敦的螺旋标志。螺旋周围的肉体被溃疡和溃烂所覆盖；注入它的能量有时会自发爆发，并使其肉体腐烂。",
	"The kraken understands from Sgothgah's constant whispering that it has a great, unknown destiny. It was content to let Sgothgah serve its needs as it grew, but it had already decided to kill the aboleth once Sgothgah's usefulness had run its course. The kraken has no interest in cooperating with anyone. Its only fear is dying before it becomes monarch of the sea, so if it is reduced to 40 hit points or fewer, it stops fighting and focuses on escape.": "克拉肯从斯戈特加不断的低语中明白，它有一个伟大而未知的命运。它满足于让斯哥特加在成长过程中满足它的需要，但它已经决定一旦斯哥特加的用处用完了，就杀掉这个亚伯拉罕。克拉肯对与任何人合作都没有兴趣。它唯一害怕的是在成为海洋君主之前死去，所以如果它的命中率降到40点或更低，它就会停止战斗，专注于逃跑。",
	"The glowing marks that writhe around the pit are a unique magical channeling device concocted by Sgothgah. The two aboleths from the Endless Nadir didn't recognize it or understand its purpose, which led to their hesitation about attacking the kraken. If the characters heard {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}'s explanation of how the cultists are incubating their spawn in the fear and misery of the Styes, the players might figure out the function of this magical conduit. Otherwise, a character who has proficiency in {@skill Arcana} who studies the glyph for a few minutes and succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check determines its purpose.": "在坑周围蠕动的发光印记是斯哥特加炮制的一种独特的魔法传导装置。来自无尽的纳迪尔的两个亚博体育登录入口并不认识它，也不了解它的用途，这导致他们对攻击克拉肯犹豫不决。如果角色们听到了（%0%）的解释，即邪教徒是如何在斯蒂尔人的恐惧和痛苦中孵化他们的卵子的，那么玩家可能会弄清楚这个魔法导管的功能。否则，精通（%%1）的角色研究石刻几分钟，并在DC18智力（（%%2%））检查中成功，就能确定它的用途。",
	"The pit's magic acts as a beacon for negative emotional energy generated within five miles of it, drawing wisps of all such energy from the dismal environment of the Styes. Channeled through the unholy symbol of Tharizdun that the kraken bears, that energy accelerates the kraken's growth and fuels its hostility. Normally such a beast would take decades to reach maturity, but Sgothgah's magic has reduced that time to mere months—and now the kraken will reach maturity in only a few weeks unless it is destroyed.": "这个深坑的魔力是它周围五英里范围内产生的负面情绪能量的灯塔，从斯蒂尔斯的恶劣环境中吸引着所有这些能量的丝丝缕缕。通过克拉肯身上的邪恶符号Tharizdun的引导，这些能量加速了克拉肯的成长并助长了它的敌意。通常情况下，这样的野兽需要几十年的时间才能成熟，但斯哥特加的魔法将这一时间缩短到了短短几个月--现在，除非摧毁它，否则克拉肯将在短短几周内达到成熟。",
	"The magic of the pit can be destroyed with a successful casting of {@spell dispel magic} (DC 19), or by physically destroying the sigils on the floor of area L3 and the similar marks on the top 20 feet of the pit wall. The floor and the pit each have AC 17; 75 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other damage while the magic endures.": "坑道的魔法可以通过成功施放{@spell dispel magic}(DC19)来摧毁，或者通过物理方式摧毁L3区域地板上的符号和坑道墙壁顶部20英尺的类似标记。地板和坑洞都有AC17；75点命中率；对坏死、毒药和精神伤害免疫；在魔法持续期间对所有其他伤害有抵抗力。",
	"To end the killings that have been plaguing the Styes, the characters need only slay Sgothgah. But killing the aboleth won't save the Styes from the doom lurking in Landgrave's Folly.": "为了结束困扰斯蒂尔人的杀戮，角色们只需要杀死斯戈特加。但是，杀死阿波勒斯并不能将斯蒂尔人从潜伏在土地公爵府的厄运中拯救出来。",
	"If the characters don't destroy the juvenile kraken (or at least wound it badly enough that it flees, after which they destroy the magic of the pit), it eventually kills the two squabbling aboleths and begins a reign of terror.": "如果角色们不摧毁幼年克拉肯（或至少把它伤得很重，以至于它逃走，之后他们破坏了坑的魔力），它最终会杀死两个争吵不休的aboleths，开始恐怖的统治。",
	"The creature starts to systematically destroy any ships and fishing boats sailing past Landgrave's Folly, and seemingly for sport it periodically slithers up to the Styes to pluck hapless victims from its sagging docks. The cultists of Tharizdun are able to foresee the kraken's strikes and can appease it with sacrifices, and their status in the district quickly improves. Eventually, the cult leaders replace the councillors as rulers of the Styes. Defeating the kraken and its growing cult becomes much more difficult at that point, though it could make for an exciting follow-up adventure.": "这个怪物开始有计划地摧毁任何驶过土地公爵府的船只和渔船，而且似乎是为了运动，它定期溜到冥河边，从下垂的码头上捞起无助的受害者。塔里兹敦的崇拜者能够预见到海怪的袭击，并能用祭品来安抚它，他们在该地区的地位迅速提高。最终，邪教领袖们取代了议员们成为斯蒂尔斯的统治者。在这一点上，打败克拉肯和它不断增长的邪教变得更加困难，尽管这可以成为一个令人兴奋的后续冒险。"
