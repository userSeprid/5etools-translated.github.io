	"Some adventurers—those brave and foolish do-gooders—may just follow adventure, wherever it might lead. When these characters witness and thwart the attack on the Wayside Inn, the natural course of events leads them next to Leilon, and from there into the larger plots and machinations of the antagonists in the campaign.": "有些冒险家--那些勇敢而愚蠢的好人--可能只是追随冒险，无论它可能导致什么。当这些人物目睹并挫败了对路边旅馆的攻击时，事件的自然进程将他们引向雷隆，并从那里进入运动中敌对者的大阴谋和阴谋。",

It was also a port where merchants sometimes offloaded goods on barges (since most ships cannot pass the town's shallow mud flats) to be transferred to cities along the Sword Coast.": "雷隆（Leilon）曾经是一个采矿镇，向沃特德普出售铜、镍和银。它也是一个港口，商人们有时会用驳船卸下货物（因为大多数船只无法通过镇上的浅滩），然后转运到剑海岸的城市。",
	"Two hundred years ago, the wizard Thalivar made his home here and raised a tower at the town center to conduct his mystical studies.

	"The Spellplague, a divine phenomenon that twisted Faerûn's magic, corrupted the tower's defenses. The creatures sealed within were freed to attack Leilon, and the magic of the planar beacon was redirected back into the Material Plane, causing humanoids who looked upon it to become paralyzed. Leilon was quickly overrun and subsequently abandoned and has remained that way for more than a century.": "咒语瘟疫，一种扭曲法鲁恩魔法的神圣现象，腐蚀了塔的防御系统。被封印在里面的生物被释放出来攻击Leilon，平面信标的魔法被重新导向物质世界，导致看着它的人类变得麻痹。Leilon很快被占领，随后被遗弃，并一直保持了一个多世纪。",
	"The first action the soldiery of Neverwinter took in Leilon was to destroy the planar beacon inside the House of Thalivar.

	"Before its fall, Leilon was defended by a loosely organized group of adventurers called the Swords of Leilon. When the House of Thalivar released its monsters, the Swords fought to cover the escape of the townsfolk. They died, becoming ghosts bound to Leilon's ruins. They now watch the rebuilding of the town with caution, hoping that the reconstructed tower does not bring similar disaster.": "在沦陷之前，雷隆被一群松散的冒险者保卫着，他们被称为雷隆之剑。当塔利瓦家族释放其怪物时，剑士们为掩护镇民逃跑而战斗。他们死了，变成了被束缚在雷隆废墟上的幽灵。他们现在小心翼翼地观察着小镇的重建，希望重建后的塔不会带来类似的灾难。",

On a failure, the character gains a level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "在岛上过夜的人物会做一些模糊的、预言性的梦，梦见未来的冒险。例如，这个角色可能会看到风暴云在雷隆上空旋转，看到一艘用骨头做成的大帆船，或者看到一个站在峡谷中的发光的矮人雕像。在夜晚结束时，角色必须做一个DC13智慧救赎。如果成功，该角色会得到怪梦的支持并获得（%0%）。如果失败，角色将获得（%1%）的等级。",
	"This shrine to Lathander, god of light, was the first temple to be reconstructed in Leilon.

	"The Leilon town square has become a place where local vendors and those passing through town can set up stalls to sell their wares. One vendor, a female human blacksmith named Zana Taylish, is a resident of Leilon who sells armor and weapons.

	"Martisha is thankful, but not ebullient in her praise or her rewards. She offers the characters food for their efforts, but not drink or lodging.

	"Backes keeps the ale flowing all night for the adventurers. He tells them that he gave up a life as a privateer (that is, a pirate) to get into business on land.

He wears a pendant around his neck in the shape of a trident, which he says the crew of his last ship wore as a way to appease the many sea gods.": "巴克斯让冒险家们整晚都在喝啤酒。他告诉他们，他放弃了私掠者（也就是海盗）的生活，开始在陆地上做生意。他在酒吧工作并协助玛蒂莎，但他希望有一天能在永夜城或水底城开自己的店。他的脖子上戴着一个三叉戟形状的吊坠，他说他上一艘船的船员戴着这个吊坠是为了安抚众多海神。",
	"Cooragh only emerges from the kitchen long enough to thank the adventurers and give them a piece of her special pork pie. It is very spicy, but delicious for those who can stomach the burn.

It was a foolish youthful folly, she says.": "库拉赫从厨房出来的时间只够感谢冒险家们，并给他们一块她特制的猪肉馅饼。它非常辣，但对那些能忍受灼热的人来说很美味。在她的脖子上，每只耳朵下面，都有弯曲的匕首的纹身。如果被问及，她承认她得到了它们，因为她知道这会让她的母亲，一个来自卢斯坎的人类感到不安。她说，这是一个愚蠢的年轻的愚蠢行为。",
	"The smith who works at the Wayside Inn smithy is a strapping woman called Teega who can wield a hammer in each hand like a titan. Her anvil is forged in the shape of a dolphin, and at night she drinks at the bar with the other patrons. She met Backes after his life as a pirate ended, and she hopes to join him in setting up a business in a city at some point.

She proudly displays three suits of plate armor that she created, each bearing the same symbol as the design of her bracers.": "在Wayside Inn铁匠铺工作的铁匠是一个魁梧的女人，名叫Teega，她可以像泰坦一样双手挥舞铁锤。她的铁砧被锻造成海豚的形状，晚上她和其他顾客在酒吧喝酒。在巴斯克斯的海盗生活结束后，她认识了他，她希望在某个时候能和他一起在一个城市里建立起一个企业。她在业余时间制作珠宝，戴着一套形似三道闪电的青铜手镯。她自豪地展示着她制作的三套板甲，每套板甲上都有与她的手镯设计相同的符号。",
	"A young halfling named Silla Scalesweep sits at a table, humming to herself. She is traveling from Neverwinter to Leilon, hoping to get hired on as a fisher by Valdi Estapaar, the woman in charge of the fishery in the town. She wears her long hair in five braids atop her head, and she is very talkative. She also plays the harmonica quite well and is keen to have an audience.": "一个名叫Silla Scalesweep的年轻半身人坐在桌前，自顾自地哼着歌。她从永夜镇来到雷隆镇，希望能被瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔雇佣为渔夫，她是该镇渔业的女负责人。她的长发在头顶上扎成五个辫子，她非常健谈。她的口琴也吹得很好，很想有一个听众。",

	"Feel free to populate the rest of the inn with travelers and staff. There are servers, farmers who work small fields nearby that supply the inn with food in return for protection and shelter on the inn's land, farmers who provide meat and milk, and other laborers. A few of these people came here because of Backes, and they serve him within the Cult of Talos.": "请自由地将客栈的其他部分与旅行者和工作人员填充在一起。有服务员，有在附近小田里工作的农民，他们为客栈提供食物，以换取客栈土地上的保护和庇护，还有提供肉类和牛奶的农民，以及其他劳动者。这些人中有几个是因为巴斯克斯而来到这里的，他们在塔洛斯教内为他服务。",
	"Some of the workers at the Wayside Inn are members of the Cult of Talos. This information should be hidden from the characters until it is ready to be revealed later in the adventure. Placing bad guys in the party's path before it is ready to be revealed is always a risk, but it is a great shock when it pays off.": "路边旅馆的一些工人是塔洛斯教派的成员。这个信息应该对角色们隐藏起来，直到在冒险的后期准备揭开它。在准备好揭开谜底之前，把坏人放在党的道路上总是有风险的，但当它得到回报时，会有很大的震撼。",
	"The best way to allay suspicion is to have the characters become friends with them early, especially during this opening encounter. The secret cultists can heap praise, rewards, free drinks, and information upon the adventurers, gaining their trust and friendship.": "打消怀疑的最好办法是让人物尽早与他们成为朋友，特别是在这个开场的遭遇中。秘密的邪教组织可以对冒险者进行赞美、奖励、免费饮料和信息，以获得他们的信任和友谊。",
	"This long con works best when you provide details that might later prove to be portents of the truth, if not actual clues. For example, the necklace worn by Backes is noteworthy early in the adventure, and it becomes clear later what it represents.": "当你提供一些细节，即使不是真正的线索，也可能被证明是真相的预兆时，这种长骗局的效果最好。例如，巴斯克斯戴的项链在冒险的早期就值得注意，后来它代表了什么就很清楚了。",
	"On the off chance that your players figure things out too quickly (or if someone is already familiar with the adventure), details can be changed. Backes is the leader of the Talos cultists at the inn, but he doesn't have to be. Maybe Cooragh the cook is really the leader, and Backes is just a patsy she is using to throw suspicion off herself. With just a few adjustments, you can keep your players guessing even after they think they know what's happening.": "如果你的玩家很快就想明白了（或者如果有人已经熟悉了这个冒险），可以改变细节。巴克斯是旅馆里塔洛斯邪教的领袖，但他不一定是。也许厨师库拉格才是真正的领袖，而巴克斯只是她用来摆脱自己嫌疑的一个替罪羊。只需做一些调整，你就可以让你的玩家猜测，甚至在他们认为自己知道发生了什么之后。",
	"After their time at the Wayside Inn, the characters have less than twenty miles of travel along the High Road to reach Leilon. Silla asks if she can travel with the party. If they say no, she simply follows behind them at a short and indiscrete distance, forlornly playing a sad tune on her harmonica at the thought of being shunned by the party.": "在路边旅馆的时间结束后，人物沿着高路还有不到20英里的路程才能到达Leilon。西拉问她是否可以和队伍一起旅行。如果他们说不行，她就跟在他们身后不远不近的地方，一想到自己会被队伍甩开，她就惆怅地用口琴吹起了悲伤的曲子。",
	"When the party gets less than a mile from the location where the town is being rebuilt, they come upon an impromptu town meeting. Most of the town is here; they have been evacuated to this point because the town guards sent up a warning that someone or something was invading Leilon.": "当队伍离重建城镇的地点不到一英里时，他们遇到了一个临时性的城镇会议。镇上的大部分人都在这里；他们被疏散到这里是因为镇上的卫兵发出了警告，说有人或有东西正在入侵雷隆。",
	"When the adventurers approach the settlers, use the following read-aloud text to describe the scene:": "当冒险家们接近定居者时，使用以下朗读文本来描述这个场景。",
	"Roughly fifty people stand in a clearing just off the High Road, where the forest to the northeast and the swampland to the southwest give way to grassland for a bit on each side of the road. The beginnings of gardens or larger fields of crops are half-dug here.": "大约有50人站在高路边的一块空地上，东北方向的森林和西南方向的沼泽地在路的两边各让出一点草地。在这里，花园或较大的农田的雏形被挖了一半。",
	"The people mill about in a panic. Some shake in fear, others shout in anger, and in the center of it all an enraged dwarf waves her arms and tries to get those around her to listen. A bored-looking human in a chain shirt and shield decorated with the sigil of Neverwinter stands next to the dwarf. He finally bangs his spear against his shield to quiet the tumult.": "人们惊慌失措地走来走去。有些人因恐惧而颤抖，有些人因愤怒而喊叫，而在这一切的中心，一个被激怒的矮人挥舞着手臂，试图让她周围的人听从。一个身穿链式衬衫、头戴装饰有永夜标志的盾牌、看起来很无聊的人类站在矮人旁边。他最后用他的长矛敲打着他的盾牌，以平息这场骚乱。",
	"The dwarf is Grizzelda Copperwraught, who the settlers call \"the Growler,\" but never within earshot of her. She was personally hired by Lord Neverember to oversee the rebuilding of the structures that will comprise the new town. She instructs the builders and gives them their pay at the end of each tenday.": "这个矮人就是格里泽尔达-科珀沃拉赫特，定居者们称她为 \"咆哮者\"，但从未在她耳边提起过。她受雇于纽伦堡勋爵，负责监督新镇的重建工作。她指导建筑工人，并在每个工作日结束时给他们发工资。",
	"Next to Grizzelda is Sergeant Hazz Yorrum. Yorrum is a human {@creature guard}, and in charge of the Neverwinter soldiers who protect the settlers while the town is being built. He is a coward, as lazy as he is corrupt.": "在格里泽尔达旁边的是哈兹-约鲁姆中士。Yorrum是一个人类{@creature guard}，负责在城镇建设时保护定居者的永夜士兵。他是个懦夫，既懒惰又腐败。",
	"Two other persons of note are here as well: Merrygold Brightshine and Valdi Estapaar. Merrygold is a priest of Lathander, the Morninglord. He and his church were given the rights to build the first temple in Leilon. The church of Lathander paid handsomely for the honor, and Merrygold and his staff assist in making sure that the workers get fed and cared for outside of their normal duties.": "还有两个值得注意的人也在这里。梅里戈德-布莱特希恩和瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔。梅里戈德是晨曦之主拉坦德的牧师。他和他的教会获得了在Leilon建造第一座神庙的权利。拉桑德教会为这一荣誉付出了丰厚的代价，梅里戈德和他的工作人员协助确保工人们在正常工作之外得到食物和照顾。",
	"Valdi Estapaar is a half-elven fisher who is tasked by Lord Neverember to oversee the fishing industry that is supposed to support the town as it is built. The fish she and her subordinates catch feed the town, and the excess fish are cured and transported to the nearby cities for sale.": "瓦尔迪-埃斯塔帕尔是一个半精灵渔民，他受诺文伯勋爵的委托，监督渔业，而渔业应该是支持城镇建设的。她和她的部下捕到的鱼养活了整个小镇，多余的鱼被腌制后运到附近的城市出售。",
	"The Growler, Merrygold, and Valdi comprise the Leilon Town Council at this point in the town's development. While the Growler is ostensibly the leader, the council votes on major issues, so the Growler can be overruled if Merrygold and Valdi agree on a different plan.": "在小镇发展的这一阶段，成长者、梅里戈德和瓦尔迪组成了雷隆镇议会。虽然咆哮者表面上是领导者，但理事会对重大问题进行投票，所以如果梅里戈尔德和瓦尔迪同意不同的计划，咆哮者可以被推翻。",
	"The characters come within earshot of the meeting just as the Growler is about to address the townsfolk. The characters are free to step in and interrupt at any point, but use the bullet points below to guide the talk until they do:": "当咆哮者要对镇民讲话时，人物就会出现在会议的耳边。角色们可以在任何时候插话，但在他们插话之前，要用下面的要点来引导谈话。",

	"She asks if anyone saw anything strange happening in the town as they were evacuating. One of the stonemasons claims that she saw something strange happening in the water out on the swampland, past the marsh islands, but then she picked up her tools and ran as the soldiers ordered her to evacuate.": "她问是否有人在疏散时看到镇上发生了什么奇怪的事情。其中一个石匠声称，她看到在沼泽地上的水里发生了一些奇怪的事情，经过了沼泽岛，但后来她拿起工具就跑了，因为士兵们命令她撤离。",
	"Another stonemason claims to have seen heard some of the returning fishing-folk, who were still out on their skiffs in the marshland, shouting in panic. Others nod and \"harrumph\" to indicate they heard this as well.": "另一个石匠声称他听到了一些返回的渔民，他们仍然在沼泽地的小艇上，惊慌失措地喊叫着。其他人也点头并 \"哈哈大笑\"，表示他们也听到了这个声音。",
	"At this point a short dragonborn wearing a holy symbol of Lathander shouts, \"May the Morninglord forgive me! We are missing two of the children. Smithwell and Burnice aren't here.

	"This pronouncement sends the collected townsfolk into a panic again, forcing the guard Yorrum to put spear to shield to quiet the crowd.": "这句话让收集起来的镇民再次陷入恐慌，迫使卫兵约鲁姆把长矛放在盾牌上，让人群安静下来。",
	"Merrygold insists that they must immediately go back to town to retrieve the children, consequences be damned. The Growler insists that they stay right here until one of the soldiers from the town comes to tell them that it is safe. Until then, no one is going anywhere.

Yorrum) is much of a fighter.": "梅里戈德坚持认为，他们必须立即回镇上找回孩子，后果自负。咆哮者坚持说，他们就呆在这里，直到镇上的一个士兵来告诉他们，这里是安全的。在那之前，任何人都不能去任何地方。瓦尔迪似乎不确定该怎么做，因为这里没有人（除了约鲁姆军士）是个战士。",

	"During the town meeting, two servants of the Morninglord are tasked with keeping an eye on a group of about twenty children between the ages of four and twelve.

	"Any players not engrossed by the town council discussion can be called upon to have their characters help the acolytes round up the wayward children.

	"Seeing that this threat came from the village itself, the town council now understands the dire nature of the situation. It is possible that the guards and anyone else who was left in town is dead, and the town could be overrun with enemies. The council asks the party to sneak into town and assess the situation there. If the town is no longer safe, the settlers must return to Neverwinter in defeat.": "看到这个威胁来自村庄本身，镇议会现在明白了情况的严峻性。守卫和其他留在镇上的人有可能已经死了，镇上可能被敌人占领了。委员会要求党员们潜入镇子，评估那里的情况。如果镇子不再安全，定居者们必须在失败中返回永夜镇。",

	"In the previous scene, a plot point was introduced: ten-year-old friends Smithwell and Burnice were still in town during the attack. How you use them is up to you, as you know your players. Some players do not handle children in danger well. If this is the case, simply have the pair hiding safely in the Shrine of Lathander, emerging when the threat is gone.": "在上一个场景中，引入了一个情节点：十岁的朋友史密斯威尔和伯尼斯在袭击期间仍在镇上。你如何使用他们取决于你，因为你了解你的玩家。有些玩家不善于处理处于危险中的儿童。如果是这种情况，只需让这对夫妇安全地躲在拉坦德神庙里，在威胁消失后出现。",
	"If you want to add drama and motivation for the party, you can place the children out in the open, needing to be brought to safety before they are seen by the Talos cultists. Just remember that giving the characters something else to do in the encounter increases the difficulty of the encounter for the party.": "如果你想为队伍增加戏剧性和动力，你可以把孩子们放在外面，需要在他们被塔洛斯邪教分子看到之前把他们带到安全的地方。只需记住，在遭遇战中给角色一些其他的事情做，就会增加遭遇战对队伍的难度。",

	"As this adventure and the other two adventures in the series progress, the Leilon locations presented in the adventures represent the default growth of the town if the characters do not intervene too much. The more interest the adventurers take in building the town, however, the more is at stake when the town in threatened.": "随着这个冒险和系列中其他两个冒险的进展，如果人物不做过多的干预，冒险中呈现的Leilon地点代表了小镇的默认增长。然而，冒险者对建设该镇的兴趣越大，当该镇受到威胁时，风险就越大。",
	"For players interested in the town-building aspect of the campaign, you can even let them help plan the growth and building of the town, changing the map dramatically. This is not only fine—it is wonderful!

	"The town council approaches the characters one morning and asks them to undertake a different kind of mission. One of the town residents, a gnome named Pinchwit Wigglehoof, is an expert goatherd.

	"However, part of the deal is that the goats must be brought to Phandalin. While Pinchwit is an excellent goatherd, she is less capable as a fighter. She and her goats need an escort from Leilon to Phandalin. The town council of Leilon also asks the characters to buy wagons to bring back a plethora of supplies that the town needs.": "然而，交易的一部分是必须将山羊带到范达林。虽然Pinchwit是一个优秀的牧羊人，但她作为一个战士的能力较差。她和她的山羊需要一个护卫队从Leilon到Phandalin。雷隆镇议会还要求这些人物购买马车，把镇上需要的大量物资运回来。",

	"Additionally, goats are not the most obedient animals in the wide kingdom of creatures. They can only travel about three miles per day, making the trip to Phandalin a seven-day ordeal. And with a couple hundred unruly goats, what could possibly go wrong?": "此外，在广阔的生物王国里，山羊并不是最听话的动物。它们每天只能走大约三英里，这使得前往范达林的旅程需要七天的折磨。而且有几百只不守规矩的山羊，有什么可能出错呢？",

	"The goats, however, panic at the sight of these large predators, causing them to flee in every direction. The characters must do everything in their power to keep the goats together, because the wyverns do not hesitate to pick off stragglers.": "然而，山羊们一看到这些大型掠食者就惊慌失措，导致它们向各个方向逃窜。角色们必须尽一切努力使山羊们聚在一起，因为狼獾会毫不犹豫地将落单者挑走。",
	"When the goats bolt, each character can attempt a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check. If at least half of the checks succeed, the characters manage to keep the herd together, and the wyverns move on to easier pickings. If the checks fail, the herd breaks up, leaving many goats vulnerable to wyvern attacks. If this happens, the characters have a choice:": "当山羊开溜时，每个角色可以尝试用DC10智慧（（%0%））检查。如果至少有一半的检定成功，角色们就能设法使羊群保持一致，而狼獾就会转移到更容易捕食的地方。如果检查失败，羊群就会散开，使许多山羊容易受到狼獾的攻击。如果发生这种情况，角色们就有了选择。",
	"They can stay together, saving half the herd but losing many of the goats to the wyvern attack. This reduces that money that the town could make from the merchant.": "他们可以呆在一起，保住了一半的羊群，但在狼人的攻击下损失了很多羊。这就减少了小镇可以从商人那里赚到的那笔钱。",
	"They can split up and each go after one of the groups of goats that split off. That means, however, that half the group must fight one wyvern, and the other half must fight the other, and they are 3000 feet away from each other, likely unable to help each other.": "他们可以分头行动，各自去追击分头行动的羊群中的一个。然而，这意味着一半的队伍必须与一只狼獾作战，另一半必须与另一只作战，而且他们彼此之间有3000英尺的距离，很可能无法互相帮助。",
	"One night (or day if the situation dictates), while the traveling goat show is resting for the evening, a family of ogres catches their scent. Being ogres, always hungry and particularly grumpy around goats, the ogres decide to attack.": "一天晚上（如果情况需要，也可以是一天），当旅行的山羊表演在晚上休息的时候，一个食人魔家族闻到了他们的气味。作为食人魔，他们总是很饿，而且对山羊特别暴躁，食人魔决定攻击。",
	"Assuming some of the characters are sleeping for the night, anyone on guard duty can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) or Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to notice that the goats are getting restless. This gives those on guard three rounds to wake up any sleepers and take precautions.": "假设有些角色在晚上睡觉，任何负责守卫的人都可以尝试用DC15智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）或智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，以发现山羊变得不安分。这给了那些守卫者三轮时间来唤醒任何睡觉的人并采取预防措施。",
	"After three rounds, the {@creature Ogre||ogres}, numbering three plus one per character, excluding sidekicks, charge out of the darkness and begin grabbing goats. When the characters intervene, the ogres drop the goats and attempt to smash the adventurers.": "三轮过后，{@creature Ogre||ogres}，数量为三个，每个角色加一个，不包括小弟，从黑暗中冲出来，开始抓羊。当人物进行干预时，食人魔放下山羊并试图砸死冒险者。",
	"Since this adventure and the ones that follow were designed to continue the story of {@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}, there's a good chance your players have already interacted with the NPCs in the town of Phandalin. If that is the case, then they have their own stories and their own relationships with the people of Phandalin. The town and the NPCs, as they are presented here, should be seen as just the beginning. You should change the attitudes of the NPCs, or the actual NPCs themselves, based on what has come to pass in your campaign.": "由于这次冒险和后面的冒险都是为了延续{@adventure Dragon of Icespire Peak|DIP}的故事，所以你的玩家很有可能已经和范达林镇的NPC互动过。如果是这样的话，那么他们就有自己的故事，有自己与范达林镇人民的关系。这里所介绍的小镇和NPC，应该被看作是一个开始。你应该根据你的活动中所发生的事情，改变NPC的态度，或者实际的NPC本身。",
	"If the characters have not been to Phandalin, you can learn more about the town in the {@i D&D Starter Set} or {@i D&D Essentials Kit}.

	"As the characters go about the business of procuring and securing wagons, horses, and the supplies needed back in Leilon, they might learn about some spies who have recently arrived in Phandalin, some working for the Cult of Talos, and others employed by Ularan Mortus and the followers of Myrkul.": "当角色们去采购和确保马车、马匹以及回到雷隆所需的物资时，他们可能会了解到最近到达范达林的一些间谍，有些人为塔洛斯教工作，有些人则受雇于乌拉然-莫特斯和米尔库尔的信徒。",

	"While the characters are in the common room at night, Toblen looks up as the door opens. The door closes quickly without anyone entering, and Toblen shakes his head in wonder. He says he thinks it was Argus Skeel who just opened the door and left immediately. Skeel is a newcomer who claims to be a prospector but never seems to be prospecting. He only comes around at night.": "当这些人物晚上在公共房间时，托布伦抬头看了看，因为门开了。门很快就关上了，没有人进来，托布伦惊讶地摇了摇头。他说，他认为是阿古斯-斯基尔刚打开门就马上离开了。斯基尔是一个新来的人，他声称自己是一个探矿者，但似乎从来不会去探矿。他只在晚上出现。",

	"If the characters follow Skeel into the shack, they cannot find him.

	"Linene Graywind, a middle-aged woman, runs the coster, and she sells the horses that the characters need for Leilon. She doesn't have any carts for sale but tells the characters that they can probably pick some up at the Miner's Exchange in town.": "Linene Graywind是一位中年妇女，经营着这家服装店，她出售人物在Leilon需要的马匹。她没有马车可卖，但她告诉角色们，他们也许可以在镇上的矿工交易所买到一些。",

	"If the characters push him for information, he can be prompted to talk with a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check. He then admits that he has taken a liking to Velleen, the new assistant at the Lionshield Coster. They were spending time together, getting to know each other, when she started talking about some scary stuff. She believes the Stormlord is going to come and wipe out the weak and the nonbelievers, and that he should join her. He's avoided her since then.": "如果人物向他询问情况，可以用DC15魅力（（%0%）或（%1%））的检查来促使他说话。然后他承认，他已经喜欢上了狮盾科斯特的新助理维莱恩。他们在一起相处，互相了解，这时她开始谈论一些可怕的东西。她认为风暴领主会来消灭弱者和不信者，他应该加入她。从那时起，他就避开了她。",

	"Also, a few people seem to have gone missing over the last couple of tendays. No one can say for sure, because the people who may be missing are visitors or travelers with no ties to Phandalin. It's possible that they simply left town, but some of them seemed to indicate that they were going to be around longer.": "另外，在过去的几个工作日里，似乎有几个人失踪了。没有人可以确定，因为可能失踪的人是与潘达林没有关系的游客或旅行者。有可能他们只是离开了小镇，但其中一些人似乎表明他们要在这里待更长时间。",
	"When the characters are packing up to take the supplies back to Leilon at the end of their visit, the spies from both the Cult of Talos and the followers of Myrkul independently decide they are too big a threat to let live.

	"Use the Backlot Map to run this encounter. As the characters load the wagons, storm clouds descend and block the sun.

If it is daylight, Argus wears heavy clothes to protect himself.": "使用 \"后场地图 \"来进行这个遭遇战。当角色们装上马车时，风暴云降临，遮住了太阳。阿古斯-斯基尔（男性（%0%））和两个（%1%），加上每个角色的一个食尸鬼，包括跟班，接近。如果是白天，阿古斯穿上厚厚的衣服来保护自己。",

	"Combat is a highlight of the game for a large number of players: they love the challenge, the tactics, and the drama. A battle involving three different sides at the same time can provide all of those highlights writ large. Running such a combat, however, takes care and practice.": "对于大量的玩家来说，战斗是游戏的亮点：他们喜欢挑战、战术和戏剧。一场同时涉及三个不同方面的战斗可以提供所有这些亮点。然而，进行这样的战斗需要谨慎和练习。",
	"With a three-sided combat, it is very easy to simply overwhelm the characters if you turn all the attention on the party. On the other hand, such a combat can be too easy if the other two sides simply wipe each other out while the adventurers watch.": "在三面作战的情况下，如果你把所有的注意力都集中在当事人身上，就很容易简单地把人物压倒了。另一方面，如果另外两方在冒险者的注视下简单地消灭对方，这样的战斗也会太容易了。",
	"Below are some tips for running a three-sided combat:": "以下是运行三面作战的一些提示。",
	"Start by focusing most attacks on the characters. Doing this establishes the tone and danger of the situation quickly. The players should be aware from the outset that if all the enemies turned on them at once, the encounter would likely go very poorly for them.": "开始时，将大多数攻击集中在人物身上。这样做可以迅速建立起局势的基调和危险性。玩家应该从一开始就意识到，如果所有的敌人都一下子转向他们，那么这场遭遇战很可能会对他们非常不利。",
	"Keep a close eye on the hit points of the characters. When the adventurers begin to feel a sense of hopelessness or peril beyond their capability, then have the other sides focus on each other for a while, giving the characters a chance to recover and regroup.": "密切关注人物的命中率。当冒险者开始感到无望或危险超出他们的能力范围时，则让对方集中精力对付一段时间，让角色有机会恢复和重新组织。",
	"Encourage tactical thinking. If one of the sides of the battle consists of savage monsters or mindless undead, give clues that they attack the nearest enemy rather than thinking tactically. This might encourage characters to move away from those enemies, or push other enemies into their path. This highlights the kind of tactical play that some players thrive on.": "鼓励战术性思考。如果战斗的一方由野蛮的怪物或无意识的亡灵组成，那么就提供线索，让他们攻击最近的敌人，而不是进行战术思考。这可能会鼓励角色远离这些敌人，或者把其他敌人推到他们的路上。这就突出了一些玩家兴致勃勃的那种战术性游戏。",
	"End dramatically. Three-sided battles can sometimes take longer because of the number of combatants participating. Use your discretion as the DM to have the excitement of the battle build up rather than fizzle out. When it's clear that the characters have the upper hand, turn on the monster toward them. But when it is clear that the characters will be victorious, have the remaining enemies fall quickly to avoid a drawn-out and anticlimactic denouement.": "结束的时候很夸张。由于参加战斗的人数较多，三边的战斗有时会花费更多时间。作为管理人，你要斟酌一下，让战斗的兴奋感逐渐增强，而不是逐渐消失。当人物明显占了上风时，就把怪物转向他们。但是，当很明显人物将获得胜利时，让剩余的敌人迅速倒下，以避免出现冗长而反常的结局。",
	"After the characters have dealt with the spies, either individually through investigation or at once as they are packing to leave, the characters can search them for clues.": "在人物处理完间谍后，可以通过调查单独处理，也可以在他们打包离开时一次性处理，人物可以在他们身上寻找线索。",
	"The ghouls working for Skeel bear the same skull marks at the ones who attacked the Wayside Inn during the introduction of this adventure. Skeel's clothes are riddled with thorns and barbed seeds from plants that are only found in the Mere of Dead Men. This can indicate to the characters that the larger undead threat may stem from that marsh.": "为斯基尔工作的食尸鬼与本冒险介绍中袭击路边旅馆的食尸鬼有着相同的头骨印记。斯基尔的衣服上布满了荆棘和带刺的种子，这些植物只有在死人沼泽才有。这可以向人物表明，更大的亡灵威胁可能来自那个沼泽地。",
	"Velleen and her kobolds each conceal hidden symbols of the Cult of Talos. She also carries a case containing a pair of lenses and a note in Common that says, \"The lenses show the secrets of the map.\" If these lenses are used to view the map found in the basement of the Wayside Inn, it reveals secret writing that points out various other locations of Cult of Talos activity up and down the Sword Coast, with the Thunder Cliffs circled as the central hub of activity.": "维莱恩和她的哥布林各自藏着塔洛斯教派的隐藏符号。她还带着一个箱子，里面有一副镜片和一张普通话的纸条，上面写着：\"镜片显示了地图的秘密\"。如果用这些镜片查看在路边旅馆地下室发现的地图，就会发现一些秘密文字，指出塔洛斯教在剑海岸上下的其他活动地点，而雷霆崖则被圈定为活动的中心。",
	"\"Foul Weather at Wayside\" is balanced for characters of 8th level, though characters of 7th level should be able to survive the encounters.": "\"Wayside的恶劣天气 \"是为8级的角色平衡的，尽管7级的角色应该能够在遭遇战中生存。",
	"As the characters played the \"{@adventure Attack on the Wayside Inn|SLW|2}\" introductory encounter earlier in this adventure, they should be familiar with the place, as well as the key NPCs who work and dwell there. However, they probably did not learn all of its secrets!": "由于角色们在这次冒险的早期进行了\"{@adventure Attack on the Wayside Inn|SLW|2} \"的介绍性遭遇战，他们应该熟悉这个地方，以及在那里工作和居住的关键NPC。但是，他们可能并没有了解到这里的所有秘密",
	"Most of the staff employed at the Wayside Inn are cultists of Talos who follow the dark teachings of Fheralai Stormsworn, a priest of the Stormbringer. Although the inn's owner does not know this, the bartender, Backes Dunfield, is a lieutenant of Stormsworn, fully pledged to the subjugation of the Sword Coast by his master. The rest of the cultists at the Wayside Inn see Backes as their leader however, to be protected and obeyed in any circumstance.": "路边旅馆的大部分员工都是塔洛斯的邪教徒，他们遵循风暴使者的牧师费拉莱-风暴之神的黑暗教义。虽然旅馆的老板不知道这一点，但酒保巴克斯-邓菲尔德（Backes Dunfield）是风暴使者的副手，他完全致力于征服他主人的剑海岸。然而，路边旅店的其他邪教徒将巴克斯视为他们的领袖，在任何情况下都应受到保护和服从。",
	"The local cultists have received orders to kidnap a local bard, Tarbin Tul, and then turn the Wayside Inn into a shrine to Talos. From this point, they would establish a series of shrines up and down the High Road, allowing them to bend the weather to their will and choke off travel and trade between the civilized areas of the northern Sword Coast.": "当地的邪教组织已经接到命令，要绑架当地的吟游诗人塔宾-图尔，然后把路边旅馆变成塔洛斯的神龛。从这一点出发，他们将在公路上下建立一系列的神殿，使他们能够按照自己的意愿改变天气，并扼杀剑海岸北部文明地区之间的旅行和贸易。",
	"As they draw power into the shrine within the Wayside Inn, the cultists summon storms to do the bidding of their master. This results in foul weather and raging skies appearing right above the inn, while the rest of the area is sunny and calm. If the adventurers can intervene in time, they can stop the ritual and save Leilon from destructive weather in their immediate future.": "当他们向路边旅馆内的神龛汲取力量时，邪教分子就会召唤风暴来听从他们主人的命令。这导致了恶劣的天气和狂暴的天空出现在旅店的正上方，而其他地区则是阳光明媚，风平浪静。如果冒险家们能及时介入，他们就能阻止这个仪式，使雷隆在不久的将来免受破坏性天气的影响。",
	"To complete the Foul Weather at Wayside quest (see \"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"), the adventurers must defeat the cultists of Talos at the Wayside Inn, destroy the shrine of Talos before it is fully activated, rescue the sacrifices, and find clues to the location of the cultists' hideout at the Thunder Cliffs.": "为了完成Wayside的恶劣天气任务（见\"{@area Leilon Quests|02a|x}\"），冒险者必须在Wayside旅馆击败塔洛斯的邪教徒，在塔洛斯的神龛被完全激活之前将其摧毁，拯救祭品，并找到邪教徒在雷霆崖的藏身之处的线索。",
	"In a D&D adventure, as in any narrative enterprise, repetition is a powerful tool. Images or symbols, when repeated, become a pattern that strengthens a story. Subtle differences in repeated scenes can add to the horror, comedy, or drama of a situation.": "在D&D冒险中，如同在任何叙事事业中，重复是一个强有力的工具。图像或符号在重复时，会成为一种加强故事的模式。重复场景中的细微差别可以增加一个场景的恐怖、喜剧或戏剧性。",
	"In this case, the characters return to the location of the first encounter in this adventure: the Wayside Inn. Some of the descriptions, details, and actions in this encounter are meant to echo that first encounter. If you remember some of the actions that the characters took in that encounter, feel free to add your own echoes.": "在这种情况下，角色们回到了这次冒险中第一次遭遇的地点：路边旅馆。这次遭遇中的一些描述、细节和行动是为了呼应第一次遭遇。如果你还记得人物在那次遭遇中的一些行动，请随时加入你自己的呼应。",
	"For example, if the characters danced in the common room during their time at the Wayside Inn previously, the ritual being performed by the cultists could incorporate movement that harkens back to that dance. Although it's a small detail that a typical player might overlook, if even just one of your players gets chills or a laugh because of the echo, it's worth the effort.": "例如，如果人物以前在路边旅馆的时候在公共房间里跳舞，那么邪教分子正在进行的仪式就可以加入一些动作，让人回想起那种舞蹈。虽然这是一个典型的玩家可能会忽略的小细节，但如果你的玩家中哪怕只有一个人因为这种回声而感到不寒而栗，这也是值得努力的。",
	"One morning, the adventurers awake to a beautiful, sunny day. To the north, however, in the direction of the Wayside Inn, storm clouds are gathering: very strange storm clouds in the shape of three swirling lightning bolts.": "一天早上，冒险家们在一个美丽的晴天中醒来。然而，在北方，在路边旅馆的方向，风暴云正在聚集：非常奇怪的风暴云，形状是三个旋转的闪电。",

The group is soaking wet, and one of the larger carts is being pulled by one horse instead of two.": "当这支队伍正在收集他们的设备并准备离开镇子时，早先派出的那群定居者回来了，没有带着他们被派去取回的货物。这群人浑身湿透，其中一辆大车是由一匹马拉的，而不是两匹。",
	"One of the two soldiers that was accompanying the caravan reports that when the group got within a mile of the inn, the weather became so violent they couldn't continue. The driving rain, fierce winds, and hailstones the size of apples impeded progress to a crawl, and then one of the horses was struck by lightning and killed.": "陪同商队的两名士兵之一报告说，当这群人走到离旅店不到一英里的地方时，天气变得如此狂暴，他们无法继续前进。瓢泼大雨、猛烈的风和苹果大小的冰雹阻碍了前进的步伐，使他们只能爬行，然后其中一匹马被闪电击中而死亡。",
	"When they retreated just a few hundred yards back down the High Road toward Leilon, the weather was perfectly calm again. The group decided not to risk trying to complete the journey to the inn, but the other soldier sent to guard the caravan agreed to stay and keep an eye on the situation.": "当他们沿着高路向雷隆方向退了仅仅几百码时，天气又完全平静了。这群人决定不冒险尝试完成前往旅店的旅程，但被派去看守商队的另一名士兵同意留下来，并密切关注情况。",
	"The characters have the following encounters as they travel to the Wayside Inn.": "角色们在前往 \"路边旅馆 \"时有以下遭遇。",
	"When the characters get to the point where the bad weather starts, the soldier who stayed behind to observe is being attacked by the three suits of armor.

	"Use the following read-aloud text to set the scene:": "使用以下朗读文本来设置场景。",
	"A wall of storms surges and howls in the distance. The sunny, mild weather gives way immediately to rain and hail, violent winds, and electrical discharges. Passing in and out of the wall are three figures in plate armor, each swinging a flail at a lone figure in splint armor wielding a longsword. The lone fighter, taking on the three in plate, wears the emblem of the Leilon garrison.": "一道风暴墙在远处涌动和呼啸。晴朗、温和的天气立即让位于雨和冰雹、狂风和放电。有三个身穿板甲的人从墙中进出，每个人都向一个身穿夹板甲、挥舞着长剑的孤独人物挥舞着长剑。孤独的战士与三个穿板甲的人对峙着，他佩戴着雷隆驻军的徽章。",
	"The soldier, a {@creature veteran} named Emmalou, is fighting off three {@creature Air Elemental Myrmidon|MTF|air elemental myrmidons} (see {@adventure appendix A|SLW|10}). These suits of armor were the same ones crafted by the Wayside Inn's blacksmith, Teega.

	"Kristoffen looks at Stands in Tar with a mixture of disgust and horror, shaking his head in disbelief that anyone would even consider choosing the drunken tabaxi and her ship over him and his.

They did see any survivors or salvageable wreckage, so they steered very clear of the area.": "这位船长是一位名叫斯塔林-温切特船长的人类，他与这些人物的船只的船长和船员交换故事和酒水。她讲了一个冒险家们特别感兴趣的故事。当{@i Uneasy Alliance}号经过雷霆崖附近时，他们发现了大量的残骸，这些残骸可能来自那里的洞穴之前的直接水域。他们没有看到任何幸存者或可打捞的残骸，所以他们对该地区避之不及。",

	"Recently, Sovendahl expressed opposition to some of Gadrille's more enthusiastic endeavors, deeming them too risky and likely to draw the attention of larger and more powerful forces, like the Waterdeep navy. Sovendahl went behind Gadrille's back and urged Fheralai Stormsworn to order Gadrille to stand down. The overzealous Gadrille did as she was told, but she secretly prayed to Talos, asking for a boon in payment for her years of devotion: curse Sovendahl for his cowardly caution. And Talos answered.": "最近，索文达尔对加德利尔的一些更热心的努力表示反对，认为这些努力太过冒险，很可能会引起更大、更强大的势力的注意，比如沃特德普的海军。索文达尔背着加德利尔，敦促费拉莱-风暴之神下令让加德利尔退下。热心过头的加德利尔照办了，但她暗中向塔洛斯祈祷，要求为她多年的奉献提供一种恩惠：诅咒索文达尔的懦弱谨慎。而塔洛斯回答说。",
