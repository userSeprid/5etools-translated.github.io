	"The legendary inventor Kwalish disappeared eons ago... as it turns out, finding a crashed planar ship and studying its technology to fuel his own experiments. Only now, Kwalish's lost research is desperately needed! Will you dare an alternate expedition into the Barrier Peaks to find him?": "传说中的发明家Kwalish在几个世纪前就消失了......事实证明，他找到了一艘坠毁的星球飞船，并研究其技术以推动自己的实验。只是现在，Kwalish遗失的研究被急切地需要！你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒探险？你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒峰寻找他？",
	"As a special offering in support of Extra Life 2018, we're pleased to present the following adventure scenario, built around a new expedition to the legendary Barrier Peaks. This adventure is suitable for characters of 5th to 10th level.": "作为支持《额外生活》2018年的特别奉献，我们很高兴地介绍以下冒险场景，它是围绕着对传奇的屏障峰的新探险而建立的。这个冒险适用于5到10级的角色。",
	"In centuries long past, a common scholar named Kwalish took an unlikely path to becoming one of the most powerful arcane inventors of all time, after his discovery of strange magic in the Barrier Peaks. His studies of an ancient, crashed planar craft set him on a path that might have seen him rival Ioun and Heward—until his experiments overtook him, and he became lost to the ages. All that's left of his legacy is a single example of his earliest work—the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} that is the only way most folk now know his name.": "在很久以前的几个世纪里，一个名叫Kwalish的普通学者在屏障之峰发现了奇怪的魔法之后，走上了一条不可能的道路，成为有史以来最强大的奥术发明家之一。他对一个古老的、坠毁的平面飞行器的研究使他走上了一条可能与伊昂和休沃德相抗衡的道路--直到他的实验超越了他，而他也迷失在了岁月中。他的遗产只剩下他最早的作品的一个例子--{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，这是大多数人现在知道他名字的唯一途径。",
	"It was Kwalish's foray into the Barrier Peaks that set his advanced studies into motion, when he joined an ill-fated expedition in search of Daoine Gloine, a legendary city said to be populated by creatures of glass. Though the rest of his party perished along the way, Kwalish stumbled upon a wrecked planar craft of unknown providence and spent years exploring its secrets. He even repurposed much of the craft's unique magical technology into his first laboratory, building planar gates of his own design.": "夸里什进入壁垒峰，开始了他的高级研究，当时他加入了一个命运多舛的探险队，寻找Daoine Gloine，一个传说中由玻璃生物居住的城市。虽然他的队伍中的其他人在途中丧生，但夸里什偶然发现了一艘残破的平面飞船，并花了数年时间探索其秘密。他甚至将这艘飞船的大部分独特的魔法技术重新用于他的第一个实验室，建造他自己设计的平面门。",
	"Testing one such gate as it forged a connection to the Nine Hells attracted the attention of a bone devil. Trailing Kwalish back across the planes, the devil took over the inventor's laboratory for itself. Kwalish managed to escape but left much of his lore behind, while the bone devil spent the years that followed converting the place into a dark monastery—and establishing its own cult.": "测试一个这样的门，因为它与九层地狱建立了联系，吸引了一个骨魔的注意。追踪Kwalish回到各个星球，骨魔为自己占领了这位发明家的实验室。夸里什成功逃脱，但留下了他的大部分理论，而骨魔则在随后的几年里将这里改造成了一个黑暗的修道院，并建立了自己的邪教。",
	"After much wandering in the mountains, Kwalish relocated to an equally remote location—Daoine Gloine, the mysterious city his expedition had originally sought. The site's isolation made it a suitable place for him to continue his research. However, its populace turned out not to be creatures of glass as the legends suggested, but clans of kenku that worshipped a medusa with the unique ability to transform her victims into glass.": "在山里徘徊了很久之后，夸里什搬到了一个同样偏远的地方--道恩-格洛因，那是他的探险队最初寻找的神秘城市。这个地方与世隔绝，是一个适合他继续研究的地方。然而，这里的居民并不像传说中的那样是玻璃生物，而是崇拜一个具有将受害者变成玻璃的独特能力的美杜莎的肯库部族。",
	"Before Kwalish could be made to suffer the same fate at the hands of the chaotic kenku and their mad medusa, he once more opened a planar gate, this time to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits, from which he summoned forth a horrific plague of ooze to clear out the city and help him defend his new lab.": "在夸里什被混乱的肯库和他们疯狂的美杜莎弄得遭受同样的命运之前，他再次打开了一道平面门，这次是通往深渊的第222层--吉布利克斯的粘液坑，他从那里召唤出了可怕的粘液瘟疫来清除城市，帮助他保卫他的新实验室。",
	"Kwalish cut off all access to Daoine Gloine, and the city was lost to the ages. The legendary inventor has not been heard from since. Only now, the characters are in dire need of his aid...": "夸里什切断了所有通往道恩-格洛因的通道，而这座城市也消失在岁月中。从此，这位传奇的发明家就没有了消息。只是现在，这些人物急需他的帮助......",
	"In 2017, the D&D team added several projects to the DMs Guild in support of Extra Life (including One Grung Above, The Lost Kenku, and The Tortle Package). The funds raised from the sale of these packages went to this extremely worthy cause—and for 2018, you'll find even more projects made available on the DMs Guild throughout the year. As part of these efforts, it's our privilege to contribute the following adventure to the cause. We wanted to provide as much value for your donation as we could, providing new maps, monsters, and magic items—and of course, the scenario itself, accompanied by a range of notes and options to help cater to your preferred play style. We hope you enjoy Lost Laboratory of Kwalish. And you have our sincere thanks for your support of Extra Life and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.": "2017年，D&D团队在DMs公会中增加了几个项目以支持Extra Life（包括One Grung Above、The Lost Kenku和The Tortle Package）。出售这些套餐所筹集的资金用于这一极其有意义的事业--而在2018年，你会发现全年在DMs公会上有更多的项目。作为这些努力的一部分，我们很荣幸地将以下冒险活动贡献给这项事业。我们希望为您的捐赠提供尽可能多的价值，提供新的地图、怪物和魔法物品--当然还有剧情本身，伴随着一系列的注释和选项，以帮助迎合您喜欢的游戏风格。我们希望你能喜欢《失落的Kwalish实验室》。我们衷心感谢您对《额外生命》和儿童奇迹网络医院的支持。",
	"The characters are charged with locating Kwalish's long-lost laboratory and the magical technology that might be found there. As they start their search, they're first directed to an accomplished gnome map merchant named Anaxi Zephries, known as \"the Cartophile.\" Information collected by Anaxi over the years has traced Kwalish's route into the Barrier Peaks—at least up to the point where his expedition was lost, despite its members' formidable knowledge and skill.": "这些人物负责寻找Kwalish失落已久的实验室和可能在那里发现的魔法技术。当他们开始搜索时，他们首先被引导到一个名叫Anaxi Zephries的有成就的地精地图商人那里，他被称为 \"制图者\"。Anaxi多年来收集的信息追踪了Kwalish进入屏障峰的路线--至少到他的探险队迷失的那一刻为止，尽管其成员拥有强大的知识和技能。",
	"Working their own way into the Barrier Peaks, the characters eventually arrive at Kwalish's first laboratory—the remains of a planar craft whose technology drove the inventor's early research. But they discover that Kwalish has long since been exiled, and his lab converted into a monastery now dedicated to the bone devil that is the site's Grand Master. The characters must negotiate their entrance into the monastery, and from there to its treasury. Hidden within the treasury are notes from Kwalish's original expedition that lead to Daoine Gloine, the legendary city deep within the Barrier Peaks—and the site of Kwalish's current laboratory.": "角色们通过自己的方式进入屏障峰，最终到达了Kwalish的第一个实验室--一个平面飞行器的遗迹，其技术推动了这位发明家的早期研究。但是他们发现Kwalish早就被流放了，他的实验室被改造成了一座修道院，现在供奉的是该地的大法师--骨魔。角色们必须通过谈判进入修道院，并从那里进入其库房。库房里藏着夸里什最初的探险笔记，这些笔记通往道恩-格洛因（Daoine Gloine），那是位于屏障之峰深处的传奇城市，也是夸里什目前的实验室所在地。",
	"After reaching Daoine Gloine, the characters find the city buried beneath a flood of gelatinous ooze, with only its tallest stone structures left rising above the surface. The characters must find a safe means of descent into the ooze as they seek the entrance to Kwalish's hidden laboratory—and avoid the empty city's deadly guardians. Once they reach the lab, the characters meet with the legendary inventor and can negotiate for the assistance necessary to complete their quest—and they might even have the chance to help Kwalish deal with one of a number of problems of his own.": "在到达Daoine Gloine之后，角色们发现这座城市被埋在胶状渗出物的洪流之下，只有最高的石头建筑耸立在表面。角色们必须找到一个安全的方法，让他们能够安全地下降到渗出物中，同时寻找Kwalish隐藏的实验室的入口--避免空城的致命守护者。一旦他们到达实验室，角色们就会见到这位传奇的发明家，并可以通过谈判获得完成任务所需的援助--他们甚至有机会帮助Kwalish处理他自己的一些问题。",
	"The original Expedition to the Barrier Peaks—1980's adventure module S3 for first edition AD&D—placed its titular mountains in Greyhawk, north of the Grand Duchy of Geoff and the Valley of the Mage. Depending on your campaign, you can set this adventure in any similar location: a mysterious mountain range that even dedicated explorers have failed to fully map. In the Forgotten Realms, one possible location for the adventure is Chult, the land explored in Tomb of Annihilation. The mysterious and poorly mapped peninsula contains several suitable mountain ranges, including the Mistcliffs and the Kobold Mountains. Elsewhere in Faerûn, the peaks surrounding Halruaa, a land known for its magical technology, are a good choice. Alternatively, campaigns making use of the {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} adventure might look for a location closer to the city, including the Greypeaks or the Nether Mountains.": "最初的《屏障之峰远征》--1980年第一版AD&D的冒险模块S3--将其名下的山脉放在格雷霍克，位于杰夫大公国和法师谷的北部。根据你的活动，你可以把这个冒险放在任何类似的地方：一个神秘的山脉，即使是专门的探险家也未能完全描绘出来。在被遗忘的领域，一个可能的冒险地点是楚尔特，即《毁灭之墓》中探索的土地。这个神秘且地图绘制不全的半岛上有几条合适的山脉，包括雾崖和哥布林山脉。在Faerûn的其他地方，以魔法技术著称的Halruaa周围的山峰也是一个不错的选择。另外，利用{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}冒险的活动可以寻找一个离城市更近的地方，包括Greypeaks或Nether山脉。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's  Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}).": "要运行这个冒险，你需要D&D第五版核心规则书（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））。",

	"Most of the monsters that appear in this adventure are from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, along with new creatures and NPCs, and monsters from {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM} and {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}. For easy reference, all the stat blocks for the creatures in the adventure can be found in appendix C. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in that appendix.

	"This adventure features numerous encounters and challenges that should keep a group entertained for multiple sessions. However, you can easily run a shorter version of the adventure, or even an exciting one-shot, by making the following modifications:": "这个冒险的特点是有许多遭遇和挑战，应该能让一个小组在多个环节中保持娱乐。然而，你可以通过以下的修改，轻松地运行一个较短的冒险版本，甚至是一个令人兴奋的单次拍摄。",
	"Run the adventure as written, making use of both the monastery and the ooze-flooded city locations.": "按规定进行冒险，同时利用修道院和水灾城市的地点。",
	" Run the adventure as written, up to the monastery. Then forgo a second laboratory location, instead replacing the final brain in a jar in the treasury (area M10) with Kwalish, and conclude the adventure there": " 按规定进行冒险，一直到修道院。然后放弃第二个实验室的位置，而用库房（M10区）的罐子里的最后一个大脑替换掉Kwalish，并在那里结束冒险。",
	"Give your players an adventure hook, assign them a guide (see \"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"), and start them at {@area C1|032}, overlooking the bone devil's monastery. Then as above, replace the treasury's brain in a jar with Kwalish for an exciting conclusion.": "给你的玩家一个冒险的钩子，给他们分配一个向导（见\"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"），然后让他们在{@area C1|032}开始，俯瞰骨魔的修道院。然后如上所述，用Kwalish取代宝库里的大脑，以获得一个令人兴奋的结论。",
	"In the course of previous adventures, the characters might have come up against a special magical-mechanical dilemma too challenging to overcome. Perhaps a secret door in a dungeon complex has been built around an iron golem, or an array of dangerous clockwork devices discovered within a city defy any attempts to turn them off. All research into the problem suggests that the inventor Kwalish might have the solution—if only he hadn't gone missing years before.": "在以前的冒险过程中，人物可能会遇到一个特殊的魔法-机械困境，难以克服。也许地牢里的一扇秘密大门是围绕着一个铁制傀儡建造的，或者在一个城市里发现的一系列危险的发条装置无视任何试图将其关闭的尝试。对这个问题的所有研究表明，发明家Kwalish可能有解决方案--如果他没有在几年前失踪的话。",
	"Alternatively, you might consider any of the following hooks. Several involve a pending crisis, such that the players are seeking Kwalish not just on their own behalf, but to prevent hardship to friends, family, or the common folk. Just make sure that the peril doesn't come on too quickly, though, as an expedition into the Barrier Peaks will take some time.": "另外，你可以考虑以下任何一种钩子。其中有几个涉及到即将发生的危机，比如玩家不仅是为了自己的利益，也是为了防止朋友、家人或普通人陷入困境而寻找Kwalish。但要确保危险不会来得太快，因为对壁垒山峰的探险需要一些时间。",
	"If you're playing through or using events from {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} in your campaign, the characters might hear rumors that Kwalish's laboratory holds lore that can help deactivate the Soulmonger. If the characters have any hope of surviving the tomb and ending the death curse, they must first make the dangerous journey to the inventor's lost lab.": "如果你在你的战役中通过或使用{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}的事件，角色们可能会听到传言说Kwalish的实验室拥有可以帮助解除灵魂使者的传说。如果角色们有任何希望从坟墓中幸存下来并结束死亡诅咒，他们必须首先进行危险的旅程，前往发明家丢失的实验室。",
	"Alternatively, in the aftermath of a {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} campaign, a friend, family member, or mentor important to the characters might have been placed in stasis within a magical sarcophagus to protect them from the death curse. With the curse lifted, this NPC can now be saved—except the sarcophagus cannot be opened by any magical or mundane means. After learning that the sarcophagus is one of Kwalish's designs, the characters must seek out his lost laboratory for the means to open it—or their friend will sleep for eternity.": "另外，在{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}战役结束后，一个对角色很重要的朋友、家人或导师可能被放置在一个魔法石棺里，以保护他们不受死亡诅咒的影响。随着诅咒的解除，这个NPC现在可以被拯救了--但石棺不能用任何魔法或世俗的方法打开。在得知石棺是Kwalish的设计之一后，角色们必须寻找他丢失的实验室以获得打开石棺的方法，否则他们的朋友将永远沉睡。",
	"A number of hooks can connect to the exploits of characters engaged in a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign. The famed walking statues of Waterdeep are showing signs of getting ready to power up once more, and not even the Blackstaff can shut them down. Old histories suggest that Kwalish's lore might hold the secrets of doing so, and the characters are sent to seek that lore out before the great magical statues can run amok.": "一些钩子可以连接到参与{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}活动的角色的探索。水底世界著名的行走雕像有准备再次发力的迹象，甚至连黑杖都无法关闭它们。古老的历史表明，Kwalish的传说可能蕴含着这样做的秘密，人物被派去寻找这个传说，以免伟大的魔法雕像横行。",
	"Alternatively, the grand parade of the Day of Wonders turns to deadly chaos when one of its inventive mechanical floats goes berserk and unleashes destruction across the city. After stopping the threat, the characters learn that it was built based on a Kwalish design, and that other such designs might be used to build great engines of destruction. The secrets to overcoming such inventions can be found only in Kwalish's lab.": "另外，奇迹日的盛大游行变成了致命的混乱，因为其中一个创造性的机械花车发狂了，并在整个城市释放了破坏。在阻止了这一威胁后，角色们了解到它是根据Kwalish的设计建造的，而其他这样的设计可能被用来建造伟大的毁灭引擎。克服这种发明的秘密只能在Kwalish的实验室里找到。",
	"As a more integral part of a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign, characters who successfully discover the location of the Vault of Dragons might discover that the keys needed to access it are lost. Rumors speak of another means of opening the vault—a secret known only to the lost inventor.": "作为{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}战役的一个重要组成部分，成功发现龙库位置的人物可能会发现，进入龙库所需的钥匙已经丢失。有传言说有另一种打开龙库的方法--只有失落的发明家才知道的秘密。",
	"If your campaign is set in the city world of Ravnica, as outlined in {@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}, Kwalish might be a chemister from the Izzet League who left the guild to pursue his own work away from Niv-Mizzetr's prying eyes. Centuries later, Izzet researchers have uncovered some of Kwalish's notes. Desperate to locate the chemister's laboratory, the Izzet League reaches out to the characters to accomplish the task.": "如果你的战役设定在拉夫尼卡的城市世界，如{@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}所述，Kwalish可能是Izzet联盟的一名化学家，他离开公会，远离Niv-Mizzetr的窥视，追求自己的工作。几个世纪后，伊泽特的研究人员发现了夸利什的一些笔记。由于急于找到化学家的实验室，伊泽特联盟向这些人物伸出援手，以完成这项任务。",
	"If you're running a campaign making use of {@adventure Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage|WDMM}, Kwalish's laboratory might contain secrets useful in the exploration of Undermountain. Or you could have some of the dungeon's deadly features be strange mechanical-magical devices reminiscent of Kwalish's work. The secrets to controlling or disabling such devices might be instrumental to a successful foray into the legendary dungeon.": "如果你正在运行一个使用（%0%）的活动，Kwalish的实验室可能包含对探索Undermountain有用的秘密。或者你可以让地牢的一些致命特征成为奇怪的机械魔法装置，让人联想到Kwalish的工作。控制或禁用这些设备的秘密可能对成功进入传说中的地牢很有帮助。",
	"A massive magical-mechanical golem, an unknown planar vessel, or some other rare threat has appeared in civilized lands. Though local settlements are safe for the moment, the characters are charged with tracking down Kwalish and his laboratory in hopes that the secrets to disabling the imminent threat might be found there.": "一个巨大的魔法机械傀儡，一个未知的星球容器，或者其他一些罕见的威胁已经出现在文明的土地上。虽然当地的居民点暂时是安全的，但角色们负责追踪Kwalish和他的实验室，希望能在那里找到解除迫在眉睫的威胁的秘诀。",
	"A powerful marut (detailed in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}) hunts one or more of the characters for breaking some cosmic contract. Their only hope of survival is to find Kwalish's laboratory, whose planar magic holds the means of restoring the balance the marut seeks to enforce.": "一个强大的马鲁特（详见{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}）追捕一个或多个角色，因为他们违背了某种宇宙契约。他们唯一的生存希望是找到Kwalish的实验室，他的平面魔法拥有恢复马鲁特所寻求的平衡的手段。",
	"The characters are hired by a gnome sage known as the Cartophile for a mission of exploration, as he seeks to complete a failed expedition to Daoine Gloine undertaken by his ancestors. The characters must find their way to the lost city hidden within the Barrier Peaks, then return with its location.": "这些人物受雇于一位被称为 \"Cartophile \"的地精圣人，执行一项探索任务，因为他要完成他的祖先对Daoine Gloine的一次失败的探险。他们必须找到隐藏在壁垒山峰中的失落之城，然后带着它的位置返回。",
	"Alternatively, the characters might hear rumors of Kwalish's legendary {@item Powered Armor|LLK} (see {@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}), and embark on a mission to find it. Or you might have them discover a set of {@item Powered Armor|LLK} in a previous adventure, leaving them needing to find a way to access it—or to free an NPC currently trapped inside it. Either way, finding Kwalish's lost laboratory is the key.": "或者，人物可能会听到关于Kwalish的传奇（%0%）（见{@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}）的传言，并开始执行任务去寻找它。或者你可以让他们在之前的冒险中发现一套{@item Powered Armor|LLK}，让他们需要找到进入它的方法，或者释放目前被困在里面的NPC。无论怎样，找到Kwalish丢失的实验室是关键。",
	"No matter what hook brings the characters into the adventure, any research into Kwalish's lost laboratory—or any NPC familiar with the inventor's failed expedition to the Barrier Peaks—establishes that seeking out the gnome known as the Cartophile is a crucial first step for their mission.": "无论什么样的钩子将角色带入冒险，对Kwalish丢失的实验室的任何研究--或者任何熟悉发明家对屏障山峰的失败探险的NPC--都会发现寻找被称为 \"嗜卡者 \"的地精是他们任务的关键第一步。",
	"Anaxi Zephries is a wealthy gnome merchant and sage. He is well known for his vast collection of maps, which cover the known world, pocket dimensions, routes across the planes, and more. In this role, the Cartophile has served as patron for numerous expeditions of exploration, sending adventurers to all corners of the world—both to draw new maps and to verify the authenticity of others already in his possession.": "阿纳西-泽弗里斯是一位富有的地精商人和圣人。他因收集了大量的地图而闻名，这些地图涵盖了已知的世界、袖珍空间、穿越位面的路线等等。在这个角色中，\"制图者 \"曾作为众多探险队的赞助人，将冒险者派往世界各个角落--既要绘制新的地图，又要验证他手中的其他地图的真实性。",
	"The gnome's collection contains notes and an initial map from the early stages of Kwalish's expedition into the Barrier Peaks. In exchange for allowing the characters to use that lore, he asks only that any further journals, notes, maps, and other documents from Kwalish's earlier expedition be returned to him.": "地精的收藏中包含了Kwalish对屏障之峰的早期探险的笔记和一张初始地图。作为允许角色使用这些传说的交换条件，他只要求将Kwalish早期探险中的任何其他日记、笔记、地图和其他文件归还给他。",
	"The Cartophile has no interest in adventuring, talking of how he once stood too close to a {@item Bag of Holding} accidentally placed within a {@item Portable Hole} and never fully recovered from it. However, in the interest of ensuring a successful mission, he offers the characters the services of a number of hirelings in his employ—and insists that at least one of those hirelings accompany the party, to serve as custodian of his maps and materials.": "嗜图者对冒险没有兴趣，他说他曾经站得太近，不小心把一个{@item Bag of Holding}放在了一个{@item Portable Hole}里面，然后就再也没有完全恢复过来。然而，为了确保任务的成功，他向人物提供了一些他雇佣的雇工的服务--并坚持要求这些雇工中至少有一个人随行，作为他的地图和资料的保管人。",
	"If the characters develop an especially close relationship to the Cartophile, the gnome might reveal that his professional career commissioning expeditions and maps has been background research for a personal obsession. One of his ancestors took part in Kwalish's lost expedition to find Daoine Gloine, the mythical city of the Barrier Peaks inhabited by \"people of glass.\" The gnome has long sought to learn the truth of the expedition's demise.": "如果人物与制图师建立了特别密切的关系，地精可能会透露，他委托探险和地图的职业生涯一直是个人痴迷的背景研究。他的一个祖先参加了Kwalish的失落的探险，以寻找Daoine Gloine，那个由 \"玻璃人 \"居住的壁垒山峰的神话城市。侏儒长期以来一直在寻求了解探险队灭亡的真相。",
	"Any of the following NPCs can join the party as custodians and translators of the materials loaned to the characters by the Cartophile. Each hireling is also charged with chronicling the party's progress along the way, in the hope of finally mapping the route to Daoine Gloine, and has specific value to the party in certain areas of expertise. However, each hireling also has one or more secret agendas that might work against the characters' interests.": "以下任何一个NPC都可以加入队伍，作为Cartophile借给人物的材料的保管人和翻译。每个雇佣兵都负责记录党派沿途的进展，希望最终绘制出通往道恩-格洛因的路线，并且在某些专业领域对党派有特殊价值。然而，每个雇工也有一个或多个秘密议程，可能会对人物的利益产生不利影响。",
	"You can let the party's size and the players' interest in bringing NPCs into their group determine whether more than one of the Cartophile's hirelings join the expedition. Or, instead of front-loading hirelings at the start, these NPCs can be set up as independent explorers not connected to the Cartophile. You can stagger their introduction throughout the course of the adventure (as suggested in each NPC's description below), with each one able to provide a useful next step to help the expedition along.": "你可以让队伍的规模和玩家对把NPC带入他们的队伍的兴趣来决定是否有超过一个嗜车者的雇佣者加入探险队。或者，这些NPC可以被设定为与嗜车者无关的独立探险者，而不是一开始就把雇佣者放在前面。你可以在整个冒险过程中错开介绍他们（正如下面每个NPC的描述中所建议的那样），每个人都可以提供一个有用的下一步来帮助探险队前进。",
	"Once a dwarven warrior, Ctenmiir was transformed into a {@creature Vampire} and hidden away within White Plume Mountain (see {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}) until captured there by an Emerald Enclave ranger. The vampire has long been imprisoned within a magical iron coffin mounted atop animated golem legs (an early Kwalish design), forced to atone for his evil deeds by working for the Cartophile.": "曾经是一名矮人战士的克滕米尔被改造成了一个{@creature Vampire}，藏在白翎山(见{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP})里，直到被一名翡翠飞地的游侠抓住。长期以来，这个吸血鬼一直被囚禁在一个神奇的铁棺材里，铁棺材被安装在灵动的格木腿上（早期Kwalish设计），被迫通过为Cartophile工作来赎罪。",
	"Ctenmiir's coffin has a speed of 30 feet and a climbing speed of 10 feet, and protects the vampire from sunlight even as it prevents him from escaping his servitude. Though Ctenmiir is able to speak from within the coffin and help guide the expedition, the coffin obeys only the commands of the party members. Cold, calculating, and manipulative, the vampire aids the party as long as he believes he can earn his release from the coffin along the way—by any means possible.": "Ctenmiir的棺材有30英尺的速度和10英尺的攀爬速度，可以保护吸血鬼不受阳光照射，即使它阻止他逃脱他的奴役。虽然克滕米尔能够在棺材里说话并帮助指导探险，但棺材只听从党员的命令。吸血鬼冷酷无情、精打细算、善于操纵，只要他认为自己可以通过任何可能的方式从棺材中获得释放，他就会协助党的工作。",
	"Originally native to an area near the Barrier Peaks, Ctenmiir has much experience with the initial route into the mountains, and can provide warnings of early encounters through the fey woods and foothills (see \"{@area Reaching the Peaks|028|x},\" below, and {@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}). The vampire's coffin can also serve as a makeshift {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} at your determination, making it easier for characters to explore Daoine Gloine—though Ctenmiir will need to first be released. The coffin can also be used as protective shelter against adversaries, including a freed Ctenmiir.": "Ctenmiir原产于壁垒峰附近的地区，对进入山区的最初路线有很多经验，并能在早期遇到费城森林和山麓时提供警告（见下面的\"（%0%）\"和（%1%））。吸血鬼的棺材也可以作为你决定的临时{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，使人物更容易探索道恩-格洛--尽管需要先释放克滕米尔。棺材也可以作为保护性的庇护所来对付敌人，包括被释放的Ctenmiir。",
	"Get out of the coffin. Feed on at least one character.": "从棺材里出来。至少以一个角色为食。",
	"If Ctenmiir does not start with the party, he might instead be found in the foothills, in the possession of outlaws seeking the monastery who use the vampire as their guide.": "如果克滕米尔没有和队伍一起出发，他可能会在山脚下被寻找修道院的歹徒占有，这些歹徒把吸血鬼当作他们的向导。",
	"If he joins the expedition from the start, the vampire might lead the characters to the foothills, then claim to no longer recognize the route ahead.

Alternatively, the Grand Master might send over a squad of five monks ({@creature Cultist||Cultists}) led by an elder monk ({@creature Cult Fanatic}) to investigate the sphinx's death and assess the characters' potential threat.": "在狮身人面像的精神指令下，飞行渡轮从修道院的码头被召唤出来，越过悬崖壁架。如果狮身人面像被杀，渡船也会来，遵守大法师的命令，任何强大的访客都会被带到魔鬼的面前。另外，大法师可能会派一个由五名僧侣（{@creature Cultist||Cultists}）组成的小队在一名长老僧侣（{@creature Cult Fanatic}）的带领下，调查狮身人面像的死亡，并评估人物的潜在威胁。",
	"A pulse of fire marks something igniting at the edge of the floating island, alongside its distant dock. Something detaches and floats smoothly towards you—a flying skiff piloted by a hooded figure.": "一阵火光标志着有什么东西在浮岛的边缘点燃了，就在远处的码头边上。有东西脱离并平稳地飘向你--由一个蒙面人驾驶的飞行船。",
	"The ferry is operated by a {@creature Merrenoloth|MTF} (originally from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}). It is crafted from laboratory debris attached to a small engine similar to the large engines holding the monastery aloft. The skiff can ferry up to ten Medium creatures at one time, and can be controlled automatically by the merrenoloth, Gearbox the modron, or a rescued brain in a jar (see area M8). A character can decipher the controls of a skiff with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing that character to control it. A skiff also requires at least one fully charged energy cell from the treasury (area M10) for fuel.": "这艘渡船是由一个{@creature Merrenoloth|MTF}(最初来自{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF})操作的。它是由实验室的碎片制作而成，连接着一个类似于支撑修道院高空的大型引擎的小型引擎。这艘船一次最多可运送10个中型生物，并可由merrenoloth、Gearbox the modron或罐子里的获救大脑（见M8区）自动控制。一个角色可以通过成功的DC15智力检查来破译小艇的控制，从而使该角色能够控制它。一艘快艇还需要至少一个来自宝库（M10区）的充满电的能量电池作为燃料。",
	"The merrenoloth stays silent, but any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to glimpse beneath its hood sees a skeletal face. (The character can later note the resemblance between this visage and the monastery's flayed monks.)": "梅里诺洛特保持沉默，但任何通过DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检定成功的角色都能瞥见它头巾下的一张骷髅脸。(角色后来可以注意到这张脸与寺院的剥皮僧侣之间的相似性。）",
	"If any character is unfortunate enough to fall from the cliff, the other characters quickly lose sight of them in a light mist that covers the valley floor. Any subsequent search for a body comes up empty—because a floating teleportation-field device (see the sidebar) zooms around the bottom of the valley, and automatically teleports the falling character into the prison cells at area M6.": "如果有哪个角色不幸从悬崖上掉下来，其他角色很快就会在覆盖谷底的轻雾中失去踪影。随后对尸体的搜索都是空的--因为一个漂浮的传送场装置（见边栏）会在谷底放大，并自动将坠落的角色传送到M6区的牢房。",
	"The crashed planar craft still makes up most of the monastery's general structure, having been long ago converted into Kwalish's first laboratory, then converted again into this present sinister site. The overall sense of the place—as evidenced in the alien geometries of its buildings and its exposed technology—should be one of a brooding, otherworldly environ where nothing feels quite right.": "坠毁的平面飞行器仍然构成了寺院的大部分总体结构，很久以前被改造成Kwalish的第一个实验室，然后又被改造成现在这个阴森的地方。这个地方的整体感觉--从其建筑的异形几何形状和暴露的技术中可以看出--应该是一个忧郁的、另一个世界的环境，没有什么感觉是对的。",
	"Over long years, the monastery has drawn hundreds of dark recruits to its hidden location, through both whispered rumor and dark outreach to criminals seeking refuge from the law. Though the vast majority of those recruits have perished or been imprisoned at the hands of the Grand Master, twenty-five monks—all a motley assemblage of evil humanoids—currently occupy various areas of the monastery. All wear cowled robes to conceal their features, which can be seen only if a monk is forced to unmask, or if a watchful character gets close to a monk and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any monk whose face is seen shows an identical grim countenance—a face flayed nearly to the bone, the result of a brutal initiation to better match the appearance of the Grand Master.": "漫长的岁月里，通过低声的传言和对寻求法律庇护的罪犯的黑暗宣传，该寺院已经吸引了数百名黑暗的新兵来到它的隐蔽地点。虽然这些新兵中的绝大多数已经在大法师手中丧生或被囚禁，但25名僧侣--所有邪恶的人形生物的杂乱组合--目前占据着寺院的各个区域。所有的人都穿着有罩子的长袍来掩盖他们的特征，只有当一个僧侣被迫揭开面具，或者当一个警觉的人物接近一个僧侣并成功通过DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查时，才能看到这些特征。任何被看到的僧侣的脸都显示出相同的狰狞面孔--一张几乎被剥去骨头的脸，这是为了更好地匹配大法师的外表而进行的残酷的启动仪式的结果。",
	"Wherever they are initially stationed, the monks all gather together if a general alarm is sounded, or to witness an audience in the central abbey (area M3). Each monk is a {@creature Cultist} that carries a smaller version of a bone devil's hooked polearm (see the sidebar in the \"Bone Devil\" section in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), typically disguised as a staff or tool:": "无论他们最初驻扎在哪里，如果有总警报响起，僧侣们都会聚集在一起，或者在中央修道院（M3区）见证一个观众。每个僧侣都是一个{@creature Cultist}，携带一个较小版本的骨魔的钩状杆枪（见{@book Monster Manual|MM}中 \"骨魔 \"部分的侧边栏），通常伪装成法杖或工具。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@i Hit}: 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1}) piercing damage.

Until this grapple ends, the monk cannot use its polearm on another target.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+3，范围5英尺，一个目标。{@i Hit}: 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1})穿刺伤害。如果目标是中型或小型生物，则是{@condition grappled}（逃脱DC 10）。在这个抓取动作结束之前，僧侣不能对另一个目标使用它的杆状武器。",
	"In addition, each group of five monks is led by an elder monk. These are {@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics} that have outfitted their polearms with laser weapons secured from the monastery's stores of technology. These weapons are notoriously ineffective against polished metal armor and shields, which reflect their laser bolts:": "此外，每组五名僧侣由一名长老僧侣领导。这些人都是{@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics}在他们的杆枪上装备了从寺院的技术仓库中获得的激光武器。这些武器对抛光的金属盔甲和盾牌是出了名的无效，因为它们会反射激光炮弹。",
	"{@i Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack}: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 40/100 ft., one creature. {@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d10 + 2}) force damage.

	"A force pike uses an energy cell (see area M10), expending one charge for each successful attack. If claimed as treasure, a pike's cell holds {@dice 2d10} remaining charges. If you prefer not to have such weapons fall into the hands of the characters, then whenever an elder monk is defeated, its force pike automatically overheats and explodes.": "力量长矛使用一个能量电池（见M10区域），每次成功的攻击都会消耗一个电荷。如果被认作是宝物，长矛的电池可以保持（%0%）的剩余电量。如果你不想让这种武器落入人物手中，那么每当一个长老僧侣被打败时，它的长矛就会自动过热并发生爆炸。",
	"One of the more impressive bits of technology from the crashed planar craft, teleportation-field devices consist of two matched magical-mechanical rings. Both rings channel the power of teleportation and flight, and were originally used to undertake repairs on the outside of the craft, handle dangerous substances at a distance, and so forth.": "从坠毁的平面飞船中获得的更令人印象深刻的技术之一，传送场装置由两个匹配的魔法机械环组成。这两个环都能引导传送和飞行的力量，最初是用来在飞船外部进行维修，在远处处理危险物质，诸如此类。",
	"When a creature passes an arm or other appendage into one ring, that appendage appears to emerge from the other ring, no matter how far apart the devices are. The second device has a flying speed of 40 feet, and can be flown remotely under the creature's control as part of its own movement. The remote device also grants the creature a sensory awareness of the area around it. This allows the appendage to be used normally, so that the creature can undertake any activity remotely that it could accomplish close up, including making physical ability checks and attacks.": "当一个生物将手臂或其他附属物传入一个环中时，该附属物就会从另一个环中出现，无论这些装置相距多远。第二个装置的飞行速度为40英尺，并且可以在生物的控制下远程飞行，作为其自身运动的一部分。远程装置也赋予生物对其周围区域的感官意识。这使得该附属装置可以正常使用，因此该生物可以在远程进行任何它可以近距离完成的活动，包括进行物理能力检查和攻击。",
	"Because they are linked to the planar craft, teleportation-field devices function only in the monastery and in Daoine Gloine (where Kwalish has used the magical-mechanical technology of the craft to set up his new lab). If the characters manage to secure a pair of such devices, you can let the players come up with novel ways to make use of them in those locations (assigning appropriate Intelligence checks if you want to make the process difficult). However, they can't be claimed as treasure.": "因为它们与平面飞船相连，所以传送场装置只在修道院和道恩-格洛因（Kwalish在那里利用飞船的魔法-机械技术建立了他的新实验室）发挥作用。如果角色们设法获得了一对这样的装置，你可以让玩家想出新奇的方法来在这些地方利用它们（如果你想让这个过程变得困难，可以指定适当的智力检查）。但是，它们不能作为宝物被认领。",
	"The Monastery of the Distressed Body has been secretly drawing in outlaws for decades. As such, you might add to the ranks of the monks with any number of villainous NPCs the players have heard about, or even foes that slipped through their clutches in years past.

	"The monks do not interfere as the characters initially explore the monastery, and they keep their cowls down if they are approached. They say little about the workings of the place, but vaguely hint at how newcomers will be welcome to either join their \"immured brothers\" (the prisoners in area M6) or the \"enlightened ones\" (the brains in jars in the control room of area M8). They readily direct characters toward the Grand Master in the central abbey (area M3). If the monks are harassed, or if the characters spend too much time exploring on their own, Lean Meimbaol from area M1 arrives to personally escort them to the abbey.": "角色们最初探索修道院时，僧侣们并不干涉，如果有人接近他们，他们也会把头巾放下。他们对这个地方的运作几乎不闻不问，只是含糊地暗示新来者将被欢迎加入他们的 \"被监禁的兄弟\"（M6区的囚犯）或 \"开明的人\"（M8区控制室里装在瓶子里的大脑）。他们很容易将人物引向中央修道院（M3区）的大法师。如果僧侣们受到骚扰，或者角色们花了太多时间独自探索，M1区的Lean Meimbaol会亲自护送他们到修道院。",

	"Some thirty humanoid prisoners ({@creature Commoner||Commoners}) are held in the monastery. All have had their faces flayed to make them barely distinguishable from the monks. Most work in the engine room (area M5) during the day, and are penned together at night in the cells of area M6. A smaller group of more dangerous humanoids has been permanently imprisoned in that same area.": "寺院里关押着大约三十名人形囚犯（{@creature Commoner||Commoners}）。所有的人都被剥去了脸皮，使他们几乎无法与僧侣们区分开来。大多数人白天在机房（M5区）工作，晚上则被关在M6区的牢房里。一小部分更危险的人形生物被永久地囚禁在同一区域。",
	"Several of the prisoners are survivors from previous expeditions sent into the Barrier Peaks by the Cartophile. They recognize any of the hirelings with the characters, or any other signs of the Cartophile's patronage (maps, notebooks, and so forth). Once contact has been made, they look to help the characters—especially if this also leads to their own escape. However, most of the other prisoners are former monks that tried to leave or otherwise got into trouble, and they look to curry favor with their captors by reporting subversive activity.": "有几个囚犯是以前被嗜车者派往壁垒峰的探险队的幸存者。他们能认出任何与人物在一起的雇佣者，或者任何其他有Cartophile赞助的迹象（地图、笔记本等等）。一旦取得联系，他们就会去帮助这些人物--特别是如果这也会导致他们自己的逃跑。然而，大多数其他囚犯都是试图离开或陷入麻烦的前僧侣，他们希望通过报告颠覆活动来讨好他们的俘虏。",

	"At the surface level of the floating rock island, the monastery is laid out as a large campus composed of sharp-angled buildings.

Five monks led by an elder can be found here, silently going about the business of gardening, observing prayers, scrubbing flagstones, and other mundane activities.": "在浮动石岛的表面，寺院被布置成一个由尖角建筑组成的大型校园。这些建筑像巨大的金属晶体一样突出地面，它们之间有杂乱无章的花园，小路蜿蜒而过。这里有五名僧侣，由一名长老带领，默默地进行着园艺、观察祈祷、擦洗旗杆石和其他世俗活动的工作。",
	"With a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check made to quietly search or inspect the area, a character learns a number of things regarding the monastery's darker nature. Graffiti scratched into the walls in thieves' cant and Infernal reveals dire sentiments regarding how the doubtful are punished, and how only service to the monastery can keep it aloft. In addition, the original metal of the structures here has been melted and reworked in many places into a preponderance of leering skulls.": "如果成功通过DC12智力({@skill Investigation})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查，悄悄地搜索或检查这个区域，角色就会了解到一些关于修道院的黑暗本质的事情。用盗贼的语气和无间道在墙上的涂鸦揭示了关于可疑者如何受到惩罚的可怕情绪，以及只有对修道院的服务才能使它保持高尚。此外，这里结构的原始金属已经被熔化，并在许多地方被重新加工成大量可耻的头骨。",

	"At the far end of the nave, a throne resembling a twisted metal captain's chair rises from a metallic dais backed by an ornate arch. There sits the Grand Master of the Distressed Body—a bone devil flanked by two massive bodyguards. The Grand Master wears a patchwork leather robe and a gleaming crown, and it carries a scepter set with odd crystal bumps and metal flanges. With its other hand, the devil taps the arm of the throne, showing off nails set with gleaming metallic shards.": "在大殿的远端，一个类似于扭曲的金属船长椅的宝座从一个金属台子上升起，台子后面是一个华丽的拱门。那里坐着的是 \"痛苦的身体 \"的大法师--一个骨质的魔鬼，两边是两个巨大的保镖。大法师穿着一件拼接的皮袍，戴着一顶闪闪发光的皇冠，拿着一根镶嵌着奇怪的水晶凸点和金属凸缘的权杖。魔鬼用另一只手拍打着王座的手臂，露出镶嵌着闪亮金属碎片的指甲。",
	"\"Welcome,\" the Grand Master says. \"We get few supplicants here of your obvious experience and skill. You shall do well in service here at the monastery. But will that service be with the strength of your bodies or the strength of your minds?\"": "\"欢迎，\"大法师说。\"我们这里很少有像你这样有明显经验和技能的祈求者。你们将在寺院的服务中表现出色。但这种服务是用你们身体的力量还是用你们思想的力量？\"",
	"As the characters draw closer to the Grand Master, anyone can see that the devil's horrid leather cloak is crafted from the faces of flayed monks and prisoners, the flesh cured to leather and roughly stitched together. The scepter and crown it bears appear almost mechanical in nature, and are crafted from repurposed magical-mechanical parts from the planar craft. Large rings seemingly crafted in the same way encircle the devil's arms and tail.": "随着人物越来越接近大法师，任何人都可以看到，魔鬼可怕的皮斗篷是由剥落的僧侣和囚犯的脸制成的，肉体被固化为皮革，粗略地缝合在一起。它所带的权杖和王冠看起来几乎是机械性的，是由平面工艺中的魔法机械部件重新制作而成的。大环似乎是以同样的方式制作的，环绕着恶魔的手臂和尾巴。",
	"If a monk escorted the characters here, the Grand Master makes an example of that servitor for allowing weapons to be brought into its holy presence. Otherwise, the Grand Master is making an example of a random monk when the characters enter this area. In either event, the devil's elder monk bodyguards (see below) are ordered to strike with their exotic weapons, executing the errant monk while the Grand Master welcomes the characters.": "如果有僧侣护送人物到此，大法师就会以该仆人为榜样，因为他允许武器被带入其圣地。否则，当人物进入这个区域时，大法师就会对一个随机的僧侣做出榜样。无论是哪种情况，魔鬼的长老僧侣保镖（见下文）都会被命令用他们的异域武器出击，在大法师欢迎这些人物的同时处决那个犯错的僧侣。",
	"The bone devil is an arrogant bully, and assumes that the characters have come to join its cult. However, it also comes across as whiny and petulant, reliant on the protection of its bodyguards rather than making any physical threats. If asked about Kwalish, the Grand Master gladly recounts how it took over the floating island and drove Kwalish to a second location—some lost city farther into the Barrier Peaks.": "骨魔是个傲慢的恶棍，它认为这些人物是来加入它的邪教的。然而，它也表现得爱发牢骚、爱撒娇，依赖其保镖的保护，而不是进行任何人身威胁。如果被问及Kwalish，大法师会很高兴地讲述它是如何占领浮岛并将Kwalish赶到第二个地方--某个更远的壁垒峰的失落城市。",
	"The devil has seen Kwalish's notes (found in the treasury, area M10), which confirm that the inventor was intent on seeking the legendary city of Daoine Gloine. It offers to let the characters see them as well—in exchange for the \"modest fee\" of all the characters' magic items, and one year of service from either the strongest or most intelligent character. (The devil is always in need of fresh servants to shovel fuel in the engine room, and fresh minds to replace the brains in the control room.) If the characters reject this offer, the Grand Master demands a year of service simply for the honor of the characters having visited the monastery, after which they are free to leave.": "恶魔看到了Kwalish的笔记（在库房中找到，M10区），证实了发明家有意寻找传说中的城市Daoine Gloine。它提出让角色们也看看这些笔记--以所有角色的魔法物品的 \"适度费用\"，以及最强壮或最聪明的角色一年的服务作为交换。(魔鬼总是需要新的仆人在机房里铲油，需要新的头脑来取代控制室里的大脑）。如果角色拒绝这个提议，大法师会要求他们服务一年，这仅仅是为了角色访问修道院的荣誉，之后他们就可以自由离开。",
	"Any characters foolish enough to volunteer their service are taken to the leather works (area M7) to have their faces flayed. As soon as those characters are out of the abbey, the Grand Master orders the other adventurers to be murdered and looted. If it is attacked or its orders are openly defied, the bone devil orders the characters attacked at once. The Grand Master fights only if directly threatened, or if its bodyguards and monks appear to be losing the fight.": "任何愚蠢到自愿服务的角色都会被带到皮革厂（M7区）剥去脸皮。一旦这些角色离开了修道院，大法师就会命令其他冒险者被谋杀和掠夺。如果它受到攻击或它的命令被公然违抗，骨魔就会命令这些角色立即受到攻击。大法师只有在受到直接威胁时才会战斗，或者它的保镖和僧侣似乎在战斗中失败。",

When the devil rolls a 20 on an attack roll with a claw, the target is decapitated. (At your option, the attack can instead deal an extra {@dice 6d8} slashing damage.) A target is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, has legendary actions, doesn't have or need a head, or if you decide that the target is too large for its head to be cut off by the devil's claws. If removed, the shards lose their magical powers.": "曾经对着魔鬼打碎的{@item Vorpal Sword}的碎片取代了它的爪子。成功通过DC12智力({@skill Arcana})或智慧({@skill Perception})检查可识别它们的身份。当魔鬼在用爪子攻击时掷出20分，目标会被斩首。(根据你的选择，攻击可以造成额外的{@dice 6d8}砍击伤害。) 如果目标对砍杀伤害免疫，有传奇行动，没有或不需要头，或者你决定目标太大，它的头会被恶魔的爪子砍掉，那么它就对这个效果免疫。如果被移除，碎片会失去它们的魔力。",

	"The Grand Master makes for a difficult fight on its own, and the addition of bodyguards and monks targeting characters from the balconies could quickly overwhelm a party.

	"If the Grand Master is slain, the bone devil is revealed to be an advanced ruse—a war machine of Kwalish's design, piloted by a particularly ingenious {@creature Quasit} named Whazzit. The original bone devil met its demise after Kwalish's exile, when it was drawn into the laboratory's machinery while trying to convert the planar craft into the monastery. This rendered the devil into the treasury's brain in a jar. In the aftermath, the Grand Master's servant Whazzit discovered Kwalish's war machine designs and managed to construct it using the bone devil's exoskeleton. The tiny fiend has kept up this pretense for years, piloting this exoskeleton in the guise of the Grand Master. If the Grand Master's true nature is discovered, the quasit immediately surrenders and any remaining monks quickly and chaotically revolt.

(The throne was once the control center of the archway—the gate Kwalish opened to the Nine Hells, crafted from the technology of the crashed planar craft.)": "宝座是一个由魔法机械部件组成的组合，背后是一个立着的金属拱门，上面镶嵌着复杂的花纹。宝座的扶手上设置了一系列复杂的仪器，尽管许多控制装置已经被剥离了。(王座曾经是拱门的控制中心--奎利什打开的通往九层地狱的大门，由坠毁的星球飞船的技术制作而成）。",
	"A character who sits on the throne notes that many of its instruments are still operational, allowing them to track the comings and goings of the merrenoloth's ferry.

Treat a successful check as if the character had cast the {@spell gate} spell to open a gate to the Nine Hells.": "坐在宝座上的人物注意到，宝座上的许多仪器仍在运作，使他们能够追踪梅里诺洛斯渡船的来去。如果坐在宝座上的生物戴着骨魔的冠冕，拿着它的权杖，该生物可以尝试用DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查来重新打开拱门。如果检查成功，就像该角色施展了{@spell gate}的法术来打开通往九幽地狱的大门一样。",
	"The crown and scepter are crafted of rare metal alloys and set with jeweled crystalline buttons plundered from the planar craft's instrument panels. They have no magical power outside the monastery and the city of Daoine Gloine (see area O4), but if sold as art objects, the crown is worth 500 gp and the scepter is worth 750 gp.": "王冠和权杖由稀有的金属合金制成，并镶有从平面飞船的仪表板上掠夺来的宝石晶石按钮。它们在修道院和道恩-格洛因城（见O4区）之外没有魔法力量，但如果作为艺术品出售，王冠价值500金币，权杖价值750金币。",

The powerful fires of those furnaces keep the monastery in the air, and instantly destroy anything thrown into their open vents.": "最初由平面飞行器运载的燃料早已耗尽，现在囚犯们将从周围的山中开采的低级矿石铲入这片区域下面的熔炉。这些熔炉的强大火力使寺院保持在空中，并立即摧毁任何被扔进其开放的通风口的东西。",
	"If ore ceases to be fed to the furnaces (most likely due to the characters freeing the prisoners here and breaking the Grand Master's power) the engines begin to fail over a 24-hour period. When the furnaces stop burning after that point, the monastery plunges into the valley to be destroyed, along with any creatures still inside it.": "如果矿石不再被送入熔炉（很可能是由于角色释放了这里的囚犯并打破了大法师的权力），引擎就会在24小时内开始失效。当熔炉在那之后停止燃烧时，寺院就会坠入山谷，连同里面的任何生物一起被摧毁。",

	"The cells are all repurposed metal containers from the planar craft, and are all locked. A character can pick a cell's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The metal of the cells is especially susceptible to the planar craft's technology, allowing a lock to be automatically sliced open with an attack from an elder monk's force pike.": "这些牢房都是由平面工艺改造的金属容器，并且都上了锁。一个角色可以使用盗贼的工具，通过成功的DC15灵巧检查来撬开一个牢房的锁。牢房的金属特别容易受到平面工艺技术的影响，允许用长老僧侣的力矛攻击自动切开锁。",

All of Kwalish's companions died at the hands of the sphinx, but the inventor managed to harvest their brains in order to return them to a semblance of life. Kwalish promised to research a means of finding new bodies for his fallen companions, but was driven away by the Grand Master before he could complete this task.

	"When Kwalish found it, the legendary lost city of Daoine Gloine was already an isolated mountain settlement. After he took over, the inventor set about closing off any and all routes to the site. As such, as the characters follow the notes found in Kwalish's journal, they find that the narrow mountain passes begin to tighten around them the closer they come to the location where the city is said to be. Many of the passes, tunnels, and trails the characters follow are deliberately blocked off with rockslides and other unexplained disasters. The need to circumnavigate such areas accounts for much of the travel time to the city, unless the characters have arranged an alternative method of travel.": "当Kwalish发现它的时候，传说中的失落之城Daoine Gloine已经是一个与世隔绝的山区定居点。在他接手后，这位发明家着手关闭了通往该地的所有路线。因此，当人物按照Kwalish日记中的说明行事时，他们发现，越是接近传说中的城市所在地，周围狭窄的山路就越是紧张。人物所走过的许多通道、隧道和小路都被故意用岩石滑坡和其他无法解释的灾难封锁了。绕过这些区域的需要占去了前往城市的大部分时间，除非人物安排了其他的旅行方式。",

	"The city of Daoine Gloine has long been thought of as mere legend—just another strange tale from the already-strange Barrier Peaks. Occasionally, travelers would return from the mountains with wild claims of having been lost in the peaks and visiting the city by accident. And though none of them could produce a full map showing the route they took, their stories all shared a common element—that Daoine Gloine was populated by creatures made of living glass, tended to by kenku in love with those creatures' shining beauty. These occasional tales drove more explorers—including Kwalish's own expedition—to seek out the route to Daoine Gloine and learn the truth of who dwelled there.": "Daoine Gloine城长期以来一直被认为只是一个传说--只是来自已经很奇怪的屏障山峰的另一个奇怪的故事。偶尔会有旅行者从山上回来，疯狂地宣称自己在山峰中迷路，意外地来到了这座城市。尽管他们中没有人能够拿出一张完整的地图来显示他们所走的路线，但他们的故事都有一个共同点--道恩-格洛因的居民都是由活的玻璃制成的生物，由热爱这些生物的闪亮之美的肯库来照顾。这些偶发的故事促使更多的探险家--包括Kwalish自己的探险队--去寻找通往Daoine Gloine的路线，了解谁居住在那里的真相。",
	"As is often the case, the common tales had more sinister origins. In ages past, the kenku that inhabited the city captured a unique medusa—{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}, whose gaze could transform victims into glass instead of stone. A cult of the medusa arose to worship the creature, which was effectively incarcerated within a central temple. Kenku priests brought regular sacrificial victims—both willing and unwilling—to stand before the medusa's gaze. And when {@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR} died, the kenku raised her in undeath to prolong their cult, continuing to fill their city with glass statues.": "正如通常的情况一样，普通的故事有更邪恶的起源。在过去的岁月里，居住在这座城市的肯库人捕获了一个独特的美杜莎--{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}，它的目光可以把受害者变成玻璃而不是石头。对美杜莎的崇拜应运而生，美杜莎被有效地囚禁在一个中央神庙里。Kenku祭司们定期带着牺牲品--无论是自愿的还是不愿意的--站在美杜莎的目光面前。当(1%)死亡时，肯库人在未死时将她复活，以延长他们的崇拜，继续用玻璃雕像填满他们的城市。",
	"After Kwalish fled his first laboratory, he used the initial research of his expedition to eventually make his way to Daoine Gloine. But instead of being welcomed and allowed to work in peace, Kwalish found the city's evil high priest threatening to transform him into Daoine Gloine's latest art installation. Desperate, Kwalish constructed another planar gateway while imprisoned in the temple, then opened a portal to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits. A flood of ooze issued forth, driving the kenku from Daoine Gloine and effectively sealing the city away from the rest of the world.": "在Kwalish逃离他的第一个实验室后，他利用最初的考察研究，最终来到Daoine Gloine。但是，Kwalish并没有受到欢迎并被允许和平地工作，而是发现这个城市邪恶的大祭司威胁要把他变成Daoine Gloine的最新艺术装置。绝望的Kwalish在被囚禁在神庙中时建造了另一个平面网关，然后打开了一个通往深渊第222层的门户--Juiblex的粘液坑。渗出物的洪流喷涌而出，将肯库赶出了道恩-格洛因，并有效地将该城市与世界其他地方隔离开来。",
	"The entire site—including the entrance to Kwalish's second lab—now spreads beneath a deadly layer of clear gelatinous ooze—perfectly preserved, eerily staged, and utterly devoid of anything organic.

The magically enhanced demilich skull built into the lab's instrumentation panels is used to channel a character's soul energy once the bargain is struck. A character who has a portion of their soul removed in this way falls under a curse. While so cursed, whenever the character drops to 0 hit points, they are treated as if they had already failed one death saving throw.

	"Kwalish is missing, trapped in stasis inside his own {@i powered armor}. The characters must first discover him there by making a close-up investigation of the armor, then find a way to access its controls. This can be accomplished with a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check made with thieves' tools or tinker's tools. Alternatively, characters who experiment with tools found throughout the lab can access the armor's controls given enough time.

As best he can, Kwalish tries to instruct characters in the methods that might reconstitute his body (with those methods determined by you). Unfortunately, some of his body parts have been installed elsewhere in the city (within other baubles, forming part of the kraken's engine, and so forth) and must be tracked down.": "夸里什失踪了，他的肉体被卷入他的实验室设备中，并被转化为各种身体部件，这些部件现在通过玻璃管道永久地进行着。然而，他的思想仍然可以通过各种方式进行交流--发条蚂蚁形成的信号和标志、机械手画出的信息、与被困的读心者的协商，等等。夸里什尽其所能，试图用可能重建他身体的方法来指导角色（这些方法由你决定）。不幸的是，他的一些身体部位已经被安装在城市的其他地方（在其他宝物中，形成克拉肯的引擎的一部分，等等），必须被追踪到。",
	"If the characters are successful, the regenerated Kwalish is grateful enough to help them with their quest even without payment. He then offers an additional boon to any interested character, granting the use of his laboratory to craft or summon any item or creature they desire (within any limits you set). However, the price for this service is one piece of the character's soul, as above.": "如果人物成功了，再生的Kwalish很感激，即使没有报酬也会帮助他们完成任务。然后，他向任何感兴趣的角色提供额外的恩惠，允许使用他的实验室来制作或召唤他们想要的任何物品或生物（在你设定的任何限制内）。然而，这项服务的代价是该人物的一块灵魂，如上所述。",
	"However he is met, Kwalish presents himself as a detached, single-minded researcher. In his mind, his work is more important than any other concerns, and he believes that the secrets of the technology found in the Barrier Peaks hold a vast potential to advance knowledge. If questioned, he proudly details his experiments (including with the {@i powered armor}), as well as the complete history of his time in the Barrier Peaks. If pressed, he talks of how he salvaged the minds of the members of his first expedition only after they were slain by the sphinx, and of how he buried Daoine Gloine in ooze only after discovering its inhabitants to be depraved cultists. In both cases, the inventor deemed his desperate actions as necessary measures to advance his research.": "无论人们如何认识他，夸里什都把自己表现为一个超然的、一心一意的研究者。在他看来，他的工作比其他任何问题都要重要，他相信在壁垒峰发现的技术秘密拥有推动知识发展的巨大潜力。如果被问及，他自豪地详述了他的实验（包括与{@i powered armor}的实验），以及他在壁垒峰的完整历史。如果被追问，他就会说到他是如何在第一次探险的成员被狮身人面像杀死后才抢救出他们的思想，以及他是如何在发现Daoine Gloine的居民是堕落的邪教徒后才将其埋入渗水中。在这两种情况下，发明家认为他的绝望行为是推进其研究的必要措施。",
	"If the characters engage Kwalish successfully, or as an added reward if they rescue him, the inventor can use his skill to remove the curse imposed by the enhanced sphinx (whose machinery he created). This restores to normal any ability scores decreased by the sphinx (see {@area area C2|034|x}).": "如果人物成功地与Kwalish交战，或者作为额外的奖励，如果他们救了他，发明家可以使用他的技能来消除由增强的斯芬克斯（他创造的机器）所带来的诅咒。这将使任何被斯芬克斯降低的能力分数恢复正常（见（%0%））。",
	"If negotiations break down, or if the characters take unkindly to Kwalish's cavalier attitude toward life, they might decide to confront and attack him. Kwalish first creates a distraction by releasing the mephits and the mind flayer in his lab as an action. He then turns on the monitor and ducks down to stay out of the medusa's field of view. During the subsequent chaos, the gnome attempts to don the {@i powered armor}, then wreak havoc.": "如果谈判破裂，或者如果角色们对Kwalish对生命的轻率态度不以为然，他们可能会决定对抗和攻击他。夸里什首先通过释放他实验室里的梅菲特和心灵杀手的行动来分散注意力。然后，他打开监视器，并躲在一旁，以避开美杜莎的视野。在随后的混乱中，地精试图穿上（%0%），然后大肆破坏。",
	"Depending on your specific adventure hook and how this adventure fits into your overall campaign, completing the adventure might have multiple ramifications.": "根据你具体的冒险钩子和这个冒险如何适合你的整个活动，完成冒险可能有多种后果。",
	"If Kwalish's knowledge was needed to oppose threats in other lands, those threats might have been permanently quelled—or they might only have been temporarily driven back. Moreover, Kwalish's aid could inadvertently create new threats, as might happen if opening the coffin-prison of the vampire, Ctenmiir, opens similar Kwalish-designed prisons across the world.": "如果需要Kwalish的知识来反对其他土地上的威胁，这些威胁可能已经被永久平息了，或者它们可能只是被暂时赶了回去。此外，Kwalish的援助可能无意中创造了新的威胁，如果打开吸血鬼Ctenmiir的棺材监狱，在世界各地打开类似Kwalish设计的监狱，就可能发生这种情况。",
	"The power in the Barrier Peaks likely shifts dramatically if the Grand Master is defeated, and a new power struggle soon ensues for control of the monastery. If Ctenmiir escapes or is freed, he might return to the monastery to occupy it as his new lair. {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK} joins him there, creating a sanctum of evil magic. If Gearbox has connected with the monastery, he might remain there as the pair's unwitting servant—or the modron might seek to overthrow this new set of evil lords in the name of establishing the monastery as a place of pure knowledge and balance.": "如果大法师被打败，壁垒峰的权力很可能会发生巨大的转变，很快就会出现新的权力斗争，以争夺对修道院的控制权。如果克滕米尔逃脱或被释放，他可能会回到修道院，占据它作为他的新巢穴。{@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK}在那里加入他，创造一个邪恶魔法的圣地。如果齿轮箱与修道院有联系，他可能会留在那里，成为这对夫妇不知情的仆人，或者莫德隆可能会以建立修道院作为一个纯粹的知识和平衡的地方为名，寻求推翻这套新的邪恶领主。",
	"Kwalish has long yearned to help the members of his former expedition trapped as brains in jars in the Monastery of the Distressed Body. Knowing that they still survive, he might provide instructions and materials for the characters to return to the monastery and provide the brains with new bodies. And in Daoine Gloine, the characters might entreat the inventor to discover a way to return the vitrified statues of the city to flesh. (If the characters haven't destroyed the undead medusa yet, such means might involve a side quest where they bring Kwalish her severed head.)": "夸里什长期以来一直渴望帮助他以前的探险队成员，他们作为大脑被困在痛苦的身体修道院的罐子里。知道他们还活着，他可能会为人物提供指示和材料，让他们回到修道院，为大脑提供新的身体。而在Daoine Gloine，人物可能会恳求发明家发现一种方法，使城市中的玻璃雕像恢复肉身。(如果人物还没有消灭不死的冥王，这种方法可能会涉及到一个副线任务，他们会把Kwalish的头割下来。）",
	"Ultimately, Kwalish might become a patron of sorts to the party, especially if the {@i powered armor} is loaned out. If any character has bestowed a bit of their soul to the inventor, he promises to return it in exchange for the completion of certain tasks he sets before them (including helping restore his friends). The place of such a valuable and powerful contact in the campaign is yours to determine.": "最终，夸里什可能会成为党的某种赞助人，特别是如果（%0%）被借出。如果有哪个角色将自己的一点灵魂赐予了这位发明家，他就会承诺以完成他布置的某些任务（包括帮助恢复他的朋友）为交换条件将其归还。这样一个有价值的、强大的联系人在活动中的地位由你来决定。",
	"The Cartophile possesses a good number of treasure maps in his extensive collections—some of which are even accurate. As an added reward for returning with maps and news of Kwalish's original expedition, he might gift one such map to the characters.

	"Since his expedition vanished ages ago, it's prudent to think about how it's possible for Kwalish to be found alive and well in his lab. If the gnome is found trapped inside the powered armor in stasis or scattered throughout his laboratory, the answer is easy. You might also consider that Kwalish's research into the planar craft's magical technology, astral cords, and similar topics might have allowed him to prolong his life indefinitely by magical means. Alternatively, given the inventor's ability to craft lifelike constructs, this version of Kwalish might not be the original gnome at all.": "由于他的探险队在很久以前就消失了，所以我们应该谨慎地思考，怎么可能在他的实验室里发现Kwalish还活着。如果发现地精被困在停滞的动力装甲内，或者散落在他的实验室里，答案就很简单了。你也可以考虑Kwalish对平面飞行器的魔法技术、星际绳索和类似主题的研究可能使他能够通过魔法手段无限期地延长自己的生命。另外，鉴于发明家有能力制作栩栩如生的构造物，这个版本的Kwalish可能根本不是原来的地精。",

	"He might be a criminal agent working for the Monastery of the Distressed Body, sending party after adventuring party to become new prisoners of the Grand Master.

	"Even if his goals are legitimate, the Cartophile's desire to trace the original expedition of his ancestors might offer further connections to be developed. If one of the brains in jars belongs to one of those relatives and is provided with a new body (see below), it might return to civilization with the characters. The Cartophile will be keen to meet this ancestor, perhaps leading to a new family business. Or considering that they're both gnomes, perhaps Kwalish is the ancestor the Cartophile sought all along!": "即使他的目标是合法的，Cartophile对追踪其祖先最初的远征的渴望也可能提供进一步的联系，以待开发。如果罐子里的一个大脑属于这些亲戚之一，并被提供了一个新的身体（见下文），它可能会和人物一起回到文明社会。嗜车族会很想见见这位祖先，也许会促成新的家族生意。或者考虑到他们都是地精，也许Kwalish就是Cartophile一直在寻找的祖先!",
	"A number of options present themselves for using the {@i deck of several things} within the adventure. As written, Mary already carries the deck, and no matter how many cards are drawn from it, the complete deck reappears magically in her possession at the conclusion of the adventure. But if she remains as an NPC in your campaign, or is first placed in an earlier adventure, consider modifying the cards' effects to more broadly fit the campaign.": "在冒险中使用（%0%）有很多选择。按照写法，玛丽已经携带了这副牌，无论从里面抽出多少张牌，在冒险结束时，整副牌都会神奇地重新出现在她手中。但是，如果她在你的活动中仍然是一个NPC，或者第一次被放在早期的冒险中，可以考虑修改卡片的效果以更广泛地适应活动。",
	"You might also decide that the cards' effects are as closely tied to the adventure as they are because they are really a set of clockwork-controlling punch cards from the crashed planar craft. Whether Gearbox is with the party or not, the cards might be used to connect to any of the technology in the adventure that the modron can interface with. You might also add additional possible effects, such as inserting the correct card into the sphinx's enhanced brain in order to issue it commands. Even if used in these ways, though, a card must first be formally drawn so that its primary effect can play out.": "你也可以决定这些卡片的效果与冒险紧密相连，因为它们实际上是一套来自坠毁的平面飞船的时钟控制打卡机。无论齿轮箱是否和聚会在一起，这些卡片都可以用来连接冒险中的任何技术，而这些技术是modron可以连接的。你还可以增加额外的可能效果，比如将正确的卡片插入斯芬克斯的强化大脑，以便向它发出指令。不过，即使以这些方式使用，也必须首先正式抽出一张牌，以便发挥其主要效果。",
	"Additionally (and especially if the characters don't choose to take Mary as a hireling), the {@i deck of several things} might not be in her possession. Instead, characters can find the cards scattered in various locations throughout the adventure, allowing them to be collected, then used.": "此外（特别是如果角色没有选择把玛丽作为雇佣者），（%0%）可能不在她的手中。相反，人物可以在整个冒险过程中找到散落在不同地点的卡片，让他们收集，然后使用。",
	"Plenty of additional options can be used during the process of resolving the sphinx's riddle, including working with the idea that because the enhanced sphinx gains much new knowledge from outlaws crossing into the monastery, asking about good-aligned topics might negate its advantage on the Intelligence check it makes to answer. Alternatively, you might decide that the dock the sphinx sits on magically fuels its enhanced abilities, and that by tricking or forcing the creature off the dock, it has disadvantage on its Intelligence checks to answer.": "在解决狮身人面像的谜语的过程中，还有很多其他的选择，包括这样的想法：由于增强的狮身人面像从穿越到修道院的歹徒那里获得了很多新的知识，问一些善意的话题可能会否定它在回答问题时的智力检查的优势。另外，你也可以决定狮身人面像所坐的码头为其增强的能力提供了神奇的动力，通过欺骗或迫使该生物离开码头，它在回答问题的智力测验中处于不利地位。",
	"Another obvious option is to allow the characters to trick the sphinx with a logical conundrum, perhaps along the lines of asking: {@i How can we cross to the monastery without paying the toll}? The answer to the question is to ask the question, pressing the sphinx into a strange loop of logic that forces her to let the characters pass. It's also possible that the characters might wish to use the enhanced sphinx to ask a question they truly need to know the answer to, perhaps from some other mystery in your campaign. The sphinx always answers truly, and so can be used to provide rare knowledge or lore if the characters are willing to pay the price.": "另一个明显的选择是让人物用一个逻辑难题来欺骗斯芬克斯，也许可以按照这样的思路来问。{@i How can we cross to the monastery without paying the toll}? 的答案，将狮身人面像压入一个奇怪的逻辑循环，迫使她让人物通过。角色们也有可能希望利用增强的狮身人面像来问一个他们真正需要知道答案的问题，也许是来自你的战役中的其他神秘事件。狮身人面像的回答总是真实的，因此如果角色愿意付出代价，它可以用来提供稀有的知识或传说。",
	"As a custodian of rare knowledge, the sphinx might have long coveted the knowledge of the monastery's brains in jars—all of them creatures with advanced intellect and a unique perspective on the world. She might strike a deal with the characters if they agree to find the brains and bring her one, allowing them to summon the ferry without paying her toll.": "作为稀有知识的守护者，斯芬克斯可能长期以来一直觊觎修道院罐子里的大脑知识--他们都是拥有高级智力和对世界独特视角的生物。她可能会与人物达成协议，如果他们同意找到大脑并给她带来一个，允许他们召唤渡船而无需支付她的费用。",
	"If the sphinx is slain, the mechanical items that circle around her (functioning as {@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones}) might all be released. The life force they contain (in the form of decreases to ability scores) might then be usable by their original owners to reverse the decrease. If any of those owners are still alive, the stones might help guide the characters to them, allowing the party to gain favor by returning the sphinx's toll to some of those who have paid it. If Mary is with the party, she might seek to keep all the mechanical {@item Ioun Stone|LLK|Ioun stones} for herself—and might stop at nothing to get them back if the other characters seize them.": "如果斯芬克斯被杀，围绕着她的机械物品（功能为（%0%））可能都会被释放。它们所包含的生命力（以能力分数下降的形式）可能会被它们原来的主人使用，以扭转下降的趋势。如果这些石头的主人还活着，这些石头可能会帮助引导人物找到他们，让队伍通过把狮身人面像的代价还给一些付出代价的人而获得青睐。如果玛丽和队伍在一起，她可能会想把所有的机械（%1%）据为己有--如果其他角色抢走了它们，她可能会不惜一切代价把它们抢回来。",
	"As the leader of the monastery, the Grand Master is meant to present a difficult but not impossible challenge. You might wish to modify his capabilities depending on the relative power of the characters.": "作为寺院的领袖，大法师是为了提出一个困难但并非不可能的挑战。你可能希望根据人物的相对能力来修改他的能力。",
	"Even while keeping the idea that the grand master's claw shards are from a {@item Vorpal Sword}, you might wish to mitigate their threat of an instant kill by having them deal an extra {@dice 6d8} slashing damage instead.

	"Another option is to allow decapitated characters to have their heads magically reattached and their life restored at the leather works, through the advice of the control room brains or Kwalish's notes. Similarly, you might have notes and technology found throughout the adventure that allow the characters to recreate the {@item Vorpal Sword} successfully if the shards are recovered.": "另一个选择是，通过控制室的大脑或Kwalish的笔记的建议，让被斩首的角色在皮革厂神奇地重新接上头，恢复生命。同样地，你可能会在整个冒险过程中发现一些笔记和技术，如果碎片被找回，就可以让角色成功再造（%0%）。",

	"Depending on your campaign, you might wish to identify some or all of the monastery's brains with other figures from D&D lore. Perhaps the monastery has long been home to obscure or lesser-known figures such as Quaal, Queen Ehlissa, Keoghtom, Nolzur, and Tuerny the Merciless—all of them known mostly for the magic items that bear their names. If you use Nolzur, the creator of {@item Nolzur's Marvelous Pigments} would be of special interest to Garret, while Tuerny (creator of the lost artifact {@i The {@item Iron Flask} of Tuerny the Merciless}) would be of special interest to {@creature Mary Greymalkin|LLK}.": "根据你的活动，你可能希望将修道院的部分或全部大脑与D&D传说中的其他人物联系起来。也许这个修道院长期以来一直是一些不知名或不太出名的人物的家，比如夸尔、埃利萨女王、基奥格托姆、诺尔祖尔和雇佣兵图尔尼--他们都因以他们的名字命名的魔法物品而闻名。如果你使用诺尔祖尔，那么（%0%）的创造者会让加雷特特别感兴趣，而图尔尼（无情的图尔尼的失落神器（%1%）的创造者}）则会让（%2%）特别感兴趣。",
	"Every brain in a jar is desperate for a new body, and a brain immediately agrees to aid the characters any way it can if they promise to restore it to life. Any number of possible options might be available to characters wanting to achieve this end. Most easily, the brains can guide characters through the process of transferring their intellect into a host such as a slain monk, or a mechanical entity such as Ctenmiir's coffin or Gearbox. This process requires a successful DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check or Dexterity check with thieves' tools or tinker's tools. However, on a failed check, the brain is destroyed and any floating disks it controls in the treasury (area M10) are permanently deactivated.": "罐子里的每一个大脑都渴望得到一个新的身体，而一个大脑立即同意以任何方式帮助人物，如果他们答应恢复它的生命。想达到这个目的的角色可以有任何数量的可能选择。最简单的是，大脑可以引导角色完成将他们的智力转移到一个宿主身上的过程，比如一个被杀的僧侣，或者一个机械实体，比如Ctenmiir的棺材或齿轮箱。这个过程需要成功的DC14智慧（（%0%））检查或使用盗贼工具或工匠工具的灵巧检查。然而，如果检查失败，大脑就会被摧毁，它在库房（M10区）控制的任何浮动磁盘也会被永久停用。",
	"The characters might also attempt to craft an entirely new mechanical body as a brain host—either individual bodies for each brain, or a single body that houses all the brains at once. Doing so requires a suitable amount of time, access to materials, and a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check or Dexterity check with thieves' tools or tinker's tools. Furthermore, each such body also requires a new energy cell from the treasury.": "角色们也可以尝试制作一个全新的机械身体作为大脑的宿主--或者为每个大脑制作单独的身体，或者为一个单一的身体同时容纳所有的大脑。这样做需要有适当的时间，能够获得材料，以及成功通过DC16智力（（%0%））检查或使用盗贼工具或工匠工具的灵巧检查。此外，每一个这样的身体也需要从宝库中获得一个新的能量细胞。",
	"You could also establish that the process of returning a brain to a new body might require knowledge available only from Kwalish. In this scenario, one or more brains will secure a promise from the characters to return with this knowledge—or they might seek to accompany them onward. The brains can go mobile by attaching their canisters to Gearbox, Ctenmiir's coffin, the merrenoloth's skiff, one of the treasury floating disks made mobile—or even to the characters themselves.": "你还可以确定，将大脑送回新身体的过程可能需要只有Kwalish才能提供的知识。在这种情况下，一个或多个大脑将从人物那里获得承诺，带着这些知识回来，或者他们可能会寻求陪同他们继续前进。大脑可以通过将它们的罐子固定在齿轮箱、Ctenmiir的棺材、Merrenoloth的小船、一个可移动的国库浮动盘上，甚至是人物本身。",
	"If you work with the idea that the sphinx seeks the knowledge held by the brains in jars, the brains know this—and greatly fear that outcome. They might strike a deal with the characters to use their control over the monastery to aid the party—but only if they agree to first go back and slay the sphinx. Once the sphinx is slain—or if the characters killed it before coming to the monastery—any ability checks made to deal with the brains are made with advantage.": "如果你认为狮身人面像在寻找罐子里的大脑所持有的知识，那么大脑知道这一点，并且非常害怕这种结果。他们可能会与角色达成协议，利用他们对修道院的控制来帮助他们--但前提是他们同意先回去杀死斯芬克斯。一旦狮身人面像被杀死，或者如果人物在来到寺院之前就杀死了它，那么任何与大脑打交道的能力检查都是有利的。",
	"The original {@i Expedition to the Barrier Peaks} mapped out six levels of the adventure's crashed ship: \"a large exploration-colonization expedition of human origin.\" This adventure focuses on only a cursory exploration of a similarly crashed planar craft, but you can easily expand the adventure by allowing characters to discover portals in the monastery that lead to lower levels of the vessel.": "原来（%0%）绘制了冒险的坠落飞船的六层。\"一支源自人类的大型探索-殖民化探险队\"。这个冒险的重点只是粗略地探索了一个类似的坠毁的平面飞船，但你可以通过让角色在修道院里发现通往较低层的飞船的传送门来轻松地扩展这个冒险。",

Opening the cell could reveal the entrance standing open, with the prisoner gone and residing somewhere below.": "一个秘密入口可能隐藏在M3区大法师的宝座后面，打开后可以看到一个类似于铁制魔像的蜘蛛网状装置，并可作为攀登电梯下到下层甲板。另一个入口可能隐藏在M6区的一个被囚禁者的牢房里。打开牢房可以发现入口是敞开的，而囚犯已经离开，住在下面的某个地方。",
	"Any such entrance might need to be accessed with one of the {@i deck of several things}' clockwork control cards (see \"{@area Mary Greymalkin|0bd|x},\" above).

	"As an added challenge to the task of rescuing characters captured by the monks (including those who fall to the valley floor below the monastery), such prisoners might be outfitted with teleportation-field devices around their necks, so that their bodies and heads are separated and imprisoned in two different locations.

	"In the ooze-flooded city of Daoine Gloine, the high priest in area O5 might negotiate with the characters for a new physical body. She readily agrees to deactivate the clockwork kraken if the characters open her coffin and help her, suggesting that they drop her into the gelatinous ooze covering the city so that she can sink down and use one of Kwalish's armatures for a new body. However, you might decide that if this is done, the priest's still-potent magical power allows her to merge with the great ooze and control it—effectively using that titanic creature as the new body she seeks.": "在渗水城市Daoine Gloine，O5区的大祭司可能会与角色谈判，以获得新的肉体。如果角色们打开她的棺材并帮助她，她就会欣然同意停用发条克拉肯，并建议他们把她扔进覆盖城市的胶状渗水中，这样她就可以沉下去，用夸利什的一个臂章来换取新的身体。然而，你可以决定，如果这样做了，牧师仍然强大的魔法力量可以让她与巨大的渗出物融合并控制它，从而有效地使用那个巨大的生物作为她寻求的新身体。",
	"As the characters search through the endless baubles of Daoine Gloine, you might want to distinguish the single bauble leading to Kwalish's lab from the other crystal baubles by having it composed of diamond.

	"In addition to crafting new options for the encounters inside the baubles, you can set up each bauble so that leaving its extradimensional space requires some sort of victory condition.

Or you might have a creature Kwalish previously met through the gate arrive in response to it being opened. That creature might have knowledge to impart, a debt to repay, or a grudge to have righted. You could even have creatures from the two gates know of each another—and, as with the monastery's sphinx and brains in jars—attempt to work with the characters against one another.": "打开这些装置中的任何一个（在中央修道院或美杜莎之墓），都会产生施放一个（%0%）法术的效果。根据该法术，人物可能希望从大门通往的平面上命名一个特定的生物，希望能与之互动。或者你可以让Kwalish以前通过这扇门遇到的一个生物来到这里，以回应它被打开。那个生物可能有知识要传授，有债务要偿还，或者有怨恨要纠正。你甚至可以让两扇门里的生物互相认识--就像修道院的狮身人面像和罐子里的大脑一样--试图与角色合作来对付彼此。",
	"Additionally, the extradimensional portal Kwalish used to open a gate to the Abyss from Daoine Gloine might be reversible. If the characters meet descendants of the city's original inhabitants, they might be asked to free the city of the ooze, perhaps in exchange for valuable lost lore. Kwalish might also ask for their aid in restoring the city to its former state.": "此外，Kwalish用来从Daoine Gloine打开通往深渊之门的超维门户可能是可逆的。如果人物遇到城市原居民的后裔，他们可能会被要求将城市从淤泥中解放出来，也许是为了交换宝贵的失落的传说。奎利什也可能要求他们协助将城市恢复到以前的状态。",
	"If the undead medusa guarding area O4 is overcome, the crown and scepter recovered from the monastery can be used to open the temple gate, as noted in the adventure. A follow-up successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check can then trigger ritual magic that reverses the flood of ooze and sends it back to the Slime Pits. However, if this check is failed by 5 or more, the botched ritual summons forth a new plague of acidic slime—so potent that it quickly melts the stone of the city away, destroying Daoine Gloine for all time.": "如果守卫O4区的不死冥王被攻克，从寺院里找到的王冠和权杖就可以用来打开寺院大门，正如冒险中所提到的。后续成功的DC 15智力检查（（%0%））可以触发仪式性的魔法，逆转渗出物的洪流，并将其送回粘液坑。然而，如果这个检查失败了5次或更多，这个失败的仪式就会召唤出新的酸性粘液瘟疫--它是如此强大，以至于迅速融化了城市的石头，永远地摧毁了道恩-格罗因。",
	"To raise the stakes for characters attempting to activate or reverse the abyssal gate, you can also require that the character wearing the crown and holding the scepter must be in physical contact with the standing arch—making it impossible to activate the gate from inside the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} or any similar protective device.": "为了提高试图激活或逆转深渊之门的角色的赌注，你还可以要求戴着王冠和拿着权杖的角色必须与站立的拱门有物理接触，这使得从（%0%）或任何类似的保护装置内激活大门是不可能的。",
	"The legendary arcane inventor is presented as an obsessed, distracted, but basically benign figure in the adventure. However, you might choose to present him as a much more sinister villain. Instead of preserving the brains of his fallen comrades in the hope of one day reviving them, Kwalish might have worked with the sphinx to arrange their deaths in order to harvest their brains for his research. Any of the brains in jars in the Monastery of the Distressed Body can detail those events.": "传说中的奥术发明家在冒险中被表现为一个痴迷的、心不在焉的、但基本上是善良的人物。然而，你可以选择将他表现为一个更加阴险的恶棍。夸里什可能与狮身人面像合作，安排他们的死亡，以便为他的研究收集他们的大脑，而不是保存他死去的战友的大脑，希望有一天能使他们复活。窘迫之躯修道院中的任何一个罐子里的大脑都可以详细说明这些事件。",
	"Likewise, instead of flooding Daoine Gloine with ooze in order to save himself from the city's evil cultists, Kwalish might simply have wished to drive away the population and seal off the city for his own use. Descendants of Daoine Gloine's original inhabitants met on the way to the city (see {@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}) can detail these events, as can any revived statues, or even the medusa if the characters use {@spell speak with dead} after ending her threat for good.": "同样地，夸里什并不是为了从城市的邪恶邪教徒手中救出自己而用渗水淹没道恩-格洛因，他可能只是想赶走人口，并将城市封闭起来供自己使用。Daoine Gloine原居民的后代在去往城市的路上遇到的（见{@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}）可以详述这些事件，任何复活的雕像也是如此，甚至如果角色在永远结束美杜莎的威胁后使用{@spell speak with dead}，美杜莎也可以。",
	"If used as a villain, Kwalish should be presented as a final opponent to overcome in his laboratory. Any knowledge required to complete the party's quest can then be found within his journals and personal notes.": "如果作为一个反派，夸里什应该在他的实验室里作为一个最后的对手来克服。完成党的任务所需的任何知识都可以在他的日记和个人笔记中找到。",
	"This section includes new monsters and nonplayer characters introduced in {@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}, as well as stat blocks from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}, and {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF} that are referenced in the adventure.": "这一部分包括在{@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}中介绍的新怪物和非玩家角色，以及冒险中引用的{@book Monster Manual|MM}、{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}和{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}中的状态块。",
	"The unique magical-mechanical crafting techniques seen in the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine are the basis of a number of unique magic items found in the adventure. Because of their power and rarity, the items in this section (or at least those that aren't cursed) are best suited for characters in a high-magic campaign. Alternatively, treat each item as the equivalent of two or more magic items appropriate for characters of 5th to 10th level.": "在窘迫之躯修道院和失落之城Daoine Gloine看到的独特的魔法-机械制作技术是冒险中发现的许多独特魔法物品的基础。由于它们的威力和稀有性，本节中的物品（或者至少是那些没有被诅咒的物品）最适合于高魔法活动中的角色。或者，将每件物品视为相当于两个或更多适合5-10级角色的魔法物品。",
	"You can also treat this section as potential treasure for future play at higher levels. Some of these items might be experiments that Kwalish is working on, which can be made available to the characters if they return to the Barrier Peaks. Alternatively, if you'd like to make full use of these items during the adventure but don't want to make them part of your long-term campaign, some of them might function only in the monastery or Daoine Gloine, while others might be charge-dependent. When an item's charges run dry, its magic drains away—or the item might malfunction or explode, with effects determined by you.": "你也可以把这部分当作潜在的宝藏，以便将来在更高层次上进行游戏。其中一些物品可能是夸里什正在进行的实验，如果角色们回到屏障山峰，可以让他们获得这些物品。另外，如果你想在冒险过程中充分利用这些物品，但又不想让它们成为长期活动的一部分，那么其中一些物品可能只在修道院或Daoine Gloine中发挥作用，而其他物品可能取决于电荷。当一个物品的电荷耗尽时，它的魔力就会耗尽，或者这个物品可能会发生故障或爆炸，其效果由你决定。",
	"The \"{@book Alien Technology|DMG|9|Alien Technology}\" section in chapter 9 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} offers useful general guidelines for dealing with strange devices of the sort found in this adventure. If Kwalish's notes can't be deciphered (or if the inventor doesn't show up when the characters need him), you might ask for successful Intelligence checks on the Figuring Out Alien Technology table from anyone trying to operate magical technology. It might take one success to operate a trinket, two successes to operate a force pike or a teleportation-field device, and four successes to operate Kwalish's {@i powered armor}.": "{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第九章的\"{@book Alien Technology|DMG|9|Alien Technology} \"部分为处理这次冒险中发现的那种奇怪的设备提供了有用的一般准则。如果Kwalish的笔记不能被破译（或者当角色需要他的时候，发明家没有出现），你可以要求任何试图操作魔法技术的人在 \"弄清外星人技术 \"表上进行成功的智力检查。操作一个饰品可能需要一次成功，操作一个力矛或一个传送场装置需要两次成功，而操作Kwalish的（%2%）需要四次成功。",

The Tharguard have returned, but no one knows why.": "屏障之峰的塔尔古德矮人是强大的铁匠。他们在自己的锻造厂里使用魔法，制造出这片土地上最好的武器--直到他们在几个世纪前消失了。但最近，在山峰的偏远峡谷中再次听到了锤子敲打铁砧的喧闹声。塔尔护卫队已经回来了，但没有人知道原因。",
