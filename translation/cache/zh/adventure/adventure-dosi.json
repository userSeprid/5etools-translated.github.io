In the Realms, fighters dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate.

	"According to legend, two families of dragons came into being in the very first days of the world's creation. Bahamut, the noble Platinum Dragon, made the metallic dragons—gold, silver, bronze, brass, and copper. Cruel, five-headed Tiamat made the chromatic dragons—red, blue, green, black and white. The metallic and chromatic dragons share a mutual animosity that originates in the enmity between Bahamut and Tiamat (Bahamut is often called the King of Metallic Dragons in the world of the Forgotten Realms, and Tiamat the Queen of Chromatic Dragons. In other worlds they have different names, and like all gods, they are beyond gender.)": "根据传说，在世界诞生的最初几天，有两个龙家族诞生了。巴哈姆特，高贵的白金龙，制造了金属龙--金、银、铜、黄铜和铜。残忍的五头龙提亚马特制造了彩色的龙--红色、蓝色、绿色、黑色和白色。金属龙和彩色龙有一种共同的敌意，这种敌意源于巴哈姆特和提亚马特之间的仇恨（巴哈姆特在《被遗忘的世界》中通常被称为金属龙之王，而提亚马特是彩色龙的女王。在其他世界中，他们有不同的名字，而且像所有的神一样，他们是超越性别的。）",
	"The origin of Dragon's Rest is rooted in that animosity. Ages ago, a fire-breathing red dragon called Sharruth rampaged up and down the Sword Coast. Three metallic dragons joined forces to battle Sharruth and imprisoned her beneath the ocean floor, believing seawater would quench her fire and keep her bound forever. But Sharruth's fury, legend says, caused the undersea volcanic activity that formed Stormwreck Isle.": "龙之息的起源就源于这种敌意。几百年前，一条名叫沙鲁斯的喷火红龙在剑海岸上下肆虐。三条金属龙联合起来与沙鲁斯战斗，并将她囚禁在海底，相信海水可以熄灭她的火，让她永远被束缚。但传说中，沙鲁斯的怒火引起了海底火山活动，形成了风暴残骸岛。",
	"In all likelihood, Sharruth is long dead and entombed beneath the island, but chromatic dragons whisper that she still lives and will one day emerge from her prison. One fact is undeniable: the powerful magic embodied in such an ancient dragon has left a permanent mark on Stormwreck Isle. That magic has drawn other dragons to the island throughout the centuries, making it a recurring battlefield in the conflict between chromatic and metallic dragons. Several of these dragons have died there, each leaving behind a spiritual scar that causes unpredictable magical effects.": "在所有的可能性中，沙鲁斯早就死了，被埋在岛的下面，但半透明的龙低声说，她仍然活着，并且有一天会从她的监狱里出来。有一个事实是不可否认的：这样一条古老的龙所体现的强大魔法在风暴残骸岛上留下了永久的印记。几个世纪以来，这种魔法将其他龙吸引到岛上，使它成为色龙和金属龙之间冲突的一个反复的战场。其中有几条龙死在了那里，每条龙都留下了精神上的伤痕，造成了不可预知的魔法效果。",
	"A hundred years ago, a blue dragon tried to harness this destructive magic. A bronze dragon named {@creature Runara|DoSI} pleaded with him to abandon his schemes. When he refused, Runara killed him, adding one more dragon grave to the island.": "一百年前，一条蓝龙试图驾驭这种破坏性的魔法。一条名叫（%0%）的青铜龙恳求他放弃他的计划。当他拒绝时，鲁纳拉杀了他，为这个岛增加了一个龙的坟墓。",
	"Runara has grown weary of strife, and Stormwreck Isle's wounds are a constant reminder to her of the cost of such conflict. Devoting herself to peace and reconciliation, she established the cloister of Dragon's Rest as a safe haven from violence. Living in human guise, Runara now serves as the leader of a tiny group of hermits and ascetics.": "鲁纳拉已经厌倦了纷争，风暴残骸岛的伤痕不断提醒她这种冲突的代价。她致力于和平与和解，建立了 \"龙息 \"修道院，作为一个远离暴力的安全港。茹娜拉现在以人类的身份生活，担任一小批隐士和苦行者的领袖。",

	"You can give players a sense of how well they're doing against a creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded. Such information gives the players a sense of progress and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't damaging the creature much, let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That might encourage the players to change their plan.": "你可以通过用叙述的方式描述生物的伤害程度，让玩家了解他们在对抗生物时的表现。例如，如果该生物的剩余命中率不到一半，你就可以把它描述成受了重伤。这样的信息给了玩家一种进展的感觉，可能会刺激他们加强攻击。另一方面，如果角色对生物的伤害不大，让玩家知道这个生物看起来可以承受更多的惩罚。这可能会鼓励玩家改变他们的计划。",
	"As they fight a creature, characters should learn more about the creature's abilities. Share information with the players as it becomes apparent. For example, if the wizard casts {@spell flaming sphere} (a spell that deals fire damage) against a {@creature fire snake} (a creature that's immune to fire damage), let the wizard's player know the spell doesn't seem to bother the creature at all. Players might correctly guess that a fire snake probably isn't harmed by fire; feel free to subtly confirm their guesses (perhaps smiling and saying, \"That sounds reasonable\").": "在与生物战斗的过程中，角色应该了解更多关于生物的能力。当信息变得明显时，与玩家分享。例如，如果巫师对{@creature fire snake}（对火伤害免疫的生物）施展{@spell flaming sphere}（造成火伤害的法术），让巫师的玩家知道这个法术似乎根本就没有影响到这个生物。玩家可能会正确地猜测火蛇可能不会受到火的伤害；可以巧妙地确认他们的猜测（也许可以微笑着说，\"这听起来很合理\"）。",

	"As the DM, you roleplay the creatures that the characters encounter. The adventure offers guidance to help you decide what these creatures know and how willing they are to share information with the characters. Beyond that, improvise and bring these creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes {@creature Runara|DoSI} (the disguised bronze dragon who leads the cloister of Dragon's Rest) as wise and peace-loving, but you get to decide what her voice sounds like and how she reacts to a given situation. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay Runara or any other creature as you see fit.": "作为管理人，你要扮演角色所遇到的生物。冒险提供了指导，帮助你决定这些生物知道什么，以及它们有多愿意与角色分享信息。除此之外，你要尽可能地即兴发挥，把这些生物带入生活。例如，冒险中描述（%0%）（领导龙之休息所回廊的伪装的青铜龙）是明智的、爱好和平的，但你可以决定她的声音是什么样的，以及她在特定情况下的反应。你也可以忽略文本中的内容，按照你认为合适的方式扮演鲁纳拉或任何其他生物。",
	"When characters find treasure, tell them how many coins they find and how much any gems and art objects are worth.

Of course, if you're not ready to craft an expedition into the caverns beneath the island, then the characters simply don't discover those subterranean passages no matter how much they search.": "这样的冒险是由你来设计的，你可以对人物在那里的行为和发现做出你独特的解释。当然，如果你没有准备好对岛屿下面的洞穴进行探险，那么无论人物如何寻找，都不会发现那些地下通道。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters come here before going to the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and they are still 1st level. It also includes simple instructions to scale up the danger in combat encounters if the characters complete chapter 3, \"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3},\" before coming here, and are now 2nd level.": "本章假设人物在去{@i Compass Rose}的沉船前来到这里，而且他们仍然是第一级。它还包括简单的说明，如果人物在来这里之前完成了第三章\"{@adventure Cursed Shipwreck|DoSI|3}\"，并且现在是第二级，那么在战斗中遇到的危险就会加大。",
	"The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with Tarak from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected Tarak's visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.": "风暴残骸岛西南侧的海洞里居住着一个不寻常的菌类群体--通常生活在地下深处的真菌。虽然他们不能忍受阳光，但这些菌类曾经时不时地欢迎访客。特别是，他们与来自龙之息的塔拉克进行交易，给他生长在他们洞穴中的稀有真菌，以换取食物残渣和其他来自回廊的废物，这些废物滋养了洞穴中的真菌。但最近，菌类拒绝了塔拉克的访问，并在他们洞穴的入口处放置了一个可怕的守护者，让所有的访客都无法进入。",
	"The reason for this sudden shift in the myconids' behavior is that a blight has spread through the caves and is poisoning the myconids, twisting their gardens, and even laying low their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}. The source of the blight is the tomb of the red dragon Sharruth deep beneath the island. Noxious fumes from the dragon's tomb normally filter up through the rock and vent to the surface through a cavern at the back of Seagrow Caves that the myconids avoid, but the vent has become blocked, and the fumes have spilled into the myconids' caves.": "菌类行为突然转变的原因是，一种瘟疫已经在洞穴中蔓延，正在毒害菌类，扭曲它们的花园，甚至使它们的领袖（%0%）陷入低谷。瘟疫的源头是岛屿地下深处的红龙沙鲁斯的坟墓。来自龙墓的有毒气体通常会通过岩石过滤，并通过海格罗洞穴后面的一个洞穴排放到地面上，菌类会避开这个洞穴，但这个洞穴已经被堵住了，气体已经溢出到菌类的洞穴中。",
	"Besides this insidious poison, visitors to Seagrow Caves must face one additional threat: the stirges that nest in the caves. These blood-sucking monsters aren't much of a threat individually and don't bother the bloodless myconids, but they can be deadly in large numbers.": "除了这种阴险的毒药之外，海草洞的游客还必须面对一个额外的威胁：在洞穴中筑巢的海螺。这些吸血的怪物单个并没有什么威胁，也不会打扰到没有血的菌类，但它们数量多了就会致命。",
	"The caves have the following features:": "这些洞穴有以下特点。",
	"Unless noted otherwise, the ceilings in the caverns are 20 feet high, and the tunnels connecting the caverns are 15 feet high.": "除非另有说明，岩洞的天花板有20英尺高，而连接岩洞的隧道有15英尺高。",

	"The cave walls are formed from hexagonal columns of dark gray basalt—volcanic rock originating from Sharruth's undersea tomb. The walls provide hand- and footholds, so climbing the walls doesn't require an ability check.": "洞壁是由深灰色玄武岩-火山岩的六边形柱子形成的，源自沙鲁斯的海底墓穴。墙壁提供了手和脚的支撑，所以爬墙不需要检查能力。",
	"Toxic volcanic fumes from deep below the island are slowly poisoning the fungi in the caves. A faint smell of sulfur pervades the place, growing stronger the closer one gets to {@area area B6|06b|x}. If the characters take a long rest inside the caves before opening the vent in B6, each character must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become {@condition poisoned} (see \"{@book Conditions|PHB|12}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}). The {@spell lesser restoration} spell ends this effect, as does finishing a long rest in fresh air.": "来自岛下深处的有毒火山烟气正在慢慢毒害洞穴中的真菌。这里弥漫着一股淡淡的硫磺味，越接近（%0%）就越强烈。如果角色在打开B6的通风口之前在洞穴里休息了很久，每个角色必须在DC13宪法救赎中成功，否则就会变成（%%1%）（见（%%2%）中的\"（%%3%）\"）。{@spell lesser restoration}咒语会结束这个效果，在新鲜空气中完成长时间休息也是如此。",

	"Walking around the coast of the island is a little easier than rowing, even though it's farther because the characters have to walk around the bays instead of rowing across them. The 7-mile trip takes only 2 hours and 20 minutes at a normal walking pace. The characters can choose whether they want to walk on the cliffs high above the sea or pick their way among the tide pools at the base of the cliffs. The lower route is available only at low tide (see the {@adventure Tides table|DoSI|2|Entering the Caves}).": "在岛上的海岸线上行走比划船要容易一些，尽管路程较远，因为人物要绕着海湾行走，而不是划船穿过海湾。以正常的步行速度，7英里的行程只需要2小时20分钟。角色们可以选择是在高高在上的悬崖上行走，还是在悬崖底部的潮汐池中选路。较低的路线只有在退潮时才能使用（见（%0%））。",

	"At high tide, the 40-foot-high tunnel ({@area area B1|058|x}) is flooded all the way to {@area area B2|05b|x}. The natural stairways, which are not shown on the {@area map of Seagrow Caves|057|x}, descend the cliffs into the sea. The characters can either wait for low tide or row or swim into the tunnel. At low tide, a 5-foot-wide pathway is exposed along the base of the cliffs and the edge of the tunnel.": "涨潮时，40英尺高的隧道（（%0%））一直淹没到（%1%）。{@area map of Seagrow Caves|057|x}上没有显示的天然楼梯，从悬崖上下到海里。人物可以等待退潮或划船或游泳进入隧道。退潮时，沿着悬崖的底部和隧道的边缘会露出一条5英尺宽的通道。",

	"To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check.

	"A myconid's Rapport Spores ability allows all intelligent creatures in the area to communicate telepathically with each other. The characters and the myconids are effectively speaking thoughts at each other. This effect doesn't allow any creature to probe invasively into another creature's mind. But it transcends language barriers, and you can play around with the kind of communication that the spores allow. Myconids' facial expressions might be difficult to read, but their telepathic communication might carry a direct expression of the myconids' emotional state. For example, when the myconids talk about their ailing leader, the characters might feel a deep sadness and a sense of anxiety much more clearly and powerfully than mere words and facial expressions can communicate.": "菌类的和睦孢子能力允许该地区的所有智能生物彼此进行心灵感应。角色和菌类实际上是在互相说想法。这个效果并不允许任何生物侵入另一个生物的心灵。但它超越了语言障碍，而且你可以玩弄孢子所允许的那种交流方式。霉菌的面部表情可能很难读懂，但它们的心灵感应可能带有霉菌的情绪状态的直接表达。例如，当菌类谈论他们生病的领袖时，人物可能会感受到一种深深的悲伤和焦虑感，这比单纯的语言和面部表情所能传达的要清楚和有力得多。",
	"The effect of Rapport Spores lasts for 1 hour, so characters might be telepathically linked to each other whenever they're within 30 feet of each other even after they leave the cave.

	"You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting.

The Plane of Fire is the origin of both the orange crystal blocking the vent (which is actually an egg case) and the creatures currently in the cave.": "问题的核心是红龙沙鲁特的坟墓，在岛屿的深处。如此强大的龙在地下深处的存在导致了火山活动，产生了有毒的烟雾。更重要的是，龙的能量偶尔会撕开现实结构中的小裂缝，通往火元素位面--现实的另一个维度，是炽热能量的宇宙来源。火之界是堵住通风口的橙色水晶（实际上是一个蛋壳）和目前洞穴中的生物的起源。",
	"Destroying the orange crystal blocking the western fissure allows the noxious fumes to escape the cave and stops the blight that is harming the myconids. A single strong whack with a weapon, a crowbar, or another tool is sufficient to shatter it. When the crystal breaks, a two-foot-diameter sphere of smoldering obsidian falls to the floor amid the other pieces and breaks open, releasing a {@creature fire snake} from this stony egg. Seeing the characters only as fuel, it attacks them at once.": "毁掉堵在西边裂缝的橙色水晶，可以让毒气从洞中流出，并阻止危害菌类的枯萎病。用武器、撬棍或其他工具大力捶打一下，就足以将其击碎。当水晶破碎时，一个直径两英尺的烟熏黑曜石球体在其他碎片中落到地上，并破开，从这个石蛋中释放出一个（%0%）。它只把人物看成是燃料，马上就攻击他们。",
	"Breaking the fire crystal also reveals the reason the myconids avoid this cave: the cave is immediately filled with shimmering sunlight refracted through the crystals that line the vent. Bright light fills the entire area.": "打破火晶也揭示了菌类避开这个洞穴的原因：洞穴里立即充满了通过排在通风口的水晶折射出来的闪亮的阳光。明亮的光线充满了整个区域。",

	"If the characters destroy the orange crystal so the toxic fumes can escape the caves, the myconids' attitude improves to friendly.

	"About forty years ago, a ship named {@i Compass Rose} carrying passengers bound for the cloister wrecked on the shoal, killing all aboard. To the horror of the cloister's residents, those who drowned found their way ashore as shambling zombies.

	"The harpy is only the most immediate problem lurking in the wrecked hull of {@i Compass Rose}. The greater threat is a cursed talisman held in the ship's hold, imbued with magic by a long-dead sailor's desperate prayers to a demon lord. This curse is responsible for the drowned sailors animating as {@creature Zombie||zombies}. Most of the sailors who were aboard the ship when it wrecked are long gone, but some zombies have been trapped in the wreck for years.": "鹞子只是潜伏在{@i Compass Rose}残骸中的最直接问题。更大的威胁是船舱里的一个被诅咒的护身符，它被一个死去多年的水手向一个恶魔领主的绝望祈祷所灌输了魔法。这个诅咒是导致淹死的水手活过来的原因（1%）。当船失事时，船上的大多数水手早已不在了，但有些僵尸已经被困在沉船中多年了。",
	"This chapter assumes the characters heed Runara's advice and search {@i Compass Rose} for clues to the recent shipwrecks. If the characters decide to explore other recent wrecks, you can use the map of {@i Compass Rose} to represent any other sunken ship's deck plan, though most of the wrecks are entirely underwater. Characters exploring other wrecks might find more zombies—sailors killed in the wrecks who were animated by the talisman in {@i Compass Rose's} hold but couldn't get off their ships for some reason. They might also find giant octopuses (you can use the {@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI} stat block), {@creature Ghoul||ghouls}, or other dangers aboard.

Many sailors perished with the initial impact, and Aleitha was gravely injured. As I tended her wounds, she clutched her talisman and breathed soft prayers. I asked her what the talisman signified. She told me love. Her husband waits for her at Dragon's Rest, having pledged his service to the dragon there. The talisman is made from locks of their hair, woven together as a promise to be reunited no matter what fate might befall them. It might have been a beautiful story, had it not been for Aleitha's gruesome end—and the words of the prayer I heard as she breathed her last. For she was begging Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, to reunite her with her husband.": "我们的旅程结束了，虽然我担心我自己的旅程会以最可怕的方式继续下去。{@i Compass Rose}在永温特南部的一个浅滩上失事了。许多水手在最初的撞击中丧生，阿莱塔也受了重伤。当我为她处理伤口时，她紧握着她的护身符，轻轻地祈祷着。我问她，这个护身符代表什么。她告诉我是爱。她的丈夫在龙息地等着她，他已经向那里的龙保证了他的服务。护身符是由他们的发绺制成的，交织在一起作为承诺，无论他们的命运如何，都会团聚。这可能是一个美丽的故事，如果不是因为阿莱塔的可怕结局--以及我在她咽气时听到的祈祷词。因为她在乞求不死王子奥库斯，让她和她的丈夫重聚。",
	"I held her hands as the breath left her, and I felt a horrible chill pass through her. Next I knew, she was sinking her teeth into my neck.

They have sworn loyalty to Sparkrender, and they share the dragon's cruel, haughty demeanor.": "一旦打败了搅拌器，如果哥布林人幸存下来，他们就会接近这些人物。他们的名字叫梅克和米恩，是龙之驿站的哥布林工匠迈拉的兄弟。在搅扰者的攻击使她的翅膀致残后，他们离开了他们的妹妹，任其死亡。他们发誓效忠于斯派克雷德，他们与龙一样有着残酷、傲慢的举止。",
	"If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that Myla is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly.

They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon.": "如果角色积极帮助哥布林或提到迈拉还活着，哥布林的态度就会变得友好。他们会将角色介绍给他们的首领，并以任何方式帮助角色（比如从{@adventure area {@dice D1}|DoSI|4|D1.Overlook}中取回月光石钥匙，这样角色就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4.Overlook}的桥梁。俯瞰}，这样人物就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: 孤立书房}的桥梁。） 不过他们不会帮助角色与斯帕克雷德战斗，他们对龙很忠诚。",
	"The sculpture in the center of the rotunda is an astronomical model used for research in centuries past.

He is eager to escape, but if the characters ask, he explains his conflict with Sparkrender. He expresses regret over his inability to defeat the blue wyrmling and concern for the safety of the island's other inhabitants. And he is terrified of the fate Sparkrender has in store for him—the blue dragon plans to use Aidron's death to claim the power of all the dead dragons on the island, transforming himself into a mighty draconic avatar.": "当人物进入时，艾德隆（%0%）兴奋地迎接他们。他花了好几天时间试图从塌陷的墙壁中挖出一条路来，但他从里面的努力只会造成进一步的坍塌。他急于逃跑，但如果人物问起，他就解释他与斯帕克雷德的冲突。他对自己没有能力打败蓝精灵表示遗憾，并对岛上其他居民的安全表示担忧。他对斯帕克雷德为他准备的命运感到恐惧--蓝龙计划利用艾德隆的死亡来获取岛上所有死龙的力量，把自己变成一个强大的龙人化身。",
	"If the characters have not yet defeated Sparkrender, Aidron decides to face the blue dragon himself. He flies to the top of the observatory tower ({@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower}) to confront Sparkrender once more. However, Aidron is too weak to defeat Sparkrender alone; he needs the characters' help.": "如果角色们还没有打败斯帕克雷德，艾德隆决定亲自面对这条蓝龙。他飞到瞭望塔的顶端（{@adventure area {@dice D5}|DoSI|4|D5: Observatory Tower}），再次与Sparkrender对峙。然而，艾德隆太弱了，他无法独自击败斯帕克雷德；他需要角色们的帮助。",

	"If the characters leave the observatory without defeating {@creature Blue Dragon Wyrmling||Sparkrender}, they might return to find the blue wyrmling's ritual underway.

A blue dragon is perched atop the sculpture, throwing his head back in pain or ecstasy as the lights surround him, and he unleashes a bolt of lightning up toward the sky. At the base of the statue, a bronze dragon is bound to the ground by three heavy chains. He looks like he's in agony.": "彩色的光流在废墟圆形大厅的金色雕像周围的空气中旋转。每一个闪亮的显示似乎来自于你之前看到的五座龙像中的一座，灯光的颜色与龙像的颜色一致：红色、金色、黄铜色、蓝色和青铜色。一条蓝龙栖息在雕塑的顶端，当灯光围绕着他时，他痛苦或狂喜地甩着头，并向天空释放出一道闪电。在雕像的底部，一条青铜龙被三条沉重的锁链绑在地上。他看起来很痛苦的样子。",

	"At the end of each round of combat (on initiative count 0, after everyone else has acted), a random magical effect occurs, caused by the magical lights that swirl around the rotunda.

The sculpture is large and sturdy, though, so a single action has no noticeable effect on the sculpture or the magic.

The first time a character uses an action to attack or otherwise try to disturb the sculpture, the distracted blue dragon has {@book disadvantage|PHB|7|Advantage and Disadvantage} on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of his next turn.

	"Elder {@creature Runara|DoSI} smiles as you approach. \"I have something to show you,\" she says. There's a flash like a silent stroke of lightning, and the human woman is gone. In her place is an enormous dragon with bronze-colored scales. \"Now you see me as I truly am,\" she says, tilting her head with an expression that might be a smile on her scaled face.": "长老（%0%）微笑着看着你走过来。\"我有东西要给你看，\"她说。一道闪光就像无声的闪电，那个人类女人不见了。取而代之的是一条有着青铜色鳞片的巨大龙。\"现在你看到了我的真面目，\"她说，歪着头，在她那有鳞片的脸上露出一个可能是微笑的表情。",
	"{@creature Runara|DoSI} outlines the history summarized in the \"{@area Adventure Background|005|x}\" section and explains that each site the characters visited is linked to the death of a dragon. Then she tells them that a bronze wyrmling named Aidron came to the island a few months ago and studied with her at Dragon's Rest. Five days before the characters' arrival, he argued with her, angrily rejected her teaching of peace, and stormed away from the cloister. She fears he went to the ancient observatory on the southeast side of the island, which is another dragon's final resting place. She suspects some evil has arisen there, but says she dares not go there herself, lest her presence reopen old wounds. She gives them a moonstone key—a 3-inch-long, 1-inch-wide hexagonal prism made from moonstone, with a dragon's head engraved on one end—and explains that they'll need it to access the observatory.": "{@creature Runara|DoSI}概述了\"{@area Adventure Background|005|x} \"部分所总结的历史，并解释说，人物所访问的每个地点都与一条龙的死亡有关。然后她告诉他们，几个月前，一个叫艾德隆的青铜巫妖来到岛上，在龙之谷跟她学习。在这些人物到达的五天前，他与她争吵，愤怒地拒绝了她的和平教导，并从回廊里冲了出去。她担心他去了岛的东南面的古老的天文台，那是另一条龙的最后安息之地。她怀疑那里出现了一些邪恶，但她说她自己不敢去那里，以免她的存在重新打开旧的伤口。她给了他们一把月光石钥匙--3英寸长、1英寸宽的月光石制成的六边形棱镜，一端刻着一个龙头，并解释说他们需要它来进入天文台。",
	"If any encounter on the island ends with all the characters {@condition unconscious}, you can have the characters awaken in the temple ({@area area A5|02c|x}), with some of the kobolds tending to their wounds. {@creature Runara|DoSI} prefers not to explain how she rescued the characters.": "如果在岛上的任何遭遇都以所有角色（%0%）结束，你可以让角色在神庙（{@area area A5|02c|x}）中醒来，由一些哥布林照顾他们的伤势。{@creature Runara|DoSI}不愿意解释她是如何救出这些人物的。",
	"Four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} and one {@creature winged kobold} (all lawful evil) participate in this ambush. These cruel, vicious kobolds reject both the peaceful teaching of {@creature Runara|DoSI} and the tyrannical rule of Sparkrender, and they prey on travelers who stray away from Dragon's Rest. They haven't had much success and are desperate, so they're hostile and fight to the death.": "四个（%0%）和一个（%1%）（都是合法的邪恶）参与了这次伏击。这些残忍、恶毒的哥布林既反对（%%2%）的和平教义，也反对斯帕克雷德的暴政，他们捕杀那些偏离龙息地的旅行者。他们没有什么成就，而且走投无路，所以他们充满敌意，以死相拼。",
	"The sea caves on the southwest side of Stormwreck Isle are inhabited by an unusual colony of myconids—fungus people who normally live deep underground. Though they can't abide sunlight, these myconids used to welcome visitors now and then. In particular, they traded with {@creature Tarak|DoSI} from Dragon's Rest, giving him rare fungi that grow in their caves in exchange for food scraps and other waste from the cloister, which nourished the fungi in the caves. Recently, though, the myconids have rejected {@creature Tarak|DoSI}'s visits and placed a monstrous guardian at the entrance to their caves that keeps all visitors away.": "风暴残骸岛西南侧的海洞里居住着一个不寻常的菌类群体--通常生活在地下深处的真菌。虽然他们不能忍受阳光，但这些菌类曾经时不时地欢迎访客。特别是，他们与来自龙之息的（%0%）进行交易，给他生长在他们洞穴里的稀有真菌，以换取食物残渣和其他来自回廊的废物，这些废物滋养了洞穴里的真菌。但最近，菌类拒绝了（1%）的访问，并在洞穴的入口处安置了一个可怕的守护者，使所有的访客都无法进入。",
	"The interior caves are illuminated by bioluminescent fungi, which provide dim light throughout the area. See \"{@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||Vision}\" in the {@book Basic Rules|PHB}.": "洞穴内部由生物发光的真菌照亮，为整个区域提供昏暗的光线。见\"{@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||Vision} \"中的{@book Basic Rules|PHB}。",
	"Dragon's Rest has a {@item rowboat} the characters can take around the western end of the island. (This is {@creature Tarak|DoSI}'s preferred method.)

	"To convince a hostile myconid to converse or to allow the characters to do anything other than leave the caves, a character must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma check. Depending on the character's approach, the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, or {@skill Persuasion} skill can apply to the check. Mentioning {@creature Tarak|DoSI}'s name or presenting the offering he sent the myconids grants advantage on this check.": "为了说服敌方菌类交谈，或允许角色做任何事，而不是离开洞穴，角色必须在DC20魅力检查中取得成功。根据角色的方法，{@skill Deception}、{@skill Intimidation}或{@skill Persuasion}的技能可以适用于该检查。提及{@creature Tarak|DoSI}的名字或出示他送给菌类的祭品，可在此检定中获得优势。",
	"An indifferent myconid is willing to explain what is going on in Seagrow Caves. The sprouts know only that their leader, {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}, has fallen ill—and that a nasty smell pervades their caves. Adult myconids know that the \"crystal cave\" ({@area area B6|06b|x}) is the source of the foul odor and that {@creature Sinensa|DoSI} fell ill after going into that cave to investigate the issue. The myconids normally avoid that cave because sunlight filters into it by way of the vent at the western end of the cave, and even diffuse sunlight is unpleasant to these cave-dwelling creatures.": "一个冷漠的霉菌愿意解释在Seagrow洞穴发生了什么。芽胞们只知道他们的领袖{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}病倒了，而且他们的洞穴里弥漫着一股讨厌的气味。成年菌类知道，\"水晶洞\"（%%1%）是恶臭的来源，而（%%2%）是在进入那个洞穴调查问题后生病的。霉菌类通常会避开那个洞穴，因为阳光会通过洞穴西端的通风口进入洞穴，而即使是散射的阳光也会让这些穴居生物感到不舒服。",

	"Because the violet fungi move so slowly, it's easy for the characters to stay out of their reach and kill the fungus monsters with ranged attacks. The interesting part of this encounter is identifying the danger. One {@creature violet fungus|DoSI} moves and attacks to start the encounter, but the other two remain motionless until characters move close to them.": "由于紫罗兰真菌的移动速度很慢，角色们很容易在它们的范围之外，用远程攻击杀死真菌怪物。这个遭遇战的有趣之处在于识别危险。一只（%0%）移动并攻击，开始遭遇战，但另外两只保持不动，直到角色靠近它们。",
	"You don't need to keep track of exactly where everyone is standing in the room. Instead, rely on your sense of what's fun and exciting.

	"The fungus farm contains heart cap mushrooms ready for harvest. A character who spends 15 minutes searching this chamber for useful fungi and succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check finds {@dice 1d6} of these reddish mushrooms, which bear an unsettling resemblance to human hearts. {@creature Tarak|DoSI} can make each heart cap mushroom into a {@item potion of healing}.": "真菌农场里有准备收获的心形帽蘑菇。花15分钟在这个房间里寻找有用的真菌，并在DC12智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查中获得成功的角色可以找到{@dice 1d6}这种红色的蘑菇，它们与人类的心脏有着令人不安的相似之处。{@creature Tarak|DoSI}可以使每个心帽菇变成一个{@item potion of healing}。",

The adults collect spores from a barrel-sized, glowing red fungus that vaguely resembles a human brain and puff the spores around the leader's head. The treatment is keeping the leader alive for now, but it is a losing battle. {@creature Sinensa|DoSI}'s only hope is for the blight to end. The adults zealously defend their leader, immediately attacking intruders who aren't accompanied by other myconids.": "两个名叫奥兰塔和伊诺克的{@creature Myconid Adult||myconid adults}正在照看领导这个菌群的{@condition unconscious}菌类，{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}。成年人从一个木桶大小、发光的红色真菌中收集孢子，这个真菌依稀像人的大脑，并将孢子扑在领袖的头上。这种治疗方法目前还能让领袖活着，但这是一场失败的战斗。{@creature Sinensa|DoSI}的唯一希望是让瘟疫结束。成年人热心地保护他们的领袖，立即攻击没有其他菌类陪伴的入侵者。",

	"This chapter assumes the characters heed {@creature Runara|DoSI}'s advice and search {@i Compass Rose} for clues to the recent shipwrecks. If the characters decide to explore other recent wrecks, you can use the map of {@i Compass Rose} to represent any other sunken ship's deck plan, though most of the wrecks are entirely underwater. Characters exploring other wrecks might find more zombies—sailors killed in the wrecks who were animated by the talisman in {@i Compass Rose's} hold but couldn't get off their ships for some reason. They might also find giant octopuses (you can use the {@creature spore servant octopus|DoSI} stat block), {@creature Ghoul||ghouls}, or other dangers aboard.

	"During the day, the sun fills the upper deck and main deck with bright light and the lower deck with {@quickref Vision and Light|PHB|2||dim light}.

	"This chapter assumes the characters visit the observatory after exploring Seagrow Caves and the wreck of {@i Compass Rose}, and thus have reached 3rd level. If they come here before visiting the other adventure sites, the combat encounters are probably too difficult for them. That's the reason {@creature Runara|DoSI} won't give the characters the moonstone key or information about the observatory until after they've dealt with the island's other problems. If necessary, you can have {@creature Runara|DoSI} warn the characters that they're not ready to face this part of the adventure yet.": "本章假设人物在探索了海草洞和{@i Compass Rose}的残骸后访问了天文台，因此已经达到了第三级。如果他们在参观其他冒险地点之前来到这里，那么战斗遭遇对他们来说可能太难了。这就是{@creature Runara|DoSI}在他们处理完岛上的其他问题后才会给人物月光石钥匙或关于天文台的信息的原因。如果有必要，你可以让{@creature Runara|DoSI}警告角色，他们还没有准备好面对冒险的这一部分。",
	"During its heyday, the Clifftop Observatory was a marvel of magical innovation. Adorned with gorgeous stained glass windows and marble spires, the observatory's towers stood high above the churning sea on separate islets, linked by shimmering bridges of magical energy. But the observatory was wrecked when {@creature Runara|DoSI} battled her blue dragon rival centuries ago, and now it lies in ruin, a crumbled memory overtaken by nature.": "在其全盛时期，悬崖顶天文台是一个神奇的创新奇迹。在华丽的彩色玻璃窗和大理石尖顶的装饰下，天文台的塔楼高高地矗立在汹涌的海面上，由闪闪发光的魔法能量桥连接。但在几个世纪前，天文台在与她的蓝龙对手的战斗中被毁坏了，现在它躺在废墟中，成为被自然界淹没的破碎的记忆。",
	"In recent months, the observatory ruins have become the home of an arrogant {@creature blue dragon wyrmling} called Sparkrender, a descendant of {@creature Runara|DoSI}'s ancient rival. Like his ancestor, Sparkrender seeks to claim the destructive magic that lingers at the site. Like {@creature Runara|DoSI}, Sparkrender has recruited kobolds to join his cause.": "最近几个月，天文台的废墟成了一个傲慢的{@creature blue dragon wyrmling}叫Sparkrender的人的家，他是{@creature Runara|DoSI}古代对手的后代。就像他的祖先一样，Sparkrender试图获得萦绕在这个地方的破坏性魔法。和{@creature Runara|DoSI}一样，Sparkrender也招募了哥布林来加入他的事业。",
	"About five days before the characters arrived on the island, a {@creature bronze dragon wyrmling} named Aidron left the safety of Dragon's Rest and {@creature Runara|DoSI}'s tutelage and came to the ancient observatory. The two wyrmlings met and immediately clashed. Sparkrender attempted to turn the bronze wyrmling against {@creature Runara|DoSI}, but Aidron's hatred of chromatic dragons was stronger than his disagreement with {@creature Runara|DoSI}. Ultimately, Sparkrender overpowered Aidron and imprisoned him in the observatory ruins.": "在这些人物到达岛上的大约五天前，一个名叫艾德隆的（%0%）离开了安全的龙息和（%1%）的监护，来到了古老的天文台。两只巫妖相遇，立即发生了冲突。斯帕克雷德试图让青铜狼人反对{@creature Runara|DoSI}，但艾德隆对色龙的憎恨比他对{@creature Runara|DoSI}的异议更强烈。最终，斯帕克雷德制服了艾德隆，并将他囚禁在天文台的废墟中。",

	"Once the stirges have been defeated, if the kobolds survive, they approach the characters. Their names are Mek and Minn, and they're the brothers of {@creature Myla|DoSI}, the kobold tinkerer at Dragon's Rest. They left their sister for dead after the stirge attack that maimed her wings.

	"If the characters actively helped the kobolds or mention that {@creature Myla|DoSI} is alive, the kobolds' attitude becomes friendly.

They won't help the characters fight Sparkrender, though; they are loyal to the dragon.": "如果角色积极帮助哥布林或提到{@creature Myla|DoSI}还活着，哥布林的态度就会变得友好。他们会主动将角色介绍给他们的首领，并以任何方式帮助角色（比如从{@adventure area {@dice D1}|DoSI|4|D1.Overlook}取回月光石钥匙，这样角色就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D1.Overlook}的桥梁。俯瞰}，这样人物就可以激活通往{@adventure {@dice D4}|DoSI|4|D4: 孤立的书房}的桥梁）。不过他们不会帮助角色与斯帕克雷德战斗，他们对龙很忠诚。",
	"If awakened, Sparkrender is hostile toward the characters, growling and barking threats in Draconic. Characters who speak Draconic (the paladin and the wizard) can try to convince the dragon not to attack by making a DC 12 Charisma check and applying the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, or {@skill Persuasion} skill as appropriate. A character who succeeds on the check stops Sparkrender from attacking immediately, and he instead takes the opportunity to boast about his grand ambitions. If no character successfully intervenes, or if a character mentions Aidron or {@creature Runara|DoSI}, Sparkrender snarls and attacks.": "如果被唤醒，斯帕克雷德会对角色产生敌意，用德拉科尼亚语咆哮并发出威胁。会说Draconic语的角色（圣骑士和巫师）可以尝试说服巨龙不要攻击，方法是进行DC12魅力检查，并根据情况运用（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）技能。检验成功的角色会立即阻止Sparkrender的攻击，而他则会利用这个机会夸耀他的宏伟抱负。如果没有角色成功干预，或者有角色提到艾德隆或（%3%），斯帕克雷德就会咆哮并攻击。",
	"Another possibility is that the characters drive Sparkrender away from the island without killing him, but leave Aidron imprisoned in {@adventure area {@dice D6}|DoSI|4|D6: Secret Library}.
