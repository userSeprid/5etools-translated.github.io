	"A prison escape for an unlikely group of heroes turns into a race for an ancient relic sought by the Legion of Dusk. Can you brave the unknown and capture the treasure before the enemy does?

	"Ixalan is a land of exploration and discovery. But the Legion of Dusk—a vampire society that formed from an alliance of nobles and the church—has recently arrived from overseas to expand its territories. The legion's army seeks to conquer the island, and the vampires have erected numerous forts in the south. However, their plans have been met with resistance from the inhabitants of Ixalan.": "伊萨兰是一片探索和发现的土地。但黄昏军团--一个由贵族和教会联盟形成的吸血鬼社团--最近从海外来到这里，扩大其领土。军团的军队试图征服该岛，而吸血鬼在南部建立了许多堡垒。然而，他们的计划遭到了艾克萨兰居民的抵抗。",
	"The Sun Empire rules the coast, and has managed to tame dinosaurs enough to work alongside them. Meanwhile, the River Heralds—a loose society of nomadic merfolk tribes—move throughout the interior of Ixalan, at one with nature. These two groups have long held an uneasy accord.": "太阳帝国统治着海岸，并成功地驯服了恐龙，使之能够与他们一起工作。同时，河流使者--一个由游牧的人鱼部落组成的松散社会--在整个伊萨兰的内部活动，与自然融为一体。这两个群体长期以来一直保持着一种不安的协议。",
	"At sea, forces of the piratical Brazen Coalition harry the naval forces of the Legion of Dusk, which make landfall to plunder the bounty of Ixalan as they see fit. But even so, not all vampires view the current ruling establishment as the final authority. The Order of the Five Sacraments, a vampire church sect that believes in establishing a trade relationship with the Sun Empire, hopes to undermine the plans of the would-be conquerors.": "在海上，海盗布拉森联盟的部队骚扰黄昏军团的海军部队，后者登陆后以他们认为合适的方式掠夺伊萨兰的赏金。但即便如此，并不是所有的吸血鬼都将当前的统治机构视为最终的权威。五圣会，一个相信与太阳帝国建立贸易关系的吸血鬼教会教派，希望能破坏未来的征服者的计划。",
	"The Legion of Dusk is ruled by rituals that require its members to feed only from the blood of their foes. As such, the legion fortification known as Conqueror's Foothold houses prisoners—enemies of the state and others deemed ne'er-do-wells—who are slaughtered once every full moon.": "黄昏军团被一些仪式所统治，这些仪式要求其成员只以敌人的血为食。因此，被称为 \"征服者的堡垒 \"的军团防御工事关押着囚犯--国家的敌人和其他被认为是无赖的人--他们每到满月就会被屠杀一次。",
	"At the start of the adventure, the characters find themselves imprisoned at Conqueror's Foothold and scheduled to be executed to feed their captors. Alante, a vampire cleric who administers last rites at the fort, aids them in a prison escape. She belongs to the Order of the Five Sacraments, and has been charged with opposing the aims of the Legion of Dusk.": "在冒险开始时，角色们发现自己被囚禁在征服者之麓，并计划被处决，以满足他们的俘虏。阿兰特，一个在要塞主持最后仪式的吸血鬼教士，帮助他们越狱。她属于五圣会，并被指控反对黄昏军团的目标。",
	"Conqueror's Foothold is overseen by Vona, known as the Butcher of Magan. Vona has uncovered a map of the local region that shows the location of a powerful artifact known as the Hierophant's Chalice, hidden in the south of Ixalan at the Temple of Aclazotz. The Hierophant's Chalice is rumored to be able to create an endless supply of blood, making it potentially valuable to the vampires of the Legion of Dusk. A prophet named Arguel is rumored to have brought the chalice to the temple for unknown reasons, and Vona wishes to secure it.": "征服者之麓由被称为马根屠夫的沃纳监管。沃纳发现了一张当地的地图，上面显示了一件被称为嗜血者圣杯的强大神器的位置，它隐藏在伊萨兰南部的阿克拉索茨神庙中。据传闻，贤者之杯能够创造出无穷无尽的血液供应，这使得它对黄昏军团的吸血鬼有潜在的价值。据传，一位名叫阿格尔的先知将圣杯带到了神庙，原因不明，沃纳希望能得到它。",
	"In exchange for various favors—in addition to escaping from certain death—the adventurers have agreed to help Alante find the artifact first.

	"As they seek the chalice, the characters meet a mad apostle who can lead them to it. At the lost temple that is the chalice's hiding place, the adventurers must face off against the demonic spawn of a bat-god. They are then able to wrest the chalice from the desiccated body of the prophet, who was led to the temple by the demon.": "在寻找圣杯的过程中，角色们遇到了一位疯狂的使徒，他可以带领他们找到圣杯。在作为圣杯藏身之处的失落的神庙里，冒险家们必须与蝙蝠神的恶魔卵子对抗。然后，他们能够从被恶魔带到神庙的先知的干尸中夺取圣杯。",
	"The characters are on a mission for the Order of the Five Sacraments to retrieve the Hierophant's Chalice from the Temple of Aclazotz, deep in the uncharted forests of Ixalan.

	"But what your captors don't know is that each of you has made a bargain with the cleric, Alante. In exchange for your lives and retrieval of the legendary relic known as the Hierophant's Chalice, you have been promised various favors from the Order of the Five Sacraments—a vampiric sect that opposes the Legion of Dusk's thirst for conquest. During your brief time in Conqueror's Foothold, Alante has been able to communicate a plan of escape by sending message spells at various interludes. Tonight marks the night that plan comes to fruition.": "但你们的俘虏不知道的是，你们每个人都与教士阿兰特做了交易。为了换取你们的生命和取回被称为嗜血者圣杯的传奇遗物，你们得到了五圣会的承诺--一个反对黄昏军团的征服欲的吸血鬼教派--的各种好处。在你在征服者之麓的短暂时间里，阿兰特通过在不同的时间段发送信息法术来传达一个逃跑的计划。今晚是这个计划实现的时刻。",
	"Read the following to set up the characters' escape from the forces of the Legion of Dusk:": "阅读以下内容，为人物逃离黄昏军团的势力做准备。",
	"You stand in a large holding cell awaiting the executioner's summons. Outside the cell window, a nearly full moon hangs high in the cloudless sky. In the center of the executioner's chamber, a greataxe lies across a stone block. Chains lined with butcher hooks hang above metal vats stacked and waiting to collect the blood of the executed, and reminding you of your imminent appointment with death.": "你站在一个大牢房里，等待刽子手的传唤。牢房窗外，一轮近乎满月的月亮高挂在无云的天空中。在刽子手室的中央，一把大斧横在石块上。铁链上挂着屠夫的钩子，上面堆放着金属大桶，等待着收集被处决者的血液，提醒你你即将与死亡的约会。",
	"The guards open the metal grate that seals your cell. Stepping into the chamber beyond, you see the cleric who will oversee your sacrifice. That's your cue. It's time to issue last rites. . . to the guards.": "卫兵们打开了封住你牢房的金属栅栏。踏入后面的房间，你看到了将监督你的牺牲的牧师。这是你的提示。是时候给守卫们做最后的仪式了。...给守卫。",
	"The characters have no gear, except for Alante. They are unarmored and can make only unarmed strikes, dealing bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + Strength modifier.": "除了阿兰特之外，这些人物没有装备。他们没有盔甲，只能进行徒手攻击，造成相当于1+力量修正值的破坏性伤害。",
	"The Legion of Dusk troops stationed at Conqueror's Foothold are loyal to Vona, Butcher of Magan. Two human {@creature guard|mm|guards} have escorted the cleric Alante into the cell. One guard carries a set of keys that can be used to open the prison cells, the main door, and the executioner's hatch (see below). The perimeter of the room is lined with five other cell blocks, each large enough to hold five prisoners but empty at present.": "驻扎在Conqueror's Foothold的黄昏军团军队效忠于马冈的屠夫沃纳。两个人类（%0%）已经护送阿兰特教士进入牢房。一名守卫带着一串钥匙，可以用来打开牢房、主门和刽子手的舱门（见下文）。房间的周边有另外五个牢房，每个牢房都大得足以容纳五个囚犯，但目前是空的。",
	"Only one door leads out of the executioner's chamber. Alante, Turk, and Ellie know that no prisoner has ever successfully escaped from Conqueror's Foothold, and that to go through that door means a vicious fight against dozens of guards, and no guarantee of finding an exit": "只有一扇门通向刽子手室的外面。阿兰特、特克和艾莉知道，从来没有囚犯成功地从 \"征服者之家 \"逃出，而穿过那扇门意味着要与几十个守卫恶斗，而且不能保证找到出口。",
	"In one corner of the chamber, a padlocked lever stands next to a three-foot-square metal grate. If the lever is unlocked (either with the key carried by the guard or a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb}), it can be pulled to drop the grate open. This reveals the executioner's hatch—a chute down which bodies are dumped into the ocean after they are drained of life by the vampires in the fort.": "在密室的一角，一个挂着锁的杠杆站在一个三英尺见方的金属栅栏旁边。如果这个杠杆被解开了（无论是用守卫携带的钥匙还是用DC20灵巧检查成功（%0%）），就可以拉动它来打开铁栅栏。这时，刽子手的舱门就会出现--尸体被堡垒里的吸血鬼吸干生命后，就会被扔进海里。",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notes that the slick walls of the chute offer no handholds. This makes it a straight drop into the ocean, and prevents anyone from getting back up this way. Characters who jump through the hatch take no damage when they hit the water, and can then easily swim to shore.": "成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查的角色注意到滑道光滑的墙壁没有提供任何抓手。这使得它直接落入海中，并阻止任何人通过这种方式爬起来。跳过舱门的人在落水时不会受到任何伤害，然后可以轻松地游到岸上。",

	"Artinoq's raptor companion, Sharkbait, waits on the beach with a rucksack containing ten days' {@item rations (1 day)|phb|rations}.

A bell-toll alarm sounds out within the fort, and a patrol of twelve {@creature guard|mm|guards} is sent out to comb the area for the prisoners and the duplicitous Alante. Additionally, beacon towers between Conqueror's Foothold, Fort Leor, and Fort Durron light up, making it difficult for characters who are not with the Legion of Dusk to move along the beach unseen. Any Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made by the characters to avoid guards are made with disadvantage.": "在人物与守卫交战一小时后，另一支巡逻队进入了刽子手的房间，并发现了这次逃跑。堡垒内响起了钟声警报，一支由12人组成的巡逻队（%0%）被派出去梳理该地区的囚犯和阴险的阿兰特。此外，征服者之麓、利奥堡和杜伦堡之间的信标塔亮了起来，使得不属于黄昏军团的人物很难在海滩上不被发现地移动。角色为躲避守卫而进行的任何灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查都是以劣势进行的。",
	"Two hours after the escape, Vona discovers that Alante is attempting to claim the {@i Hierophant's Chalice} before he does.

	"If the characters continue along the shoreline, they come upon the wreckage of numerous ships. Among the dead is the orc Captain Beelzebufo from the pirate ship Relentless, on which both Ellie and Turk served. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check notes that the orc appears to have died from stab wounds rather than by drowning.": "如果人物继续沿着海岸线前进，他们会遇到许多船只的残骸。死者中有来自海盗船 \"无情 \"号的兽人船长贝尔泽布福，艾莉和特克都曾在该船服役。任何在DC10智力({@skill Investigation})检查中成功的角色都会注意到这个兽人似乎是死于刺伤，而不是淹死的。",
