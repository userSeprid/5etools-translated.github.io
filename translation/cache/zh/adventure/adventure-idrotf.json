	"North of the Spine of the World and west of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.": "世界之脊以北，高耸的雷格德冰川以西是一片寒冷的土地，很少有人敢于探索，更不用说居住了。这片被风吹动的苔原的冰雪之地最近被锁在一个永久的、没有缓和的黑暗冬天。寒霜少女奥里尔，冬天愤怒的神圣化身，已经撤回到世界的这个寒冷角落，生活在凡人之中。此外，她还对冰风谷下了一个可怕的咒语，对其大多数居民造成了伤害。",
	"Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light—a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.": "每晚午夜前，欧瑞尔骑着白鹏鸟飞上天空，编织她的咒语，表现为一道闪亮的光幕--美丽的极光，照亮夜空，在黎明前消逝。这个强大的魔法阻止了第二天的太阳从地平线上升起，将正午变成了黄昏，将冰风谷困在冬天的黑暗怀抱中，没有阳光和温暖来融化冰雪。每一次施法都会使冰封女巫变得虚弱，只剩下足够的神力用暴风雪封锁山口，用刺骨的寒风搅动移动的冰海。这些措施阻止了旅行者接近或离开冰风谷，进一步孤立了这个地区。冰风谷因此被困于与世界其他地方不同的现实中，因为尽管太阳从未在谷地上空升起，但在其他地方却继续升起。",
	"The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.": "冰风谷的人们在感受到欧瑞尔的愤怒时就知道了，他们对她施加给他们的无休止的冬天有一个名字。他们称其为 \"永恒的风铃\"。没有人理解为什么冰霜女巫以这种方式强加她的意志，也没有人理解为什么其他神灵拒绝挑战她。这个漫长的冬天已经持续了两年多，它不仅威胁着被称为 \"十镇 \"的闪烁的文明之光，也威胁着需要阳光和季节变化来生存的本地动植物。",
	"Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn—a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.": "并非所有的生物都对世界之脊以北发生的事情感到气馁。漫长的夜晚和没有阳光的白天对{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}来说是一种祝福，他渴望在地面上为自己开辟一块领地，并在此过程中奴役十镇的人民。他已经利用了奥里尔的魔法，在山脉的黑暗阴影中建立了一个堡垒。从这里，他的手下在苔原上寻找Chardalyn--一种只存在于冰风谷的晶体物质。一旦他收集到足够的物质，Xardorok计划建造一条chardalyn龙，并将其释放到十镇。",
	"Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier—a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret—a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!": "尽管有奥里尔的暴风雪和其他阻挠因素，游客仍然来来往往。在最近到来的人中，有四位来自奥术兄弟会的巫师，这是一个位于卢斯坎的强大的施法者协会。他们是来追寻埋藏在雷格德冰川下的失落之城的传闻--一个早已消失的尼瑟尔帝国的碎片，其巫师们挥舞着令诸神恐惧的魔法。尼瑟尔的魔法有一种吸引渴望权力的巫师的方式，就像奥术兄弟会的成员常常是这样。尼瑟尔的城市漂浮在云层之间，使它们在几个世纪里几乎不受攻击。然后，近两千年前，这座漂浮的城市在帝国的衰落中坠落，此后没有人发现或探索过它。可以说，它是冰风谷最大的秘密--尼瑟斯巫师的墓地和他们留下的魔法。谁也不知道坠机后有什么幸存下来，但我们马上就会知道了!",

	"The Reghed nomads who stalk the tundra and the Ten-Towners who keep civilization alive are so concerned with day-to-day survival that they typically pay little heed to the evil forces gathering on the fringes of Icewind Dale. Adventurers are much better equipped to deal with such threats, particularly in the dead of winter.": "在苔原上游荡的雷格德（Reghed）游牧民族和维持文明的天主（Ten-Towners）都非常关心日常的生存问题，他们通常很少注意到聚集在冰风谷边缘的邪恶力量。冒险者们更有能力应对这种威胁，尤其是在严冬。",
	"One recent arrival in the area is {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar warlock formerly of the Underdark. His patron, Deep Duerra, has urged Xardorok to fulfill his destiny and become the first duergar to rule a kingdom on the surface. Icewind Dale is cold, dark, and heartlessly cruel—the perfect realm for Xardorok to claim as despot. Unbeknownst to Xardorok, however, it is not Deep Duerra guiding his actions but the archdevil Asmodeus in the guise of Deep Duerra. In Xardorok, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found an eager and petty tyrant.": "最近来到这个地区的是{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}，一个以前在暗黑世界的duergar术士。他的赞助人，深渊杜拉（Deep Duerra），敦促Xardorok完成他的命运，成为第一个统治地面王国的duergar。冰风谷冰冷、黑暗、无情、残酷--是Xardorok成为暴君的完美境界。然而，Xardorok不知道的是，指导他行动的不是Deep Duerra，而是化身为Deep Duerra的大恶魔Asmodeus。在Xardorok身上，九层地狱的主宰找到了一个急切而小气的暴君。",
	"To achieve his goal, Xardorok is scouring the land for chardalyn, which he is forging into a dragon that he will send to destroy Ten-Towns. His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.": "为了实现他的目标，Xardorok正在搜罗土地上的chardalyn，他要把它锻造成一条龙，然后派它去摧毁十镇。他的儿子Durth和Nildar带领着duergar团队进行任务，为他们贪婪、专制的父亲夺回更多这种深色的水晶。",
	"The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world. They used such magic to raise their cities into the sky. The city of Ythryn was one such wonder. It crashed long ago but still exists, buried under the Reghed Glacier on the eastern edge of Icewind Dale.": "昔日尼德兰的巫师们掌握着可以重塑世界的魔法。他们用这样的魔法将他们的城市升入天空。Ythryn城就是这样一个奇迹。它在很久以前就崩溃了，但仍然存在，被埋在冰风谷东部边缘的雷格德冰川之下。",
	"This frozen necropolis holds the remnants of some of the most powerful spellcasters in the history of the Realms, including a Netherese demilich. It also contains a {@i mythallar} (described in {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}), a magic item that can raise an entire city into the air and alter the weather in a fifty-mile radius. The characters can use this device to counteract Auril's spell and free Icewind Dale from her Everlasting Rime.": "这个冰冻的尸骨城保存着一些王国历史上最强大的法术师的残骸，包括一个尼瑟尔人的恶魔。它还包含一个{@i mythallar}（在{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}中描述），一个可以将整个城市升到空中并改变50英里范围内天气的魔法物品。角色们可以用这个装置来对抗奥里尔的咒语，并将冰风谷从她的恒定时间中解放出来。",
	"More than a hundred years prior to this adventure, a wizard named Akar Kessel found an artifact suffused with demonic magic called {@i Crenshinibon} (better known as the {@i Crystal Shard}) and used it to erect a great black tower in Icewind Dale. When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the {@i Crystal Shard}, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.": "在这次冒险的一百多年前，一个名叫阿卡-凯瑟的巫师发现了一件充满恶魔魔法的工艺品，叫做{@i Crenshinibon}(更多的是称为{@i Crystal Shard})，并用它在冰风谷建立了一座巨大的黑塔。当这座塔被摧毁时，用来创造它的魔法与周围的冰融合在一起，形成了现在已知的Chardalyn：一种非魔法的晶体物质，与金属一样坚固，但比钢铁更容易操作。在此后的几年里，冰风谷各地发现了更多的chardalyn矿藏。与(2%)一样，这些矿床往往充满了恶魔的魔力。长时间接触充斥着恶魔魔力的chardalyn，可以扭曲生物的心智，导致疯狂，一旦接触中断，这种疯狂通常就会消失。",
	"Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a {@spell detect evil and good} spell or similar magic.": "Chardalyn触摸起来很冷，而且很容易接受魔法，因此它是制作魔杖、法杖和其他魔法物品的理想物质。充斥着上层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被献祭的物品，而充斥着下层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被亵渎的物品；两者都可以通过{@spell detect evil and good}的咒语或类似的魔法来识别。",
	"Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.": "早在阿卡-凯瑟尔在冰风谷留下他的印记之前，尼德兰的巫师们就创造了他们自己的Chardalyn。在古代尼瑟斯人的废墟中可以找到许多由这种深色水晶制成的物品。",
	"Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.": "奥术兄弟会（Arcane Brotherhood）（一个由巫师组成的阴谋集团，他们的行为就像西部的枪手）的四名成员来到冰风谷，寻找失落的尼瑟斯飞地，希望能发掘出它的秘密。角色们是选择帮助还是反对这些巫师，由他们自己决定，但有一点是肯定的：奥术兄弟会不会让一帮冒险者挡在他们和等待在这个注定灭亡的废墟中发现的魔法之间。",
	"Auril's decision to live among mortals is explained in {@book appendix C|idrotf|21}. What the characters discover in the course of the adventure is that she's unhappy and craves isolation. Her nightly quest to hold the sun at bay stems from a need to preserve the beauty of things by freezing them. There is no way to reason with a being so bereft of compassion as Auril, but in her weakened state, she can be defeated or forced to reckon with her cruel indifference toward life.": "Auril决定生活在凡人之中的原因是（%0%）。人物在冒险过程中发现，她不快乐，渴望与世隔绝。她每夜都在追求把太阳挡在门外，这是因为她需要通过冻结事物来保存它们的美丽。没有办法与像奥里尔这样缺乏同情心的生物讲道理，但在她虚弱的状态下，她可以被打败或被迫考虑她对生命的残酷漠视。",
	"Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain {@item The Codicil of White|IDRotF}, a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers.

Anyone who clears out the mine can expect to be well compensated.": "在Termalaine，Masthew议长关闭了该镇一个有利可图的宝石矿。显然，一伙哥布林悄悄地进入了矿场，并威胁到了一些矿工。任何清理出该矿的人都会得到丰厚的补偿。",

	"Once the characters reach 4th level, they no long gain levels by completing the quests in this chapter.

	"As the characters complete the quests in this chapter, their reputation in Ten-Towns begins to spread.

Fame in Icewind Dale is always a double-edged sword.": "随着人物完成本章的任务，他们在十镇的名声开始传播。无论好坏，他们都会被十镇的人们所熟知--有些人把他们当作救世主，有些人则害怕他们的胆量，羡慕他们的力量，或者觊觎他们积累的财富。在冰风谷的名声总是一把双刃剑。",

	"When the characters reach 3rd level, they begin to earn a healthy measure of respect from Ten-Towners who know of their exploits.": "当人物达到3级时，他们开始从知道他们的事迹的天镇人那里赢得健康的尊重。",
	"When the characters reach 4th level, they are given a hero's welcome in the towns they've helped but are given the cold shoulder in towns they've ignored. They also learn about new adventure opportunities outside Ten-Towns, as described in {@adventure chapter 2|IDRotF|12}.": "当角色达到4级时，他们在他们帮助过的城镇中受到英雄的欢迎，但在他们忽视的城镇中却受到冷遇。他们也会了解到十镇以外的新的冒险机会，如{@adventure chapter 2|IDRotF|12}中所述。",
	"Ten-Towns didn't spring up overnight. It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over Faerûn came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.": "腾博会官网诚信为本并不是一夜之间崛起的。它是在四个世纪前从卑微的起点开始的。来自法鲁恩各地的移民来到这里寻找逃生或冒险，并在现在布林山德所在的山顶上建立了一个简陋的贸易站。一个接一个的定居点在Maer Dualdon、Lac Dinneshere和Redwaters的海岸上兴起。兽人和其他怪物无处不在的威胁迫使这些防卫薄弱的湖边小镇将布林山德从一个简陋的山顶贸易站变成了一个有围墙的小镇，在最坏的情况发生时，能够保卫所有的Ten-Towners。",
	"Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.": "大多数城镇都有孕育它们的移民文化的痕迹。这些证据被刻在房屋、雕像和其他装置上。例如，古德米德的老建筑上的恐龙雕刻提醒人们，其最初的定居者中有许多是楚丹人。",
	"Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.": "十镇的居民在不工作的时候倾向于留在室内，因为外面冷得吓人，这使每个定居点都有一种死一般的安静。大多数冒险到户外的人都被捆绑在寒冷的天气里，几乎无法辨认，而且他们不会站在那里太久，因为寒风会让他们更难受。",
	"Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.": "奥里尔的冬季魔咒导致十镇的人口减少，并加剧了酝酿多年的竞争，随着对资源的竞争变得越来越激烈，邻近的城镇也开始相互对抗。如果日益严重的部落主义继续威胁到共同利益，十镇联盟将无法维持。",
	"Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.": "除布林山德外，这十个城镇中的大多数都建在三个大湖的岸边。最深的湖泊Maer Dualdon是最大的节头鳟鱼种群。最浅的湖泊--红水湖（Redwaters）在冬季几乎完全结冰，使得那里的捕鱼变得困难。Dinneshere湖赶上了东面Reghed冰川吹来的最坏的风，因此拥有最汹涌的水域。这些湖泊底部的小型热力喷口使它们即使在最冷的冬天也不会完全冻结。",
	"Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.": "Ten-Towns渔船是简单的事务。最小的是划艇和单桅小船，需要小心操作以避免翻船。较大的双桅小船和单层甲板的龙骨船能更好地处理风和浪。这些船挂着他们城镇的旗帜，为整个社区提供鱼，而不是为任何个别渔民。",
	"When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.": "当厚厚的冰层覆盖在湖面上时，许多渔民呆在家里和炉灶的庇护所里，但最热心或最绝望的人在冰上凿洞，把鱼线垂下来，希望能引诱饥饿的鳟鱼。",
	"The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses. In the other towns of Icewind Dale, wood is too precious a commodity to burn, so whale oil is used in lamps and small stoves around which townsfolk huddle for warmth.": "在取暖方面，十镇的居民没有太多的选择。来自Good Mead、Lonelywood和Termalaine的人们燃烧着从附近森林打捞上来的木材来取暖。在冰风谷的其他城镇，木材太过珍贵而无法燃烧，所以鲸鱼油被用在灯和小炉子上，镇民们挤在一起取暖。",
	"Ten-Towners buy their whale oil from whalers who live on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. Whaling is thus a lucrative (if inherently dangerous) business in Icewind Dale.": "Ten-Towners从居住在移动冰海海岸的捕鲸者那里购买鲸鱼油。因此，在冰风谷，捕鲸是一项有利可图的生意（尽管本身就很危险）。",
	"Any item listed in the equipment chapter of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be bought in Ten-Towns, including fishing tackle and sleds. The larger the town, the more likely it is to have the item.": "装备篇（%0%）中列出的任何物品都可以在十镇买到，包括钓具和雪橇。城镇越大，越有可能有该物品。",

	"Snowshoes reduce the likelihood of their wearer getting stuck in the deep snow.": "雪鞋减少了穿戴者陷入深雪中的可能性。",
	"Most Ten-Towners travel from town to town on foot. Those who need to transport more goods than they can carry use wooden sleds pulled by dogs or domesticated axe beaks as pack animals. Such things can be bought and sold in every Ten-Towns settlement.": "大多数天镇人从一个镇到另一个镇都是步行。那些需要运输更多货物的人则使用狗拉的木制雪橇或驯化的斧头嘴作为驮运动物。这种东西在每个天镇定居点都可以买到和卖到。",

	"The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease Auril so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon.

Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen.

She has a protection racket that earns her a little coin on the side, and she also commits murders for profit on the sly. One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help.

She employs {@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF} as a bodyguard and pays four others (neutral evil human {@creature Bandit||bandits}) to drive and protect the other two sleds.

	"The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours. Once activity drops off, Torrga shuts down her operation for the rest of the day, puts the dogs in a kennel and the sleds in a secure shed, and pays for the team's lodgings. After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.": "对付Sephek的最好办法是在他与Torrga和她的其他亲信分开时与他对峙。塞菲克在营业时间内与托尔加保持密切联系。一旦活动减少，托尔加就会在一天之内关闭她的业务，把狗放在狗窝里，把雪橇放在一个安全的棚子里，并支付团队的住宿费。在托尔加退休过夜后，塞菲克可以自由地做他喜欢的事，直到第二天早上。如果他碰巧在布林山德、伊士文或塔戈斯，他就会跟踪他的下一个谋杀受害者。如果他在其他地方，他就会在晚上喝酒和狂欢，然后睡上几个小时，最好是在一个没有暖气的地方，比如谷仓或废弃的小屋。",
	"When asked about his odd style of dress, {@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF} claims that he was born on the holiday of Midwinter and that the Frostmaiden's blessing protects him from the cold. In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.": "当被问及他奇怪的着装风格时，{@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF}声称他是在中秋节出生的，而且冰霜女巫的祝福能保护他免受寒冷。事实上，塞菲克并不是在仲冬节期间出生的。他是一个水手，几个月前他的船在奥里尔岛的海岸边沉没了。他游到岛上，但几乎被冻死了。当他的生命逐渐消逝时，一个听命于欧瑞尔的冰霜德鲁伊的灵魂附身于他。冬日之魂吞噬了塞菲克的灵魂，并将他作为一个活的容器来做冰霜女巫的工作。灵魂不能离开萨菲克的身体；如果萨菲克死了，冬天的灵魂也会随着他一起毁灭。",

As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt. He considers surrendering only because it buys time for him to escape and commit more murders. In combat, he wields a magical sword and magical daggers made of ice that he can conjure at will.

	"After finding and slaying Sephek, the characters can return to Hlin and collect their 100 gp reward. If they don't have evidence to prove that Sephek is dead, Hlin is willing to take them at their word. If the ice-dagger murders stop, she'll know her trust was not misplaced.

For the characters' services, Dannika is offering the group 25 gp as well as a {@item Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)} that can help locate chwingas. She says she'll be at the local tavern each evening, so the characters should have no trouble finding her once the job is completed. If the characters accept her quest, Dannika gives them her lantern (see {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}) and explains how it works. She then tells them she's been looking all over town and hasn't found any chwingas. She suggests the characters might have better luck in one of the other settlements. She could continue the search herself, but she's nervous about venturing out into the extreme cold and has other research-related chores to attend to.": "演讲者是丹妮卡-格雷斯泰尔（合法中立的半精灵（%0%）），她是一位学者，认为被称为chwingas的微元素精神可能是改善冰风谷气候的关键。由于温格人居住在十镇，并且有一些改变自然环境的能力，丹妮卡认为通过近距离研究温格人，她可以学到很多。对于这些人物的服务，丹妮卡为他们提供了25戈比，以及一个可以帮助找到温格人的{@item Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)}。她说她每天晚上都会在当地的小酒馆，所以一旦完成任务，人物应该不难找到她。如果人物接受了她的任务，丹妮卡会把她的灯笼给他们（见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}），并解释它的工作原理。然后她告诉他们，她已经找遍了整个镇子，但没有发现任何chwingas。她建议角色们在其他定居点可能会有更好的运气。她可以自己继续寻找，但她对冒险进入极度寒冷的环境感到紧张，而且还有其他与研究有关的琐事要做。",
	"There are no chwingas in the adventurers' starting town, but each time they visit another town in Icewind Dale, there's a cumulative {@chance 25|25 percent} chance of chwingas being present.

On a failed check, both bears are hostile toward that character for the rest of the encounter.

	"In generations past, travelers to Caer-Dineval had to follow the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere until after several hours they spied a small fortress (the \"caer\" for which the town is named) jutting up from the prominence where it overlooks the lake. A ferry out of Easthaven made the arduous trek unnecessary for merchants and other travelers, but the ferry was discontinued two months ago, cutting off Caer-Dineval (and its eastward neighbor, Caer-Konig) from the rest of Ten-Towns except by the overland route.

	"This small castle was built over four hundred years ago by the Dinev family from Cormyr, before Ten-Towns existed as anything more than a few scattered camps of explorers living off the land. The Dinevs hoped to claim sovereignty over the unsettled lands of Icewind Dale. When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.": "这座小城堡是四百多年前由来自科米尔的迪内夫家族建造的，当时十镇还没有任何东西，只是一些分散的探险者营地，靠土地为生。迪内夫家族希望对冰风谷这块未开发的土地拥有主权。当这座被称为Caer-Dineval的城堡完工后，工人们和他们的家人在悬崖下较远的地方建造的附属建筑中定居下来，同时还有Dinevs带来的家臣的家人。在接下来的几年里，该地区的许多探险家来到这里亲眼目睹了Caer，一些人在城墙的阴影下建造了小屋。小镇刚站稳脚跟，掠夺性的兽人就从苔原上冲下来，把它烧成灰烬。镇上的居民试图在城堡里避难，但迪涅夫人被兽人部落的规模所惊吓，封锁了大门并拒绝打开。兽人扑向受困的人们，将他们屠杀殆尽。迪内夫人在最初的攻击中幸存下来，但没有在随后的围攻中幸存。在被关在凯尔的三个星期后，迪内夫家族因饥饿而变得非常虚弱，当兽人翻越城堡的墙壁时，他们无法抵抗。因此，迪内夫家族在冰风谷的短暂统治就这样血腥地结束了。",
	"The Caer remained in the orcs' possession for several years, until they were driven out by a small army of human settlers from other parts of the dale who banded together. The victors claimed the castle and its lands, and those with families brought them here to settle. Their descendants live here to this day and keep alive the memory of their ancestors' deeds.": "卡伊尔在兽人手中停留了数年，直到他们被一支来自山谷其他地方的人类定居者组成的小规模军队赶走。胜利者宣称拥有这座城堡和它的土地，那些有家庭的人把他们带到这里定居。他们的后代至今生活在这里，并保持着对祖先事迹的记忆。",

Although he has spare rooms with empty beds, he claims to have no available guest accommodations. If adventurers are looking for a place to rest, he suggests that they try the Caer.

After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the \"Chardalyn Amulets\" sidebar).": "大多数邪教徒都是冰风谷的本地人，如果不是莱维斯托斯为他们出面干预，他们就会在荒野中灭亡。这些邪教徒的故事都是一样的：当他们快要冻死的时候，大恶魔在他们的脑海中向他们伸出了手，提供了第二次生命的机会，以换取他们的绝对奉献。在他们同意追随莱维斯特后，附近的雪地上有一道淡淡的光芒吸引了他们的目光，导致他们发现了一个剑形的查尔达林护身符。这些护身符中的每一个都有内在的光芒，提供温暖和帮助，保护佩戴者抵御寒冷，同时引导他们安全返回文明社会。一旦佩戴者到达十镇，护身符就会失去内在的光芒，但崇拜者会保留他们的护身符，作为他们对斯蒂吉亚大公的奉献的标志（见 \"Chardalyn护身符 \"侧边栏）。",
	"The Knights of the Black Sword have members scattered throughout Ten-Towns.

The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do. She has convinced the other cult members to forge alliances with anyone willing to oppose the duergar, including stray bands of adventurers.": "莱维斯特已经警告黑剑骑士团，虫族正在策划破坏十镇。他相信这些精灵是代表地狱之主阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）和他的地狱狱卒行事的，但他并没有与邪教分享这一信息。该邪教最年长的成员赫特（一个因冻伤而失去右脚的钉腿盾牌矮人）像大多数矮人一样憎恨精灵。她说服其他邪教成员与任何愿意反对精灵族的人结成联盟，包括流浪的冒险者队伍。",

In truth, the winter wolves expect Norsu to slaughter the characters, but in case that doesn't happen, they remain outside to attack any characters who try to flee.

On a failed check, no useful information is obtained. If the check succeeds, the character is urged to speak with Scython, the tiefling ferryman, who spends most of his free time in a tavern called the Wet Trout. Scython is widely regarded as a font of useful information. Although he doesn't know anything about the duergar or the stolen chardalyn, he knows several rumors that might steer the characters in new directions (see \"{@area The Wet Trout|166|x}\").

	"A white moose is attacking loggers in the forest near Lonelywood. The town's logging industry is essential to the growth and survival of Ten-Towns, and Speaker Nimsy Huddle has assured the other speakers that Lonelywood's \"moose problem\" will be dealt with in short order. Hunters have been dispatched to kill the moose, but it has eluded them so far. From what the hunters have seen, their prey is smarter than the average moose, and its white hide makes it hard to spot in the snow. What they don't know is that the moose is using a magic mirror as a scrying device to show it where its enemies are.": "一只白色的驼鹿正在孤独林附近的森林里攻击伐木工人。该镇的伐木业对十镇的发展和生存至关重要，议长尼姆西-哈德向其他发言者保证，孤独林的 \"驼鹿问题 \"将在短期内得到解决。猎人已经被派去杀死驼鹿，但到目前为止，驼鹿还没有被他们发现。根据猎人的观察，他们的猎物比一般的驼鹿更聪明，而且它的白色皮毛使它在雪地上很难被发现。他们不知道的是，驼鹿正在使用一面魔镜作为窥探装置，以显示它的敌人在哪里。",

	"The white moose is an awakened beast that serves Ravisin, the same evil frost druid who awakened the plesiosaurus in Maer Dualdon (see \"{@area Lake Monster|07d|x}\"). This druid has cast {@spell awaken} spells on several beasts, gifting them with human-level intelligence and the ability to speak, and uses them to spy on settlements and terrorize their inhabitants. Ravisin has taken refuge in an elven tomb in the woods and won't rest until the forest is free of loggers. Simply killing the white moose will not solve Lonelywood's problem; to end the threat to Lonelywood and other towns, the characters must stop the druid from awakening more beasts and using them to harm Ten-Towners.": "白麋鹿是一只被唤醒的野兽，它为拉维辛服务，拉维辛也是邪恶的冰霜德鲁伊，他在迈尔-杜尔登唤醒了李氏巨兽（见\"（%0%）\"）。这个德鲁伊在几只野兽身上施了{@spell awaken}的法术，赋予它们人类级别的智力和说话的能力，并利用它们来监视定居点，恐吓居民。拉维辛在森林中的一个精灵墓中避难，在森林中没有伐木工人之前不会休息。仅仅杀死白麋鹿并不能解决Lonelywood的问题；为了结束对Lonelywood和其他城镇的威胁，人物必须阻止德鲁伊唤醒更多的野兽并利用它们来伤害Ten-Towners。",

	"When the characters investigate, they discover that all is not what it seems. The kobold leader has been possessed by a ghost, and a grell has infiltrated the mine, setting the kobolds on edge.

No one was killed, but the kobolds are too dangerous for the miners to deal with. He also reveals that a human miner went missing a few days before the kobolds showed up, prompting other miners to fear that a monster must have crawled up from the Underdark. Oarus thinks it's possible that the miner fell down the central shaft, which is deep enough that his body would never be found.": "镇上的发言人欧鲁斯-马修（合法善良的半兽人（%0%））解释说，几天前有一群哥布林悄悄进入矿区，从地表进入，迫使矿工们放弃工作。没有人被杀，但哥布林太危险了，矿工们无法对付。他还透露，在哥布林出现的前几天，一个人类矿工失踪了，这促使其他矿工担心一定有怪物从地下世界爬上来。欧鲁斯认为那名矿工有可能是掉进了中央竖井，那里很深，他的尸体永远不会被发现。",

	"Six months ago, Macreadus, a sage and devout follower of Lathander (god of the dawn and rebirth), formed a plan to end Auril's everlasting winter. He holed up in the Black Cabin, where he spent all his time assembling a weather-controlling magical device called the {@i Summer Star}, using knowledge he gleaned from a book about Netherese artifacts. Macreadus's device was similar in design to a {@i mythallar} (see {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF}}), but much smaller. Unfortunately for him, it had a serious design flaw. When Macreadus tried to use it three days ago, it malfunctioned, incinerating both him and his book. Characters who search the cabin can find the sage's charred skeleton and his deadly creation.": "六个月前，Macreadus，一个圣人和Lathander（黎明和重生之神）的虔诚追随者，制定了一个计划来结束Auril的永恒的冬天。他躲在黑屋里，用他从一本关于尼瑟斯神器的书中收集到的知识，把所有的时间都花在了组装一个名为（%0%）的天气控制魔法装置上。Macreadus的装置在设计上类似于{@i mythallar}（见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF}}），但要小得多。对他来说，不幸的是，它有一个严重的设计缺陷。三天前，当Macreadus试图使用它时，它发生了故障，将他和他的书都烧毁了。搜索小屋的人物可以找到圣人烧焦的骨架和他致命的创作。",
	"Since the mishap, Macreadus's restless spirit has lingered in the Border Ethereal, unwilling to depart until its work is complete.

	"From the Border Ethereal, the restless spirit of Macreadus can observe happenings in and around the cabin, but it can't manifest physically on the Material Plane. Characters can see the restless spirit of Macreadus and interact with it only if they cross over to the Border Ethereal, which is what happens to someone who dies in the cabin (see \"Dying in the Black Cabin\" below).": "从边界虚空，Macreadus的不安分的灵魂可以观察到小木屋内和周围发生的事情，但它不能在物质世界显现出来。角色只有在穿越到边界虚空时才能看到Macreadus的不安分的灵魂并与之互动，这就是死在小木屋里的人的情况（见下文 \"死在黑木屋\"）。",
	"In the Border Ethereal, the spirit of Macreadus manifests as a giant, floating, spectral head with fire burning in its eyes. Arrogant in life, Macreadus remains so in death. He's snappy and egotistical, blaming everything but himself for his failure. He welcomes the company of others, but anyone who questions his motives or mocks his invention quickly loses his favor. He spent months locked away in the cabin, building the {@i Summer Star} so he could end the Everlasting Rime, becoming more and more desperate to see it through. He had hoped to make a name for himself and win Lathander's praise—is that so wrong?": "在边境虚空中，Macreadus的精神表现为一个巨大的、漂浮的、幽灵般的头颅，眼睛里燃烧着火焰。Macreadus生前傲慢无礼，死后也是如此。他尖刻而自负，把失败归咎于一切，而不是自己。他欢迎别人的陪伴，但任何质疑他的动机或嘲笑他的发明的人都会很快失去他的青睐。他花了几个月时间关在小屋里，建造{@i Summer Star}，这样他就可以结束永恒之磬，越来越迫切地想看到它的完成。他曾希望为自己扬名立万，赢得Lathander的赞扬--这有什么错吗？",
	"If the characters try to finish his work, Macreadus helps as much as his bodiless form allows. To lay his spirit to rest, the characters must fix his creation's design flaw and then activate it, all within the confines of the Black Cabin, where Macreadus can observe the results. Once he sees the device working as intended, his spirit departs to the afterlife.": "如果人物试图完成他的工作，Macreadus会在他的无躯体形态允许的范围内提供帮助。为了让他的灵魂安息，角色们必须修复他创造的设计缺陷，然后激活它，所有这些都在黑屋的范围内，Macreadus可以观察到结果。一旦他看到这个装置按计划工作，他的灵魂就会离开，前往来世。",
	"If a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or higher dies inside the Black Cabin, its spirit (if it has one) leaves its body and assumes a spectral form on the Border Ethereal until the creature is brought back from the dead. This is what happened to Macreadus, and the same fate awaits characters who perish in the cabin.": "如果一个智力为3或更高的生物在黑屋内死亡，它的灵魂（如果它有的话）就会离开它的身体，在虚无边界上呈现出幽灵的形态，直到该生物被起死回生。这就是发生在Macreadus身上的事情，同样的命运也在等待着在小屋里死亡的人物。",
	"If a character dies in the cabin and its spirit manifests in the Border Ethereal, the player can choose the form the spirit takes. It might look like a spectral image of the dead character, or it might be something bizarre like a ghostly crow or a blob of ectoplasmic energy.": "如果一个角色死在船舱里，他的灵魂在边境虚无之地显现，玩家可以选择灵魂的形式。它可能看起来像一个死去的角色的幽灵形象，也可能是一些奇怪的东西，比如一只幽灵般的乌鸦或一团外质能量。",
	"Regardless of the form it takes, the spirit is not a creature and can't be harmed or turned. It can't make attack rolls and doesn't make saving throws, and conditions don't apply to it. It can't cast spells or attune to magic items. Creatures on the Material Plane can't see the spirit without some ability or magic that lets them gaze into the Border Ethereal. A spirit in the Border Ethereal can't speak to creatures on the Material Plane, or vice versa.": "无论它采取什么形式，灵魂都不是生物，不能被伤害或转化。它不能进行攻击，也不能进行蓄力，而且条件对它不适用。它不能施展法术或与魔法物品相适应。物质世界的生物如果没有某种能力或魔法可以让他们凝视边界虚空，就无法看到这个灵魂。边界虚空的灵魂不能与物质界的生物说话，反之亦然。",

	"The spirit can make ability checks based on Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma only. It applies no modifiers to these checks.": "灵魂可以根据灵巧、智力、智慧和魅力来进行能力检查。它对这些检查不适用任何修饰法。",
	"As an action, the spirit can attempt to exert up to 5 pounds of force on a creature or object no more than 5 feet away from it in the Material Plane, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma check. The spirit might use this ability to move a tiny object, write a message on a frosty or sooty surface, operate a simple tool, or tap someone on the shoulder, but the force isn't strong enough to cause harm to a creature.": "作为一个动作，灵魂可以尝试对物质世界中距离它不超过5英尺的生物或物体施加最多5磅的力量，只要成功地进行DC10魅力检查就可以了。灵魂可以用这种能力来移动一个微小的物体，在冰霜或烟尘的表面上写下信息，操作一个简单的工具，或拍打某人的肩膀，但这种力量还不足以对生物造成伤害。",
	"The spirit can see other spirits in the Border Ethereal (including the spirit of Macreadus) and speak to them. The spirit knows the languages it knew in life.": "灵魂可以看到边界虚空中的其他灵魂（包括Macreadus的灵魂）并与他们交谈。灵魂知道它生前知道的语言。",

But the walkway west of the gap (outside the door to {@area area B4|2d4|x}) collapses if more than 150 pounds of weight are placed on any 5-foot section of it. Any creature on the section of walkway when it collapses must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature drops 20 feet straight down into the snow, taking 1 bludgeoning damage from the cushioned fall and landing {@condition prone}.

Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 90 ({@dice 10d10 + 35}) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, the creature is turned to ashes if the remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum. Once the explosion is triggered, the {@i Summer Star} becomes inoperable and safe to handle.": "当生物第一次拿起{@i Summer Star}时，它的核心会发出像蜡烛火焰一样的金色光芒。除非该生物立即丢掉装置，否则光芒会突然绽放，变成一个以装置为中心的半径为10英尺的金色光芒燃烧球。球体中的每个生物都必须进行DC17宪法救赎，如果救赎失败，将受到90({@dice 10d10 + 35})的辐射伤害，如果救赎成功，将受到一半的伤害。如果这个效果将一个生物的命中率降低到0，并且还有剩余的伤害，如果剩余的伤害等于或超过它的最大命中率，这个生物就会变成灰烬。一旦爆炸被触发，{@i Summer Star}就变得无法操作，可以安全处理。",

The goblins who triggered the avalanche captured Spellix's mates and dragged them back to their caves in the mountains to be eaten. Spellix, whom the goblins overlooked, followed them and devised a cunning plan to free his companions. Using materials scavenged from the wrecked caravan, he engineered a costume for himself. Disguised as a half-metal goblin, he infiltrated the goblins' lair and did his best to fit in, cleverly using {@spell silent image} spells to hide the imperfections in his disguise. When he was offered a bone to gnaw on, his mechanical goblin mouth malfunctioned and wouldn't stop grinding its teeth. Thus, {@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} came to be known as Yarb-Gnock, which means \"Ever-Gnawing\" in Goblin.": "五年前，在冰风谷成为今天这个永久冰封的地狱景区之前，{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}与一个小商队一起穿越山口时，被卷入雪崩。引发雪崩的地精抓住了斯佩利克斯的伙伴们，并把他们拖回山中的洞穴吃掉。妖精们忽略了斯佩利克斯，他跟踪了他们，并制定了一个狡猾的计划来解救他的同伴们。他利用从残破的商队中搜出的材料，为自己设计了一套服装。他伪装成一个半金属的妖精，潜入了妖精的巢穴，并尽力融入其中，巧妙地使用{@spell silent image}法术来掩盖他伪装中的缺陷。当有人给他一根骨头让他啃的时候，他的机械地精的嘴出现了故障，不停地磨牙。因此，{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF}被称为Yarb-Gnock，在哥布林语中意为 \"永远的啃食\"。",
	"Spellix was repulsed by the goblins' squalor and took pity on them. Abandoning all concern for his former mates, whom he didn't particularly like anyway, Spellix adopted the name given to him by the goblins and spent the next several months engineering ways to improve their standard of living. Long after the other members of the caravan had been eaten, Yarb-Gnock became the new chief after the previous one choked to death on a mountain goat tongue. By then, Yarb-Gnock had already drawn up plans to build a fortress in the mountains. Karkolohk, the Gnomish word for \"home,\" became the goblin tribe's dream of a better future.": "斯佩利克斯对地精们的肮脏生活感到厌恶，并同情他们。斯佩利克斯放弃了对他以前的伙伴们的关心，反正他也不是特别喜欢他们，他采用了地精们给他起的名字，并在接下来的几个月里想办法提高他们的生活水平。在商队的其他成员被吃掉很久之后，在前任首领被山羊舌头噎死之后，亚尔布-格诺克成为新的首领。那时，亚尔布-格诺克已经制定了在山上建造堡垒的计划。Karkolohk，地精语中的 \"家\"，成为地精部落对美好未来的梦想。",
	"As the goblins were finishing construction of their new home, everlasting winter descended upon Icewind Dale. Fewer caravans made their way through the mountain pass, forcing Chief Yarb-Gnock to send goblin wagons far and wide in search of food and resources.

The goblins felt like they were working harder for less, and a few are beginning to suspect that Chief Yarb-Gnock is a fraud.": "当地精们完成了他们新家的建设时，永恒的冬天降临到了冰风谷。通过山口的商队越来越少，迫使首领Yarb-Gnock将地精的马车送到很远的地方去寻找食物和资源。尽管他做出了最大的努力，但身穿地精衣服的地精可以感觉到，这个部落正变得越来越沮丧。妖精们觉得他们工作得更辛苦了，而少数人开始怀疑Yarb-Gnock酋长是个骗子。",
	"Cooped up in the cold with creatures that would kill him if they learned the truth, Chief Yarb-Gnock is running out of ideas to keep the goblins motivated on other tasks and has begun to fear that the goblins are on to him. His costume is beginning to come apart, and paranoia has made him sleep-deprived.

Mistrust has infected every nook and cranny of Karkolohk.": "亚尔布-格诺克酋长被关在寒冷的地方，与那些一旦得知真相就会杀了他的生物在一起，他已经没有办法让妖精们继续执行其他任务，并开始担心妖精们会盯上他。他的服装开始散架，偏执狂使他寝食难安。从山顶上扔下的 \"叛徒 \"的数量随着每个月的周期而增加，地精们不知道他们中谁是亚尔布-格诺克的忠实间谍。不信任已经感染了卡科洛赫的每一个角落和缝隙。",
	"{@creature Spellix Romwod|IDRotF} was beginning to think that the time had come to abandon his goblin kin and seek refuge in Ten-Towns when, two days ago, his fortunes improved suddenly.

	"Chief Yarb-Gnock has taught the goblins to seize their destiny and stop at nothing to get what they want. Opportunistic creatures that they are, they take any sign of weakness as an opening to gain an advantage. If bullying and intimidation don't work, the goblins use more underhanded and passive-aggressive tactics. If they think that they are at a disadvantage or that they will come to an unavoidable loss, the goblins will do whatever they can to backtrack out of such a situation, be it through bribery, wheedling, or treachery.": "亚尔布-格诺克酋长教导地精们要抓住自己的命运，不惜一切代价来获得他们想要的东西。他们是机会主义的生物，他们把任何软弱的迹象都当作获得优势的机会。如果欺负和恐吓不起作用，妖精们就会使用更多的暗器和消极的攻击手段。如果他们认为自己处于劣势，或者他们将面临不可避免的损失，地精们会想尽办法从这种情况下倒退出来，无论是通过贿赂、讨好，还是背叛。",

Centuries later, a band of goblins dug it out and hauled it back to Karkolohk. Unfortunately for them, the guardian could not be reactivated. After some thought, Chief Yarb-Gnock decided to dangle it from this platform, using ropes and pulleys like puppet strings to make the guardian appear animate and terrifying.

	"The Reghed nomads eke out a meager existence on the desolate tundra of Icewind Dale, yet this is a life to which they are accustomed. Auril's everlasting winter has made hunting and travel more challenging, to be sure, but the tribes are weathering these difficult times by rationing their food and letting nothing go to waste. If anything, the Frostmaiden's cruelty has hardened the nomads' determination to survive. By following herds for their food and occasionally restocking on wood, the Reghed can get by without relying on trade. They shun Ten-Towns and expect to prevail long after those feeble lights of civilization have been snuffed out.": "雷格德游牧民族在冰风谷荒凉的苔原上勉强度日，但这是他们所习惯的生活。奥里尔（Auril）永恒的冬天使狩猎和旅行更具挑战性，这是肯定的，但部落通过配给食物和不让任何东西被浪费来度过这些困难时期。如果说有什么原因的话，那么冰霜女巫的残忍已经使游牧民族的生存决心更加坚定。通过跟随牧群获取食物，偶尔补充木材，雷格德人可以不依赖贸易而生存。他们避开了十镇，并期望在那些微弱的文明之光被扼杀后还能长期存在。",
	"A Reghed camp is a somber and subdued place, except for the barking of sled dogs and the sounds of children playing in the snow. The warriors and hunters like to conserve their strength for when it's needed, preferring to spend their idle hours doing as little as possible. Telling familiar stories and inventing new ones that glorify the nomads' outlook on life are common pastimes (see the \"Reghed Stories\" sidebar), as is sharpening weapons.": "瑞格德的营地是一个阴沉而低调的地方，除了雪橇犬的叫声和孩子们在雪地上玩耍的声音。战士和猎人喜欢保存自己的力量，以备不时之需，宁愿在闲暇时尽可能少做事情。讲述熟悉的故事和编造新的故事来颂扬游牧民族的人生观，是常见的消遣方式（见 \"摄取的故事 \"边栏），磨练武器也是如此。",
	"Food is critical, of course, and certain beasts of the tundra are staples among the Reghed tribes. Knucklehead trout and seals are often prepared for eating very near the scene of the kill, filleted or chopped and generally eaten raw. {@creature Reindeer|IDRotF} meat, on the other hand, must be cooked before consumption. {@creature Reindeer|IDRotF} also provide the Reghed tribes with sinew, bone, and hide, all of which are used in the manufacture of weapons and armor.": "当然，食物是至关重要的，某些苔原上的野兽是雷盖德部落的主食。刀头鳟鱼和海豹通常是在杀戮现场附近准备吃的，切成片或切碎，一般都是生吃。而{@creature Reindeer|IDRotF}肉则必须煮熟后才能食用。{@creature Reindeer|IDRotF}还为雷盖德部落提供筋、骨和皮，所有这些都被用于制造武器和盔甲。",

	"Revel's End is a panopticon, a prison configured in such a way that the activities of the prisoners can be closely monitored from a central location. Situated on the frigid, misty coast of the Sea of Moving Ice, the prison is a single-story structure topped with battlements. Rising from the core of the panopticon is a tower that holds the prison's administrative offices and guard barracks. Both the prison and the tower are carved out of a tall, blade-shaped rock that rises high above the sea cliffs. This rock, called the Windbreak, shields the tower against the brutal winds that sweep down from the Reghed Glacier.": "雷弗的尽头是一座全景监狱，这座监狱的配置方式使囚犯的活动可以从一个中心位置受到密切监视。监狱位于移动冰海的寒冷、迷雾的海岸上，是一个单层结构，顶部有城墙。监狱的核心是一座塔楼，里面有监狱的行政办公室和警卫营房。监狱和塔楼都是由一块高大的刀状岩石雕刻而成，高高耸立在海崖之上。这块岩石被称为 \"防风墙\"，为塔楼挡住了从雷盖德冰川上掠过的残酷的风。",

To be imprisoned in Revel's End, one must have committed a serious crime against one or more members of the alliance and been sentenced to a lengthy period of incarceration (typically a year or more). Moreover, the offender must have political connections that make incarceration in another facility less dependable. Captured spies, for example, are often brought here to cool their heels.": "启示录由领主联盟控制，这是一个松散的定居点联盟，目前的成员包括博德之门、米拉巴尔、永夜、银月、水底和亚尔塔等城市；安菲勒、达格福德和长鞍等城镇；以及矮人的据点米特拉尔厅。要想被囚禁在雷弗尔尽头，必须对联盟的一名或多名成员犯下严重罪行，并被判处长期监禁（通常是一年或更长时间）。此外，犯罪者必须有政治关系，使监禁在另一个设施中不那么可靠。例如，被抓获的间谍经常被带到这里，以冷却他们的脚步。",
	"Each member of the Lords' Alliance assigns one representative to Revel's End, and together they form a parole committee called the Absolution Council. Rarely are all ten council members present, since Revel's End offers little in the way of comfort and amenities.

This villain last appeared in {@i Legacy of the Crystal Shard}, a published adventure also set in Icewind Dale. {@i Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden} presupposes that Vaelish Gant's plot to take over Ten-Towns was thwarted, and that he has been incarcerated at Revel's End for a few years before the start of this story.": "角色们可能是被本章开头的某个与维利什-甘特有关的故事或任务引诱到雷弗的尽头的（见\"（%0%）\"和\"（%1%）\"）。这个恶棍最后一次出现在{@i Legacy of the Crystal Shard}中，这是一个已出版的、同样以冰风谷为背景的冒险。{@i Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden}的前提是，维利什-甘特占领十镇的阴谋被挫败了，而且在这个故事开始之前，他已经被关在雷弗尔尽头好几年了。",
	"The characters might also come to Revel's End hoping to book passage on a ship, as such vessels are known to bring prisoners and supplies to the prison.

Their arm muscles are quivering from exertion, and their jaws are clenched. Seven more goliaths stand around them, cheering and waving haunches of cooked meat.": "一个长条形的火盆为这个15英尺高的洞穴供暖，并使该地区充满了在火盆上方的烤架上煮肉的香味。欢呼声也充斥着这个洞穴，两个巨人站在南面的墙壁附近，手臂从两侧伸出，双手各握着一块大石头。他们的手臂肌肉因用力而颤抖，下巴也紧紧咬着。还有七个巨人站在他们周围，欢呼着，挥舞着熟肉的臀部。",

Unless the characters are accompanied by a member of the Akannathi clan, the goliaths try to frighten away the interlopers, attacking them if they refuse to leave. A clever character can win over the goliaths by challenging and beating one or more of them in a rock-holding contest. The contest plays out as follows:": "两个歌利亚人正在进行力量测试，看谁能在岩石的重压下把手臂举得最久。除非角色有阿卡纳提部族的成员陪同，否则歌利亚人会试图吓走闯入者，如果他们拒绝离开，就会攻击他们。聪明的角色可以通过挑战并在持石比赛中击败一个或多个巨人来赢得胜利。比赛的过程如下。",

	"A character who has earned the respect of one or both clans convinces either chieftain that being the first to accept responsibility for a misunderstanding, even when others should share the blame, is a sign of moral strength and good character.

The two chieftains waste hours airing their grievances, then spend longer hours glaring at each other in stubborn silence. (The characters' patience is eventually rewarded when Ogolai has food and tea brought to her. She offers to share her repast with Arn, who begrudgingly accepts out of politeness. This moment marks a turning point as the chieftains agree that there can be no winner to this contest and, more important, that the contest is a metaphor for their pointless, long-standing feud.)": "角色们让酋长们谈了好几天，如果这需要的话，把它变成一场耐力的竞赛。两位酋长浪费了几个小时来表达他们的不满，然后又花了更多的时间在顽固的沉默中互相瞪眼。(当奥戈莱的食物和茶被送到她面前时，人物的耐心最终得到了回报。她提出与阿恩分享她的食物，阿恩出于礼貌勉强接受了。这一刻标志着一个转折点，因为酋长们同意这场比赛不可能有赢家，更重要的是，这场比赛是对他们毫无意义的长期争斗的一种隐喻）。",

Xardorok rewards his subjects for spying on one another and uncovering plots against him.

If the characters take Vellynne's advice and head to Bryn Shander, they will be playing into Xardorok's hands. The dragon is saving Bryn Shander for last, because Xardorok knows that refugees from the smaller towns have nowhere else to go but there.

Speaker Trovus survives but never conquers his guilt; he does, however, give up the bottle. Jarthra Farzassh survives and leads most of the town's evacuees to the ruins of Caer-Dineval, only to be denied entry into the castle. Before they can leave Caer-Dineval, Jarthra and several others are murdered by the duergar lurking in town (see \"{@area Target 4: Caer-Dineval|4f2|x}\" above).

	"The dragon's flying speed is greater than the characters' overland movement speed or the flying speed available to characters who can cast {@spell fly} spells, so the party has little hope of catching up to the dragon before it reaches Ten-Towns. The characters' best chance of destroying the dragon is to pick a settlement and wait for the dragon there. If the characters saw Xardorok's battle plan in the previous chapter, they know the order in which the settlements of Ten-Towns will be attacked.": "龙的飞行速度大于人物的陆上移动速度或能施展（%0%）法术的人物的飞行速度，所以在龙到达十镇之前，队伍几乎没有希望追上它。角色们消灭龙的最好机会是选择一个定居点，在那里等待龙的到来。如果角色们在上一章看到了Xardorok的战斗计划，他们就知道十镇的定居点将被攻击的顺序。",
	"The dragon's preferred tactic is to strafe each settlement from the air, using its breath weapon to incinerate people and structures alike.

	"If the characters confront the dragon in Lonelywood, Bremen, Targos, or Bryn Shander, they must also contend with strong wind and heavy snowfall (for rules, see \"{@book Strong Wind|DMG|5|Strong Wind}\" and \"{@book Heavy Precipitation|DMG|5|Heavy Precipitation}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). The dragon ignores these effects, having been built by Xardorok to overcome such debilitating weather.": "如果角色在隆利伍德、布雷门、塔戈斯或布林山德与龙对峙，他们还必须面对强风和大雪（规则见{@book Strong Wind|DMG|5|Strong Wind}和{@book Heavy Precipitation|DMG|5|Heavy Precipitation}中的\"{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}\"）。龙无视这些影响，因为它是由Xardorok建造来克服这种衰弱的天气的。",

	"A demilich is what becomes of a lich that neglects to feed souls into its phylactery, and Iriolarthas's phylactery has been empty for nearly two thousand years, buried under the rubble of Ythryn far from the demilich's reach. Having lost its body and its spellcasting abilities, the demilich holds out hope that other Netherese wizards will come to its rescue, unaware that the Empire of Netheril no longer exists. Though it has been trapped in Ythryn under the ice for centuries, the demilich has a very poor sense of how much time has passed.": "Demilich是一个忽视向其法器中输入灵魂的巫师的结果，而Iriolarthas的法器已经空了近两千年，被埋在Ythryn的废墟下，远离demilich的影响。在失去了身体和法术能力之后，demilich抱着希望，希望其他尼瑟尔的巫师能来救它，却不知道尼瑟尔帝国已经不存在了。虽然它已经在Ythryn的冰层下被困了几个世纪，但demilich对时间的流逝感觉很差。",
	"When confronted by new arrivals, the demilich assumes they are rescuers from another Netherese enclave and watches to see what they do. The demilich has no means of communication and can't be contacted telepathically, so it judges new arrivals in silence. Characters who observe Iriolarthas and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can ascertain that the demilich is watching them closely to see how they react to their surroundings. If the demilich concludes, based on its observations, that the characters are not a rescue team from another Netherese enclave, it tries to destroy them before they can steal any of Ythryn's secrets. The same is true of invasive NPCs such as members of the Arcane Brotherhood. A party can fool the demilich into thinking they belong in Ythryn by succeeding on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) group check. If the group check is successful, Iriolarthas believes the party is what it pretends to be; on a failed group check, the demilich sees through the party's deception and becomes hostile toward the characters. If the demilich thinks that the characters are rescuers, given how they appear and act, it follows them around until something happens to change its mind.": "当遇到新来的人时，demilich会认为他们是来自另一个Netherese飞地的救援者，并观察他们做什么。demilich没有通讯手段，也不能用心灵感应与之联系，所以它在沉默中判断新来的人。观察Iriolarthas并成功通过DC13智慧({@skill Insight})检查的角色可以确定demilich正在密切关注他们，看他们对周围环境的反应。如果demilich根据它的观察得出结论，这些角色不是来自另一个Netherese飞地的救援队，它就会试图在他们偷取Ythryn的任何秘密之前摧毁他们。侵入性的NPC也是如此，比如奥术兄弟会的成员。队伍可以通过DC13魅力（{@skill Deception}）团体检查成功来愚弄demilich，让它以为自己属于Ythryn。如果团体检定成功，伊里欧拉塔斯就会相信队伍是它所假装的那样；如果团体检定失败，迪米利希就会看穿队伍的欺骗，并对角色产生敌意。如果demilich认为这些角色是救援者，鉴于他们的外表和行为，它就会一直跟着他们，直到发生一些事情改变它的想法。",
	"Although it lacks the means to communicate, the demilich dimly recalls the circumstances that led to its present situation.": "虽然它缺乏沟通的手段，但Demilich模糊地记得导致其目前状况的情况。",
	"After using the {@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF} (see {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF}}) to lift the enclave of Ythryn into the sky, Iriolarthas and his apprentices traveled to the frozen north in search of relics of Ostoria, a bygone empire of magic-wielding giants that waged war against the dragons forty thousand years earlier. After many fruitless excavations, they found a large stone spindle bearing strange sigils at the bottom of the Sea of Moving Ice and brought it back to Ythryn for study in the fall of −343 DR, the Year of Chilled Marrow. During one of their experiments, something went wrong—a flash of power from the spindle caused the {@i Ythryn} {@i mythallar} to shut down, which in turn caused the city to fall out of the sky and crash into the ice below.": "在使用{@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}(见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22|{@item Ythryn Mythallar|IDRotF}})将Ythryn的飞地升上天空之后，Iriolarthas和他的学徒们前往冰封的北方，寻找Ostoria的遗迹，一个由挥舞着魔法的巨人组成的已逝帝国，在四万年前与龙展开了战争。经过多次无果的挖掘，他们在移动的冰海底部发现了一个带有奇怪符号的大石锭，并在-343 DR的秋天，即冰冷的骨髓年，将其带回了Ythryn进行研究。在他们的一次实验中，出了点问题--纺锤的闪光导致{@i Ythryn}{@i mythallar}关闭，这反过来又导致城市从空中坠落，坠入冰层之下。",
	"The inhabitants of Ythryn had only a few moments to react as the city fell. Iriolarthas conjured a doorway to a magical demiplane and stepped through it just in time. As Ythryn settled into its icy grave, all magic in the city became undone for a brief time, as though something was trying to siphon it all away. The demiplane expelled Iriolarthas in that instant, trapping the lich in Ythryn, and became a living demiplane (see {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}). Iriolarthas searched the ruins of the city for his spellbook and his phylactery, recovering only the former. He also found several magical servants in stasis that had survived the devastation, as well as a handful of apprentices who had used their spells in ingenious ways to escape death.": "当城市陷落时，Ythryn的居民只有片刻的时间来反应。Iriolarthas变出了一个通往魔法半位面的门，并及时跨过了它。当Ythryn落入冰冷的坟墓时，城市中所有的魔法都在短暂的时间内失效了，好像有什么东西要把它全部吸走。半位面在那一瞬间驱逐了伊瑞奥拉塔斯，将这个巫师困在了Ythryn，并成为了一个活的半位面（见（%0%））。伊瑞奥拉塔斯在城市的废墟中寻找他的法术书和他的法器，只找到了前者。他还发现了几个在毁灭中幸存下来的魔法仆人，以及少数几个以巧妙的方式使用法术逃脱死亡的学徒。",
	"Some of those inside tried to flee Ythryn, but glacial ice blocked all conventional routes of escape, and attempts to leave by magic were thwarted by a troublesome intercessor: the mysterious spindle in Iriolarthas's citadel was still putting out magical pulses of energy to hinder spellcasting. By the time this disruption stopped some fifty years later, fear and madness had warped the minds of the apprentice mages, transforming them into nothics. Meanwhile, Iriolarthas grew increasingly feeble until, finally, the lich's skeletal body turned to dust.": "里面的一些人试图逃离Ythryn，但冰川阻挡了所有常规的逃生路线，而试图通过魔法离开的行为也被一个麻烦的干扰者挫败了：Iriolarthas城堡中的神秘主轴仍然在放出魔法能量脉冲，阻碍了施法。大约五十年后，当这种干扰停止时，恐惧和疯狂已经扭曲了法师学徒的思想，将他们变成了无名氏。与此同时，伊利奥拉塔斯变得越来越虚弱，直到最后，这个巫师的骷髅身体变成了灰尘。",
	"The Empire of Netheril arose more than five thousand years ago. Those who follow the Dalereckoning calendar would place the date of Netheril's birth at −3859 DR.": "Netheril帝国产生于五千多年前。那些遵循Dalereckoning日历的人将Netheril的出生日期定为-3859 DR。",
	"The Netherese legacy began with the discovery of the {@i Nether Scrolls}. These long, golden scrolls taught Netherese arcanists how to wield magic beyond their wildest fantasies. It took centuries, but the Netherese who mastered the power of the {@i Nether Scrolls} became a ruling class, living on great flying cities or taking refuge in remote, subterranean lairs.": "尼瑟尔人的遗产始于对{@i Nether Scrolls}的发现。这些长长的金色卷轴教会尼德兰人的奥术师如何挥舞魔法，超越他们最疯狂的幻想。花了几个世纪的时间，掌握了{@i Nether Scrolls}力量的尼瑟斯人成为了一个统治阶级，他们生活在巨大的飞行城市中，或者躲在遥远的地下巢穴中。",
	"Despite their great power, the Netherese faced a growing threat. Under the heart of their empire lived spellcasting aberrations called phaerimm. Using their ability to drain magic, the phaerimm began to unravel the Weave, without which Netheril would collapse into ruin. In −339 DR, four years after the fall of Ythryn, the empire's most powerful arcanist, Karsus, attempted to neutralize the phaerimm threat by casting a spell of unparalleled power that would enable him to replace Mystryl as the god of magic, giving him absolute control over the Weave. Mystryl countered Karsus at a key moment during the casting of the spell, a feat she could accomplish only by sacrificing herself and tearing the Weave. Karsus was slain instantly, and for a time thereafter, most of the creatures of the world were either without magic or simply unable to control it.": "尽管他们拥有强大的力量，尼瑟斯人却面临着一个日益增长的威胁。在他们帝国的中心地带，住着被称为phaerimm的施法反常者。利用他们消耗魔法的能力，phaerimm开始解开织网，没有织网，尼瑟尔就会崩溃，变成废墟。在-339 DR，也就是Ythryn陷落的四年后，帝国最强大的奥术师Karsus试图通过施放一个无与伦比的咒语来消除phaerimm的威胁，这将使他能够取代Mystryl成为魔法之神，使他能够绝对控制编织网。在施法的关键时刻，Mystryl反击了Karsus，她只有通过牺牲自己和撕裂织网才能完成这一壮举。卡萨斯当场被杀，此后的一段时间里，世界上的大多数生物要么没有魔法，要么根本无法控制它。",
	"Without great magic to keep them aloft, the remaining flying cities of Netheril crashed to the ground, and many arcanists who survived were driven mad. Once magic came back into use, Netherese arcanists could no longer cast their mightiest spells as they had before, forcing them to resort to traditional wizardry. Four hundred years after Karsus cast his spell, the Netherese empire was no more—crushed by its enemies and undone by its own hubris.": "没有伟大的魔法来维持它们的飞行，尼瑟尔剩下的飞行城市坠落到地面，许多幸存的奥术师被逼疯了。一旦魔法重新开始使用，尼瑟尔的奥术师就不能再像以前那样施展他们最强大的法术，迫使他们求助于传统的巫术。在Karsus施法的四百年后，尼瑟斯帝国不再存在--被它的敌人击溃，被它自己的狂妄所毁灭。",
	"In the Forgotten Realms, Netheril is the definitive lost empire. It rose to unparalleled heights but eventually fell into ruin. If you've ever played a science fiction game that includes the concept of a lost, highly advanced civilization, then you can begin to imagine what ancient Netheril must have been like. Out of this empire came many of the fearsome monsters, bizarre dungeons, and wondrous magic items found in Faerûn today.": "在《被遗忘的领域》中，尼瑟尔是一个绝对的失落帝国。它上升到了无与伦比的高度，但最终却落入了废墟。如果你曾经玩过一个科幻游戏，其中包括一个失落的、高度先进的文明的概念，那么你就可以开始想象古代尼瑟尔一定是什么样子。从这个帝国中诞生了许多今天在Faerûn发现的可怕的怪物、怪异的地牢和奇妙的魔法物品。",

If the target exists on the same plane of existence as the orb, the character touching the orb experiences a vivid vision of the target's location and knows how far away it is and in what direction. Such insight, however, comes with a risk: a creature that receives a vision must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) piercing damage as one of its eyes is magically plucked from its socket and teleported inside the orb (see \"{@book Injuries|DMG|9|Injuries}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for rules on losing an eye).": "放置球体的石基上刻有德拉戈尼语的说明：\"问吧，我们会找到的。\" 要使用这个球体，必须将自己的手放在它上面，并说出一个物体或人的名字。如果目标与球体存在于同一平面，触摸球体的人物就会体验到目标位置的生动视觉，知道它有多远，在什么方向。然而，这样的洞察力是有风险的：接收到视觉的生物必须进行DC20宪法救赎。如果救赎失败，该生物会受到10（（%0%））的穿刺伤害，因为它的一只眼睛会被神奇地从眼窝里挖出来，并被传送到球体内部（关于失去一只眼睛的规则，请参见（%2%）中的\"（%1%）\"）。",

Months before Ythryn's fall, a circle of mages known as the Telepathic Pentacle tried to fuse their minds together to become a conjoined telepathic force. The procedure went terribly wrong, and their bodies and minds melded into a single monstrosity. Iriolarthas imprisoned the thing in this empty well so that its latent telepathic powers could be tapped by the city's elite.

	"If the characters are having trouble solving a puzzle in Ythryn, such as how to deactivate the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, you can use Vellynne or {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} to help them. Both NPCs are highly intelligent and can help the characters arrive at a solution. You, as the DM, can use them to keep the adventure from grinding to a halt.": "如果人物在解决Ythryn的难题时遇到困难，比如如何解除Iriolarthas尖塔周围的力场，你可以使用Vellynne或（%0%）来帮助他们。这两个NPC都有很高的智能，可以帮助角色达成解决方案。你，作为管理人，可以利用他们来防止冒险陷入停顿。",
	"Both Vellynne and {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} will do almost anything to obtain Iriolarthas's spellbook, and they are only slightly less determined when it comes time to choose who gets Iriolarthas's {@item staff of power}, the {@item scroll of the comet|IDRotF}, and the {@item scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF}.": "薇琳和（%0%）几乎都会不惜一切代价来获得伊里奥拉塔斯的法术书，而在选择谁得到伊里奥拉塔斯的（%1%）、（%2%）和（%3%）时，他们的决心才稍显不足。",
	"If the characters helped {@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}'s simulacrum become a real person in chapter 2 (see \"{@area Lost Spire of Netheril|3a8|x}\"), he might be present as well. Without a full complement of spells, {@creature Dzaan|IDRotF} isn't nearly as helpful as Vellynne nor as dangerous as {@creature Avarice|IDRotF}, but he's just as greedy and self-serving. Roleplay him accordingly.": "如果人物在第二章帮助{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}的模拟人成为一个真正的人（见\"{@area Lost Spire of Netheril|3a8|x}\"），他也可能会出现。由于没有完整的法术，{@creature Dzaan|IDRotF}既不像薇琳那样有帮助，也不像{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}那样危险，但他也同样贪婪和自利。据此来扮演他的角色。",
	"{@creature Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF} can use her {@spell comprehend languages} spell to translate passages of Draconic script found throughout the necropolis, and her {@spell Leomund's tiny hut} spell conjures an excellent refuge against the extreme cold.

	"From her refuge, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} divides her expedition into four hunting parties of five cult fanatics each, and sends them off to explore the ruins, using her raven familiar and the gargoyles as aerial scouts. The party can meet {@creature Avarice|IDRotF}'s minions anywhere in the necropolis (including inside the spire if the force field surrounding it is deactivated or suppressed). They have orders to attack the characters on sight.": "在她的避难所里，{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}把她的探险队分成四个狩猎队，每个队有五个邪教狂热者，并派他们去探索废墟，用她熟悉的乌鸦和巨妖作为空中侦察兵。队伍可以在废墟的任何地方遇到{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}的爪牙（包括在尖塔内，如果周围的力场被停用或压制）。他们有命令，一看到人物就会攻击他们。",

	"If she becomes aware of Vellynne's presence in Ythryn, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} uses her raven familiar to deliver a written invitation to her rival, asking Vellynne to join her inside her floating lair. Vellynne accepts the invitation unless the characters strongly discourage her from doing so. There, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} coldly lays down her terms: abandon the necropolis within the hour. Conflict between members of the Arcane Brotherhood is forbidden, but {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} makes it clear she is willing to ignore the rules if nobody lives to find out.

	"{@creature Avarice|IDRotF} is smart enough to ally with the characters if doing so might help her conquer Ythryn, but she won't join forces as long as {@creature Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF} is with them—she demands that they cast out her hated rival. If the characters oblige and banish Vellynne from their ranks, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} reciprocates by sharing {@dice 1d4} pieces of Ythryn lore she has learned (determine each piece by rolling on the {@area Ythryn Lore table|62f|x}).": "{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}很聪明，如果这样做可以帮助她征服Ythryn的话，她会和这些角色结盟，但只要{@creature Vellynne Harpell|IDRotF}和他们在一起，她就不会加入，她要求他们赶走她讨厌的对手。如果角色们答应了，并将薇琳驱逐出他们的队伍，{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}就会以分享她所学到的{@dice 1d4}Ythryn的传说作为回报（通过滚动{@area Ythryn Lore table|62f|x}来确定每一条）。",
	"Unlike Vellynne, who accompanies the characters, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} prefers to remain in her glass chamber atop Skydock Spire and stay in touch with the characters remotely by using her {@spell Rary's telepathic bond} spell. Once the characters find all the inscriptions they need to bypass the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas, {@creature Avarice|IDRotF} emerges from her base and accompanies them into the tower, eager to claim the treasures inside.": "与陪伴角色的维琳不同，{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}更喜欢呆在她位于斯凯多克尖塔顶的玻璃房里，通过使用她的{@spell Rary's telepathic bond}法术与角色保持远程联系。当人物找到他们需要的所有铭文以绕过伊瑞奥拉塔周围的力场时，{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}从她的基地出来，陪同他们进入塔内，急于索取里面的财宝。",
	"The Frostmaiden likes to preserve beauty by freezing it. If the characters failed to defeat Auril in {@adventure chapter 5|IDRotF|15}, she takes umbrage with anyone who unseals and plunders the necropolis of Ythryn.

After sending her skeletons, golems, and wolves into the city in small groups to kill interlopers on sight, Auril shuts down the force field around the Spire of Iriolarthas by sheer force of her divine will and watches over the city from its high balcony ({@area area Y19p|6a8|x}). The force field remains deactivated until the last of Auril's forms is destroyed or until she leaves the spire.": "当冰霜女郎到达Ythryn时，整个亡灵城的温度下降了几度。奥里尔有三个（%0%）（见（%1%））、六个（%2%）（见（%3%）和一群（%4%）加入。） 在派遣她的骷髅、地精和狼群进入城市，当场杀死闯入者后，欧里尔以她的神力关闭了伊瑞奥拉塔斯尖塔周围的力场，并在高高的阳台上监视着这座城市（{@area area Y19p|6a8|x}）。力场一直处于关闭状态，直到奥里尔的最后一个形态被摧毁或她离开尖塔为止。",
	"Any of {@creature Avarice|IDRotF}'s minions still patrolling the city are swiftly captured and dragged before the Frostmaiden. Auril murders each captive in turn and transforms the cultist into a {@creature coldlight walker|IDRotF} (see {@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}). These undead horrors venture out into the necropolis to hunt down the living.": "任何仍在城市中巡逻的{@creature Avarice|IDRotF}的爪牙都会被迅速捕获并被拖到冰霜女巫面前。奥里尔依次杀害了每个俘虏，并将崇拜者转化为{@creature coldlight walker|IDRotF}（见{@adventure appendix C|IDRotF|21}）。这些不死的恐怖之物冒险进入亡灵之城，追杀活人。",
	"If the characters defeat most of Auril's minions, the god's cool voice echoes across the city from the high balcony of the Spire of Iriolarthas, demanding that they leave Ythryn or face her wrath. One hour after making this announcement, Auril leaves the tower and prowls through the streets in search of the characters. For every hour that passes, there is a {@chance 20|20 percent} chance that she catches up with them. Only characters who flee the city and return to Icewind Dale are spared her wrath.": "如果角色们打败了奥里尔的大部分爪牙，那么神的冷酷声音就会从伊里奥拉塔的高台上回荡在整个城市，要求他们离开Ythryn或者面对她的愤怒。在宣布这一消息的一个小时后，奥里尔离开了塔楼，在街上游荡，寻找那些人物。每过一个小时，她就有（%0%）的机会追上他们。只有那些逃离城市并回到冰风谷的角色才能免遭她的愤怒。",
	"Characters who find the {@item scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF} in the Spire of Iriolarthas might be sorely tempted to use it. {@item Professor Skant|IDRotF}, an expert on the tarrasque, warns the characters about the uncontrollable nature of the monster and the danger it represents, but the {@i professor orb} also confesses that it would love to observe the tarrasque firsthand.": "在Iriolarthas的尖塔中发现{@item scroll of tarrasque summoning|IDRotF}的角色可能会很想使用它。{@item Professor Skant|IDRotF}是研究塔拉斯克的专家，他警告角色们这种怪物的不可控性和它所代表的危险性，但{@i professor orb}也承认它很想亲身观察塔拉斯克。",
	"If summoned in Ythryn, the {@creature tarrasque} destroys everything in sight before smashing its way through the Caves of Hunger and continuing its rampage across Icewind Dale, inevitably putting Ten-Towns in peril. The mountains to the south, the sea to the north and west, and the towering glacier to the east contain the tarrasque for a while. The extreme cold also makes the creature lethargic. It might take months, but the hungry tarrasque eventually makes its way southward through the mountain pass, imperiling the rest of the Sword Coast, if nothing is done to curtail its rampage.": "如果在Ythryn被召唤出来，{@creature tarrasque}会摧毁眼前的一切，然后砸开饥饿洞穴，继续在冰风谷横冲直撞，不可避免地将十镇置于危险之中。南边的山，北边和西边的海，以及东边高耸的冰川，都能暂时遏制住塔拉斯克。极端的寒冷也使这种生物昏昏欲睡。这可能需要几个月的时间，但饥饿的龙卷风最终会通过山口向南移动，如果不采取任何措施来遏制它的横行，就会危及剑海岸的其他地区。",
	"If summoned on Auril's island, the tarrasque is trapped there by the deep, churning Sea of Moving Ice. The behemoth lays waste to Grimskalle and everything else on the island before sinking into a deep hibernation. Auril, if she survives, is forced to abandon her island lair and find a new refuge.": "如果在奥里尔的岛上被召唤出来，塔拉斯克就会被深不见底的移动冰海困在那里。这只巨兽在沉入深度休眠之前，对格里姆斯卡勒和岛上的其他事物造成了浪费。奥里尔，如果她能活下来，就不得不放弃她的岛穴，寻找一个新的避难所。",
	"Depending on the characters' actions and the whims of the dice gods, this adventure has several possible endings. Likely conclusions are discussed below, though others are certainly possible.": "根据人物的行动和骰子之神的旨意，这次冒险有几种可能的结局。下面讨论的是可能的结论，当然也有其他的可能。",
	"Allow time at the end of the adventure for players to reveal any character secrets that have not come to light. Some players will want to keep their characters' secrets buried. For the others, work with them to figure out the best way for the characters' secrets to bear fruit. For example, a character who has the Ring Hunter secret might still be searching for the signet ring that secures their inheritance; perhaps the ring is discovered during a celebratory dinner in Ten-Towns, when the character cuts open their pan-fried knucklehead trout and the ring unceremoniously spills out!": "在冒险结束时，留出时间让玩家揭示任何尚未曝光的角色秘密。有些玩家会想把他们角色的秘密埋藏起来。对于其他玩家，请与他们一起想出让角色的秘密开花结果的最佳方法。例如，一个拥有 \"猎戒者 \"秘密的角色可能仍在寻找确保其继承权的标志戒指；也许戒指是在十镇的庆祝晚宴上被发现的，当这个角色切开他们煎的节瓜鱼时，戒指毫不客气地溢了出来",
	"Slaying Auril or her roc prevents the Frostmaiden from casting her nightly spell, ending her everlasting winter. The characters can also counteract the Frostmaiden's everlasting winter by using the {@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF} to effect a change in the weather, though any such attempt inevitably leads to a confrontation with Auril and her faithful. Only by slaying Auril can the characters deprive her followers of their god-granted spells and their will to fight.": "杀死奥里尔或她的大鹏，可以阻止冰霜女巫施展她的夜间法术，结束她的永生之冬。角色也可以通过使用{@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}来改变天气，从而对抗冰霜女巫的永生之冬，不过任何这样的尝试都不可避免地会导致与奥里尔和她的信徒们的对抗。只有杀死奥里尔，人物才能剥夺她的追随者的神赐法术和战斗意志。",
	"With the Frostmaiden's defeat, normal seasonal weather returns to Icewind Dale. The sun again rises above the horizon, and as temperatures improve, flora and fauna begin to recover. Depending on how they fared against the chardalyn dragon in {@adventure chapter 4|IDRotF|14}, the people of Ten-Towns can look forward to warmer times once more.": "随着冰封女巫的失败，冰风谷恢复了正常的季节性天气。太阳再次从地平线上升起，随着气温的提高，动植物开始复苏。根据他们在{@adventure chapter 4|IDRotF|14}中对chardalyn龙的表现，十镇的人们可以再次期待温暖的时光。",
	"Auril's death is temporary, for a god who has mortal worshipers can't truly die. When the Frostmaiden is resurrected on the next winter solstice, she has all her divine power. But her inclination is to retreat from the world and not allow herself to be imperiled by mortals once more. The characters won't have to deal with her again in their lifetimes unless they continue meddling in her followers' affairs.": "奥里尔的死亡是暂时的，因为一个拥有凡人崇拜者的神不可能真正死亡。当冰霜少女在下一个冬至复活时，她拥有所有的神力。但她倾向于从这个世界上撤退，不允许自己再一次受到凡人的威胁。除非他们继续插手她的追随者的事务，否则人物在他们的一生中不会再与她打交道。",
	"The characters can help Ten-Towners rebuild their settlements in the wake of the chardalyn dragon's rampage and the floods. If the dragon has not yet been defeated, finding and destroying it should be a priority. Until its master sends it on another rampage, it lurks inside the forge where it was created (see {@adventure chapter 3|IDRotF|13}).": "角色们可以帮助天镇人在查尔达林龙的肆虐和洪水之后重建他们的定居点。如果龙还没有被打败，找到并消灭它应该是首要任务。在它的主人再次派它去肆虐之前，它潜伏在创造它的锻造厂内（见（%0%））。",
	"Characters who help rebuild Ten-Towns might be asked to take up the mantle of speaker in one or more communities, replacing leaders who were killed during the adventure. If he survived, Speaker Naerth Maxildanarr of Targos opposes the characters' political ascendance, since they represent a threat to Zhentarim control of the region; without a power base of his own, however, Naerth can do little to stop them.": "帮助重建十镇的角色可能会被要求担任一个或多个社区的议长，取代在冒险过程中被杀害的领导人。如果他幸存下来，塔戈斯的议长纳尔斯-马克西达纳尔（Naerth Maxildanarr）会反对这些角色的政治地位，因为他们代表着对赞塔林对该地区控制的威胁；然而，由于没有自己的权力基础，纳尔斯几乎无法阻止他们。",
	"If the characters don't stop Auril, her everlasting winter becomes unendurable to most of Icewind Dale's inhabitants. The hostile climate and the scarcity of food force indigenous creatures to migrate southward or die. As go the {@creature reindeer|IDRotF}, so go the Reghed tribesfolk. In time, even the lakes freeze solid, depriving Ten-Towners of the knucklehead trout upon which their survival depends. Within a year or two, Icewind Dale becomes a gods-forsaken wasteland as cold as Stygia. The bitter cold allows Levistus to open portals between Icewind Dale and the sixth layer of the Nine Hells, from which come forth ice devils under the archdevil's command. Knights of the Black Sword who survive to see these events come to pass try to maintain a foothold in the region, though they are opposed by duergar at every turn.": "如果角色们不阻止欧瑞尔，她的永恒的冬天对冰风谷的大多数居民来说就变得难以忍受了。恶劣的气候和匮乏的食物迫使本地生物向南迁移，否则就会死亡。随着{@creature reindeer|IDRotF}的消失，雷格德部落的居民也随之消失。久而久之，连湖泊都结成了冰，使Ten-Towners失去了他们赖以生存的节节高的鳟鱼。在一两年内，冰风谷变成了一片被神抛弃的荒地，就像斯蒂吉亚一样寒冷。严寒让莱维斯托斯在冰风谷和九层地狱的第六层之间打开了传送门，在大恶魔的指挥下，冰魔从那里走出来。活着看到这些事件发生的黑剑骑士们试图在这个地区保持一个立足点，尽管他们处处受到杜尔加的反对。",
	"The ice devils help clear the way for the duergar, who aren't going anywhere unless the characters kill {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF} and put an end to his line. Once Ten-Towns is no longer a threat to his supremacy, Xardorok does his utmost to conquer the rest of Icewind Dale. If left unchecked, the duergar become a controlling power in the region. The ice devils, once subservient to Levistus, are dragooned by Asmodeus into helping the duergar turn the Far North into a vassal kingdom secretly under the sway of the Nine Hells.": "冰魔为杜尔加扫清了道路，除非人物杀死（%0%）并结束他的路线，否则杜尔加是不会走的。一旦Ten-Towns不再对他的霸主地位构成威胁，Xardorok就会竭尽全力征服冰风谷的其他地区。如果不加控制，杜尔加人将成为该地区的控制力量。曾经臣服于莱维斯特的冰魔们被阿斯莫德拉拢，帮助二人组将极北之地变成一个秘密地受九幽地狱支配的附庸国度。",
	"If the characters use Iriolarthas's {@item staff of power} to activate the obelisk in Ythryn, they inadvertently reset the world to a time predating the fall of Ythryn and the end of Netheril.

	"Necalli, a {@creature couatl} shapechanged into the form of an aarakocra, doesn't remember why it was bound to the obelisk or by whom. It knows only that it is free of its obligation to the obelisk's builders.

	"Ythryn is now a floating, living city under the rule of the {@creature lich} Iriolarthas and his apprentices, the Wizards of the Arcane Star (eight evil {@creature Archmage||archmages}). Almost every other inhabitant of the city is either a Netherese {@creature mage} or a green-skinned magen (described in appendix C).

In exchange for their information, Iriolarthas gives the characters a skycoach to expedite their departure from the city. Characters who flee rather than allow themselves to be detained can commandeer a skycoach and plot a course away from the city. A skycoach has the statistics of an {@item airship} (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), but its magic wanes quickly unless it's recharged using magic foreign to the characters. Soon, the skycoach struggles to remain aloft, forcing the characters to set down and salvage what they can from the vessel.": "方尖碑消失了，从历史中抹去了，留下了这些人物被困在这里。他们现在被困在-343 DR。如果角色们警告Iriolarthas等待Ythryn的命运，并讲述了导致它倒下的情况，那么巫师会采取措施确保历史不会重演，包括但不限于让Ostorian遗物远离{@item Ythryn mythallar|IDRotF}。作为对他们信息的交换，Iriolarthas给了这些角色一辆空中客车，以加快他们离开城市的速度。逃离而不是让自己被扣留的角色可以征用一辆空中客车，并制定一个远离城市的路线。空中客车拥有{@item airship}的统计数据（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}），但它的魔力很快就会减弱，除非使用对角色来说陌生的魔法来充能。很快，空中客车就难以保持在高空，迫使角色们坐下来，从船上打捞出他们能打捞的东西。",
	"To put it mildly, the characters have a whole new world to explore. Ten-Towns doesn't exist in this timeline, nor do most of the cities along the Sword Coast that characters might recognize. Many tribes of Reghed nomads prowl Icewind Dale, while Uthgardt tribes descended from Netherese claim vast tracts of untamed land south of the Spine of the World, kept in check by marauding monsters. The Empire of Netheril controls the lush, temperate lands doomed to become the desert of Anauroch. The town of Illusk (still centuries away from becoming Luskan) surrounds the brooding Hosttower of the Arcane. Characters hoping to visit some past version of Waterdeep or Neverwinter find nothing but unsettled land surrounded by the remnants of the elven kingdom of Illefarn. Humans won't begin farming the plateau above Deepwater Harbor (the future site of Waterdeep) or building the settlement of Eigersstor (later renamed Neverwinter) for another three centuries.": "说白了，人物有一个全新的世界需要探索。在这条时间线中，十镇并不存在，角色们可能认识的剑海岸上的大多数城市也不存在。许多Reghed游牧部落在冰风谷游荡，而Netherese后裔的Uthgardt部落在世界之脊以南拥有大片未被驯服的土地，被掠夺的怪物所控制。尼瑟尔帝国控制着郁郁葱葱的温带土地，注定要成为阿诺罗奇的沙漠。伊鲁斯克（Illusk）镇（距离成为卢斯坎（Luskan）还有几个世纪）围绕着忧郁的奥术师主塔。希望访问某个过去版本的沃特迪普（Waterdeep）或永冬（Neverwinter）的角色，除了被伊尔法恩（Illefarn）精灵王国的残余物所包围的不平静的土地之外，什么都没有。人类要再过三个世纪才会开始在深水港（未来的沃特德普所在地）的高原上耕种，或者建造艾格斯托尔（Eigersstor）的定居点（后来改名为永冬）。",
	"To run a campaign set in this earlier time frame, you will need to delve into earlier products tied to the Forgotten Realms to get the lay of the land circa–343 DR. Of course, once the characters move beyond the strongholds of civilization, the Realms of the past is very much like the Realms of the present—a land of mystery, with old ruins and lost dungeons waiting to be explored. Only now the characters are poised to witness the inevitable fall of Netheril, or find a way to stop it.": "要在这个较早的时间框架内开展活动，你需要深入研究与被遗忘的领域有关的早期产品，以了解公元前343年左右的土地情况。当然，一旦角色超越了文明的堡垒，过去的王国就和现在的王国非常相似--一片神秘的土地，有古老的遗迹和失落的地牢等待着他们去探索。只是现在人物准备见证Netheril不可避免的衰落，或者找到阻止它的方法。",

	"I was brought here from another world by spacefaring mind flayers. The ship in which I was imprisoned crashed in the mountains south of Ten-Towns. After surviving the crash, I nearly froze to death crossing the tundra to reach Ten-Towns. If some friendly trappers hadn't found me, I would have perished. I fear some of my captors also survived the crash and might come looking for me.": "我是从另一个世界被太空中的思想传播者带到这里的。囚禁我的飞船在Ten-Towns南部的山区坠毁了。坠毁后，我在穿越苔原到达十镇时几乎被冻死了。如果不是一些友好的捕猎者发现了我，我就会丧命。我担心我的一些俘虏也在坠机中幸存下来，可能会来找我。",
	"I was raised by yeti. Although I relied on my ferocious guardians for food and warmth and never quite adapted to the cold, I speak Yeti and have advantage on Charisma checks made to influence yeti or improve their attitudes.": "我是由雪人养大的。虽然我依靠我凶猛的监护人提供食物和温暖，但我从来没有完全适应过寒冷，我会说雪人语，在影响雪人或改善他们的态度的魅力检查中具有优势。",

	"I have a lover in Ten-Towns whom I haven't seen in years. At any time outside of combat, I can decide who the lover is by choosing an NPC in Ten-Towns that I can see.

This old flame is friendly and helpful toward me, even if our past is checkered.": "我在Ten-Towns有一个多年未见的恋人。在战斗之外的任何时候，我都可以通过选择一个我可以看到的十镇的NPC来决定谁是我的爱人。一旦我做出这个选择，我就无法改变它。这个旧情人对我很友好，也很有帮助，即使我们的过去有问题。",
	"I saved the life of an orc, who gave me a {@item Orc Stone|IDRotF|stone} with the symbol of the Many-Arrows tribe (a humanoid skull pierced by three arrows) carved into it. The stone is an uncommon magic item that requires attunement, and only I can attune to it.": "我救了一个兽人的命，他给了我一块刻有多箭部落标志的（%0%）（一个被三支箭穿透的人形头骨）。这块石头是一种不常见的魔法物品，需要调和，而只有我可以调和它。",
	"As an action, I can use the stone to summon the spirit of an orc warrior, which appears within 30 feet of me.

	"I served aboard {@i Dark Duchess}, a pirate ship from the city of Luskan. After the vessel got stuck in the ice, everyone but the captain abandoned the vessel and fled to Ten-Towns.

The ship and its treasure are still out there.": "我曾在{@i Dark Duchess}，一艘来自卢斯坎城的海盗船上服务。船只被困在冰里后，除了船长外，其他人都弃船逃往十镇。我们一路上在暴风雪中迷失了方向。我是唯一活下来的人，而且是靠吃我的同伴才活下来的。那艘船和它的财宝还在外面。",
	"I am the offspring of {@creature Bjornhild Solvigsdottir|IDRotF|Queen Bjornhild Solvigsdottir}, leader of the Tiger Tribe. My mother cast me into the Sea of Moving Ice when I was a young child as a sacrifice to Auril the Frostmaiden. A polar bear pulled me from the water and spared me a freezing death.

I owe her my life, just as I owe my mother a merciless death.": "我是老虎部落首领（%0%）的后代。当我还是个孩子的时候，我的母亲把我扔进了移动的冰海，作为献给冰霜女巫奥里尔的祭品。一只北极熊把我从水中拉出来，使我免于冻死。这只熊后来变成了一只巨熊，它把我安全地带到了十镇。我记得那个巨人的名字--奥亚米纳托克，但此后就再也没见过她。我欠她一条命，就像我欠我母亲一个无情的死亡。",

Both have threatened Ten-Towns in the past.": "我是哈珀人的间谍，这是一个秘密组织，在幕后挫败暴君和其他邪恶分子。我在冰风谷的任务是保护十镇的定居点，同时隐瞒我的哈珀人的关系。对十镇的可靠威胁包括奥术兄弟会，一个以卢斯坎为基地的巫师组织，以及Zhentarim，一个想要控制整个北方贸易的庞大的影子网络。两者在过去都曾威胁过十镇。",

	"The Arcane Brotherhood is a cabal of powerful wizards that operates out of the Hosttower of the Arcane, a multi-spired structure that towers above Luskan (a city south of Icewind Dale on the Sword Coast). The brotherhood's leadership consists of five renowned archmages who handpick the other members, favoring wizards of great accomplishment. Every year, scores of wizards from across Faerûn flock to the Hosttower of the Arcane, hoping to gain admittance into the prestigious ranks of the brotherhood. Nearly all candidates are dismissed out of hand, without so much as a test, feeding rumors that the brotherhood's leaders are more interested in marketing their own brand of exclusivity than finding new talent. Yet wizards seem willing to debase themselves regardless, for admittance to the brotherhood grants access to the Hosttower's incredible libraries of magical lore.": "奥术师兄弟会是一个由强大的巫师组成的阴谋集团，在奥术师的主塔中运作，主塔是一个耸立在卢斯坎（剑海岸冰风谷南部的一个城市）之上的多重风格的建筑。兄弟会的领导层由五位著名的大法师组成，他们亲自挑选其他成员，偏爱有巨大成就的巫师。每年，来自法鲁恩各地的数十名巫师都会涌向奥术之塔，希望能进入兄弟会的著名行列。几乎所有的候选人都被直接开除了，甚至连测试都没有，这就助长了一些谣言，说兄弟会的领导人对推销他们自己的独家品牌比寻找新人才更感兴趣。然而，无论如何，巫师们似乎都愿意贬低自己，因为加入兄弟会就可以进入Hosttower不可思议的魔法传说图书馆。",
	"The truth behind the brotherhood's ongoing quest for new members is based on the adage, \"Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.\" The brotherhood's leaders seek out wizards who might by their exploits compete with the brotherhood's acquisition and hoarding of arcane lore and magical secrets. By bringing these wizards into the fold, the brotherhood turns potential enemies into colleagues, in effect neutralizing future threats.": "兄弟会不断寻求新成员背后的真相是基于一句格言：\"让你的朋友靠近，让你的敌人靠近\"。兄弟会的领导人寻找那些可能通过他们的探索与兄弟会获取和囤积奥秘传说和魔法秘密相竞争的巫师。通过拉拢这些巫师，兄弟会将潜在的敌人变成了同事，实际上是消除了未来的威胁。",
	"Once welcomed into the brotherhood, wizards are free to pursue their own interests so long as they place the security and sanctity of the Hosttower and the cabal above all else. When not rallying to defend their home, wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood act like friendly and unfriendly rivals to one another, striving to outdo their peers in magic. Open conflict between members is forbidden, yet members are adroit at finding underhanded ways to needle and sabotage one another.": "一旦被欢迎加入兄弟会，巫师们就可以自由地追求自己的利益，只要他们把主塔和阴谋集团的安全和神圣性放在第一位。在不团结起来保卫家园的时候，奥术兄弟会的巫师们就像彼此之间的友好和不友好的对手一样，努力在魔法方面超过他们的同行。成员之间的公开冲突是被禁止的，但成员们却善于找到暗中的方法来针锋相对，互相破坏。",

As a result, few goliaths live to see old age.": "歌利亚人喜欢竞争和记分，计算他们的事迹，统计他们的成就，与其他人的成就相比较。歌利亚人喜欢赢，但他们把失败看作是提高技能的一种激励。最重要的是，每个巨人都被驱使着去超越他们过去的表现，承担越来越大的风险。因此，很少有巨头能活到老。",
