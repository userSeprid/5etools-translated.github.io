	"A fallen clock tower holds components from an ancient artifact. Upon discovery of the components, competing agents look to launch expeditions to uncover additional components scattered across distant places—and times. The now-lost Temple of Moloch and the construction site of the legendary {@adventure Tomb of Horrors|TftYP} are two of those locations. However great the risks, finding the components demands the effort, for whoever does so can reassemble the fabled {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!}": "一座倒下的钟楼里有一个古代艺术品的部件。在发现这些部件后，相互竞争的特工们希望发起探险，以发现散落在遥远的地方和时间的其他部件。现在已经消失的摩洛神庙和传说中的{@adventure Tomb of Horrors|TftYP}的建筑工地就是其中的两个地点。无论风险有多大，找到这些组件都需要付出努力，因为谁找到了，谁就能重新组装传说中的{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!}。",

	"Eons ago, a planar craft of unknown origin crashed within the Barrier Peaks. The scholar Kwalish would later find this craft, converting it into his laboratory and studying its technology to fuel his own experiments. However, Kwalish was not the first explorer to do so.": "几百年前，一个来历不明的平面飞行器坠落在壁垒山峰内。学者Kwalish后来发现了这个飞船，将其改造成自己的实验室，研究其技术，为自己的实验提供动力。然而，夸里什并不是第一个这样做的探险家。",
	"Earlier expeditions also chanced upon the crash site, and although most parties perished while delving through the craft, a few managed to recover rare objects never conceived by even the greatest minds of this world. Many of these objects were subsequently lost over time—and most resulted in the deaths of their owners along the way. But a few persisted, controlled by those able to glean some partial understanding of their operation.": "早期的探险队也偶然发现了坠机地点，虽然大多数探险队在钻研飞船时丧生，但也有少数人设法找到了这个世界上最伟大的思想家都没有想到的稀有物品。这些物品中的许多后来随着时间的推移而丢失，大多数导致其主人在途中死亡。但也有少数人坚持了下来，被那些能够对其运作有部分了解的人所控制。",
	"Among the most important of these relics was the planar craft's central command console, used to guide its flight through space and time. Legend of this object grew as it fell into the hands of a warlord and came to be known as a most powerful artifact: the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} (so named after its last owner). Yet with the defeat of Baron Lum, his {@i Infernal Machine} was said to have been destroyed as well.": "这些遗物中最重要的是平面飞行器的中央指挥台，用来指导它在空间和时间中的飞行。当这个东西落入一个军阀手中时，它的传说越来越多，被称为最强大的神器：{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}（以其最后的主人命名）。然而，随着卢姆男爵的失败，他的{@i Infernal Machine}据说也被摧毁了。",
	"Currently, the archdevils Zariel and Bel both have designs on rebuilding Lum's infernal machine. Zariel is the present master of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Bel is the deposed former master of that layer. But to rebuild the infernal machine, both devils require a number of missing components—former control buttons vital to the machine's operation. Zariel and Bel have both planted agents in the world, tasking those agents with finding adventurers to track down and claim these components. Once the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} is complete, whichever devil controls it plans to use the machine to claim final dominion over Avernus.": "目前，大恶魔扎里尔和贝尔都有重建卢姆的地狱机器的打算。扎里尔是九层地狱的第一层阿弗纳斯的现任主人。贝尔是被废黜的该层的前主人。但要重建无间道机器，两个魔鬼都需要一些缺失的部件--对机器的运作至关重要的前控制按钮。扎里尔和贝尔都在这个世界上安插了代理人，让这些代理人负责寻找冒险者来追踪和索取这些部件。一旦{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}完成，无论哪个魔鬼控制它，都计划利用机器对Avernus进行最终统治。",
	"While journeying through fey woods, the characters must choose whether to help a trio of (supposed) dryads or a unicorn, with each faction blaming the other for the woods' corruption. Either way, the characters come across a fallen clock tower containing a strange set of magical components, which appear to manipulate time within a localized area.": "在穿越精灵森林的过程中，角色们必须选择是帮助三只（假定的）干尸还是一只独角兽，每个派别都将森林的腐败归罪于对方。无论怎样，人物都会遇到一座倒下的钟楼，里面有一套奇怪的魔法组件，似乎可以在局部区域内操纵时间。",
	"Discovery of these components leads to an invitation to meet one of two agents: {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} or {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}. Both are in competition with each another to collect all such missing components, in order to reassemble the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}. Each agent pledges to use the {@i Infernal Machine} against devilish forces plaguing the world—but each secretly plans to give it to their own patron archdevil. Both ask for the characters' help, looking to hire them to undertake expeditions to retrieve the missing components. ": "发现这些成分，就会被邀请去见两个代理人中的一个。{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}或{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}。两人都在互相竞争，收集所有这些缺失的部件，以便重新组装（%2%）。每位特工都承诺用（%%3%）来对付困扰世界的恶魔势力--但每个人都暗中计划把它交给自己的守护神大恶魔。两人都请求人物的帮助，希望雇佣他们进行远征，找回丢失的部件。",
	"Once the characters are involved, they are provided the resources to travel to two legendary locations of the past to recover the {@i Infernal Machine} components believed to be there. First is the Tomb of Horrors, in the period while the infamous dungeon is still under construction. There, they meet the tomb's architect, {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, who oversees the site with an iron hand. The second location is the Temple of Moloch in the same era. The temple is run by {@creature Moghadam|IMR}'s chief rival, {@creature Thessalar|IMR}—the inventor of the thessalhydra and many other grotesque monsters, including the owlbear.": "一旦人物参与进来，他们就会得到资源，前往过去的两个传说中的地点，恢复据信在那里的（%0%）组件。首先是恐怖之墓，在这个臭名昭著的地宫还在建设中的时期。在那里，他们遇到了古墓的建筑师，(1%)，他以铁的手腕监督着这个地方。第二个地点是同一时代的摩洛神庙。这座寺庙由{@creature Moghadam|IMR}的主要对手{@creature Thessalar|IMR}经营，他是thessalhydra和许多其他怪异怪物的发明者，包括猫头鹰熊。",
	"The characters must navigate the perils of both locations, manipulate time, and manage untrustworthy agents to return with as many of the missing components as they can. And even then, they must contend with the agents who hired them, and ensure that a completed {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} does not fall into the wrong hands!": "角色们必须在两地的危险中穿梭，操纵时间，管理不值得信任的特工，尽可能多地带着失踪的部件回来。即使如此，他们还必须与雇用他们的特工抗争，并确保已完成的{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}不会落入坏人手中!",
	"This adventure explores two locations of the distant past, and as such, features artifacts and figures from the deepest history of D&D.": "这场冒险探索了遥远的过去的两个地点，因此，以D&D最深的历史中的文物和人物为特色。",
	"The demilich Acererak and his tomb are familiar from 1978's original Tomb of Horrors and 2017's Tomb of Annihilation. But this adventure also features {@creature Tarnhem|IMR}, Acererak's balor father, and {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, the tomb's architect, both of whom first appeared in the era of 1998's Return to the Tomb of Horrors.": "在1978年的《恐怖之墓》和2017年的《毁灭之墓》中，人们对Demilich Acererak和他的古墓非常熟悉。但这次冒险中还有阿克拉克的巴洛尔父亲{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}和坟墓的建筑师{@creature Moghadam|IMR}，他们都是在1998年的《重返恐怖之墓》时代首次出现。",
	"The Temple of Moloch derives from the sample dungeon map appearing in the first edition Dungeon Masters Guide of 1979, and includes the famed statue of Moloch featured on the cover of the first edition Players Handbook from 1978.

	"As for the centerpiece of the adventure, the artifact known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad first appeared as the Machine of Lum the Mad back in 1976, in original D&D's Supplement III: Eldritch Wizardry. But of course, you are free to modify or swap out any of these elements of D&D canon with artifacts and NPCs more relevant to more recent official storylines, or for better resonance with your own home campaign.": "至于冒险的核心部分，被称为 \"疯狂的卢姆的地狱机器 \"的神器最早出现在1976年的《D&D》原版附录三：\"邪恶的巫术 \"中。当然，你可以自由地修改或替换这些D&D经典的任何元素，使之与最近的官方故事情节更相关，或者与你自己的家庭活动产生更好的共鸣。",

	"As a continuation of {@i Lost Laboratory of Kwalish}, you can use the legendary inventor as a replacement for this adventure's agents, {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}. Kwalish has long researched legends about the missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine} scattered across the world. Reaching out to the characters, he tasks them with recovering the missing components, with {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} serving as rivals along the way.

	"Whichever hook you choose, the adventure begins while the characters are traveling through a remote fey wood. If {@i Infernal Machine Rebuild} is played in combination with {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this could be part of the thick band of woods surrounding the pass leading into the Barrier Peaks, known to be infused with the power of the Feywild. The High Forest in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, the Svalich Woods in Barovia, or Xen'drik in Eberron also make excellent starting points.": "无论你选择哪种钩子，冒险都是在人物穿越一个遥远的费伊森林时开始的。如果{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}与{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}结合使用，这可能是通往屏障山峰的山口周围茂密树林的一部分，众所周知，它被注入了精灵的力量。被遗忘的领域》战役设定中的高森林，巴罗维亚的斯瓦里奇森林，或者《艾伯伦》中的Xen'drik也是很好的起点。",

Before the characters depart, she asks them to once more use the panel at the clock tower bridge, adjusting time back toward the past. Combined with her own magical influence, this allows the unicorn to separate the myconids from the trees, returning the woods to their former condition.": "如果角色们打败了女巫，班瑞恩就会重出江湖，并将其他邪恶的精灵赶出森林。在人物离开之前，她要求他们再一次使用钟楼桥的面板，将时间调整到过去。再加上她自己的魔法影响，这使得独角兽能够将菌类从树木中分离出来，使森林恢复到以前的状态。",
	"With the hags defeated, Banrion has no further need for the clock tower panel's magical power.

	"If the characters research the components or the ancient city, a successful DC 18 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill History}) check leads to the discovery that the city was the site from which Lum the Mad seized the great artifact that bears his name—and that the two components were once part of that artifact.": "如果角色研究这些部件或古城，成功通过DC18智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill History}）检查，就会发现这个城市是疯子卢姆夺取以他名字命名的伟大神器的地方，而这两个部件曾经是那个神器的一部分。",
	"Regardless of whether the characters take the missing components, their activity in the woods is eventually noted by spies of the two agents, {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} (introduced in {@adventure chapter 2|IMR|2}).

	"After the characters return from the woods (or at any appropriate time depending on which adventure hooks you've used), the party is sought out by two competing agents. {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} and {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} are both searching for any missing components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}, and their spies have returned with news of the characters' knowledge or possession of the components from the clock tower.

	"When first met, each agent extends the same offer. If the characters have not already determined so on their own, the agent explains that the components they found originated in the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.

	"Presenting herself as a tiefling rogue, {@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR} talks of how she retired as an adventurer to use her assembled fortune and collected antiquities in the service of nobler causes. Chief among those causes is the defeat of the servants of the archdevil Bel. An eccentric dilettante, Lynx has had her thick horns intricately carved and inlaid with sigils and figures in silver, including multiple images of her namesake lynx. She has also lost one eye from old adventuring misfortunes, replacing it with a glass eye of hazy crystal. Several of her teeth have also been replaced with precious stones and metals.": "她以一个盗贼流氓的身份出现，{@creature Lynx Creatlach|IMR}谈到她是如何作为一个冒险家退休的，以利用她收集的财富和收集的古物为更高尚的事业服务。这些事业中最主要的是打败大恶魔贝尔的仆人。猞猁是个古怪的二流子，她的厚厚的角上精雕细琢，镶嵌着银色的符号和数字，包括她同名的猞猁的多个图像。她的一只眼睛也因为以前的冒险不幸而失去了，取而代之的是一只朦胧的水晶玻璃眼。她的几颗牙齿也被换成了珍贵的宝石和金属。",
	"In truth, Lynx is an active agent of Zariel but is no longer among the living. Rather, she's a lawful evil undead tiefling, with her skeleton specially crafted to retain her former skills and intellect, and bonded to an equally special flesh golem that she wears as a costumed skin. (If you are playing through {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}, this setup was one of Mad Maggie's creations while the hag was in Zariel's employ.) Beneath this golem costume, Lynx's bones are carved and silver-scribed in the same manner as her horns. She uses her skull, which is locked and accessed from inside the back of her mouth, as a container for her most private treasures.": "事实上，林克斯是扎里尔的一个活跃的特工，但却不再是活人了。相反，她是一个合法的邪恶的不死铁弗林，她的骨架是专门制作的，以保留她以前的技能和智力，并与一个同样特殊的肉体格姆结合在一起，她把它当作服装的皮肤。(如果你在玩穿越{@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}，这个设置是疯狂的麦琪在受雇于扎里尔时的创作之一。) 在这套魔像服装下，猞猁的骨头被雕刻成与她的角一样的银色。她用她的头骨作为她最私人的宝物的容器，而她的头骨是锁着的，可以从她嘴的后面进入。",
	"Lynx resides in a narrow, multistory house in a fine part of the city. While she claims ownership of the place, she has merely taken over the manor from its current owner. That owner (whose identity is left to your determination) is kept alive and bound within an extradimensional prison, treated as a permanent {@spell Leomund's tiny hut} held inside a permanent {@spell rope trick} spell that can be opened only by Lynx. When the rope from the spell hangs down, it is disguised as a curtain pull in the manor library.": "猞猁住在城市的一个好地方的一个狭窄的多层房子里。虽然她声称拥有这个地方，但她只是从目前的主人那里接管了这个庄园。那个主人（他的身份由你决定）被活生生地束缚在一个异度空间的监狱里，被当作一个永久的（%0%）被关在一个永久的（%1%）的咒语里，只有林克斯可以打开。当咒语的绳子垂下来时，它被伪装成庄园图书馆的窗帘拉环。",

Rather than noting their artists or subjects, however, Lynx describes each painting based on where she stole it from.": "如果人物接受了林克斯的邀请，她就会在她的庄园的长长的走廊上与他们见面，墙上挂满了精美的绘画。然而，林克斯并没有注意到他们的艺术家或主题，而是根据她从哪里偷来的画来描述每一幅画。",

Lynx further states that {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} wants the missing components for his own lost cause of leading a war in the Nine Hells, which would invariably result in the components falling into diabolical hands.": "猞猁说她在寻找缺失的部件，以便完成她的版本（%0%）。她的计划是利用这个强大的神器来对抗在博德之门内工作的大恶魔贝尔的力量。她承认与{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}有竞争关系，她说{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}认为林克斯过去的冒险方式是一种犯罪，现在不断寻求挫败她。猞猁进一步指出，{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}想要丢失的部件，以实现他自己失去的领导九层地狱战争的目标，而这必然会导致部件落入恶魔之手。",
	"As she talks with the characters, Lynx relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in various legends surrounding the Tomb of Horrors, but recent expeditions sent to the tomb have all failed to return.

If on friendly terms, a guide can restore any damage dealt to its counterpart during a short rest, by willingly sacrificing parts for the other.": "如果人物与这两个特工见面，他们可能会同意为这两个特工工作而不被另一个特工知道。在这种情况下，他们有可能获得两个机械向导。你可以决定这两个构造物的程序是否会导致他们争吵和互相指责，或者每个引导者是否试图破坏和摧毁其对应物。或者，你可以决定他们发展出相互尊重的关系，甚至可能因为他们共同的冒险而成为朋友。如果是友好关系，向导可以在短暂的休息中恢复对其同伴造成的任何伤害，愿意为对方牺牲一部分。",

	"The {@i Infernal Machine} components placed into the mechanical guides allow the characters to order a guide to spend 1 or more charges to alter time within individual areas of the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch.

	"A guide spends 1 or more charges using its action. Commanding a guide to spend a charge requires no action.": "一个向导使用其行动来花费1个或多个冲锋。指挥一个向导花费一个冲锋，不需要任何行动。",
	"Neither the characters nor the agents know in advance which rooms are subject to localized time effects, which areas can be affected by multiple charges, whether spending charges advances or rewinds time, or if the effects will be helpful, harmful, or simply wondrous in nature. Ultimately, some amount of experimentation might be necessary.": "角色和代理人都不知道哪些房间会受到局部时间效应的影响，哪些区域会受到多次收费的影响，花钱是为了让时间前进还是倒退，或者这些效应是有益的、有害的，还是仅仅是奇妙的性质。最终，某种程度的实验可能是必要的。",
	"By spending 1 or more charges in an area, a mechanical guide alters the flow of time within that area in a limited way. As time flows forward or backward, the characters see the area and its occupants move like ghosts into the future or the past, then settle back into the normal time frame once more. As was seen at the clock tower in chapter 1, this time manipulation affects only the immediate area and that area's original inhabitants. The characters, any creatures accompanying them, and any creatures that enter the area while time is shifting are not affected.": "通过在一个区域花费1个或更多的费用，一个机械向导以有限的方式改变了该区域的时间流。当时间向前或向后流动时，人物会看到这个区域和它的居民像幽灵一样移动到未来或过去，然后再一次回到正常的时间框架中。正如第一章中在钟楼看到的那样，这种时间操纵只影响到附近的区域和该区域的原始居民。人物、陪伴他们的任何生物，以及在时间转移时进入该区域的任何生物都不受影响。",
	"For example, having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in a specific room might cause that room's occupants to move to a different location, as local time speeds forward or back to a point when those occupants are going on or off duty, starting or ending a rest period, and so on. The characters and other outside observers see the affected occupants retreating or advancing in time, but cannot interact with them.": "例如，让一个机械向导在一个特定的房间里花费1个或更多的电荷，可能会导致这个房间里的人移动到不同的位置，因为当地的时间加速前进或后退到一个点，当这些人要上岗或下班，开始或结束一个休息时间，等等。人物和其他外部观察者会看到受影响的住户在时间上撤退或前进，但不能与他们互动。",
	"Once the affected creatures arrive at their new time and location, they start acting as they normally would from that point forward. This means that creatures going back in time have their memories revert, such that they forget any interactions with characters in the area they just left.

Likewise, characters who fail badly in negotiations with NPCs can try to wind back the clock to replay those negotiations as desired.": "通过操纵冒险地点的时间，NPC和怪物可以被移到新的位置，这样就可以避免战斗（即使战斗已经开始了）。同样，在与NPC的谈判中严重失败的角色可以尝试让时间倒流，以重新进行所需的谈判。",
	"The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroes—and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wanting—the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world's deadliest dungeons on their own terms.": "恐怖之墓是多元宇宙中最具传奇色彩的地牢之一。恐怖之墓是由半人半兽的阿克雷拉克（Acererak）塑造的，作为未来英雄的试验场，并作为窃取那些技能不足的英雄的灵魂的地方，千百年来夺去了无数人的生命，即使是一些最强硬的冒险家也会对进入这些致命的大厅三思而行。但是，通过回到过去，角色们有机会探索一个很少有人见过的恐怖之墓的版本，并以自己的方式参与世界上最致命的地牢之一。",

In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy him—and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.": "根据传说，Acererak是一个名叫{@creature Tarnhem|IMR}的巴洛尔人所生的铁皮人。年轻时，他在韦克纳手下学习法术，此后成为一名超越邪恶的大法师。在研究实现巫术的方法时，阿塞拉克建造了许多地牢和坟墓，包括他著名的恐怖之墓。建造这些地牢的目的，一方面是为了引出并击败那些被驱使寻找并摧毁他的冒险者，另一方面是为了夺取这些冒险者的灵魂来喂养他的法器。",
	"Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness.

	"By traveling to the Tomb of Horrors in the past, the characters arrive with the place still under construction. The artificer {@creature Moghadam|IMR} serves as the tomb's chief architect, overseeing its construction in initial areas dug out by enthralled umber hulks and refined by master artisans. As part of the unprecedented levels of magic used to create the deadly traps in the Tomb of Horrors, {@creature Moghadam|IMR} has installed several of the missing components from the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad} at the site.

He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival's temple, instructing them to steal the temple's two most famous gems—set into the eyes of a great statue of Moloch—for use in the creation of Acererak's jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by {@creature Thessalar|IMR}.": "在建造坟墓的这些年里，{@creature Moghadam|IMR}和他的对手工匠，{@creature Thessalar|IMR}，对对方的努力进行了激烈的竞争。{@creature Moghadam|IMR}很高兴从{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的寺庙里引诱了几个雕塑家来帮助建造坟墓。他最近还派了一队盗贼和一位宝石大师去他的对手的神庙，指示他们偷取神庙里最有名的两颗宝石--镶嵌在摩洛神的大雕像的眼睛里--用于制造阿克拉克的宝石半身人头骨。不幸的是，这些小偷没有回来，估计是被{@creature Thessalar|IMR}抓住了。",
	"This version of the Tomb of Horrors takes place in the distant past, when various legendary figures of in-game history (Acererak included) still operate as mere mortals. Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure's approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in \"what-if\" fashion.

Likewise, so will the agents' patron archdevils, Zariel and Bel, who might send forces of cultists to finish the characters off.": "当然，如果这些角色占有机器的时间过长，任何幸存的特工都会对他们进行报复。同样，特工们的守护神扎里尔和贝尔也会这样做，他们可能会派邪教徒的部队来干掉这些角色。",
	"The mechanical guides are programmed to serve their agent masters—and to self-destruct in the event that anyone else attempts to take control of them. Still, exposure to the power of the components of the {@i Infernal Machine} might change a guide's programming, allowing the characters to befriend and permanently claim it as a companion or ally. If this happens, a guide's time traveling ability can be curtailed as you desire.": "机械导引器被设定为服务于它们的代理人主人--在其他人试图控制它们的情况下会自我毁灭。尽管如此，接触到{@i Infernal Machine}组件的力量可能会改变向导的程序，允许人物与它交好并永久地将其作为伙伴或盟友。如果发生这种情况，向导的时间旅行能力可以按照你的意愿被削减。",
	"Because this adventure traverses both time and space, you might decide that actions carried out by the characters in the past of chapters 3 and 4 create changes in the present of the campaign world when they return. For example, the construction of the Tomb of Horrors might be disrupted, in which case it holds less prominence in later times. If {@creature Thessalar|IMR} regains his missing sculptors, he might complete his stone golem and send it out to destroy {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and demolish the tomb while it's under construction. {@creature Thessalar|IMR} might also create more monsters than he is already known for, which can spread throughout the world.": "因为这次冒险穿越了时间和空间，所以你可以决定让角色在第三章和第四章的过去进行的行动在他们回来时对现在的活动世界产生变化。例如，恐怖之墓的建造可能会被破坏，在这种情况下，它在后来的时代中的地位就不那么突出了。如果{@creature Thessalar|IMR}重新找回了他失踪的雕塑家，他可能会完成他的石雕，并派它去摧毁{@creature Moghadam|IMR}，并在坟墓建设中拆除它。{@creature Thessalar|IMR}也可能创造出比他已经出名的更多的怪物，这些怪物可以在全世界传播。",
	"Feel free to keep track of what events and choices in the past might have future implications—and have fun presenting the fallout of those events to your players!": "请自由跟踪过去的哪些事件和选择可能会对未来产生影响--并在向你的玩家介绍这些事件的后果时获得乐趣。",
	"{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild} hopefully provides plenty of options for you to run the adventure the way that works best for your campaign. But if you'd like to customize this adventure even further, consider any of the following possibilities.": "{@i Infernal Machine Rebuild}，希望为你提供足够的选择，以最适合你的活动的方式进行冒险。但如果你想进一步定制这个冒险，可以考虑以下任何一种可能性。",
	"The conflict between the hags and the unicorn Banrion can be complicated or augmented in a number of ways.": "女巫和独角兽Banrion之间的冲突可以以多种方式复杂化或增强。",
	"If having three dryads working together is too immediate a tipoff that these might be hags forming a coven, you can add a fourth illusory mother to the mix to help allay suspicion. Created from a few logs and branches, Mother Hedgehog sits quietly in the corner of the cottage. If the characters attempt to speak with her, the programmed illusion is able to mumble a few incoherent words. A successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check detects this illusion.": "如果三个干尸在一起工作太过直接，让人觉得他们可能是女巫组成的女巫团，你可以在其中加入第四个虚幻的母亲，以帮助消除怀疑。用几根木头和树枝做成的刺猬妈妈，静静地坐在小屋的角落里。如果角色试图和她说话，这个程序化的幻象能够喃喃自语，说一些语无伦次的话。成功通过DC16智力({@skill Investigation})检查可以发现这个幻象。",
	"The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening. If the characters treat with Banrion, the unicorn asks them to help free the dryads to set the woods back to order. ": "女巫的小屋是由三棵树缠绕在一起建成的。这些树可能包含了三个真正的干尸，她们的外表被女巫们窃取为己用，并被女巫们奴役，帮助她们进行腐败的园艺工作。如果人物与Banrion交谈，独角兽会要求他们帮助释放干尸，使森林恢复秩序。",
	"Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with Banrion the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.": "与其把女巫伪装成善良的干尸，你可能会选择颠覆这个场景。三位母亲可能真的是需要帮助的干尸，而独角兽Banrion是邪恶的生物，必须被打败才能拯救森林。独角兽甚至可能使用它的黑暗魔法，使干尸们变成了巫婆。",
	"If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward Banrion (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, Banrion looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.": "如果角色最初对班瑞恩采取了积极的态度（无论是因为女巫欺骗了他们还是因为独角兽是邪恶的），你可以让独角兽在角色试图穿过钟楼桥时出现，从而使战斗更加艰难。在桥上战斗时，班瑞恩会把角色从塔上打到下面的鸿沟里，甚至在她传送走的时候试图把塔压在角色下面。",
	"If the unicorn later makes peace with the characters, she teleports down into the chasm (if still able to) and heals them.": "如果独角兽后来与人物和解，她就会传送到鸿沟里（如果还能传送的话）并治疗他们。",
	"Meeting with the infernal agents has the potential for a number of interesting story options.": "与无间道特工会面有可能产生一些有趣的故事选项。",
	"As written, the mechanical guides can safely teleport the characters to and from the specific adventure locations. If it fits with your campaign, you might opt to allow teleportation to other locations in time and space with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. A failed check causes the characters to be misdirected physically or temporally, as you determine. If the characters claim any missing components of the {@i Infernal Machine}, those components can be added to the mechanical guide, providing a +2 bonus to this check per component.": "按照规定，机械指南可以安全地将角色传送到特定的冒险地点。如果符合你的活动，你可以选择允许传送到其他时间和空间的地点，但要成功地进行DC20智力（（%0%））检查。如果检查失败，角色就会在物理上或时间上被误导，由你决定。如果人物声称缺少{@i Infernal Machine}的任何部件，这些部件可以被添加到机械指南中，为每个部件提供一个+2的检查奖励。",
	"You might decide that neither agent would ever allow the components they already possess to leave their sight, or that the characters are the first ones to have come across any missing components. If so, Lynx's guide is powered by a dangerous combination of living {@spell teleport} and {@spell time stop} spells, and might malfunction as you see fit. {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}'s guide is a captured quarut (an inevitable that seeks to uphold the laws of space and time), and which is forced to use its powers as Ursas demands. Though the quarut is programmed to prevent it from revealing its plight outright, it might provide clues during the adventure that all is not as it seems.": "你可能会决定，两个特工都不会允许他们已经拥有的部件离开他们的视线，或者说，这些角色是第一个遇到任何失踪部件的人。如果是这样的话，林克斯的向导是由一个危险的活体（%0%）和（%1%）法术组合驱动的，并且可能会在你认为合适的时候发生故障。{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的向导是一个被捕获的夸鲁特（一种寻求维护空间和时间法则的必然），它被迫按照乌瑟斯的要求使用其力量。虽然夸鲁特被编程为防止它直接暴露自己的困境，但它可能会在冒险过程中提供线索，表明一切都不像它看起来那样。",
	"When the characters make their choice of which agent they want to work with, whatever agent they turn down immediately arranges to send out their own competing expedition. (If the characters agree to work for both agents, both agents might still send out second redundant expeditions as insurance.)": "当人物选择他们想与哪个代理人合作时，无论他们拒绝了哪个代理人，都会立即安排他们自己的竞争性探险队。(如果人物同意为两个代理人工作，两个代理人仍然可能派出第二个多余的探险队作为保险。)",
	"These expeditions are composed of five {@creature cultist} servants, led either by the {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} for Lynx, or the brains in iron for {@creature Sir Ursas|IMR} (see below for more information on both). Each expedition also has its own mechanical guide. You might use the members of the rival expedition to chase after the characters, or they might have already arrived at one of the locations and be set up for the characters to stumble upon. The members of the alternative expedition might set obstacles along the way, possibly inspiring the characters to do the same. Using the power of a mechanical guide might allow for the creation of particularly devious traps that can be set across space and time. And the members of the alternative expedition certainly look to sabotage or destroy the characters' mechanical guide in order to strand them.": "这些远征队由五个{@creature cultist}仆人组成，由{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}的猞猁带领，或由{@creature Sir Ursas|IMR}的铁脑袋带领（关于两者的更多信息见下文）。每个探险队也有自己的机械向导。你可以用对手的探险队成员来追赶角色，或者他们可能已经到达某个地点，并被安排好让角色偶然遇到。另一支探险队的成员可能会在路上设置障碍，可能会激励角色做同样的事。利用机械向导的力量，可以创造出特别狡猾的陷阱，可以跨越空间和时间来设置。而另类探险队的成员当然会破坏或摧毁人物的机械向导，以便将他们困住。",
	"These competitors might succeed in securing some of the missing components, whether they steal them out from under the characters or take them directly in combat. Any stolen components will be delivered to their respective agents before the characters return from the past.": "这些竞争者可能会成功地获得一些缺失的部件，不管他们是在角色下面偷出来的还是在战斗中直接拿走的。任何被盗的部件都将在人物从过去回来之前交付给他们各自的代理人。",
	"Like the enhanced sphinx from {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this creature has been augmented with various technologies from the Barrier Peaks. Specifically, its eyes have been replaced with mechanical frames into which it slots different lenses. This is the same magical technology that was used to create another artifact, {@i Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn}. The medusa is nicknamed \"Daoud's Living Lanthorn\" as a result.": "和{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的增强型狮身人面像一样，这个生物也被增强了来自壁垒峰的各种技术。具体来说，它的眼睛被替换成了机械框架，里面可以插入不同的镜片。这也是用来创造另一件神器（1%）的神奇技术。因此，这只美杜莎被昵称为 \"达乌德的活兰瑟\"。",
	"The {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} uses the {@creature medusa} stat block with the following changes:": "{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}使用{@creature medusa}的统计块，并做了以下改动。",

	"Its Petrifying Gaze trait turns creatures into metal, wood, or porcelain (the medusa's choice) rather than stone.": "它的石化凝视特性可以将生物变成金属、木头或瓷器（由美杜莎选择）而不是石头。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, the {@creature enhanced medusa|IMR} might seek revenge for what befell its ancestor {@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}, or could be appeased with information regarding that medusa's whereabouts.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集，{@creature enhanced medusa|IMR}可能会为它的祖先{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}的遭遇寻求报复，或者用关于那个美杜莎的下落的信息来安抚它。",
	"While little is known of Daoud, his lanthorn was part of the treasure to be recovered in the AD&D adventure module {@i Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth}. Light cast through the different faces of the lanthorn created different magical effects, which the lanthorn fueled with crushed gemstones.": "虽然人们对达乌德知之甚少，但他的镧传是AD&D冒险模块（%0%）中要收回的宝藏的一部分。光线投射到兰瑟恩的不同面会产生不同的魔法效果，兰瑟恩用粉碎的宝石作为燃料。",
	"This creature originated from old designs of Kwalish, and takes the form of multiple brains that have been magically preserved and which collectively operate a new mechanical body. The brains share insights and knowledge with one another, and have typically been taken from creatures that desired to prolong their consciousness—or that were tasked with controlling a construct for all time as punishment.": "这种生物起源于Kwalish的古老设计，以多个大脑的形式出现，这些大脑被神奇地保存下来，共同操作一个新的机械身体。这些大脑彼此分享见解和知识，通常是从那些希望延长自己意识的生物身上取下来的，或者是那些作为惩罚而被要求永远控制一个构造物的生物。",

	"It has a speed of 20 feet.": "它的速度为20英尺。",
	"If this adventure is played as a sequel to {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, this creature began as the brains in jars encountered in the Barrier Peaks. After constructing a new collective body from spare parts, the brains escaped (and now seek revenge against the characters if they did not aid the brains sufficiently during that adventure). The brains' collective goal in seeking the missing components is to be able to transfer themselves into the ultimate mechanical body—the {@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}.": "如果这次冒险是作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的续集来玩的，这种生物开始是在屏障峰遇到的罐子里的大脑。在用零件构建了一个新的集体身体后，这些大脑逃了出来（如果在那次冒险中没有充分帮助这些大脑，他们现在会对这些人物进行报复）。大脑的集体目标是寻找缺失的部件，以便能够将自己转移到最终的机械身体--{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}。",
	"You can expand the characters' exploration of the Tomb of Horrors construction site in a number of ways.": "你可以通过多种方式扩展人物对恐怖之墓建筑工地的探索。",
	"Even villains have their hobbies—and for {@creature Moghadam|IMR}, that hobby is death traps. Any character who discusses traps with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} can impart to him a new deadly design—either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Doing so gains {@creature Moghadam|IMR}'s favor and advantage on further ability checks made to negotiate with the artificer, as you determine.": "即使是恶棍也有他们的爱好--对{@creature Moghadam|IMR}来说，这个爱好就是死亡陷阱。任何与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}讨论过陷阱的角色都可以向他传授新的致命设计--要么使用合适的角色扮演和玩家的聪明才智，要么成功进行DC16魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。这样做可以获得{@creature Moghadam|IMR}的好感，并在与工匠谈判的进一步能力检定中获得优势，具体由你决定。",
	"As written, the sculptors in the Tomb of Horrors are eager to escape but the muralists are loyal to {@creature Moghadam|IMR}. However, you might decide that the muralists have their own reasons to flee servitude, and have secured a set of {@item claws of the umber hulk|PotA} (see {@adventure appendix C|IMR|8}) to do so.

	"As an added element of danger and dilemma during the ceremony in the chapel ({@area area 14|093|x}), each time a character succeeds on a saving throw to resist the ceremony's power, one of the worshipers in the pews is overcome and transforms into black rock.": "在礼拜堂的仪式中，作为一个额外的危险和困境的元素（{@area area 14|093|x}），每当一个角色在抵抗仪式的力量时蓄力成功，就会有一个在座位上的崇拜者被征服并变成黑岩。",
	"If the black rocks from the chapel are brought to the sculptors, you might decide that they can help restore those victims to life using their superior mason's tools. Alternatively, the sculptors might want to incorporate these magic rocks into an even more impressive golem, helping to ensure their escape. Likewise, if taken to the Temple of Moloch, these rocks might be highly prized for the crafting of statues and homunculi.": "如果把小教堂里的黑色石头带给雕塑家，你可能会决定他们可以用他们优越的石匠工具帮助那些受害者恢复生命。另外，雕塑家们可能会想把这些神奇的石头融入到一个更令人印象深刻的巨石中，帮助确保他们逃脱。同样地，如果被带到摩洛神庙，这些石头可能会被高度重视，用于制作雕像和同形体。",
	"The fiery rift of area 16 allows {@creature Tarnhem|IMR} to return to the Abyss. But depending on the setup of your campaign (and particularly if you are playing through {@adventure Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus|BGDIA}), you might instead have this rift lead to the Nine Hells.

	"Considering the variety of laboratory creatures residing in the temple, its hallways might also be populated by roving packs of wild, escaped {@creature tressym|BGDIA}.

	"You might introduce different options for interacting with the statues in {@area area 24|136|x}, especially if combat breaks out there. For example, if the eidolon inhabits a statue of Zariel or Bel, the characters might gain advantage on attack rolls against that statue if they serve the archdevil's agent (or disadvantage on attack rolls against the statue of the competing agent's patron). Out of combat, if the characters are allied with {@creature Moghadam|IMR} and remove a hand and an eye from any statue, Vecna rewards them with some boon (advantage on attack rolls during the first round of their next fight, having a consumable magic item appear in the statue's remaining hand, and so forth).": "你可以引入不同的选项来与{@area area 24|136|x}的雕像互动，尤其是在那里发生战斗的时候。例如，如果Eidolon居住在Zariel或Bel的雕像中，如果角色为大恶魔的代理人服务，他们可能会在对该雕像的攻击卷中获得优势（或在对竞争代理人的守护者的雕像的攻击卷中处于劣势）。在战斗之外，如果人物与{@creature Moghadam|IMR}结盟，并从任何雕像上取下一只手和一只眼睛，Vecna就会奖励他们一些好处（在下一次战斗的第一轮中获得攻击卷的优势，在雕像剩下的手上出现一个可消耗的魔法物品，等等）。",
	"One of the chickens in {@area area 35|15f|x} might be one of {@creature Thessalar|IMR}'s experiments, such that it occasionally lays silver eggs (worth 10 gp) or even golden eggs (worth 20 gp).

Alternatively, he might trade missing components in his possession for the three famed weapons, which are still hidden elsewhere in the world, or for some of the monstrous creatures that will eventually guard the dungeon.": "人物可能需要回到Keraptis第一次建造他的传奇地牢（在{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}中出现）的时候，并使用{@i Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad}中的组件，用魔法将{@item Wave}、{@item Whelm}和{@item Blackrazor}固定住。另外，他可能会用手中缺失的部件换取仍藏在世界其他地方的三件著名的武器，或者换取一些最终将守护地宫的怪物。",
	"If you are playing this adventure alongside {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, {@adventure White Plume Mountain|TftYP} offers a number of connections to that adventure's guides. Ctenmiir the vampire once haunted White Plume Mountain, while Mary Greymalkin's former tutor, the witch Thingizzard, dwelled nearby.": "如果你和{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}一起玩这个冒险，{@adventure White Plume Mountain|TftYP}提供了一些与该冒险指南的联系。吸血鬼Ctenmiir曾经在白翎山出没，而Mary Greymalkin的前导师，女巫Thingizzard则住在附近。",

	"During the time frame in which the characters visit the Tomb of Horrors, Acererak is still a mortal human spellcaster—albeit an incredibly evil and powerful one. You can play him as an {@creature archmage}—or for higher-level parties, use his stat block from {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}, but without his undead traits, his Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance traits, and his Disrupt Life legendary action. Acererak does not reside in the Tomb of Horrors at the time the characters travel there in chapter 3, but he might appear if its construction is hindered. He is keen on preventing characters from utterly destroying the tomb, but might grace them with an audience if they look as though they could prove useful to furthering his plans.": "在人物访问恐怖之墓的时间范围内，阿克雷拉克仍然是一个凡人的施法者--尽管是一个非常邪恶和强大的施法者。你可以把他当做一个（%0%）--或者对于更高级别的队伍，使用他在（%1%）时的状态块，但没有他的亡灵特性、他的重生和转动抵抗特性，以及他的破坏生命的传奇行动。在第三章中人物前往恐怖之墓时，阿克拉克并没有住在那里，但如果恐怖之墓的建造受到阻碍，他可能会出现。他热衷于阻止人物彻底毁坏坟墓，但如果他们看起来对推进他的计划有帮助的话，他可能会给他们提供一个听众。",
	"If enmity arises between the characters and Acererak, the would-be lich is a formidable foe. You might make this special version of Acererak even more so by having him wielding a sword with a {@item sphere of annihilation} fashioned into its blade, and with the matching {@item talisman of the sphere} fashioned into the hilt.": "如果角色和阿塞拉克之间产生了敌意，这个可能的巫师就是一个可怕的敌人。你可以让他挥舞着一把剑，在剑刃上刻上{@item sphere of annihilation}，并在剑柄上刻上相应的{@item talisman of the sphere}，从而使这个特殊版本的阿塞拉克更加强大。",
	"A potential guide in {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, Mary Greymalkin might appear in this adventure as a servant of {@creature Moghadam|IMR} or {@creature Thessalar|IMR}, a guide for the thieves who entered the Temple of Moloch, one of either agents' couriers, and so forth. As she does in {@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}, she offers to let the characters draw from her {@i deck of several things}. Some of the deck's cards bestow effects more relevant to this adventure, as follows:": "作为{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}的潜在向导，玛丽-格雷马尔金可能会在这次冒险中作为{@creature Moghadam|IMR}或{@creature Thessalar|IMR}的仆人出现，成为进入摩洛神庙的盗贼的向导，成为这两个特工的信使之一，等等。正如她在{@adventure Lost Laboratory of Kwalish|LLK}中所做的那样，她提出让人物从她的{@i deck of several things}中抽出。这副牌中的一些牌赋予了与这次冒险更相关的效果，如下所示。",
	"You are instantly teleported to and confined within either the Tomb of Horrors (in {@area area 7|076|x}) or the Temple of Moloch (in {@area area 10|081|x}) as the DM determines. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards.": "你会被瞬间传送到恐怖之墓（在（%0%））或摩洛神庙（在（%1%）），并被限制在其中，具体由DM决定。你所穿戴和携带的所有东西都会留在你消失时的空间里。你不会再抽牌。",
