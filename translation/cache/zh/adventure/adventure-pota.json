	"A terrible threat gathers in the North. Throughout this region of the Forgotten Realms, savage marauders bring destruction. Monsters are on the prowl, preying on flocks, rampaging through croplands, and attacking homesteads and travelers. In settlements, discord and suspicion grow. Sinister strangers lurk in the shadows, whispering about how everything is soon to change. This year brought an unseasonably warm and stormy spring. Tales spread of flooding, windstorms, wildfires, and tremors.": "一个可怕的威胁在北方集结。在被遗忘的王国的整个地区，野蛮的掠夺者带来了破坏。怪物们在徘徊，捕食羊群，在农田里横冲直撞，袭击家园和旅行者。在定居点，不和谐和猜疑在增长。阴险的陌生人潜伏在阴影中，低声说着一切很快就会改变。今年带来了一个反常的温暖和风暴的春天。洪水、暴风、野火和地震的传说不断传播。",
	"These troubles have a source known to few in the North: Elemental Evil. Servants of this malevolence gather in the Sumber Hills and spy on the Dessarin Valley, drawn by a force they can't explain. Dabbling in dangerous lore, these fanatics seek to master elemental magic and unleash its destructive power everywhere. And they are further along in their plans than most people in the North realize.": "这些麻烦有一个在北方很少有人知道的来源。元素的邪恶。这种邪恶的仆人们聚集在桑伯山，监视着德萨林谷，被一种他们无法解释的力量所吸引。这些狂热者沉迷于危险的传说，试图掌握元素魔法，并在各地释放其破坏性力量。而且他们的计划比北方大多数人意识到的要更进一步。",
	"Four elemental cults grow in power in the Sumber Hills, claiming abandoned keeps that connect to an underground fortress once part of an ancient dwarven kingdom. Within those chambers are the remnants of a temple built by drow worshipers of Elemental Evil. Each of the four cults venerates a powerful entity of air, earth, fire, or water: a Prince of Elemental Evil. Like their princes, the four cults are rivals, yet they all serve a mysterious force they call the Elder Elemental Eye.": "四个元素教派在桑伯山的势力越来越大，他们声称有废弃的堡垒与地下要塞相连，而地下要塞曾是古代矮人王国的一部分。在这些房间里，有一座由崇拜元素邪恶的鸦人建造的神庙的遗迹。四个邪教中的每一个都敬仰一个强大的空气、土、火或水的实体：一个元素邪恶的王子。就像他们的王子一样，这四个教派是竞争对手，但他们都服务于一个神秘的力量，他们称之为 \"长老元素之眼\"。",
	"A prophet gifted with a powerful elemental weapon leads each cult. Those weapons—{@item Windvane|PotA}, {@item Ironfang|PotA}, {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, and {@item Drown|PotA}—were the catalysts for the creation of four elemental nodes, places where the Elemental Planes connect to the Material Plane. The cults draw elemental creatures through the nodes, and they use elemental magic to create {@item devastation orb|PotA}s capable of ravaging the countryside. They've been testing these magic weapons, bolstering the cults' ranks, and infiltrating various communities, all directed by visions the prophets receive from the Elder Elemental Eye.

	"The presence of Elemental Evil in the Sumber Hills goes back thousands of years, when a sect of renegade drow discovered the extensive caverns beneath the Sumber Hills and claimed it as their territory. These dark elves venerated a terrible god of primordial evil, and they built a shrine to this nameless power. In time, the ancient drow cult faded away (or was wiped out), and the place known as the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye was forgotten for centuries.": "邪恶元素在桑伯山的存在可以追溯到几千年前，当时一个叛逆的乌鸦教派发现了桑伯山下的大量洞穴，并声称这是他们的领土。这些黑暗精灵崇尚一种可怕的原始邪恶之神，他们为这种无名的力量建造了一座神殿。随着时间的推移，古老的乌鸦崇拜逐渐消失（或被消灭），这个被称为长老元素之眼神庙的地方被遗忘了几个世纪。",
	"The dwarves of Besilmer were the next folk to discover the site. Besilmer was a realm of pastures and cropland. The dwarves established an underground stronghold called Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills to defend against the trolls and giants that plagued the region.

Trolls and giants soon broke the realm of Besilmer, and the remaining dwarves abandoned the place altogether.": "贝西尔默的矮人是下一个发现这个地方的人。贝西尔默是一个牧场和农田的王国。矮人在桑伯山下建立了一个名为Tyar-Besil的地下堡垒，以抵御困扰该地区的巨魔和巨人。矮人在自己的洞穴下发现了古老的鸦人据点和它的神庙。他们缺乏清理废墟的力量，所以他们放弃了更深的挖掘工作。巨魔和巨人很快就打破了贝西尔默的领域，剩下的矮人也完全放弃了这个地方。",
	"Over the years, adventurers occasionally stumbled across the buried stronghold of Tyar-Besil and the drow vaults below it. Few made any lasting record of their explorations, and their names are forgotten. But in the year 893 DR (using the Dalereckoning calendar, about 600 years before the present day), a band of adventurers called the Knights of the Silver Horn found the place and commenced an exploration of the ruins. The adventurers came back to Tyar-Besil again and again, and when they decided to establish strongholds and tame the territory, they raised their keeps over each of the known access points leading to the ancient dwarven ruins. The adventurers feared something in the deep caves below the Sumber Hills, and they intended to set a permanent watch over the area.": "多年来，冒险家们偶尔会偶然发现被埋葬的泰尔-贝西尔的据点和它下面的乌鸦金库。很少有人对他们的探索做任何持久的记录，他们的名字也被遗忘。但是在公元893年（使用达勒克宁历法，大约比现在早600年），一队被称为银角骑士的冒险者发现了这个地方，并开始对废墟进行探索。冒险家们一次又一次地回到泰尔-贝西尔，当他们决定建立据点并驯服这片领土时，他们在通往古代矮人遗迹的每个已知的通道上建立了自己的堡垒。冒险家们担心桑伯山下的深洞里有什么东西，他们打算对该地区进行长期监视。",
	"History didn't cooperate. A generation or two after the Knights of the Silver Horn established their strongholds, an orc horde swept through the North, and the keeps were overrun. For centuries they stood empty. Locals came to know them as the Haunted Keeps, and various monsters occasionally occupied the ruins.": "历史并不配合。在银角骑士团建立据点的一两代之后，兽人部落横扫北方，堡垒被攻陷。几个世纪以来，它们一直空着。当地人将其称为 \"闹鬼的堡垒\"，各种怪物偶尔会占据这些废墟。",
	"The abandoned keeps and the dwarven stronghold beneath them might have been forgotten forever, but a few years ago a drow named Vizeran DeVir returned to the ancient Fane of the Eye. A renegade drow wizard of great power, DeVir was no servant of Lolth; like the forgotten sect that created the temple long ago, he devoted himself to the nameless power of the Elder Elemental Eye. His beliefs led to his exile from drow society, but his faithfulness to this dark power did not go unrewarded. Guided by visions, Vizeran DeVir created four mighty weapons imbued with Elemental Evil: the spear {@item Windvane|PotA}, the dagger {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, the trident {@item Drown|PotA}, and the war pick {@item Ironfang|PotA}. He left these weapons on the altar of the Elder Elemental Eye for their fated bearers to discover.": "废弃的堡垒和其下的矮人据点可能已经被永远遗忘了，但几年前，一个名叫维泽兰-德维尔的鸦人回到了古老的眼之窗。DeVir是一个具有强大力量的叛逆的乌鸦巫师，他不是洛尔思的仆人；就像很久以前创建神庙的被遗忘的教派一样，他把自己献给了上古元素之眼的无名力量。他的信仰导致他被流放出鸦人社会，但他对这种黑暗力量的忠诚并没有得到回报。在幻觉的指引下，维泽兰-德维尔创造了四种被元素邪恶所浸染的强大武器：长矛（%0%）、匕首（%1%）、三叉戟（%2%）和战镐（%3%）。他把这些武器留在长老元素之眼的祭坛上，让它们的宿命持有者去发现。",
	"Within the last few months, each of the four elemental prophets was driven to seek out the ancient altar by dreams or visions. One by one, {@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}, {@creature Vanifer|PotA}, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}, and {@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA} claimed their weapons and became the leaders of their respective cults. The four prophets established themselves in the ruins of dwarven Tyar-Besil and occupied the Haunted Keeps that guard access to the vast dungeon. Lunatics, outlaws, power-hungry villains, and monsters of all description began to trickle into the valley, drawn by the dark call of Elemental Evil. Meanwhile, the prophets experimented with their new toys, nurturing the seeds of elemental nodes that grew larger every day and testing their powers to create ever-larger natural disasters.": "在过去的几个月里，四个元素先知中的每一个都被梦境或幻觉所驱使，去寻找古老的祭坛。一个接一个，{@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}、{@creature Vanifer|PotA}、{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}和{@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA}认领了他们的武器，并成为他们各自教派的领袖。这四位先知在矮人泰尔-贝西尔的废墟中建立了自己的势力，并占领了守卫通往巨大地宫的鬼堡。疯子、亡命之徒、渴望权力的恶棍和各种类型的怪物开始涌入山谷，被邪恶元素的黑暗召唤所吸引。同时，先知们用他们的新玩具进行实验，培育出的元素节点的种子一天比一天大，并测试他们的力量，创造出越来越大的自然灾害。",
	"After thousands of years, the seeds of Elemental Evil once again sprout beneath the Sumber Hills. Whether anyone can expose these sinister plots and put a stop to them remains to be seen.": "几千年后，元素邪恶的种子再次在桑伯山下发芽。是否有人能揭露这些险恶的阴谋并制止它们，还有待观察。",
	"The adventure begins when the characters arrive in the town of Red Larch, a small settlement on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. Strange rumors and ominous signs have the townsfolk concerned, including reports of bandit attacks on the roads, piracy on the Dessarin River, and monster sightings too close to town. But the mystery that has keen observers of the region most concerned is the disappearance of a delegation traveling overland from the city of Mirabar to Waterdeep. The delegation stopped in the tiny village of Beliard, where the members mentioned their intent to visit sacred dwarven sites before continuing on to Goldenfields. They were last seen at the west end of the Stone Bridge, turning south to proceed overland through the heart of the Sumber Hills. It has now been almost a month, and the delegation never showed up at Goldenfields or any other outpost.": "冒险开始于人物到达红松镇，一个位于德萨林谷西侧的小定居点。奇怪的传言和不祥的征兆让镇民们忧心忡忡，包括公路上的强盗袭击、德萨林河上的海盗行为以及在镇子附近看到的怪物。但最让该地区敏锐的观察家们担心的谜团是一个从米拉巴尔城到沃特德普的陆路旅行代表团的失踪。该代表团在贝利亚德（Beliard）的小村庄停了下来，成员们在那里提到他们打算在继续前往金矿区之前参观矮人的圣地。他们最后一次被看到是在石桥的西端，转向南方，从陆路穿过桑伯山的中心地带。现在已经过去了将近一个月，代表团从未在金田镇或任何其他前哨出现过。",
	"Powerful factions have good reason to worry about the missing delegation. The Harpers are concerned about a noted dwarf historian who was part of the delegation. The Emerald Enclave wants to know what happened to a pouch of magical seeds one of the delegation members was bringing to Goldenfields. Even the Zhentarim are interested in trying to improve their relations with Mirabar by helping to solve the mystery. Whether the characters set out to search for the missing delegation or choose to investigate another lead, they soon find clues that lead them to the Haunted Keeps in the Sumber Hills. All of these are now occupied by strange new sects masquerading as harmless societies or reclusive orders, but these outposts serve Elemental Evil.": "强大的派别有充分的理由担心代表团的失踪。哈珀人担心一位著名的矮人历史学家，他也是代表团的成员。翡翠飞地想知道代表团成员之一带往金地的一袋魔法种子发生了什么。甚至连Zhentarim也有兴趣通过帮助解开这个谜团来试图改善他们与Mirabar的关系。无论人物是开始寻找失踪的代表团，还是选择调查另一条线索，他们很快就找到了线索，将他们引向桑伯山的闹鬼堡。所有这些地方现在都被奇怪的新教派占据，它们伪装成无害的社团或隐居的命令，但这些前哨站都为元素邪恶服务。",
	"When the characters infiltrate or defeat these disguised groups of cultists, they discover that each Haunted Keep guards a passage leading to a huge dungeon beneath the Sumber Hills, the new Temple of Elemental Evil. Here, the elemental cults have established themselves in the ruins of an ancient dwarven stronghold. They are building up their strength as they work to master elemental power. The characters come up against the elemental prophets and confront one of the four cult leaders, whose identity depends on which part of the temple the characters explore first.": "当人物潜入或击败这些伪装的邪教组织时，他们发现每个鬼堡都守卫着一条通道，通往桑伯山下的巨大地牢，即新的元素邪恶神殿。在这里，元素邪教已经在一个古老的矮人据点的废墟中建立了自己的势力。他们在努力掌握元素力量的同时也在积蓄力量。角色们与元素预言家们对峙，并与四个邪教领袖中的一个对抗，他们的身份取决于角色们首先探索神庙的哪个部分。",
	"Even as the characters delve into the elemental temples, their successes provoke retaliation. The elemental prophets dispatch bands of cultists armed with {@item Devastation Orb|PotA|devastation orbs}—essentially bombs of elemental energy created from the elemental nodes—to unleash natural disasters throughout the Dessarin Valley, punishing everyone for the characters' interference.": "即使人物深入到元素神庙中，他们的成功也会引起报复。元素预言家们派遣了一批手持（%0%）--基本上是由元素节点产生的元素能量炸弹的邪教徒，在整个德萨林谷释放自然灾害，对人物的干预进行惩罚。",
	"Despite fierce opposition in the various elemental temples and the retribution of the offended cults, the characters succeed in rescuing some of the Mirabar delegates and driving out some or all of the cults from their newly established bases in Tyar-Besil. Unfortunately, other members of the delegation remain missing, and various other leads and mysteries remain unresolved. Worse yet, it quickly becomes clear that the elemental cults are on the brink of unleashing unthinkable disasters.": "尽管各元素神庙中存在激烈的反对意见，而且被冒犯的邪教也会进行报复，但这些人物还是成功地救出了一些米拉巴尔的代表，并将一些或所有的邪教赶出了他们在泰尔-贝西尔新建立的基地。不幸的是，代表团的其他成员仍然失踪，其他各种线索和谜团仍然没有得到解决。更糟糕的是，很快就可以看出，元素邪教正处于释放不可想象的灾难的边缘。",
	"As an elemental apocalypse grows nearer, the characters discover passages leading from the cult-controlled territory in Tyar-Besil to the far older (and more dangerous) caverns known as the Fane of the Eye, dug long ago by drow. Here they find the evil altar dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye, where the characters confront another of the elemental prophets (again, the prophet they fight depends on which part of the dungeon they explore first). They also find passages leading into the ultimate sanctums of the cults: the elemental nodes known as the Black Geode, the Howling Caverns, the Plunging Torrents, and the Weeping Colossus.": "随着元素启示的日益临近，角色们发现了从Tyar-Besil的邪教控制区通往更古老（也更危险）的洞穴的通道，这些洞穴被称为 \"眼睛之窗\"，是很久以前由鸦人挖掘的。他们在这里找到了供奉长老元素之眼的邪恶祭坛，人物在这里与另一位元素先知对峙（同样，他们与哪位先知战斗取决于他们先探索地牢的哪一部分）。他们还发现了通往邪教终极圣地的通道：被称为黑晶石（Black Geode）、嚎叫洞穴（Howling Caverns）、急流（Plunging Torrents）和哭泣巨人（Weeping Colossus）的元素结点。",
	"In the last stage of the adventure, the characters face the daunting task of pursuing the remaining two elemental prophets into their places of power. The most powerful and dedicated followers of each of the four cults guard these sanctums, which are infused with elemental energy and warped into strange reflections of the Elemental Planes. At the heart of each elemental node, the characters find a great portal that serves as a conduit from its associated elemental plane. Here the remaining cult leaders make their stands, and here the characters face the overwhelming power of the Princes of Elemental Evil. Victory might seem doubtful against such opponents, but clever and resourceful characters can find ways to destroy the portals instead of trying to slay these dire beings.": "在冒险的最后阶段，角色们面临着一项艰巨的任务，那就是追捕剩下的两位元素先知，进入他们的权力之所。四个邪教中最强大、最虔诚的追随者守护着这些圣地，这些圣地被注入了元素能量，并被扭曲成元素界的奇怪反映。在每个元素节点的中心，角色们会发现一个巨大的传送门，作为相关元素界的通道。在这里，剩余的邪教领袖们做出了他们的决定，而在这里，角色们面临着元素邪恶王子们的压倒性力量。面对这样的对手，胜利似乎很值得怀疑，但聪明机智的角色可以找到摧毁传送门的方法，而不是试图杀死这些可怕的生物。",
	"With the portals shut, the elemental nodes revert to normal, and any surviving cultists scatter to the four winds. Their stronghold is destroyed and their leaders are dead; Elemental Evil is defeated in this world for now.": "随着传送门的关闭，元素节点恢复正常，任何幸存的邪教徒都四散奔逃。他们的据点被摧毁了，他们的领袖也死了；元素邪恶在这个世界上暂时被打败了。",
	"Elemental Evil perverts the natural elements, limiting them to aspects of destruction. This force wants to gain the power to tear down everything—morals, social structures, governments, the laws of nature—and reduce existence to a more elemental state, tainted with conflict and madness. Elemental Evil uses mortal servants as a means to this end.": "元素邪恶扭曲了自然元素，将它们限制在破坏的方面。这股力量想要获得拆毁一切的力量--道德、社会结构、政府、自然法则--并将存在降低到一个更原始的状态，沾染上冲突和疯狂。元素邪恶利用凡人的仆人作为实现这一目的的手段。",
	"These hateful principles take two primary forms in the world. The first is corruption. Elemental Evil tempts the broken, the wronged, and the wicked with the power to strike back. It represents the worm in the apple, a hidden corruption that grows stronger over time as the natural order decays. Secret cults spring up, institutions are debased, and the fundamental laws governing the seasons begin to weaken. As Elemental Evil grows stronger, its corruption grows into the second form: madness. Cultists sink into insanity, lashing out at everything around them or destroying themselves in elemental cataclysms. Ruin rules as the forces of nature become instruments of destruction. A world in which Elemental Evil triumphed would exist only as an everlasting war of raging elements.": "这些可恨的原则在世界范围内有两种主要形式。第一种是腐败。元素邪恶诱惑着破碎的人、受委屈的人和有能力反击的邪恶者。它代表着苹果中的虫子，是一种隐藏的腐败，随着时间的推移，自然秩序的衰败而变得越来越强大。秘密邪教涌现，机构被贬低，管理四季的基本法律开始削弱。随着元素邪恶越来越强大，它的腐败也发展成第二种形式：疯狂。崇拜者陷入疯狂，对周围的一切进行抨击，或在元素大灾难中毁灭自己。当自然界的力量成为毁灭的工具时，毁灭就成为了统治。一个元素之恶取得胜利的世界将只存在于一场永恒的元素之战中。",
	"Elemental Evil appears in different worlds throughout the many ages. This sinister force—the Elder Elemental Eye—is well hidden in Faerûn. Individuals remain susceptible to its call: those lured by the promise of power, those who know only hate in their hearts, those whose minds are broken and therefore open to insinuation and dark whispers. These are the servants of Elemental Evil, and they can cause immeasurable harm if they aren't exposed and rooted out.": "元素的邪恶出现在不同的世界，贯穿了许多时代。这种邪恶的力量--长老元素之眼--在法鲁恩隐藏得很好。个人仍然容易受到它的召唤：那些被权力的承诺所引诱的人，那些心中只有仇恨的人，那些心灵被破坏的人，因此对暗示和黑暗的低语开放。这些人是元素邪恶的仆人，如果他们不被揭露和根除，他们会造成不可估量的伤害。",
	"Although destruction is the unifying principle of Elemental Evil, beings that serve this dark force don't necessarily adhere to that goal. Only the most unbalanced minds seek destruction for its own sake. Instead, the servants of Elemental Evil seek power through the destructive might of one of the elements of air, earth, fire, or water. This is the origin of the four elemental cults that together compose the worship of Elemental Evil.": "虽然毁灭是元素邪恶的统一原则，但为这种黑暗力量服务的生命不一定坚持这一目标。只有最不平衡的头脑才会为了毁灭而寻求毁灭。相反，元素邪恶的仆人们通过空气、地球、火或水等元素之一的破坏力来寻求力量。这就是四个元素邪教的起源，它们共同构成了对元素邪教的崇拜。",
	"The cults operate independently of each other. Each believes that its favored element is the most powerful and most worthy of worship. Rank-and-file members of the air cult sneer at the idea that anyone could see something worth worshiping in elemental earth, fire, or water. Members of the other cults feel the same way about any cult but their own. Only the best-educated or most magically gifted members understand that a unifying principle underlies each elemental cult. Even then, they believe that their element should reign supreme.": "这些邪教相互独立运作。每个人都相信自己喜欢的元素是最强大的，最值得崇拜的。空气邪教的普通成员对任何人都能在土、火或水元素中看到值得崇拜的东西的想法嗤之以鼻。其他邪教的成员对任何邪教都有同样的感觉，除了他们自己的。只有受过最好教育或最有魔法天赋的成员才明白，每个元素邪教都有一个统一的原则。即使如此，他们也认为他们的元素应该是至高无上的。",
	"Despite these different goals and varying methods, the elemental cults are linked to each other by forces they don't fully understand. From world to world and age to age, the cults of Elemental Evil have risen again and again. Each time, the cultists of elemental air, earth, fire, and water are joined to the same dark fate.": "尽管有这些不同的目标和不同的方法，元素邪教被他们不完全理解的力量联系在一起。从一个世界到另一个世界，从一个时代到另一个时代，元素邪恶的邪教一次又一次地兴起。每一次，空气、地球、火和水元素的崇拜者都会加入到同一个黑暗命运中。",
	"Throughout the adventure, characters have ample opportunity to see the symbol associated with each of the four cults. They could figure out how the four symbols connect to form a fifth symbol: that of the Elder Elemental Eye.": "在整个冒险过程中，人物有充分的机会看到与四个教派中的每一个相关的符号。他们可以弄清楚这四个符号是如何连接起来形成第五个符号的：长老元素之眼的符号。",
	"The Cult of the Black Earth appeals to those who draw their fortunes from the earth—directly or indirectly. In areas where the influence of Elemental Evil takes hold, animals and monsters that live or burrow in the ground accept the cultists as allies. Creatures such as ankhegs or bulettes, normally too stupid and ravenous to be trained, submit to the will of the Black Earth. The monsters allow themselves to be herded or ridden into battle against the enemies of the cult.": "黑土教吸引了那些直接或间接地从地球上获取财富的人。在受元素邪恶影响的地区，生活在地下或钻在地下的动物和怪物会接受邪教者为盟友。像Ankhegs或bulettes这样的生物，通常太过愚蠢和贪婪而无法被训练，但却服从于黑土的意志。这些怪物允许自己被驱赶或骑在马上与邪教的敌人作战。",
	"The symbol of the earth cult signifies purpose and stability. Cultists sometimes identify themselves with a hand gesture: they make a triangle by touching the thumbs and forefingers of both hands together.": "大地崇拜的标志象征着目标和稳定。崇拜者有时会用一个手势来表明自己的身份：他们把双手的拇指和食指碰在一起，做成一个三角形。",
	"The Black Earth cult is the most defense-minded and patient of the four elemental cults. Earth cultists admire stoicism, endurance, and unyielding resolve. They are deliberate and slow to act, careful to consider their plans and gather their strength before beginning any new enterprise. Once earth cultists resolve to act, they are inflexible, grinding their way forward through any obstacle or unforeseen development. They are single-minded in the extreme, and most earth cultists have little use for social niceties. They see common courtesy as a way for the weak to put limits on the behavior of the strong, and they scorn empathy or friendship as weakness.": "黑土邪教是四个元素邪教中最具防御意识和耐心的。大地崇拜者推崇坚忍不拔的精神、耐力和不屈的决心。他们深思熟虑，行动迟缓，在开始任何新的事业之前，都会仔细考虑他们的计划并聚集他们的力量。一旦地球崇拜者下定决心采取行动，他们就会不屈不挠，在任何障碍或不可预见的发展中磨练自己的前进道路。他们极端地一意孤行，而且大多数大地崇拜者对社会礼节没有什么用处。他们认为普通的礼貌是弱者对强者的行为施加限制的一种方式，他们蔑视同情或友谊，认为这是弱者。",
	"In battle, Black Earth cultists are brutal and straightforward. They overpower foes with direct assaults, although if they have the opportunity to undermine defenses or attack from below, they unhesitatingly put their skill at tunneling and mastery of burrowing monsters to good use. They are unflinching in the face of death. Surrender is never an option.": "在战斗中，黑土崇拜者是残酷而直接的。他们用直接攻击来制服敌人，尽管如果他们有机会破坏防御或从下面攻击，他们会毫不犹豫地把他们的隧道技术和对钻地怪物的掌握用在这里。他们在面对死亡时毫不退缩。投降从来不是一种选择。",
	"Earth cultists live and work underground. They craft weapons from stone or iron and \"bathe\" themselves in sand or dirt to feel close to their favored element. Black Earth initiates know the secret of creating armor from magically shaped stone, and even their robes include stone pauldrons or masks.": "大地崇拜者在地下生活和工作。他们用石头或铁制作武器，并在沙子或泥土中 \"沐浴\"，以感觉接近他们所喜爱的元素。黑土教的入门者知道用魔法形状的石头制造盔甲的秘密，甚至他们的长袍上也有石质的长柄或面具。",
	"A medusa named {@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA} leads the Black Earth cult. He wields the elemental weapon {@item Ironfang|PotA}, a war pick infused with the power of {@creature Ogrémoch|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Earth. Marlos is vain and cruel, an extreme narcissist who delights in surrounding himself with objects of beauty and luxurious comforts. Beneath this sneering self-assurance lies a bitter being who loathes himself and holds everyone around him in contempt.": "一个名叫{@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA}的美杜莎领导着黑土教派。他挥舞着元素武器（%%1%），这是一把注入了邪恶地球王子（%%2%）力量的战刀。马洛斯虚荣而残忍，是个极端的自恋者，喜欢用美丽的物品和奢华的舒适来包围自己。在这种讥讽的自我肯定之下，是一个厌恶自己并蔑视周围所有人的痛苦的存在。",
	"Marlos began life as a human aristocrat, born into a wealthy Cormyrean family. He squandered his family's wealth on endless self-indulgence, seeking more questionable forms of entertainment through the years. The Urnrayle estate became known as a place of outrageous masquerades, bizarre banquets, and grotesque orgies. Marlos required his guests to don ugly or monstrous masks, thus ensuring that no one's beauty would outshine his own.": "马洛斯开始了作为人类贵族的生活，出生在一个富裕的科米雷家族。他把家族的财富挥霍在无休止的自我放纵上，多年来寻求更多可疑的娱乐形式。厄恩雷尔庄园成为著名的离谱的化妆舞会、怪异的宴会和怪诞的狂欢之地。马洛斯要求他的客人戴上丑陋或畸形的面具，从而确保没有人的美貌会超过他自己。",
	"As he aged, Marlos turned to magic to preserve his fading beauty. After searching for years, he found a ring that contained the stolen vitality of a lovely fey creature. As long as he wore the ring, his imperfections vanished and no one could resist his physical charms—until the day the ring transformed Marlos into a medusa. The horror of his fate drove Marlos mad. He fled his ancestral home, taking his collection of masks with him.": "随着年龄的增长，马洛斯转而求助于魔法，以保持他逐渐消失的美丽。经过多年的寻找，他找到了一枚戒指，里面有一个可爱的精灵生物的偷来的活力。只要他戴上这枚戒指，他的缺陷就会消失，没有人能够抵挡他的身体魅力--直到有一天，这枚戒指把马洛斯变成了一只美杜莎。命运的恐怖使马洛斯发疯了。他带着他收集的面具逃离了他的祖屋。",
	"After years of wandering and hiding in one ruined estate or another across the Western Heartlands, Marlos felt drawn to the desolate Sumber Hills by troubling dreams and visions. A long stairway beneath a ruined monastery brought him to an ancient cavern with a hideous altar, upon which lay a war pick of iron. When the medusa claimed {@item Ironfang|PotA}, his purpose finally became clear to him. He established his lair in the dungeon nearby and began building the Cult of the Black Earth.": "在西部心脏地带的一个或另一个破败的庄园里流浪和躲藏多年后，马洛斯感到被令人不安的梦和幻觉吸引到了荒凉的桑伯山。一座破败的修道院下的长梯将他带到一个古老的洞穴，里面有一个可怕的祭坛，上面躺着一把铁制的战镐。当美杜莎要求{@item Ironfang|PotA}时，他的目的终于变得清晰起来。他在附近的地牢里建立了自己的巢穴，并开始建立黑土教。",
	"Unlike many of his followers, Marlos is genteel and well-spoken. He delights in witty banter and pointed repartee, although he is quick to make a cutting remark or jest at someone else's expense. Marlos takes pleasure in mocking others, especially if he can do so in a clever or elegant way. Marlos's previous life had been a constant search for pleasure, but the only thing that now stirs his loveless soul is refined cruelty. He can be driven to fits of blind, unreasoning jealousy if he is outshone by another urbane and attractive individual.": "与他的许多追随者不同，马洛斯风度翩翩，谈吐得体。他喜欢诙谐的戏谑和尖锐的对答，尽管他很快就会说些尖锐的话语或以别人的利益为代价开玩笑。马洛斯以嘲弄他人为乐，特别是如果他能以一种聪明或优雅的方式这样做。马洛斯以前的生活一直在寻找快乐，但现在唯一能激起他无爱的灵魂的是精致的残忍。如果他被另一个彬彬有礼的有魅力的人比下去了，他就会被驱赶到盲目的、无理的嫉妒中。",
	"The Black Earth cultists are highly suspicious of the Cult of Howling Hatred. They believe that the air cultists are mercurial, unreliable, and generally out of touch with reality. The earth cultists respect the strength and ferocity of the Eternal Flame followers, but also find them maddeningly inconstant. Black Earth cultists ally most often with the Crushing Wave, since they admire the patience and pragmatism of the water cultists.": "黑土邪教的人对嚎叫的仇恨邪教高度怀疑。他们认为空气邪教的人是水银泻地，不可靠的，而且通常与现实脱节。大地崇拜者尊重永恒之火追随者的力量和凶猛，但也发现他们令人抓狂的不稳定。黑土教派最常与碎浪教派结盟，因为他们欣赏水教派的耐心和实用主义。",
	"The Crushing Wave cult appeals to those who live in or near bodies of water, as well as to those who appreciate subtlety and inevitability. Wicked sea creatures such as aquatic ghouls and merrows are friendly toward water cultists. Even non-sentient predators such as sharks or octopuses understand that water cultists are allies to be aided or masters to be obeyed.": "碎浪教吸引了那些生活在水体中或附近的人，以及那些欣赏微妙和不可避免性的人。邪恶的海洋生物，如水生食尸鬼和美人鱼，对水崇拜者很友好。即使是鲨鱼或章鱼等无知觉的掠食者也明白，水崇拜者是需要帮助的盟友或需要服从的主人。",
	"Water cultists use a simple hand sign to identify one another when a token of recognition is required: crossing the forefingers and overlapping the thumbs to create an X-shape linked by a line across the bottom. It stands for water's eternal surge and retreat, a cycle of unending change.": "水崇拜者使用一个简单的手势来识别彼此的身份，当需要确认的时候：食指交叉，拇指重叠，形成一个X形，底部有一条线连接。它代表着水的永恒涌动和退却，一个无休止变化的循环。",
	"Crushing Wave cultists are almost as patient and stoic as the followers of the earth cult. They understand the value of outlasting formidable foes and slowly eroding their defenses. However, they are far more flexible and opportunistic in their overall philosophy than the earth cultists are. Like a flood that seeks the weak point in a levee and then bursts through with ever-growing strength, water cultists are quick to sense an opening and then act to exploit it. This philosophy of pragmatism and opportunism means that the Crushing Wave is the most mercenary of the four elemental cults. Water cultists eagerly seek out rich prizes and use their ill-gotten loot to develop their schemes.": "碎浪邪教的信徒几乎和大地邪教的信徒一样有耐心和坚忍。他们了解战胜强大的敌人并慢慢侵蚀其防御的价值。然而，他们在整体理念上要比大地崇拜者灵活得多、机会主义得多。就像洪水寻找堤坝的薄弱点，然后以不断增长的力量冲破堤坝一样，水崇拜者很快就能感觉到一个缺口，然后采取行动来利用它。这种实用主义和机会主义的哲学意味着破碎浪潮是四个元素邪教中最雇佣的。水崇拜者热衷于寻找丰富的奖品，并利用他们不义之财来发展他们的计划。",
	"In combat, Crushing Wave cultists excel as skirmishers. They value mobility and opportunism, rarely making a stand in one place for long. Instead, they feign retreats, regroup, and launch new attacks, wearing down their foes like storm-driven waves eating away at a sandy beach. Almost all water cultists are excellent swimmers skilled at fighting in water, so they look for opportunities to surprise their enemies by using bodies of water to slip around or through defenses.": "在战斗中，破碎浪潮的邪教徒擅长做小兵。他们重视机动性和机会主义，很少在一个地方长期驻扎。相反，他们会假装撤退，重新集结，然后发动新的攻击，就像风暴驱动的海浪侵蚀沙滩一样消磨他们的敌人。几乎所有的水崇拜者都是优秀的游泳者，擅长在水中作战，所以他们寻找机会，利用水体绕过或穿过防线，给敌人一个惊喜。",
	"Because the cultists see water as the wellspring of all life and purpose, they spend as much time in or around it as possible. Many cult hideouts are located near large bodies of water, and those that aren't feature hidden pools or wells in which cult members can immerse themselves. Water cultists prize water-breathing magic and seek it out for no other reason than to spend hours meditating underwater. Few cultists gain any profound insights from these exercises.": "由于邪教成员将水视为所有生命和目的的源泉，他们尽可能多地在水里或周围度过。许多邪教的藏身之处都位于大型水体附近，而那些没有的地方则有隐藏的水池或水井，邪教成员可以将自己浸泡在其中。水上邪教的信徒非常重视水呼吸的魔法，他们寻找水呼吸的原因无非是为了在水下花几个小时进行冥想。很少有邪教成员从这些练习中获得任何深刻的见解。",
	"The former sailor {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA} leads the Crushing Wave cult. He wields the elemental weapon {@item Drown|PotA}, a trident imbued with the essence of {@creature Olhydra|PotA}, Princess of Evil Water. Gar is a sullen man who says little, letting his actions speak for him. He believes he has been wronged by the world and hates all people except those as broken and unfortunate as himself. Gar also despises weakness in others.": "前水手（%0%）领导碎浪教派。他挥舞着元素武器（%%1%），这是一把灌注了恶水公主（%%2%）精华的三叉戟。加尔是一个闷闷不乐的人，他很少说话，让他的行为来代表他。他认为自己被世界所冤枉，除了那些像他一样破碎和不幸的人，他憎恨所有的人。加尔还鄙视他人的弱点。",
	"Gar was born in a poor fishing village in the Nelanther Isles. At a young age, he lost his family to a sahuagin attack. The sea devils slaughtered almost everyone he knew. A Tethyrian merchant galley conscripted the young orphan into service, and Gar was forced into a brutal indentured servitude that was barely better than being enslaved. His unwilling service came to an end when pirates attacked the merchant ship. During the fighting, Gar was knocked overboard. For days he survived by clinging to the ship's wreckage, until a shark ripped off his left arm. Death seemed imminent, but a powerful current arose and bore him away from the hungry predator. Within an hour he was cast upon the shores of the Sword Coast.": "加尔出生在内兰瑟群岛的一个贫穷的渔村。在他很小的时候，他的家人就在萨瓦金人的袭击中丧生。海妖们几乎屠杀了他认识的所有人。一艘泰特里亚商船征召这个年轻的孤儿服役，加尔被迫接受残酷的契约奴役，勉强比被奴役好一点。当海盗袭击商船时，他不情愿的服务就结束了。在战斗中，加尔被打翻在地。几天来，他紧紧抓住船上的残骸，直到一条鲨鱼撕下了他的左臂。死亡似乎迫在眉睫，但一股强大的水流将他从饥饿的掠食者身边冲走。在一个小时内，他被扔到了剑海岸的海岸上。",
	"Gar believed that the current that had saved his life was an elemental sent by the sea. From that day forward, he devoted himself to the ocean, teaching himself its secrets and learning powerful water magic over years of lonely wandering. He despised all other people, remembering only his harsh treatment by the merchant crew and the brutality of the pirates. But in time he became aware of a call to a higher purpose, impelling him to find other examples of human flotsam and teach them about the power of the sea.": "加尔相信，救他一命的水流是大海派来的元素。从那天起，他就把自己献给了海洋，在多年的孤独漂泊中自学了海洋的秘密和强大的水魔法。他鄙视所有其他人，只记得他受到商船船员的严厉对待和海盗的残暴。但随着时间的推移，他意识到一种对更高目标的呼唤，促使他去寻找其他人类的浮尸，并向他们传授海洋的力量。",
	"Gar's visions led him to the secret waters beneath the Sumber Hills. He found a hidden cavern temple, on whose altar lay a powerful magical trident. Sensing its power, Gar took up the weapon and began to call his cult to join him in the Temple of the Crushing Wave.": "加尔的幻觉将他引向桑伯山下的秘密水域。他发现了一个隐藏的洞穴寺庙，在其祭坛上有一个强大的魔法三叉戟。感受到它的力量，加尔拿起武器，开始召唤他的崇拜者加入他的碎浪寺。",
	"Gar is covered in barnacles, and he wears an artificial arm in the shape of a crab's claw over the stump of his left arm. He never uses two words when one will do, and he believes that anyone addressing him with courtesy is either insincere or subtly mocking him. The water prophet's primary motivation is retribution; the world has been cruel to him, and he intends to make everyone else suffer as he has. He longs to be near the ocean again and is distressed by the fact that the driving force behind his visions keeps him so far from the sea.": "加尔浑身都是藤壶，他的左臂残肢上戴着一只蟹爪形状的假臂。他从来不用两个字，而用一个字就可以了，他认为任何人以礼相待都是不真诚的，或者是在巧妙地嘲弄他。水先知的主要动机是报应；世界对他很残酷，他打算让其他人也像他一样受苦。他渴望再次接近海洋，并为他的幻觉背后的驱动力使他远离大海而感到痛苦。",
	"The followers of the Crushing Wave detest the Cult of the Eternal Flame. They find the fire cultists to be hostile, short-tempered, and unforgivably rash. The Howling Hatred cultists aren't as hostile, but they are likewise given to sudden impulses and are unreliable. The water cultists get along with the Cult of the Black Earth. The earth cultists are deliberate and dependable, if perhaps too inflexible for their own good.": "碎浪的追随者厌恶永恒火焰的崇拜。他们发现火崇拜者充满敌意，脾气暴躁，而且不可原谅地轻率。嚎叫的仇恨教派没有那么多敌意，但他们也同样会有突然的冲动，而且不可靠。水崇拜者与黑土崇拜者相处融洽。大地崇拜者是深思熟虑和可靠的，尽管可能对他们自己来说太不灵活了。",
	"The Eternal Flame appeals to those drawn to destruction for its own sake. Creatures of elemental fire are most likely to take up this reckless philosophy; even non-intelligent fire monsters sense the reckless lust for destruction lurking in the hearts of fire cultists and consider Eternal Flame believers to be their allies.": "永恒之火吸引着那些为了毁灭而被吸引的人。火元素的生物最有可能接受这种鲁莽的哲学；甚至非智能的火怪也能感觉到潜伏在火崇拜者心中的鲁莽的毁灭欲望，并认为永恒之焰的信徒是他们的盟友。",
	"The symbol of the fire cult is reminiscent of a bowl-like brazier with a burning flame. Fire cultists sometimes identify themselves with a symbolic hand sign: holding one hand in a fist, thumb up, and laying the other hand over the fist as if to cover the bowl but allow the flame to show. Members of the cult can also be identified by their burn scars.": "火崇拜的标志让人联想到一个碗状的钎子，上面有燃烧的火焰。火崇拜者有时会用一个象征性的手势来表明自己的身份：一只手握拳，拇指向上，另一只手放在拳头上，好像要盖住碗，但允许火焰露出来。该邪教的成员也可以通过他们的烧伤疤痕来识别。",
	"Fire cultists are impetuous, hot-tempered, and violent. They aren't mindless savages; their impetuousness also encompasses fiendish inventiveness and a drive to devise new tools for their mad cause. They are masters of fire and forge, taking captives to work in their infernal foundries. Fire cultists see conquest and enslavement of the weak as necessary steps in bringing about the chaos they intend to unleash on the world.": "火崇拜者是急躁的、脾气暴躁的和暴力的。他们不是无意识的野蛮人；他们的急躁也包含了恶魔般的创造力和为他们的疯狂事业设计新工具的动力。他们是火和锻造的大师，会把俘虏带到他们的地狱铸造厂里工作。火崇拜者认为征服和奴役弱者是实现他们打算在世界范围内释放的混乱的必要步骤。",
	"In battle, fire cultists launch sudden, overwhelming assaults. They throw themselves into reckless attacks with no regard for their own lives, seeking to cause as much damage as possible before falling. They are fearless and would rather die fighting among a mob of enemies than retreat a single step.": "在战斗中，火崇拜者发起突然的、压倒性的攻击。他们不顾自己的生命，不顾一切地投入攻击，力求在倒下之前造成尽可能多的伤害。他们无所畏惧，宁可死在一群敌人中战斗，也不愿意退缩一步。",
	"Followers of the Eternal Flame cult surround themselves with the largest fires they can create. Their favorite tactic involves using magic to open volcanic fissures or vents and channel flows of molten rock. Widespread arson and deliberately set forest fires are acceptable alternatives. Most fire cultists believe that something important and beautiful should be set on fire every day, or else they're just not doing their part.": "永恒之火邪教的追随者用他们能创造的最大的火包围自己。他们最喜欢的策略是用魔法打开火山裂缝或通风口，引导熔岩流动。广泛的纵火和故意设置的森林大火是可以接受的替代方法。大多数火崇拜者认为，一些重要而美丽的东西应该每天都被点燃，否则他们就是没有尽到自己的责任。",

In her youth, she learned to dance for coin and slowly worked her way up from the wine sinks of the laborers' districts to the elegant chambers of the city's nobles. She mastered minor fire magic to distinguish herself from other dancers and incorporated flame into her routine. Her talents grew, and soon she caught the eye of a pasha and became his concubine. But even as she enjoyed the gifts he lavished on her, {@creature Vanifer|PotA} hated the pasha for seeing her as a mere trophy. She left before long, robbing the pasha of a small fortune in jewelry and setting fire to his palace.": "{@creature Vanifer|PotA}在卡里姆波特最贫穷的地区出生和长大，只靠她狡猾的智慧武装。在她年轻的时候，她学会了为钱而跳舞，并慢慢地从劳工区的酒池子里爬到了城市贵族的优雅房间里。她掌握了小的火魔法，以区别于其他舞者，并将火焰融入她的舞步。她的才能不断增长，很快她就引起了一位帕夏的注意，并成为他的妾。但即使她享受着他给她的礼物，{@creature Vanifer|PotA}也憎恨那个帕夏把她看作是一个单纯的战利品。她不久就离开了，抢走了帕夏的一小笔珠宝，并放火烧了他的宫殿。",

There she remained until a few months ago, when dreams and visions impelled her to seek out a lost dungeon in the North. On the altar of a forgotten temple she found the dagger {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, imbued with the power of {@creature Imix|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Fire.

	"Eternal Flame cultists detest the followers of the Crushing Wave. They see the water cultists as slippery and untrustworthy, perhaps even cowardly—after all, the Crushing Wave retreats quickly from opposition and seeks the path of least resistance before committing its strength. The earth cultists are stolid and courageous, but maddeningly slow to act. The cultists of the Howling Hatred share the fire cult's impulse to act swiftly and show many of the same qualities of inventiveness and creativity in the service of Elemental Evil.": "永恒之火的崇拜者厌恶破碎之浪的追随者。在他们看来，水崇拜者滑头，不值得信任，甚至可能是懦弱的--毕竟，破碎浪潮在遇到反对时迅速撤退，在投入力量之前寻求阻力最小的路径。大地邪教的人固执而勇敢，但行动却慢得令人抓狂。嚎叫之恨的邪教徒与火邪教徒一样有迅速行动的冲动，并在为元素之恶服务时表现出许多同样的发明和创造的品质。",
	"The Cult of the Howling Hatred appeals to those who deal in perceptions over facts: illusionists, spies, and assassins, for example.

Hippogriffs, griffons, and giant vultures are frequently used as air cult steeds.": "仇恨嚎叫教吸引了那些以感知而非事实为交易对象的人：比如说幻术师、间谍和刺客。任何种类的掠夺性或凶猛的有翼生物，甚至是那些原本会抵制训练的无知觉的怪物，都会把空气崇拜者视为盟友并与他们合作。河马、狮鹫和巨大的秃鹰经常被用作空气崇拜者的坐骑。",
	"The symbol of elemental air is an inverted triangle with three branching lines above it. Some believe it stands for the funnel cloud of a tornado, while others see it as the superiority of winged creatures over the ground. Some maintain it is an ancient rune that stands for the elemental lord {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}. Whatever their interpretations, the air cultists use the symbol as a secret password of sorts. By touching the thumbs and little fingers together and closing the rest of the fingers into a fist, an air cultist forms an inverted triangle that is a mark of membership in the cult.": "空气元素的象征是一个倒三角形，上面有三条分支线。有些人认为它代表着龙卷风的漏斗云，而其他人则认为它是有翼生物对地面的优势。有些人坚持认为它是一个古老的符文，代表着元素之主（%0%）。无论他们的解释是什么，空气崇拜者都把这个符号作为一种秘密的密码。通过将大拇指和小拇指碰在一起，并将其余手指合拢成拳头，空气崇拜者形成一个倒三角形，这是崇拜者的标志。",

In her dreams she began to envision herself as one of the winged elves from her storybooks. She wished to control the wind and go wherever she liked, and to punish those who offended her. The childlike fantasies of her youth became dark visions where she ruled the storms and the air itself. She dreamed of an old mystic with brown skin and white hair, who promised to teach her all she desired to know—a vision of {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Air. Aerisi turned her study to elemental air, learning the secret of flight and escaping Evereska to follow the deluded visions of her dreams.": "爱丽斯在月精灵中感到无能为力。虽然她在精灵界已经成为一个熟练的魔法师，但她的人民对这种魅力有抵触。在她的梦中，她开始把自己想象成故事书中的有翼精灵之一。她希望能控制风，去她喜欢的地方，并惩罚那些冒犯她的人。她年轻时的童真幻想变成了黑暗的幻觉，在那里她统治着风暴和空气本身。她梦见一个棕色皮肤和白色头发的老神秘主义者，他答应教给她所有她想知道的东西--这是邪恶空气王子{@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}的愿景。爱丽斯将她的研究转向了空气元素，学会了飞行的秘密，并逃离了埃弗里斯卡，追随她梦中的妄想。",

	"No one can deny Aerisi's grace, but she also possesses a violent temper that reveals itself whenever she is denied what she wants. Aerisi is prone to flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She doesn't see herself as evil because she lacks the capacity to empathize with anyone else. Those who worship and please her are good, and those who defy her are wicked and must be punished. Her wish to lash the world with storms and destruction is, at its root, a temper tantrum against the elven society that dared to impose its strictures on her.": "没有人可以否认艾里西的优雅，但她也拥有一个暴躁的脾气，每当她被剥夺了她想要的东西时，她就会暴露出来。爱丽斯容易胡思乱想，冲动颓废。她不认为自己是邪恶的，因为她缺乏同情别人的能力。那些崇拜和取悦她的人是好的，而那些违抗她的人是邪恶的，必须受到惩罚。她希望用风暴和毁灭来冲击世界，从根本上说，是对敢于对她强加限制的精灵社会的一种发脾气行为。",
	"The cultists of the Howling Hatred find the Black Earth cultists to be coarse, rude, unimaginative, and stubborn to the point of stupidity. Most offensively, the earth cultists are bluntly unimpressed by the Howling Hatred cult and its achievements. Followers of the Crushing Wave are more flexible and inventive, but they are crass mercenaries and likewise too pragmatic to appreciate the finer points of the air cult's philosophy. The Eternal Flame is the best of the lot, since the fire cultists share the decisiveness and creative energy of the Howling Hatred cult, even if they are overly proud and aggressive.": "嚎叫之恨的邪教徒认为黑土邪教徒粗糙、粗鲁、缺乏想象力，而且顽固到愚蠢的地步。最令人反感的是，大地崇拜者对嚎叫之恨邪教及其成就直言不讳地不以为然。碎浪的追随者更灵活、更有创造力，但他们是粗俗的雇佣兵，同样也太务实，无法欣赏空气邪教哲学的精髓。永恒之火是其中的佼佼者，因为火崇拜者分享了嚎叫之恨邪教的果断和创造能量，尽管他们过于骄傲和好斗。",

	"Throughout the adventure, each encounter presents monster names in bold. This is a visual cue pointing you to look up the monster's stat block.

	"The rise of Elemental Evil in Faerûn begins in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and uninhabited wilderness just a week's journey from Waterdeep. Nothing of note to the wider world has happened here for hundreds of years. The frontier long ago receded farther northward, leaving behind a quiet backwater littered with ruins. These days, the Dessarin Valley has little in common with the popular conception of the Savage Frontier. Winters are hard here, but the hordes of orcs and other hungry monsters are a long way off from these parts.": "元素之恶在法鲁恩的兴起始于德萨林谷，这是一个由商队城镇、孤立的家园和无人居住的荒野组成的轻度定居地区，距离沃特德普只有一周的路程。几百年来，这里没有发生过任何值得注意的事情。边境早已向北退去，留下了一片安静的落后地区，到处都是废墟。如今，德萨林谷与流行概念中的野蛮边境没有什么共同之处。这里的冬天很艰苦，但成群的兽人和其他饥饿的怪物离这些地方很远。",
	"If the Dessarin Valley isn't quite as wild and lawless as it once was, it's still lightly settled territory that serves as a route to distant lands. Residents in places such as Red Larch or Triboar boast that their humble settlements are \"the Gateway to the North.\" Through these lands pass hundreds of caravans and keelboats each year, linking the great ports of Waterdeep and Neverwinter with places such as Everlund, Mirabar, or Silverymoon. The steady caravan traffic breathes life into the towns of this area, supporting businesses in the settlements along the Long Road. Inns cater to travelers anxious to sleep safely within sturdy walls and enjoy good food by a warm fire instead of camping by the side of the road.": "如果说德萨林谷不像以前那样野蛮和无法无天，它仍然是轻度定居的领土，是通往远方的通道。红落叶松或特里波尔等地的居民吹嘘说，他们简陋的定居点是 \"通往北方的门户\"。每年有数以百计的商队和龙骨船通过这些土地，将水底城和永夜城的大港口与埃弗隆德、米拉巴尔或银月城等地连接起来。稳定的商队交通为这一地区的城镇注入了活力，支持了长路沿线定居点的商业。旅店迎合了那些急于在坚固的墙内安全入睡的旅行者，在温暖的火堆旁享受美食，而不是在路边露营。",
	"In addition to catering to caravans and travelers heading to or from the far North, the Dessarin Valley is a breadbasket for the hungry populations of Waterdeep and Neverwinter. The farms and pastures of the area produce grain, livestock, poultry, apples, and hops, then ship them downriver (or drive them down the Long Road) to the coast. Few people become rich from farming, but farmers in the region do well for themselves provided the weather cooperates. (That's one reason why the unusual weather lately has been a concern.)": "除了满足前往或来自遥远的北方的商队和旅行者的需求外，德萨林谷还是沃特德普和永冬的饥饿人口的粮仓。该地区的农场和牧场生产谷物、牲畜、家禽、苹果和啤酒花，然后将它们顺流而下（或沿长路行驶）运往海岸。很少有人靠种地致富，但只要天气好，该地区的农民就能过上好日子。(这就是为什么最近的异常天气令人担忧的原因之一）。",
	"Most people who live in the Dessarin Valley have no idea of its long history. Old-timers nodding sagely by the hearths of the local taprooms sometimes observe, \"These lands, they have old bones.\" Most locals have no idea of how right they are.": "生活在德萨林谷的大多数人都不知道它的悠久历史。在当地自来水厂的壁炉旁，老一辈人不时地点头称是：\"这些土地，他们有古老的骨头\"。大多数当地人不知道他们是多么正确。",
	"While some truly ancient ruins in this area go back to the days of the first great elf kingdoms, none of these figure into the story of this adventure. The earliest realm that does is the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer, which was founded nearly six thousand years ago in −4420 DR. Its existence is so far back in the mists of history that only a handful of non-dwarf sages have even heard of it. Most people of the Dessarin Valley don't know Besilmer at all, but they are familiar with two of its works: the engineering marvel known as the Stone Bridge (described later in this chapter) and the crumbling ruins known as the Halls of the Hunting Axe.": "虽然这个地区的一些真正的古代遗迹可以追溯到第一个伟大的精灵王国的时代，但这些都没有出现在这次冒险的故事中。最早的王国是贝西尔默（Besilmer）的盾牌矮人王国，它建立于-4420 DR的近六千年前。它的存在在历史的迷雾中是如此遥远，以至于只有少数非矮人的圣人听说过它。德萨林谷的大多数人根本不知道贝西尔默，但他们熟悉它的两个作品：被称为石桥的工程奇迹（在本章后面描述）和被称为猎斧大厅的破败废墟。",
	"The realm of Besilmer was something rare: a dwarven kingdom built on the surface, with its strength measured in fields and pastures. It prospered for a time but was plagued by trolls and giants. The dwarves were obliged to build a stronghold underground, carving out the fortress-city of Tyar-Besil a century after Besilmer's founding. Unfortunately for the dwarves, the realm collapsed after its king and founder died in battle. Most of the surviving dwarves sought safer lands. The dwarven city beneath the Sumber Hills was abandoned by −4160 DR and then forgotten.": "贝西尔默王国是一个罕见的东西：一个建立在地表的矮人王国，它的力量以田地和牧场来衡量。它繁荣了一段时间，但却受到巨魔和巨人的困扰。矮人不得不在地下建造一个据点，在贝西尔默建立一个世纪后，建造了泰尔-贝西尔堡垒城市。对矮人来说，不幸的是，在其国王和创始人战死后，这个王国就崩溃了。大多数幸存的矮人寻求更安全的土地。桑伯山下的矮人城市在-4160 DR时被遗弃，然后被遗忘。",
	"Tyar-Besil slumbered in darkness for many long centuries, occasionally discovered and occupied by monsters or ambitious miners, only to be abandoned again. It came to light again in 893 DR, when a group of adventurers who called themselves the Knights of the Silver Horn discovered the ruins. Over the next six years they returned again and again, eventually founding strongholds of their own to safeguard the hidden entrances to the sprawling dungeon.": "Tyar-Besil在黑暗中沉睡了许多个世纪，偶尔被怪物或野心勃勃的矿工发现并占领，然后又被遗弃。公元893年，一群自称银角骑士的冒险家发现了这片废墟，它再次出现在人们眼前。在接下来的六年里，他们一次又一次地返回，最终建立了自己的据点，以保护这个庞大的地下城的隐藏入口。",
	"The knights had some success in clearing small domains in the wild Sumber Hills, but only a few years later the powerful orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt arose nearby, and the Dessarin Valley became a battlefield. Trouble followed on trouble: the Orcfastings War, the First and Second Trollwars, and finally a series of vicious drow raids. By the year 942 DR, human settlements in the Dessarin Valley had been all but wiped out, and the Knights of the Silver Horn were no more. Their strongholds crumbled into ruin and became known in later years as the Haunted Keeps. Eventually, no one remembered who built them or why.": "骑士们在清理野生桑伯山的小块领地时取得了一些成功，但仅仅几年后，附近出现了强大的兽人王国乌鲁斯-乌克雷特，德萨林谷成为了战场。麻烦接踵而至：兽人战争、第一和第二次巨魔战争，最后是一系列邪恶的鸦人袭击。到公元942年，德萨林谷的人类定居点几乎被消灭了，银角骑士团也不复存在。他们的据点坍塌成了废墟，在后来被称为 \"闹鬼的堡垒\"。最终，没有人记得是谁建造了它们，也没有人记得为什么。",
	"The current wave of settlement in and around the Dessarin Valley began after 1000 DR, coinciding with Waterdeep's growth from a warlord's stronghold into a major city. The first small outposts that would grow into places such as Red Larch and Triboar were carved out of a wild and untamed land. People resettling the Dessarin Valley found the remains of \"kingdoms of old\" scattered here and there throughout the area.": "目前在德萨林谷及其周围的定居浪潮始于1000 DR之后，与沃特德普从一个军阀的据点成长为一个主要城市相吻合。第一批小的前哨站，后来发展成红松和特里波尔这样的地方，都是在一片荒芜的土地上开凿出来的。重新定居在德萨林谷的人们发现 \"古老的王国 \"的遗迹散落在整个地区。",
	"The people of the Forgotten Realms number the years by the Dalereckoning calendar, which is abbreviated \"DR.\" Years are also given names, which are drawn from the writings of a great seer from long ago. The adventure is set in 1491 DR, the Year of the Scarlet Witch.": "被遗忘国度的人们用达勒克宁历法对年份进行编号，缩写为 \"DR\"。年份也被赋予了名称，这些名称来自于很久以前一位伟大的预言家的著作。这场冒险的背景是1491年，即猩红女巫之年。",
	"Each month consists of three ten-day long weeks called tendays. People refer to tendays the way people in other worlds refer to weeks.": "每个月由三个为期十天的星期组成，称为tendays。人们用其他世界的人指称周的方式来指称 tendays。",
	"Minor issues are nothing unusual in the Dessarin Valley. Bands of savage humanoids from the Sword Mountains or the Evermoors occasionally raid here. Human barbarians known as the Uthgardt roam these lands, and the more aggressive tribes can be very dangerous. Bandits sometimes gather in the lonelier parts of the vale to waylay caravans traveling the Long Road or the Kheldell Path. Every now and then reckless or unlucky adventurers manage to stir up some ancient curse in the ruins scattered around the area. Constables of valley settlements are usually up to the task of restoring the peace.": "在德萨林谷，小问题并不罕见。一群来自剑山或常春藤的野蛮人偶尔会袭击这里。被称为 \"乌斯加特\"（Uthgardt）的人类野蛮人在这些土地上游荡，而那些更具侵略性的部落可能非常危险。强盗们有时会聚集在山谷中较孤独的地方，劫持在长路或克尔德尔路径上旅行的商队。时不时地，鲁莽或不幸运的冒险者会设法在散落在该地区的废墟中挑起一些古老的诅咒。山谷居民点的警员们通常都能完成恢复和平的任务。",
	"Six months ago, an insidious new threat began to grow in the area, unsuspected by the locals or any passing adventurers. Dreams and visions drew four elemental prophets, one by one, to the Fane of the Eye beneath the Sumber Hills. Each prophet began to gather like-minded followers. Strangers trickled into the Dessarin Valley in ones or twos. Some were already cultists of Elemental Evil, eager to build a place where they could openly practice their vile rites. Others were brutal thugs, power-hungry dabblers in forbidden magic, or fanatics lured by the call of evil. At first the cultists valued secrecy above all else, but as their numbers grew and they established their strongholds, they turned their attention to expanding their hold on the Dessarin Valley.": "六个月前，一个阴险的新威胁开始在该地区增长，当地人和任何过路的冒险者都没有察觉。梦境和幻觉吸引了四位元素先知，一个接一个地来到桑伯山下的眼之神殿。每个先知都开始收集志同道合的追随者。陌生人三三两两地涌入德萨林谷。有些人已经是邪恶元素的崇拜者，渴望建立一个他们可以公开进行卑鄙仪式的地方。其他人则是残忍的暴徒、渴望权力的禁忌魔法爱好者，或者被邪恶的召唤所吸引的狂热分子。起初，邪教分子把保密工作看得比什么都重要，但随着他们人数的增加和据点的建立，他们把注意力转向了扩大对德萨林谷的控制。",
	"The presence of so many malefactors has caused a spate of banditry, kidnappings, murders, and raids. The cultists have also upset the weather in the region. All of these occurrences continue to worsen over the course of the adventure until the characters locate and clean out the four elemental cults in the Temple of Elemental Evil.": "这么多恶棍的存在引起了一连串的强盗行为、绑架、谋杀和突袭。这些邪教分子还破坏了该地区的天气。在冒险过程中，所有这些事件都会继续恶化，直到人物找到并清除了元素邪恶神殿中的四个元素邪教。",
	"Red Larch has been an important stop on the Long Road for two centuries now. Named for a distinctive stand of red larch trees that were cut down when the hamlet was founded, Red Larch became a settlement in the first place thanks to a drinkable spring that fed a sizable pond ideal for watering horses, oxen, and pack mules.": "两个世纪以来，红落叶松一直是长征路上的一个重要站点。红落叶松因其独特的红落叶松树而得名，这些树在小村庄建立时被砍伐，红落叶松之所以成为一个定居点，首先是由于有一个可饮用的泉水，它为一个适合浇灌马匹、牛和骡子的可观的池塘提供水源。",
	"An east-west trail meets the Long Road at the pond, running west to the logging community of Kheldell and east to Bargewright Inn and eventually Secomber. Another trail leads to quarries in the Sumber Hills and to ruins of stone keeps long ago left to monsters and outlaws (the Haunted Keeps).": "一条东西向的小路在池塘边与长路相接，向西延伸到伐木社区克尔德尔，向东延伸到巴格莱特旅馆，最终延伸到塞康伯。另一条小路通向桑伯山的采石场和很久以前留给怪物和逃犯的石堡遗址（闹鬼的堡垒）。",
	"In recent years, new quarries have been opened on the northwestern edge of town. So far these have yielded up great slabs of marble much prized in Waterdeep for facing large new buildings and repairing older edifices. Red Larch is also a center for stonecutters quarrying slate on the fringes of the Sumber Hills.": "近年来，新的采石场已经在城市的西北边缘开张了。到目前为止，这些采石场已经产出了大量的大理石板，在沃特迪普非常珍贵，可以用来建造大型的新建筑和修复旧建筑。红松也是石匠的中心，他们在桑伯山的边缘开采石板。",
	"While Red Larch remains prosperous, dark omens are appearing. The heart of the Sumber Hills has become far more dangerous, with monsters lurking seemingly everywhere (no one goes into the hills berry-picking or hare-hunting these days, though Red Larcher children traditionally did so daily in summer and fall). Banditry is on the rise, and the weather seems to be getting more severe and more unpredictable. Several Red Larcher shepherds have seen strange figures watching them from distant hillsides in the wild fields east of town where they have traditionally grazed their flocks. Quarry workers used to cut by torchlight when orders were backing up but do so no longer, shunning the pits by night. They are spooked by rumors of dark-robed figures in stone masks lurking in the darkness beyond the torchlight. The townsfolk fear that dangerous times are at hand, but no one seems to know what to do about it.": "虽然红洛奇仍然很繁荣，但黑暗的预兆正在出现。桑伯山的中心地带变得更加危险，似乎到处都潜伏着怪物（现在没有人去山上采摘浆果或狩猎野兔了，尽管红落叶山的孩子们在夏秋两季传统上每天都这样做）。土匪活动在增加，天气似乎变得更加恶劣，更加不可预测。有几个红军牧民看到奇怪的身影，在镇子东边的野地里从远处的山坡上看着他们，他们传统上在那里放牧。采石场工人曾经在订单增加时用手电筒切割，但现在不再这样做了，他们在夜间避开矿坑。他们被火炬之外的黑暗中潜伏着的戴着石头面具的黑袍人的传言吓坏了。镇民们担心危险的时刻即将来临，但似乎没有人知道该怎么做。",
	"To the average citizen of Waterdeep, Red Larch is known only for crumblecake, a local specialty. This much-maligned but hearty food is useful on the trail: baked loaves of turkey and wildfowl scraps, nuts, and chopped roots and greens, mixed in a chickpea mash. It is bland at the best of times, but badly made crumblecake tastes terrible.": "对于沃特迪普的普通公民来说，红松只因当地的特产--碎石饼而闻名。这种饱受诟病但却很丰盛的食物在路上很有用：由火鸡和野禽下脚料、坚果、切碎的根茎和绿色植物烤成的面包，混在鹰嘴豆泥中。在最好的情况下，它是平淡无奇的，但做得不好的碎肉饼味道就很糟糕。",
	"The inhabitants of Red Larch have become so frightened by the recent \"dark doings\" that rather than showing typical frontier reticence, they helpfully babble about everything they've seen and heard. Most hope to convince adventurers to investigate and put an end to the current troubles.": "红落叶松的居民已经被最近的 \"黑暗行动 \"吓坏了，他们没有表现出典型的边疆沉默，而是帮助地讲述他们所看到和听到的一切。大多数人希望能说服冒险者进行调查，结束目前的麻烦。",

	"A dozen of the Red Larch town elders have a secret: They belong to a secret society that calls itself \"the Believers.\" It isn't quite a cult, although it has special ceremonies and rites passed down for generations. It isn't quite a civic organization, despite the fact that some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in Red Larch are members. The members of the Believers use their secret association to guide town affairs, plot against business competitors, and sometimes take care of people who cause problems when it becomes clear that \"something must be done\" for the good of the town.": "红松镇的十几位长者有一个秘密：他们属于一个自称为 \"信徒 \"的秘密社团。它并不完全是一个邪教，尽管它有世代相传的特殊仪式和典礼。它也不完全是一个民间组织，尽管事实上红落叶山的一些最富有和最有权势的人都是成员。信徒会的成员利用他们的秘密协会来指导镇上的事务，策划反对商业竞争者，有时为了镇上的利益，在明确 \"必须做些什么 \"的情况下，也会解决那些造成问题的人。",
	"The Believers formed years ago when local miners discovered a secret underground chamber beneath the town. Strange things happened in the chamber, such as heavy stones levitating and moving about when no one was around (this is described in chapter 6, in the \"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x}\" adventure). The miners began using the chamber to honor those who died in quarry accidents and to appease Beshaba, goddess of misfortune and accidents. The Believers gather secretly at the tomb once every nine nights to see if any stones have moved—and if any have, they covertly meet the next night to discuss what the movements mean, and what is to be done. They keep the tomb and its strange secret to themselves.": "多年前，当地的矿工在镇子下面发现了一个秘密的地下密室，于是信徒们就形成了。在这个密室里发生了一些奇怪的事情，比如当周围没有人的时候，沉重的石头会悬浮起来并移动（这在第六章的\"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x} \"冒险中有所描述）。矿工们开始用这个密室来纪念那些死于采石场事故的人，并安抚Beshaba，不幸和事故的女神。信徒们每隔九天晚上都会秘密聚集在坟墓前，看看是否有石头移动--如果有，他们会在第二天晚上秘密会面，讨论这些移动意味着什么，以及该怎么做。他们对坟墓和它的奇怪的秘密保持沉默。",

Inside are stretching racks, cutting tables with sharp knives and scraps of tanned hide, a back room of finished leather ready for sale, and six huge, open-topped vats containing various foul-smelling, caustic liquids used in tanning.": "这个前仓库散发着令人瞠目结舌、令人窒息的臭味，在这里的一箭之地，所有其他气味都被湮没了。里面有拉伸架、摆放着锋利刀具的切割台和晒好的皮料碎片、一间准备出售的成品皮革的密室，以及六个巨大的敞口大桶，里面装着用于制革的各种恶臭的腐蚀性液体。",
	"The proprietor is Ulhro Luruth (male Chondathan human {@creature commoner}). He can't smell a thing, thanks to years of working in tanneries. He and his five loyal, terse assistants live and work here.": "经营者是乌尔罗-鲁鲁斯（男性崇丹人（%0%））。由于多年来在制革厂工作，他什么都闻不到。他和他的五个忠诚的、简练的助手在这里生活和工作。",
	"Luruth is one of the Believers. He knows he's not supposed to talk with outsiders about the secret society, but he's not too bright and might assume that questioners know more than they do.": "路路通是信徒之一。他知道自己不应该与外人谈论这个秘密社团，但他不太聪明，可能会认为提问者比自己知道的更多。",
	"Four identical, well-built warehouses stand here in ground covered in raked gravel and cinders. The moment anyone sets foot past the sign that says \"Bethendur's Storage/Rent Space by tenday, month, or year,\" a tall, smiling man emerges to meet them. This is Aerego Bethendur (male Tethyrian human {@creature noble}). He is assisted by three burly clerks and porters, who are former mercenary thugs.": "四个相同的、建好的仓库矗立在这里，地面上铺满了耙过的碎石和煤渣。当任何人踏过写着 \"贝特恩德的仓库/按天、按月、按年出租空间 \"的牌子时，一个高大的、面带微笑的男人就出现在他们面前。这就是艾瑞戈-贝瑟杜尔（男性泰特里亚人（%0%））。他身边有三个魁梧的文员和搬运工，他们都是前雇佣兵的打手。",
	"Aerego asks no questions, so anything can be stored here.

If they contain dead bodies (rare, but it happens), Aerego burns them without a word to the constable or anyone else.": "艾瑞格不问问题，所以任何东西都可以存放在这里。储存的物品如果没有移动或冲出容器，就会被严格地搁置起来，尽管那些开始有死亡气息的箱子会被拿出来打开。如果箱子里有尸体（很少见，但会发生），Aerego会把它们烧掉，不会对警员或其他人说一句话。",
	"Aerego is a Believer, although his attendance is spotty and he is beginning to wonder what exactly the mysterious priest Larrakh (see \"{@adventure The Tomb of Moving Stones|PotA|5|Tomb of Moving Stones}\" in chapter 6) has in mind for Red Larch.": "艾瑞格是一名信徒，尽管他的出席率很低，而且他开始怀疑神秘的牧师拉雷克（见第六章中的\"{@adventure The Tomb of Moving Stones|PotA|5|Tomb of Moving Stones}\"）对红叶松到底有什么想法。",

	"On the other nine days of the tenday, only one Red Larcher is here, a half-orc named Grund. Grund (male half-orc {@creature thug}) is the village simpleton.

	"Grund is a happy, dim-witted sort. The other vendors all pilfer from his open pickling vats, and he cheerfully lets them.

	"Aside from the bewildering profusion of doors, barrels, rotting old furniture, and tools leaning against its outside walls, this building looks like a private home.

He's the only vendor in town selling blank books and parchment.": "恩德瑞斯-瓦利沃（男性，泰特里亚人（%0%））是一个退休的商队商人，出售新旧商品：家具、灯具、地毯、镜子、武器、盾牌、头盔，以及其他一些东西。几乎任何东西都可以在这里买到，埋藏在一堆其他的东西下面，瓦利弗的脑子里有一个很好的运行清单。他是镇上唯一出售空白书籍和羊皮纸的商贩。",

He is friendly toward the Harpers and shares all of what he sees and hears with any Harper who asks. He is a useful, loyal informant and contact, though he's not really cut out for any derring-do.": "恩德利斯是一个害羞的、乱跑的小人，他雇用了一小队当地的孩子。他听说了大部分的传言和怪物的踪迹，但不知道--也不想知道--到底发生了什么。然而，他认真地观察和倾听。他对哈珀人很友好，并将他所看到和听到的一切与任何询问的哈珀人分享。他是一个有用的、忠诚的线人和联络人，尽管他并不真正适合做任何危险的事情。",
	"If one or more characters seem interested in helping the town with its recent troubles, Endrith says, \"I don't know if it's relevant, but I overheard someone say that they saw a skull pinned to a tree with a black arrow, like some kind of dire warning or ill omen.

	"Endrith bought a strange old book from a passing merchant just a couple of days ago. The book is a beautifully illuminated manuscript written in Dwarvish. Endrith doesn't read Dwarvish, so he doesn't know what is in it; a character who can read the words can tell that it's a genealogical history of the dwarf clans of Mirabar. If asked how he got it, Endrith explains that he bought it from a peddler passing through town. The peddler told Endrith that he bought it from a shady keelboat skipper in Womford, who had somehow come by a dozen similar books. (If the characters investigate, this leads to the \"{@area Womford Rats|127|x}\" encounter in chapter 3.) Endrith is willing to sell the tome for 50 gp, although he lets a Harper have it for 25 gp.": "恩德利斯几天前刚从一个路过的商人那里买了一本奇怪的古书。这本书是一本用矮人语写的精美的照明手稿。恩德瑞斯不懂矮人语，所以他不知道里面写的是什么；能读懂字的人可以看出这是一本米拉巴尔矮人氏族的家谱。如果问他是如何得到它的，恩德瑞斯解释说，他是从一个路过城镇的小贩那里买的。小贩告诉恩德瑞斯，他是从沃姆福德的一个阴暗的龙骨船船长那里买的，他不知怎么搞到了一打类似的书。(如果人物进行调查，这将导致第三章中的\"{@area Womford Rats|127|x} \"遭遇。) 恩德瑞斯愿意以50戈比的价格出售这本巨著，不过他以25戈比的价格让一个哈珀人得到了它。",
	"If you run the \"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x}\" adventure in chapter 6, the exposure of the Believers leads to some big changes. Even if the Believers can avoid a murder investigation, the folk of Red Larch are scandalized to learn that many of their most respected fellow citizens were part of a secret cabal. This discovery launches a whirlwind of gossip, innuendo, and recrimination.": "如果你执行第六章的\"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x} \"冒险，信徒们的暴露导致了一些大的变化。即使信徒们能够避免谋杀案的调查，红落叶城的人们也会因为得知他们中许多最受尊敬的同胞是一个秘密集团的成员而感到羞愧。这一发现掀起了一场流言蜚语、影射和指责的旋风。",
	"The other citizens of Red Larch shun the Believers for the next several months, and the Believers turn against one another. Many retreat into seclusion. Leadership of Red Larch passes to Harburk, but he's too busy as constable. After a month, Jalessa Ornra becomes Red Larch's mayor. She's liked and known for common sense, so the townsfolk rally around her.": "在接下来的几个月里，红松镇的其他市民都避开了信徒，而信徒们则互相对立。许多人退缩到隐居中。红松镇的领导权传给了哈伯克，但他作为治安官太忙了。一个月后，贾丽萨-奥恩拉成为红松镇的镇长。她很受欢迎，以常识著称，所以镇民们都拥护她。",

	"At the beginning of the adventure, the player characters know they are up against a mysterious threat. Something isn't right in the Dessarin Valley. To find out what exactly threatens these lands, they must leave Red Larch and venture out into the wider vale. Much of the early action of the adventure involves visiting different sites in and around the valley, solving problems and digging up clues that can lead the party to the Haunted Keeps—and then on to their confrontation with the elemental cults and the discovery of the temple complex below the Sumber Hills.": "在冒险开始时，玩家角色知道他们正面临着一个神秘的威胁。在德萨林谷，有些事情是不对的。为了弄清到底是什么在威胁着这些土地，他们必须离开红落叶松，到更广阔的山谷中去冒险。冒险的早期行动大多涉及到访问山谷及其周围的不同地点，解决问题并挖掘线索，从而将他们引向闹鬼堡垒--然后是他们与元素邪教的对抗以及发现桑伯山下的神庙群。",
	"It can take a full tenday for a slow-moving group—say, a merchant caravan—to trudge from Red Larch to Triboar. The Dessarin River is an obstacle to any group without a boat, since no crossing can be found between Ironford and the Stone Bridge.": "一个行动缓慢的团队--比如说，一个商队--从红落叶到特里波尔，可能需要整整一个工作日。德萨林河对任何没有船的队伍来说都是一个障碍，因为在铁佛和石桥之间找不到渡口。",

Within spitting distance of the statue is the Stag-Horned Flagon, a cozy tavern.": "在小镇广场的一角，矗立着大沙兰，这是一匹很久以前在安菲勒饲养的著名战马的黑石雕像。这匹被恶作剧者阉割的马，经常被兴致勃勃的当地人涂上鲜艳的颜色。孩子们被允许向栖息在石像上的鸟儿投掷石块，以保持石像没有粪便。孩子们经常自己爬上马背，紧紧抓住高高的、倾斜的马鞍，挥舞着手臂，指挥着想象中的军队作战。在雕像的不远处是鹿角酒馆，一个舒适的酒馆。",
	"Great Shalarn is a popular place to leave cryptic messages, either tucked under the statue's hind hooves or slid between the sculpted curls of its tail.": "大沙拉恩是一个很受欢迎的地方，可以留下隐秘的信息，要么塞在雕像的后蹄下，要么滑落在雕像尾巴的雕刻卷曲之间。",

	"Bargewright Inn reeks of manure and filthy mud. It houses blacksmiths, dealers who buy and sell horses, mules, and oxen, wheelwrights, coopers, and wagonmakers. It has inns, stables, and warehouses, and two concentric rings of high protective walls with gates that are firmly closed and barred by night. (Individuals can pay stiff fees to be raised and lowered after sunset on rope-slung chairs, but nothing beyond what they can carry can pass.)": "巴格莱特旅馆散发着粪便和肮脏的泥土的味道。它容纳了铁匠、买卖马匹、骡子和牛的商人、车轮工、库珀和马车制造商。它有客栈、马厩和仓库，还有两道同心环形的高大防护墙，大门紧闭，晚上有栅栏。(个人可以支付高昂的费用，在日落后坐在绳索吊椅上升降，但超出他们所能携带的东西都不能通过）。",
	"Bargewright Inn fell under Zhentarim influence a few years ago. Any member or ally of that faction can find a discreet welcome (and few or low fees) within its walls. The Zhentarim spy on everyone, even each other (or as one merchant put it, \"especially each other\"). Bargewright Inn is ruled by a plutocracy of business owners, most of whom are in the pockets of the Zhentarim.

It's also home to a tanner, a smith, some horse dealers and trainers who keep extensive stables, and an inn: the venerable, popular, and several-times-expanded Watchful Knight. The inn was originally named for an inoperative helmed horror that stood in the common room, but the creature mysteriously vanished years ago. The innkeeper went missing shortly thereafter.": "贝利亚德是许多牧民的家，他们的牛群在周围的山上游荡，特别是在东部。村里有一口公共水井，还有一个池塘，可以把拴好的马或牛赶到水里洗澡，赶走苍蝇，并让它们喝水。这里还有一个皮匠、一个铁匠、一些马贩子和驯马师，他们拥有大量的马厩，以及一家客栈：古老的、受欢迎的、几经扩建的守望骑士。这家旅店最初是以矗立在公共房间里的一个无法使用的头盔恐怖物命名的，但这个生物在几年前神秘地消失了。此后不久，旅馆老板也失踪了。",
	"In recent years, bodyguards and mercenaries formerly active in Waterdeep and along the Heartlands trade routes retired to Beliard, and their presence makes nearby brigands reluctant to raid the village directly.

Hired adventurers patrol the walls and the land immediately around them, watching for anyone approaching. More than five thousand people live and work in Goldenfields year round, farming more than twenty square miles of tillage in gangs of hard-working gardeners.": "现在由Ellardin Darovik修道院院长（男性泰特里亚人（%0%））管理，Goldenfields是翡翠飞地的一个据点。该派系的成员在这里和Chauntea的神职人员一样受到欢迎；他们中的许多人每次都会呆上几个月，帮助工作，并警惕地保卫农场，防止昆虫和瘟疫，以及可能的破坏者和掠夺者。雇佣的冒险者在城墙和周围的土地上巡逻，监视任何接近的人。超过五千人常年生活和工作在Goldenfields，在辛勤工作的园丁团伙中耕种超过二十平方英里的耕地。",

	"These monster-haunted ruins were once a grand and important city in the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer. The old city was a small forest of stone roundhouses, interlaced with gardens and joined by walls into one vast and sprawling building. It was surrounded by a moat fed by underground springs; splendid stone statues of heroic dwarves stood on high pedestals wherever one turned. All trace of the gigantic building is gone now except the foundations of its thickest, highest walls, which jut like lines of stone teeth from thickets of trees and creeping vines. For centuries, shards from magnificent windows of stained glass that once adorned the Halls have found their way into beautiful and distinctive glass bottles blown locally.": "这些被怪物困扰的废墟曾经是盾牌矮人王国贝西尔默的一座宏伟而重要的城市。旧城是一片由石头圆房组成的小森林，与花园交错在一起，并由城墙连接成一个巨大而无垠的建筑。它被一条由地下泉水供给的护城河所包围；无论在哪里，英雄矮人的华丽石雕都站在高高的基座上。现在，除了最厚、最高的墙基之外，这座巨大建筑的所有痕迹都已消失，这些墙基就像一排排石牙，从树木和爬行的藤蔓丛中伸出来。几个世纪以来，曾经装饰过大厅的华丽的彩色玻璃窗的碎片，被发现在当地吹制出美丽而独特的玻璃瓶。",

Her favorite shape is a beautiful female drow. In this form, Nurvureem lures adventurers into the manor and stalks them. She sometimes poses as a drow captive of a dragon, desperate to avoid being eaten and willing to pay with her treasure to be rescued.

The hills are mostly uninhabited.": "如果拉蒙和队伍在一起，他解释说他在附近的谷地放羊，不到一个月前他经过这个地方。他上次来的时候并没有坟墓。他几天前才发现这些坟墓，他不知道谁可能被埋在这里--红落叶松的人都没有失踪，他也不知道还有谁在这条路上。这座山大多无人居住。",
	"If the characters excavate the graves, they find one male dwarf dressed in artisan robes (a smith from Mirabar), one female human warrior dressed in a black surcoat with a red axe (the symbol of Mirabar's army), one male human warrior dressed in a black cloak with strange stony armor (an earth cultist), and one male human in a white robe with black feathers at the shoulders (an air cultist). All died from arrow wounds or crushing blows, and the earth cultists who won the battle buried the fallen on both sides because they believe everything should ultimately be consumed by the earth.": "如果人物挖掘坟墓，他们会发现一个身穿工匠长袍的男性矮人（米拉巴尔的铁匠），一个身穿黑色袈裟、手持红色斧头（米拉巴尔军队的标志）的女性人类战士，一个身穿黑色斗篷、身穿奇怪石质铠甲的男性人类战士（大地崇拜者），以及一个身穿白色长袍、肩部有黑色羽毛的男性人类（空气崇拜者）。所有的人都死于箭伤或粉碎性打击，赢得战斗的大地崇拜者埋葬了双方的死者，因为他们认为一切最终都应该被大地所吞噬。",

	"The most senior knight is a human woman of sixty years named Ushien Stormbanner, an ally of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ushien is happy to meet with any adventurers that turn up on her doorstep.

However, Jolliver Grimjaw felt that he didn't have sufficient numbers to hold Rivergard against a determined attack, so he employs three {@creature Bugbear||bugbears} to augment the garrison.

The two reavers with her roll their eyes and look bored, but Drosnin keeps going and going, brooking no interruptions. Once Drosnin begins, she drones on for two hours before dismissing the party. If they attempt to leave before she finishes her sermon, or if they interrupt her frequently, she orders the reavers to keep them from leaving. She attacks if the characters ignore her commands.": "德罗斯宁认为，任何闯入她的礼拜堂的陌生人都是被指派给她进行灌输的。德罗斯宁最喜欢的技巧是热情、无情的演说。只要人物不攻击，她就开始详尽的布道，讲述 \"深海的真理 \"和即将到来的 \"伟大启示\"。和她在一起的两个叛徒翻着白眼，显得很无聊，但德罗斯宁一直在说，一直在说，不允许别人打断。一旦Drosnin开始，她就会在解散聚会前叨叨两小时。如果他们试图在她完成布道之前离开，或者如果他们经常打断她，她会命令食人魔阻止他们离开。如果人物无视她的命令，她就会攻击。",

	"The defenders in the kennel (area H3) join the battle. The guards on the scaffolding (area H4) react slowly to disturbances in the courtyard, because some such occurrences are the fire cult feeding the wicker giant.

A small platform has been built outside this opening, and on it are supplies for repairing the roof, including 200 feet of hempen rope and a climbing kit.": "梯子通向约5英尺高的一个约3英尺宽的圆形开口。在这个开口外建了一个小平台，上面放着修理屋顶的用品，包括200英尺的麻绳和一个攀登工具。",

	"In chapter 3, the characters succeeded in exposing some or all of the elemental cults' surface outposts as nests of villainy. However, the Haunted Keeps represent only the tip of the iceberg. Each cult's base of operations lies hidden deep beneath the Sumber Hills in the ancient dwarven redoubt of Tyar-Besil. Clearing the cultists out of the Haunted Keeps deals a sharp setback to the affected cults, but unless the characters follow up on their initial successes by infiltrating the temple complex, the cults recover quickly from their early defeats and return in greater force.": "在第三章中，角色们成功地揭露了部分或全部元素邪教的表面哨所是恶棍的巢穴。然而，\"鬼堡 \"只是冰山一角。每个邪教的行动基地都隐藏在桑伯山下的古老的矮人堡垒泰尔-贝西尔。将邪教分子从鬼堡中清除出来，对受影响的邪教来说是一个巨大的挫折，但除非人物在最初的成功基础上继续渗透到神庙群中，否则邪教很快就会从早期的失败中恢复过来，并以更大的力量返回。",
	"The characters might want to assault the four elemental temples as quickly as possible, but they also need to deal with the cults' continuing efforts to corrupt and terrorize the people of the Dessarin Valley. While the characters are busy smashing one temple, the other three cults can do great harm in the area. Between expeditions to Tyar-Besil, the characters would be well advised to continue the investigations they began in {@area chapter 3|112|x}.": "人物可能想尽快攻击四个元素神庙，但他们也需要应对邪教继续腐蚀和恐吓德萨林谷人民的努力。当角色们忙着砸毁一座神庙时，其他三个邪教组织可以在该地区造成巨大的伤害。在远征Tyar-Besil的间隙，人物最好继续他们在{@area chapter 3|112|x}开始的调查。",
	"Ultimately, the natural disasters, monster incursions, and upswing in raider activity represent symptoms of a common disease: the presence of the Temple of Elemental Evil. No matter which disasters and events the characters choose to respond to, the solution to the region's woes lies in the great dungeon below the Sumber Hills.": "归根结底，自然灾害、怪物入侵和突袭者活动的上升代表了一种共同疾病的症状：元素邪恶神殿的存在。无论人物选择应对哪种灾难和事件，解决该地区困境的办法都在桑伯山下的大地牢中。",
	"Early in this part of the adventure, one or more characters receive messages from their factions, asking for help with other dangers in the area.

	"The summons could be a verbal message entrusted to an NPC waiting in the characters' base town. A messenger might brave the wilds to find the characters at their campsite. Magic might be used, such as a {@spell sending} spell. Whether the party chooses to respond or continue on their current course is up to the players.": "召唤可以是一个口头信息，委托给一个在人物的基地城市等待的NPC。一个信使可能会冒着荒野的危险在他们的营地找到这些人物。也可以使用魔法，比如一个（%0%）的法术。队伍是选择回应还是继续他们目前的路线，由玩家决定。",
	"The characters have a problem in Red Larch: Justran Daehl, the cellarer (ale buyer) of the Helm at Highsun, is a spy for the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He's been reporting on the party's comings and goings since they arrived in the region. Justran doesn't sign his letters, but if the characters find one of his reports in Rivergard or in the Temple of the Crushing Wave, they might be able to figure out who he is by looking for the author.": "这些人物在红松镇有一个问题。贾斯兰-戴尔（Justran Daehl）是高森之盔的酒窖管理员（买酒的人），是碎浪教的间谍。自从他们到达该地区后，他就一直在报告该党的来往情况。贾斯特兰不在他的信上签名，但如果人物在里弗加德或碎浪神庙找到他的一份报告，他们也许可以通过寻找作者来弄清他是谁。",
	"Most townsfolk don't recognize the handwriting, but those who do regular business with Justran and the Helm at Highsun can identify his script. These include Kaylessa (proprietor of the Swinging Sword Inn), Marlandro Gaelkur (of Gaelkur's), and Aerego Bethendur (the warehouse owner). If the characters show the letter to any of these individuals, the NPC identifies the handwriting. If the players say \"we show the letter to everyone in town,\" Justran hears about it and flees town before the characters corner him.": "大多数镇民不认识他的笔迹，但那些经常与贾斯特兰和高森的舵手做生意的人可以识别他的字体。这些人包括凯莱萨（摇摆剑客栈的老板）、马兰罗-盖尔库尔（盖尔库尔的）和艾瑞戈-贝瑟杜尔（仓库老板）。如果角色把信给这些人中的任何一个看，NPC就会辨认笔迹。如果玩家说 \"我们把信给镇上的每个人看\"，贾斯特兰就会听到这个消息，并在角色们找到他之前逃离镇子。",
	"If confronted, Justran Daehl denies the charge vehemently. He claims that any letter the characters present as evidence is \"a clear forgery\" until he sees a chance to escape. The cult spy is equivalent to a {@creature bandit captain}. If the encounter takes place at the Helm and the characters don't make a strong case against him, five {@creature Commoner||commoners} (tavern regulars) come to his defense. They aren't cult servants, just bystanders mistaken about Justran and trying to help the cellarer who keeps them in drink.": "如果面对面，贾斯兰-达尔激烈地否认这一指控。他声称，任何人物作为证据提出的信件都是 \"明显的伪造品\"，直到他看到有机会逃跑。邪教的间谍相当于一个（%0%）。如果遭遇发生在海尔姆，而人物没有对他提出有力的证据，那么五个（1%）（酒馆常客）会来为他辩护。他们不是邪教的仆人，只是被旁观者误认为是贾斯特兰，想帮助让他们喝酒的酒窖老板。",
	"Justran might take it upon himself to eliminate the characters. When the characters gather for dinner one evening after they return to Red Larch, he arranges to serve them poisoned ale. This has the same effect as a {@item potion of poison}, but the characters have advantage on their saving throws because Justran has to dilute the poison among several flagons. (The dilution also makes the poison unlikely to be lethal; Justran is better at making ale than he is at making poison.)": "贾斯特兰可能会自作主张地消灭这些人物。当角色们回到红落叶松后的某天晚上聚餐时，他安排给他们提供有毒的麦酒。这和{@item potion of poison}的效果是一样的，但是由于贾斯特兰要把毒药稀释在几个酒壶里，所以人物在救赎时有优势。(稀释也使得毒药不太可能致命；贾斯特兰在制作麦酒方面比他在制作毒药方面更有优势）。",
	"A brief investigation reveals that the poisoned flagons came from the taproom of the Helm at Highsun, and Justran Daehl personally delivered and poured the ale.": "简短的调查显示，被毒死的旗子来自海尔姆的自来水房，贾斯特兰-代尔亲自交付并倒出了麦芽酒。",
	"If the characters capture Justran, he reveals after brief interrogation that he is a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He knows that an underground stream at Rivergard Keep leads to \"the temple below,\" although he has never been to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. He also knows that Jolliver Grimjaw and his followers (see {@area chapter 3|18d|x}) are water cultists.": "如果角色们抓住了贾斯特兰，他在简短的审讯后会透露自己是碎浪教的成员。他知道里弗加德堡的一条地下水道通向 \"下面的神庙\"，尽管他从来没有去过碎浪神庙。他还知道乔里弗-格林杰夫和他的追随者（见{@area chapter 3|18d|x}）是水崇拜者。",
	"The characters probably begin this chapter around 6th level. Encourage the players to take on the challenges in this chapter in whatever order they wish—let their interests drive the story. If you want to pace the adventure, the Temple of Howling Hatred suits a 6th-level party; the Temple of the Crushing Wave is appropriate for a 7th-level party; the Temple of Black Earth is designed for an 8th-level group; and the Temple of Eternal Flame works best for a party of 9th-level characters. Each quarter of the dungeon cleared out by the characters should advance the party one level.": "角色们可能在6级左右开始这一章。鼓励玩家以他们希望的任何顺序接受本章的挑战--让他们的兴趣来推动故事的发展。如果你想把握冒险的节奏，嚎叫的仇恨神殿适合6级的队伍；破碎的波浪神殿适合7级的队伍；黑土神殿是为8级的队伍设计的；而永恒的火焰神殿最适合9级的角色队伍。角色们每清理出四分之一的地牢，就应该使队伍提升一个等级。",
	"The four elemental cults maintain their chief stronghold in the ancient dwarven citadel of Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills. Each cult controls a portion of the old dwarven redoubt and has its own sanctum dedicated specifically to the element worshiped. These four temples are described in this chapter.": "四个元素崇拜者在桑伯山下的古老矮人堡垒泰尔-贝西尔保持着他们的主要据点。每个邪教都控制着古老的矮人堡垒的一部分，并拥有自己的圣殿，专门用于崇拜的元素。本章将介绍这四个神庙。",
	"Several subterranean routes lead from buried Tyar-Besil to the surface. Knifepoint Gully near Feathergale Spire leads to the Temple of Howling Hatred. The Dark Stream flows under Rivergard Keep, leading to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. The Ancient Stair descends from Sacred Stone Monastery to the Temple of Black Earth. Finally, the Path of Frozen Fire leads from the cellars below Scarlet Moon Hall to the Temple of Eternal Flame. Each elemental cult controls one of these routes and therefore controls the quarter of Tyar-Besil that connects to the surface outpost.": "有几条地下路线从埋在地下的泰尔-贝西尔通向地面。费瑟盖尔尖塔附近的刀尖沟（Knifepoint Gully）通往嚎叫的仇恨神殿。黑暗溪流流经里弗加德堡（Rivergard Keep）下方，通向碎浪神庙。古老的阶梯从圣石修道院下到黑土神庙。最后，冰火之路从猩红之月大厅下面的地窖通向永恒之火神庙。每个元素邪教都控制着其中一条路线，因此也控制着泰尔-贝西尔与地面前哨连接的那一区。",
	"Characters who dress in cultist gear might have some success infiltrating the temples. Each cult's monstrous allies rarely challenge a group of cultists that proceeds with confidence. Human members of the cult have a good chance to spot impostors at close range, but fast-talking characters might be able to pass themselves off as new arrivals, bearers of important information, or potential allies against another cult. If the characters ask for a prophet or issue threats in the prophet's name, they gain advantage on ability checks they make to bluff or intimidate their way into a temple. Fooled cultists insist on leading the party to one of the cult's leaders. At least two cultists from any group the characters interact with serve as escorts.": "穿着邪教装备的角色可能会在潜入神庙方面取得一些成功。每个邪教的畸形盟友都很少挑战一群自信地进行的邪教人员。邪教的人类成员有很好的机会在近距离发现冒名顶替者，但快嘴的角色可能会把自己伪装成新来的人、重要信息的携带者或反对另一个邪教的潜在盟友。如果这些人物要求找先知或以先知的名义发出威胁，他们就会在虚张声势或恐吓进入寺庙的能力检查中获得优势。被愚弄的邪教人员坚持要把队伍引向该邪教的一个领袖。至少有两名来自与角色互动的任何团体的邪教人员担任护卫。",
	"The cultists learn and adapt as the characters attack their strongholds. The four temple dungeons described in this chapter each include a room where that cult's elemental prophet might be encountered. The first time the characters find their way to one these locations, the prophet is present, and the characters can engage their foe. After one prophet falls, the remaining three prophets retreat to lower levels, leaving their minions to defend the temple dungeons.": "当角色们攻击他们的据点时，邪教徒们会学习并适应。本章描述的四个神庙地牢都包括一个可能会遇到该教派元素先知的房间。当角色第一次找到这些地点时，先知就会出现，角色可以与敌人交战。在一位先知倒下后，其余三位先知会撤退到更低的楼层，留下他们的爪牙来保卫神庙地宫。",

	"It's dangerous to linger in a stronghold without defeating that dungeon's prophet. If the characters try to camp in any of the four temples while its elemental prophet is still alive, the prophet gathers reinforcements and sends them to attack the intruding party. The prophets can organize this strike even if they have retreated down to the Fane of the Eye or the elemental nodes—visions and whisperings from the Eye guide their actions. (However, there are a few specific areas called out within the temple levels where the characters might be able to rest without attracting attention.)": "在没有打败地牢的先知之前，在一个据点里逗留是很危险的。如果人物试图在四个寺庙中的任何一个扎营，而它的元素先知还活着，先知就会召集援军，并派他们去攻击入侵的队伍。预言家们可以组织这次攻击，即使他们已经撤退到了眼球之窗或元素节点--来自眼球的幻象和低语引导着他们的行动。(然而，在神庙层中有几个特定的区域，人物可能会在那里休息而不会引起注意）。",

(See the \"{@area Random Encounters|095|x}\" section in chapter 2.) To rest in safety, the characters must either hide their camp or return to a nearby settlement.": "同样地，在被清除的鬼堡中扎营也不安全。元素预言家们会知道人物的位置，并派人去骚扰他们。小股的邪教突袭者和雇佣兵在桑伯山游荡，所以命令这样的队伍在某个鬼堡里攻击角色是很简单的事情。(参见第二章中的\"（%0%）\"部分）。为了安全地休息，人物必须隐藏他们的营地或返回附近的定居点。",

They worked the natural stone of the cavern and carved barracks and other living quarters into the rock, connecting them via lamplit passageways. Though it was a fortress, some commerce and art was present, with a rudimentary bazaar and dwarven skalds filling the air with chanted verse.

The water loses its healing power if removed from the fountain.": "这个喷泉是通过一个精心设计的系统来供应的，该系统挖掘了C26区域的隐藏泉水。一个古老的祝福为喷泉提供了适度的治疗能力；任何喝了它的人都会获得短暂休息的好处，但受益于喷泉魔法的人在24小时内不能再这样做。如果从喷泉中取出，水就会失去其治疗能力。",

A moderate impact on the floor, such as a dropped object weighing at least 1 pound or a firm stamp of the foot, activates the levitation effect, which lasts for 1 minute. When the floor is active, the stones hover less than an inch off the floor, and they move with a light touch. Thus, minor earth tremors can cause the stones to move. Intruders, even beasts, can move stones about accidentally.": "矮人给密室的地板施了魔法，使接触到的石头悬浮起来，所以地板的魔法可以用（%0%）（转化学派）检测出来。对地板的适度冲击，例如掉落的至少1磅重的物体或脚的用力踩踏，会激活悬浮效果，持续时间为1分钟。当地板被激活时，石头在离地面不到一英寸的地方盘旋，轻轻一碰就会移动。因此，轻微的大地震颤也会导致石头移动。闯入者，甚至是野兽，都可以意外地移动石头。",
	"The Believers have never figured out the magic, and none have seen the stones levitating. Larrakh and the Black Earth cultists discovered how the floor works. They have been amusing themselves by shifting the stones around and telling the Believers that the mysterious movements are fearsome signs of impending doom.": "信徒们从来没有弄清楚这个魔法，也没有人看到石头悬浮起来。拉雷克和黑土崇拜者发现了地板的运作方式。他们一直在自娱自乐，把石头移来移去，并告诉信徒们，这种神秘的运动是即将到来的厄运的可怕迹象。",
	"Larrakh was part of the attack on the Mirabar delegation described in {@area chapter 3|101|x}. (News of the delegation's disappearance doesn't reach Red Larch until you are ready to carry on with the next part of the adventure.) He carries four Mirabar trade bars, each a foot-long spindle of iron, like two long, four-sided pyramids joined at the base. These bars are genuine, so they make a distinctive tone when struck. They are worth 5 gp each. Any character native to the North recognizes the city's distinctive currency.": "拉雷克是{@area chapter 3|101|x}中描述的对米拉巴尔代表团的袭击的一部分。(代表团失踪的消息直到你准备好进行冒险的下一部分时才传到红松镇)。他带着四根米拉巴尔贸易棒，每根都是一英尺长的铁轴，就像两个长长的、四面的金字塔在底部连接起来。这些铁条是真的，所以敲击时会发出独特的声音。它们每根价值5戈比。任何土生土长的北方人物都能认出这个城市的独特货币。",
	"The aftermath of the discovery of the Tomb of Moving Stones depends on how the last few encounters played out, in particular the discovery of bodies in area T5. The corpses are those of murder victims.": "发现移动石墓的后果取决于过去几次遭遇战的情况，特别是在T5区发现的尸体。这些尸体是谋杀受害者的尸体。",
	"If the characters didn't pay much attention to the bodies, then the remaining Believers are able to abscond with them and bury them elsewhere before Harburk finds them. Red Larch is scandalized, but it's a matter of secrets and lies, not murder and justice.": "如果这些人物没有太注意这些尸体，那么剩下的信徒就能在哈伯克发现他们之前带着他们潜逃并埋在其他地方。红松树被丑化了，但这是一个秘密和谎言的问题，而不是谋杀和正义。",
	"If the characters expressed curiosity about the bodies, or if you deem it likely that Constable Harburk reached area T5 before Believers did, then matters grow more serious. Harburk quickly draws the correct conclusion that the Believers are the murderers. The constable launches a full-fledged investigation.": "如果人物对尸体表示好奇，或者你认为哈伯克警员很可能比信徒们先到达T5区，那么事情就会变得更加严重。哈伯克很快得出了正确的结论：信徒是凶手。这位警员展开了全面的调查。",
	"If he can, Harburk questions Grund and Baragustas. Grund didn't kill anyone or witness the murders, but admits to helping stash the corpses. He says Albaeri Mellikho and Ilmeth Waelvur oversaw the process. Baragustas is also innocent of any overt wrongdoing, so he's quick to confirm Grund's story and exonerate himself.": "如果可以的话，哈伯克询问格伦德和巴拉古斯塔斯。格伦德没有杀人，也没有目睹谋杀，但他承认帮助藏匿了尸体。他说阿尔巴里-梅利科（Albaeri Mellikho）和伊尔梅斯-韦尔武（Ilmeth Waelvur）监督了这一过程。巴拉古斯塔斯也没有任何公开的不法行为，所以他很快证实了格鲁德的说法，并为自己开脱。",
	"Marlandro Gaelkur, Albaeri Mellikho, and Ilmeth Waelvur are the actual culprits. Mellikho maintains her innocence in the face of all evidence, blustering loudly. Waelvur breaks down and confesses his involvement, and he implicates Mellikho. Gaelkur plays it cool as long as he can, and tries flees town a few tendays later when it becomes clear Waelvur is about to implicate him as well. The murderers also tell of Larrakh's part in the scandal, and of their use of his magic dagger.": "Marlandro Gaelkur、Albaeri Mellikho和Ilmeth Waelvur是真正的罪人。面对所有的证据，Mellikho坚持认为自己是无辜的，大声咆哮。Waelvur崩溃了，承认了自己的参与，他把Mellikho牵扯进来。盖尔库尔尽可能地保持冷静，几天后，当发现韦尔武尔也要把他牵扯进来时，他试图逃离小镇。凶手还讲述了拉雷克在丑闻中的角色，以及他们使用他的魔法匕首。",
	"This drama plays out over the course of the next month, with some Believers fleeing the town and others disavowing any knowledge of the murders. It might be tempting for the characters to get involved, but they have the four elemental cults to contend with. Justice for the Believers can play out in the background during the characters' next few visits to Red Larch.": "这场戏在接下来的一个月里上演，一些信徒逃离了小镇，另一些则不承认对谋杀案有任何了解。角色们可能很想参与进来，但他们还要与四个元素邪教抗衡。信徒们的正义可以在人物接下来几次访问红松镇时在背景中进行。",
	"Dangerous, seemingly unrelated situations are arising in widely scattered places, from Yartar to Womford and the Westwood to the High Forest. None of these troubles can be set right for good until the elemental prophets and their cults are defeated, but that doesn't mean these secondary events can be allowed to fester. Characters might conclude that some of these problems are so dire that they must be dealt with immediately, even if that means diverting attention away from their campaign against Elemental Evil.": "危险的、看似不相关的情况正在广泛分散的地方出现，从雅塔尔到沃姆福德，从西林到高森林。在击败元素先知和他们的邪教之前，这些麻烦都不能被永远地摆平，但这并不意味着可以允许这些次要事件的发酵。角色们可能会得出结论，这些问题中有些是如此可怕，以至于必须立即处理，即使这意味着将注意力从对抗元素邪恶的活动中转移开。",
	"Side treks presented in this chapter are summarized in this section, along with their level. Options for involving the characters are presented in the next section and in the side treks themselves. Some are directly related to the elemental cults, and others are situations unconnected to the cults that demand immediate attention.

The Iceshield orcs are attacking farms and cattle ranches throughout the region, and orc scouts have been sighted by patrols less than a day's ride from Yartar.": "兽人的突袭在整个边境地区都很常见，小股兽人偷盗牲畜，或者偶尔劫持补给车。最近几天，隐藏在桑伯山以东粗糙土地上的一个部落变得明显地大胆起来。冰盾兽人正在袭击整个地区的农场和牧场，从雅尔塔出发不到一天的路程，巡逻队就发现了兽人侦察兵。",
	"Although the folk who live in the area are hardy and independent, capable of handling the occasional raid, the reports of organized orc war bands have them worried.

	"The Iceshield orcs reside in a handful of lodges spaced about a day apart along the western edge of the High Forest. They have long been a thorn in the side of the denizens of that wood and the settlers who farm and ranch in the plains to the west. Now the Iceshields have become a prominent threat. Disruptions to the weather and landscape due to the powerful magic being used by the elemental cults has been taken as a sign from Gruumsh that blood and gold must flow from the lands of lesser races.": "冰盾兽人居住在沿着高级森林西部边缘的少数几个住宿点，这些住宿点相隔大约一天。长期以来，他们一直是森林居民和西部平原上耕种和放牧的定居者的眼中钉。现在，冰原已经成为一个突出的威胁。由于元素教派使用的强大魔法对天气和地貌的破坏，被认为是格鲁姆什的一个信号，即血液和黄金必须从较小种族的土地上流走。",
	"The orcs seek supply sources in the valley. Scouts found that the farmers and ranchers in the area are prime options. Now, roving war bands attack the frontier families directly, raiding the homesteads with impunity.

They take the families as slaves and force them to tow the conveyances back to the Iceshield lodges.": "兽人在山谷中寻找补给来源。侦察员发现，该地区的农民和牧场主是首要选择。现在，游荡的战队直接攻击边疆的家庭，肆无忌惮地掠夺家园。除了偷窃牲畜外，冰原人还抢走他们发现的任何手推车和马车，把它们装满战利品。他们把这些家庭当作奴隶，强迫他们把运输工具拖回冰盾旅社。",
	"Some independent-minded squads of orcs decided that the fertile land of the homesteads was more appealing than serving as underlings in their own lodges, and they killed the original owners to occupy the land.

	"Late in the day, the orcs start a grass fire upwind from the compound to create cover for themselves. Thick white smoke drifts through the compound and makes the area lightly obscured.

	"At dawn, the orcs make a final push. It should seem like they might overwhelm the defenders in several spots, and get inside the compound.

	"Customarily, a barge from Yartar arrives on a regular schedule to deliver the wares that the Bargewrighters order to sell, including buckles, swivel-rings, nails, sheaths, finished leatherwork, and food and drinkables. However, last month the barges came late, orders were short changed, and the prices for what little did arrive went up steeply.": "通常，来自雅尔塔的驳船会定期抵达，运送驳船工订购的商品，包括扣子、旋转环、钉子、护套、成品皮革制品以及食品和饮料。然而，上个月，驳船姗姗来迟，订单不足，到手的东西价格陡然上涨。",

The Black Network is an incidental casualty in this scheme.": "到达巴格莱特旅店的报告中没有一丝真相，但这些捣乱者是克拉肯协会的成员，他们试图破坏雅尔塔的稳定，以便用自己的傀儡取代现任水牛城。然后，新的水霸可以迅速解决麻烦，从而赢得当地的支持。黑网是这个计划中的一个偶然的牺牲品。",
	"Regardless of why the \"troubles\" are occurring, the Zhentarim wants the situation fixed fast.

	"The characters become involved in the overland caravan, because the Zhentarim think they're perfect for the job. Any fast caravan guarded by a sizable contingent of armed Zhentarim mercenaries indicates a rich target to anyone in this part of the North. For the same reason, the Zhents dare not hire the retired bodyguards, adventurers, and mercenaries who live in and around Beliard, for fear rumors might spread all over the Dessarin Valley about a pay caravan.": "这些人物参与了陆路商队，因为Zhentarim认为他们是这项工作的完美人选。任何由相当数量的武装的Zhentarim雇佣兵组成的快速商队都表明，在北方的这一地区，任何人都是富有的目标。出于同样的原因，振特人不敢雇用住在贝利亚德及其周围的退休保镖、冒险家和雇佣兵，因为他们担心关于付费商队的谣言会传遍整个德萨林谷。",

	"During attacks on the caravan, the thugs defend themselves first, and then their wagon and drover.

	"Among the Nettlebees, Wiggan's secret is known only to his son, Bertram, now an initiate in the earth cult. The cult has begun its slow indoctrination of the whole Nettlebee clan, starting with Bertram's son Watson.

	"After the adventurers infiltrate the Sacred Stone Monastery, the cult gives Wiggan a mission. He and his family must play the parts of meek halflings, lure the party to their isolated ranch, and kill the characters.

	"As part of their assassination plot, Wiggan and Bertram Nettlebee have constructed an elaborate ruse. They unearthed a nearby Uthgardt barrow mound and set it aflame.

	"As the elemental collapses the entry tunnel, Wiggan and Bertram run for the ranch. Javor senses his quarry on the move and rushes to the barrow's exit. The elemental emerges from the earth in the main chamber. It attacks those it can see, rather than pursuing Javor.": "随着元素的倒塌，维根和伯特兰跑向牧场。贾沃感觉到他的猎物在移动，于是赶往荒冢的出口。元素从主室的泥土中冒了出来。它攻击那些它能看到的人，而不是追击贾沃尔。",
	"While the party fights the elemental, Javor works with supernatural fervor to clear the rubble choking the exit to the barrow.

The opening is big enough for the massive chieftain, so it's big enough for the characters.": "在党派与元素战斗的同时，贾沃以超自然的热情工作，清理堵塞荒冢出口的碎石。大约2分钟后，他完成了在顶部附近的开口，并跃入阳光下。这个开口对巨大的酋长来说足够大，所以对人物来说也足够大。",

	"The characters have many choices. They can do nothing, which allows the barbarians to loot and destroy the ranch and kill every Nettlebee. (The Uthgardt show no mercy.) If the party chooses to attack the Uthgardt before they arrive at the ranch, the adventurers must also battle the revenant. At the ranch, Javor focuses on finding and killing Wiggan and Bertram, giving the characters a better chance against the raiders. For their part, the Uthgardt, despite portentous visions, are unwilling to perish to serve Javor. If they suffer significant losses, including either berserker, they make a fighting retreat through the pastures to steal sheep and ponies.": "人物有很多选择。他们可以什么都不做，这样野蛮人就可以掠夺和破坏牧场，并杀死所有的Nettlebee。(Uthgardt人不会手下留情。)如果队伍在到达牧场之前选择攻击Uthgardt人，冒险者也必须与复仇者战斗。在牧场，贾沃专注于找到并杀死维根和伯特兰，让角色们有更好的机会对抗突袭者。就他们而言，乌斯加特人尽管有预言性的幻觉，但他们不愿意为贾沃尔服务而丧生。如果他们遭受重大损失，包括任何一个狂暴者，他们就会通过牧场进行战斗性撤退，去偷羊和小马。",
	"Once the barbarians make it to the ranch, Javor bursts into the house's cellar. The Nettlebees, having seen the raiders on their way over the hills, hide there. The undead chief points to Wiggan and Bertram as the guilty ones. How the scene then plays out is up to you and the players, but halfling pluck and dark devotion make the wicked Nettlebees unlikely to back down easily. In fact, Wiggan tries to bribe the characters into defending Bertram and him \"against these savages.\" He also uses his secrets to try to influence the characters, promising to tell them everything if saved. Javor might be influenced to stay his hand to allow Wiggan to tell his tale, but the revenant's reprieve is only temporary.": "野蛮人一到牧场，贾沃尔就冲进了房子的地窖。荨麻疹患者在翻山越岭的途中看到了突袭者，就躲在那里。亡灵首领指出维根和贝特伦是有罪的人。这场戏如何发展，取决于你和玩家，但半身人的勇气和黑暗的奉献精神使邪恶的奈特比人不可能轻易退缩。事实上，维根试图贿赂这些角色为伯特兰和他辩护，\"以对抗这些野蛮人\"。他还利用自己的秘密来试图影响这些人物，承诺如果被救，就会告诉他们一切。贾沃可能会受到影响而留手，允许维根讲述他的故事，但复仇者的缓和只是暂时的。",
	"If the party defends the Nettlebees and Wiggan survives, the characters are still in danger. Wounded foes make tempting targets, especially if the party knows of Wiggan's guilt.

	"Gargosh continues in detail, giving the adventurers a crash course on Besilmer history (see the \"Ancient Bones\" section of {@area chapter 1|002|x} for an overview) and explaining what he is trying to accomplish. During the conversation, he reveals that he has \"an extensive collection of notes and evidence\" pointing to the location of the tomb, but he has not brought it with him out of caution for the diary's safety. He promises that they can see it next time. Gargosh agrees to meet them the next day at the same spot, equipped and ready to go.": "加戈什继续详细介绍，给冒险者们上了一堂关于贝西尔默历史的速成课（概况见{@area chapter 1|002|x}的 \"古代骨头 \"部分），并解释了他想要完成的任务。在谈话中，他透露他有 \"大量的笔记和证据 \"指向坟墓的位置，但出于对日记安全的考虑，他没有把它带在身边。他承诺，他们下次可以看到它。加戈什同意第二天在同一地点与他们见面，并配备好装备，随时准备出发。",
	"Between the time the characters first meet with Gargosh and when they are to reconvene, Drannin and his misfit team take Gargosh prisoner and get the diary. Liking the idea of letting the characters set off the traps and fight all the deadly monsters, Drannin and his crew hatch a plan to dupe the characters. One of Drannin's companions, a doppelganger, assumes the guise of Gargosh and goes along with the characters, urging them to hurry with a story of theft and betrayal. The rest plan to stay out of sight, and when the axe is found, they hope to step in and take it from the characters. The doppelganger doesn't know everything that Gargosh knows. However, it can read surface thoughts and, if questioned, might be able to glean the expected answer from characters who interrogate it. If all else fails, the doppelganger resorts to blackmail, telling the characters to press on \"lest great harm befall the real Gargosh.\"": "从人物第一次与Gargosh见面到他们再次开会之间，Drannin和他的不称职的团队将Gargosh俘虏并得到了日记。德兰宁和他的队员们喜欢让角色们设置陷阱并与所有致命的怪物战斗的想法，他们策划了一个计划来欺骗角色们。Drannin的一个同伴，一个二重身，假扮成Gargosh的样子，和人物一起行动，用一个偷窃和背叛的故事催促他们快点。其余的人计划躲在暗处，当斧头被发现时，他们希望能介入并从人物手中夺走斧头。二重身并不了解加戈什所知道的一切。然而，它能读懂表面的想法，如果被询问，也许能从审问它的人物那里得到预期的答案。如果一切都失败了，二重身就会采取敲诈手段，告诉角色们要继续下去，\"以免真正的加戈什受到巨大伤害\"。",

	"Drannin left these forces here knowing that they were unlikely to defeat the characters, but he wanted to play up the idea that someone is trying to stop Gargosh from completing his quest.

Close inspection accompanied by a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals a disengaged sprocket that can be slid along an axle to engage a different part of the machinery. If the sprocket is set in place, the flywheel does move when a character pushes it, and the characters can hear the sound of grinding stone echoing off in the distance. If the characters move the flywheel and then let go, it reverses and spins back to its original position when it is released. There is no apparent way to stop this motion with raw strength; characters who push against the reversal don't even slow it down.": "无论人物如何用力，飞轮都不会动。仔细检查并成功通过DC10智力检查（（%0%）），可以发现一个脱离的链轮，它可以沿着轴滑动，与机器的不同部分啮合。如果链轮被安放好了，当人物推动它时，飞轮确实会移动，而且人物可以听到远处回荡的磨石声。如果角色移动飞轮，然后放手，它就会逆转，并在松开时旋转回原来的位置。没有任何明显的方法可以用原始的力量来阻止这个运动；推动反转的人物甚至不能减缓它。",

	"This structure isn't so much a building as it is a facade built into a bluff. Two alcoves flank an opening, and life-sized statues carved from the stone stand within each alcove: a pair of dwarves in full regalia, perhaps as an honor guard. The statues are badly weathered and have suffered damage from vandals and treasure hunters.": "这座建筑与其说是一座建筑，不如说是建在悬崖上的一个门面。两个凹槽位于开口的两侧，每个凹槽内都矗立着用石头雕刻的真人大小的雕像：一对矮人身着盛装，也许是作为仪仗队。这些雕像已经严重风化，受到破坏者和寻宝者的破坏。",
	"The opening leads into a hallway that extends back about 60 feet before coming to a long staircase that descends into the darkness for 200 feet, with landings positioned every 20 feet.

The alcoves once held stone effigies of the interred dead. Many of the tombs have been smashed open, revealing the bones of the dead inside. The crumbled and ruined stonework of the broken effigies lies smashed on the floor.": "楼梯最后通向一个大殿，里面充满了20英尺粗的巨大方柱，一直升到30英尺高的天花板。石制火炉矗立在柱子之间的每条通道的交汇处。每根柱子都是一个陵墓，每边都刻有一个凹槽，偏移的位置使凹槽只占到面对的右半边。凹槽里曾经放置过死者的石像。许多坟墓已经被砸开，露出里面的死者的骨头。碎裂和毁坏的石雕被砸在地板上。",

	"The stone slabs are actually the topmost steps of a secret staircase that descends to area X10. Four locks hidden under the floor prevent the slabs from lowering. However, if the flywheels in area X4 are properly lined up, these locks are now open.

They hate the way the world is made and the natural laws that constrain their favored elements. They resent the gods who shaped the world, and the mortals for whom the world was shaped, especially mortals who seek to impose their will on the elements. The princes unleash natural catastrophes at every opportunity, and gladly crush or devour mortals to assert their mastery over the world.": "王子们并不关心在凡人中传播邪恶，或使任何一种秩序或哲学在世界中占主导地位。他们的邪恶是盲目的、破坏性的和饥饿的。他们憎恨世界的构成方式和制约他们所喜爱的元素的自然规律。他们憎恨塑造世界的诸神，以及世界为其塑造的凡人，尤其是那些试图将自己的意志强加于元素的凡人。王子们一有机会就会释放自然灾难，并乐意粉碎或吞噬凡人以宣示他们对世界的掌控。",
	"While the princes of Elemental Evil share a love of destruction and hatred of mortals, they don't cooperate with each other. Each is concerned only with advancing his or her own favored element.

	"While the princes of Elemental Evil act independently of each other, there is a mysterious force that seems to link them together: the Elder Elemental Eye.

	"The princes of Elemental Evil seek to spread their power by sowing the seeds of elemental nodes throughout the world. Elemental nodes are places in the Material Plane that are suffused with energy from the Elemental Planes. For example, a subterranean magma chamber or a swamp with flaming gas seeps might be an elemental node of fire. Elemental nodes are like beachheads for the elemental princes, places from which they can reshape part of the world to their own tastes and wreak destruction on whatever is nearby. When an elemental prince succeeds in establishing a node, it channels its power—and its elemental minions—to that spot, spreading Elemental Evil like a cancer in the firmament of the world.": "元素邪恶的王子们试图通过在全世界播撒元素结点的种子来传播他们的力量。元素结点是物质世界中充斥着来自元素界的能量的地方。例如，一个地下岩浆室或一个有火焰气体渗漏的沼泽可能是一个火元素节点。元素结点就像元素王子的滩头堡，他们可以在那里按照自己的口味重塑世界的一部分，并对附近的任何事物进行破坏。当一个元素王子成功地建立了一个节点，它就会把它的力量和它的元素奴仆引导到那个地方，像癌症一样在世界的苍穹中传播元素的邪恶。",
	"The princes of Elemental Evil are indifferent to mortal followers. They aren't gods and don't crave worship, but evil mortals find that Elemental Evil is a ready source of magical power and lends itself to destructive uses. Cultists often gather near elemental nodes and attempt perilous rituals to tap into the power of Elemental Evil or attract the attention of one of the princes. These fell beings don't hear prayers or grant spells, but they can serve as sources of power to those who learn to draw on their might. More often than not, the princes of Elemental Evil wind up destroying the mortals who called on them. Until they do, clever (or crazed) cultists can do a great deal of harm with the elemental power they borrow.": "邪恶元素的王子们对凡人的追随者无动于衷。他们不是神，也不渴求崇拜，但邪恶的凡人发现，元素之恶是一种现成的魔法力量来源，并可用于破坏性用途。崇拜者经常聚集在元素节点附近，试图通过危险的仪式来获取元素之恶的力量或吸引其中一位王子的注意。这些堕落的生命不会听到祈祷或授予法术，但他们可以作为那些学会利用其力量的人的力量来源。更常见的是，元素邪恶的王子们最终会摧毁召唤他们的凡人。在他们这样做之前，聪明的（或疯狂的）崇拜者可以用他们借用的元素力量造成很大的伤害。",

	"Elemental power has allowed the cults to have more magic items than is normal for groups of their size, yet there still aren't enough magic items for each cultist to have one. Every member of the air cult, for example, would love to be able to soar on the wind, but only certain members have a magical ability or an item that confers that blessing.": "元素的力量使邪教拥有比他们这种规模的团体正常情况下更多的魔法物品，但仍然没有足够的魔法物品让每个邪教成员都拥有一个。例如，空气邪教的每个成员都希望能够乘风翱翔，但只有某些成员拥有一种神奇的能力或一种能赋予这种祝福的物品。",
	"The cults have some special items that harness the power of the elemental nodes themselves. These items rely on energy siphoned from a node, and some of them must be recharged inside the appropriate type of node, as noted in the items' descriptions. Otherwise, such an item ceases to function. Adventurers who recover a node-fueled item will, therefore, only be able to recharge it when an appropriate node is nearby.": "邪教有一些特殊的物品，可以利用元素结点本身的力量。这些物品依赖于从节点中抽出的能量，其中一些必须在适当类型的节点中充电，正如物品描述中所指出的那样。否则，这种物品就会停止运作。因此，冒险者如果找回一个以节点为燃料的物品，只有在附近有适当的节点时才能给它充电。",

The weapons also bring out the worst in their wielders, twisting their minds toward evil ends.": "领导元素邪恶教派的四位先知中的每一位都配备了一件强大的元素武器。这些有力的物品被注入了元素邪恶王子的精华。除了武器在战斗中的明显用处外，它们还可以作为钥匙，让先知们引导元素结点的力量，并撕开星球之间的边界。这些武器还能激发挥舞者最坏的一面，将他们的思想扭曲成邪恶的目的。",

	"The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, do not face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit—whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.": "元素界对物质界的人来说往往是不友好的：破碎的土地、灼热的火焰、无边的天空和无尽的海洋，使得访问这些地方即使是短时间也很危险。然而，强大的精灵在进入凡人世界时不会面临这样的麻烦。他们能很好地适应物质世界的混合元素，而且他们有时会去拜访--不管是出于他们自己的意愿还是被魔法所蛊惑。有些精灵可以化身为凡人，隐姓埋名地旅行。",
	"During these visits, a mortal might catch a genie's eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither.

	"Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.": "偶尔，基因人也会因为暴露在元素力量的激增下而产生，比如内层世界的喷发或星球融合等现象。元素能量饱和了该地区的任何生物，并可能改变他们的本性，以至于他们与其他凡人的后代生来就是基因人。",

	"Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.": "Genasi几乎从未与他们的元素父母接触过。精灵很少对他们的凡人后代感兴趣，把他们视为意外。许多人对他们的精灵孩子根本没有感觉。",
	"Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered.

	"Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.": "基纳西人很少缺乏自信，他们认为自己几乎可以应对他们道路上的任何挑战。这种自信在一个Genasi身上可能表现为优雅的自我肯定，在另一个Genasi身上则表现为傲慢。这种自信有时会使玄武门人对风险视而不见，他们的伟大计划常常使他们和其他人陷入困境。",
	"Too much failure can chip away at even a genasi's sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.": "太多的失败甚至会削弱一个基因人的自我意识，所以他们不断地促使自己进步，磨练自己的才能，完善自己的技艺。",
	"As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.": "作为罕见的生命，genasi可能在一生中都不会遇到另一个他们的同类。没有伟大的Genasi城市或帝国。Genasi很少有自己的社区，通常采用他们出生时的文化和社会。他们的外表越是奇怪，他们的日子就越难过。许多基因人在繁华的城市中迷失了自己，在习惯了各种不同人的地方，他们的与众不同几乎不会引起人们的注意。",
	"Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.": "不过，那些生活在边疆的人的日子要艰难得多。那里的人们往往不太接受差异。有时，一个冷漠的肩膀和一个怀疑的目光是genasi所能希望得到的最好结果；在更落后的地方，他们面临着排斥，甚至被人们误认为是魔鬼的暴力。面对艰难的生活，这些基因人在荒野中寻求隔离，在山区或森林、湖泊附近或地下安家。",
	"Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerûn, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.": "大多数王国的空气和火精灵都是曾经统治卡里姆山的精灵和伊夫里特的后裔。当这些统治者被推翻后，他们在星球上的孩子被分散了。几千年来，这些精灵的血统已经扩散到其他地区。虽然远非常见，但空气和火系精灵更有可能在法鲁恩的西部地区被发现，从卡里姆山向北到剑海岸的沿海地区，以及东部的西部中心地带。有些人还留在他们古老的家乡。",
	"In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "相比之下，水系和土系精灵没有共同的历史。个人很难追踪自己的血统，而且血统偶尔会跳过一两代。许多土族人起源于北方，并从那里传播出去。水系基因人来自沿海地区，其中最集中的是堕落星海周围的地区。",
	"The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerûn. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.": "遥远的扎哈拉（Zakhara）对法鲁恩的大多数居民来说只在传说中知道。在那里，精灵和施法者进行交易，而精灵可以从这种契约中产生。在那片土地的历史上，这些精灵一直是巨大利益和灾难的来源。",
	"Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.": "基纳西人使用他们所生长的民族的命名惯例。他们后来可能会取一些独特的名字来捕捉他们的遗产，如火焰、微光、波浪或玛瑙。",
	"Although any world that includes one or more elemental planes can feature genasi, on Athas, the world of the Dark Sun campaign setting, elemental forces hold greater sway than they do on other worlds. As a people touched by elemental power, genasi are viewed as seers, prophets, and chosen ones. The birth of a genasi, whether a slave, a noble, or a member of a desert tribe, is an auspicious event. Most Athasians believe a given genasi is destined for greatness—or infamy.": "虽然任何包含一个或多个元素位面的世界都可以有玄武者的身影，但在黑暗太阳战役设定的阿塔斯世界，元素力量比其他世界拥有更大的影响力。作为一个被元素力量触及的民族，genasi被视为预言家、先知和被选中的人。无论是奴隶、贵族还是沙漠部落的成员，基因人的诞生都是一个吉祥的事件。大多数阿塔西亚人相信，一个特定的基因人注定是伟大的，或者说是臭名昭著的。",
	"Each genasi subrace has its own temperament, which might make some backgrounds more suitable than others.": "每个基因亚族都有自己的气质，这可能使一些背景比其他背景更适合。",
	"Air genasi are proud of their heritage, sometimes to the point of haughtiness. They can be flamboyant, and are keen to have an audience. They rarely stay in one place for long, always looking for a new sky to see and breathe. Air genasi who don't live in cities favor open lands such as plains, deserts, and high mountains. Fitting backgrounds include charlatan, entertainer, and noble.": "空中精灵为自己的遗产感到骄傲，有时甚至到了傲慢的地步。他们可以很张扬，并热衷于拥有观众。他们很少在一个地方停留很长时间，总是在寻找新的天空来观察和呼吸。不住在城市的空气族人喜欢开阔的土地，如平原、沙漠和高山。适合的背景包括江湖郎中、艺人和贵族。",
	"Earth genasi are more withdrawn, and their connection to the earth keeps them from being comfortable in most cities. Their uncommon size and strength makes them natural soldiers, though, and with their stoic demeanor, they can encourage others and become great leaders. Many earth genasi live underground, where they can be in their favored element. When they emerge from their caves, they might roam the hills and mountains or lay claim to old ruins. Appropriate backgrounds for earth genasi include hermit, outlander, and soldier.": "大地精灵比较孤僻，他们与大地的联系使他们在大多数城市中不适应。不过，他们不寻常的体型和力量使他们成为天然的战士，而且由于他们坚毅的举止，他们可以鼓励他人，成为伟大的领导者。许多土族人生活在地下，在那里他们可以处于自己喜欢的元素中。当他们从洞穴中出来时，他们可能会在山丘和山脉中游荡，或者对古老的废墟提出要求。适合土族人的背景包括隐士、外乡人和士兵。",
	"Fire genasi often get themselves into difficulty with their fiery tempers. Like their air genasi cousins, they sometimes flaunt their perceived superiority over common folk. But they also want others to share their high opinion of themselves, so they constantly seek to enhance their reputations. Likely backgrounds for a fire genasi include criminal, folk hero, and noble.": "火族人经常因其火爆的脾气而使自己陷入困境。就像他们的空气族表亲一样，他们有时会炫耀自己对普通人的优越感。但他们也希望别人能分享他们对自己的高度评价，所以他们不断寻求提高自己的声誉。火族人的可能背景包括罪犯、民间英雄和贵族。",
	"Water genasi almost all have some experience aboard or around sea vessels. They make excellent mariners and fishers. Like earth genasi, though, water genasi prefer quiet and solitude; the wide shores are their natural homes. They go where they want, do what they want, and rarely feel bound to anything. Good backgrounds for water genasi include hermit and sailor.": "水族人几乎都有一些在海船上或周围的经验。他们是优秀的航海家和渔民。不过，和地球上的精灵一样，水精灵也喜欢安静和孤独；宽阔的海岸是他们的天然家园。他们想去哪里就去哪里，想做什么就做什么，很少感到受到任何约束。水之精灵的良好背景包括隐士和水手。",
	"This appendix presents new spells that you can make available to your players. Some of the spells are used by creatures in chapter 7.": "本附录介绍了你可以提供给玩家的新法术。其中一些法术是第七章中的生物所使用的。",
	"It's up to you whether these spells are available at character creation, whether they are discovered over the course of the adventure, or whether they don't end up in the characters' hands at all. Many players are fine sticking with the spells in the {@i Player's Handbook}, whereas other players will be excited to gain new spell options.": "这些法术是否在角色创建时就可以使用，是否在冒险过程中被发现，或者是否最终根本没有落入角色手中，这都取决于你。许多玩家坚持使用{@i Player's Handbook}中的法术就可以了，而其他玩家会对获得新的法术选项感到兴奋。",

	"Old as creation itself, Elemental Evil has arisen in a thousand different worlds across the ages of the multiverse. {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} describes the rise of Elemental Evil in the world of the Forgotten Realms setting. However, there is no reason you couldn't adjust this adventure to fit in almost any world that is part of the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse. In this appendix, we take a look at how you can adapt this adventure to some of the well-known settings for the D&D game, or to your own campaign world.": "邪恶元素与创世本身一样古老，它在多元宇宙的无数个不同的世界中出现。{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}描述了元素邪恶在被遗忘的世界里的崛起。然而，你没有理由不调整这个冒险以适应几乎任何属于龙与地下城多元宇宙的世界。在这个附录中，我们看一下如何将这个冒险改编成一些著名的D&D游戏设定，或者改编成你自己的活动世界。",
	"The dying planet of Athas is a world that is already deeply scarred by elemental power. Long ago the gods of Athas fought a terrible war against the mighty primordial powers of the elemental planes—and they lost. The gods were slain or driven into exile, leaving Athas under the dominion of elemental beings who took little interest in the affairs of mortals. In the grim age that followed the defeat of the gods, mighty sorcerer-kings came to power and nearly destroyed the world with their reckless use of defiling magic. They made Athas into a desert where terrible monsters roam and only the strongest survive.": "垂死的阿塔斯星球是一个已经被元素力量深深伤害的世界。很久以前，阿萨斯的诸神与元素界强大的原始力量进行了一场可怕的战争--他们输了。诸神被杀或被流放，使阿萨斯处于元素生物的统治之下，他们对凡人的事务不感兴趣。在诸神战败后的黑暗时代，强大的巫师国王开始掌权，他们不顾一切地使用污秽的魔法，几乎摧毁了这个世界。他们把阿塔斯变成了一片沙漠，可怕的怪物在那里游荡，只有最强的人才能生存。",
	"One of the hallmarks of the Dark Sun setting is that the heroes don't need to seek out forgotten dungeons to find adventure—mere survival is adventure enough. But there is no reason you can't successfully adapt {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} to your Dark Sun campaign.": "黑暗太阳设定的一个特点是，英雄们不需要寻找被遗忘的地下城来寻找冒险--仅仅是生存就足够冒险了。但是，你没有理由不成功地适应（%0%）你的黑暗太阳活动。",
	"A fertile agricultural region like the Dessarin Valley does not exist in Athas, but there are several frontier areas containing small, out-of-the-way villages separated by several days' travel through the wilderness. One good example is the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes. The long-lost dwarven citadel of Tyar-Besil lies beneath the rocky badlands about 30 to 40 miles northwest of the village of Kled. The buried city does not have to change much at all; a 5,000-year old dwarven stronghold forgotten beneath the desert sands might easily date back to the Green Age, a time when the world of Athas would have looked much like the Forgotten Realms.": "阿塔斯不存在像德萨林谷那样肥沃的农业地区，但有几个边疆地区包含一些小的、偏僻的村庄，它们之间隔着数天的路程，穿过荒野。一个很好的例子是大冲积沙荒地。消失已久的矮人堡垒泰尔-贝西尔（Tyar-Besil）就在克莱德村西北约30至40英里的岩石坏境下。被埋葬的城市根本不需要有太大的变化；一个被遗忘在沙漠沙地下的5000年历史的矮人据点可能很容易追溯到绿色时代，那个时候的阿萨斯世界看起来很像被遗忘的王国。",
	"The four Haunted Keeps described in chapter 3 of this adventure are lonely outposts or ruins scattered throughout the badlands under which Tyar-Besil lies. Rivergard Keep is admittedly a little problematic in a desert world, but the solution is simple: It lies on the dusty banks of a river long dried up. The Crushing Wave cultists occupying the old keep aren't smugglers and pirates; they're slave traders.": "本冒险第三章中描述的四个闹鬼堡垒是分散在Tyar-Besil所处的坏境中的孤独前哨或遗迹。河岸堡垒在沙漠世界中确实有点问题，但解决办法很简单。它位于一条早已干涸的河流的尘土飞扬的岸边。占据旧堡垒的破碎浪潮邪教徒并不是走私者和海盗，他们是奴隶贩子。",
	"Settlements nearby the area where the elemental cults are establishing themselves include the slave village of Freedom, the dwarven mining village of Kled, and Silver Spring oasis. Kled is a good base for explorations, and can serve as the \"Red Larch\" of a Dark Sun Elemental Evil campaign. Freedom is a good counterpart for Beliard, and Silver Spring works well in the role of Bargewright Inn and Womford. You can invent another small village or two—perhaps a merchant house outpost—to serve as Westbridge, and provide a location that can be threatened or destroyed by cult reprisals as the adventure unfolds.": "元素邪教正在建立的地区附近的定居点包括自由奴隶村、矮人采矿村克莱德和银泉绿洲。克莱德是一个很好的探索基地，可以作为黑暗太阳元素邪教活动的 \"红松\"。自由是贝利亚德的一个很好的对应物，而银泉在巴格莱特旅馆和沃姆福德的作用中很好。你可以发明另一个或两个小村庄--也许是一个商行的前哨站--来作为西桥，并提供一个可以在冒险过程中受到威胁或被邪教报复的地点。",
	"Instead of the delegation from Mirabar, the missing caravan that drives the heroes' initial involvement in the adventure consists of envoys from the halfling village of Ogo, bound for the recently freed city of Tyr. The city's new leaders hope to forge an alliance with the halflings of the Forest Ridge, and sent envoys bearing gifts and trade goods to the village of Ogo; a party of important halflings is returning to Tyr with the city's envoys, bringing reciprocal gifts of their own. After stopping in the village of Freedom, the delegation headed south to Kled, where they intended to turn toward Tyr. However, they disappeared in the badlands between Kled and Freedom.": "促使英雄们最初参与冒险的失踪商队不是来自米拉巴尔的代表团，而是来自半身人村庄奥戈的特使，前往最近被解放的泰尔城。这个城市的新领导人希望与森林山脊的半身人结成联盟，并派出携带礼物和贸易品的特使前往奥戈村；一队重要的半身人正与城市的特使一起返回泰尔，并带来他们自己的对等礼物。在自由村停留后，代表团向南前往克莱德，他们打算在那里转向泰尔。然而，他们在克莱德和自由之间的坏境中消失了。",
	"Elemental cults are widespread in Athas. In a world without gods, people instead worship the powers they see in the world around them: air, earth, fire, and water. Elemental priests hold a social position similar to that of religious hermits or tribal shamans of other worlds. Common Athasians, especially those who live outside the walls of the city-states, revere elemental priests and listen carefully when they speak. The chief difference between cultists dedicated to Elemental Evil and the elemental priests normally found in the tribes and villages of Athas is the cult's dedication to evil. An elemental priest protects and guides the common people, using elemental magic to better their lives. An elemental cultist demands abasement, sacrifice, and obedience. The element is no longer a tool of survival; it is a force for destruction and the power to dominate others.": "元素崇拜在阿塔斯很普遍。在一个没有神的世界里，人们转而崇拜他们在周围世界看到的力量：空气、地球、火和水。元素祭司的社会地位与其他世界的宗教隐士或部落巫师相似。普通的阿萨斯人，尤其是那些生活在城邦围墙外的人，都很崇敬元素祭司，当他们说话时都会仔细聆听。献身于元素邪恶的崇拜者和通常在阿萨斯的部落和村庄中发现的元素牧师之间的主要区别是崇拜者对邪恶的奉献。元素牧师保护和引导普通人，使用元素魔法来改善他们的生活。一个元素崇拜者要求堕落、牺牲和顺从。元素不再是生存的工具；它是一种毁灭的力量和支配他人的力量。",
	"Because elemental priests hold such an important place in Athasian society, the appearance of cultists serving Elemental Evil is not likely to seem out of the ordinary at first. In small desert villages, a cult could easily take shape and even attract popular support from a local community or tribe—at least until the cruelty and madness of its adherents make its true nature obvious to all.": "由于元素祭司在阿塔西亚社会中占有如此重要的地位，服务于元素之恶的崇拜者的出现一开始不可能显得不寻常。在小的沙漠村庄里，一个邪教很容易形成，甚至吸引当地社区或部落的支持--至少在其信徒的残忍和疯狂使其真正的本质显露出来之前。",
	"In an Athasian version of the Elemental Evil campaign, the prophets first appear as especially charismatic and powerful elemental priests promising their followers a \"better\" way. The elemental weapons are heirlooms or lost treasures created long ago during an earlier incarnation of the cult. When the Elder Elemental Eye begins to stir beneath the dark sun and seeks new servants, the ancient weapons awake from their slumber and find their way into ready hands.": "在阿塔西亚版本的元素邪恶运动中，先知们首先出现的是特别有魅力和强大的元素牧师，向他们的追随者承诺了一个 \"更好 \"的方法。元素武器是传家宝，或者是很久以前在邪教的早期化身中创造的失落的宝物。当古老的元素之眼开始在黑暗的太阳下蠢蠢欲动并寻找新的仆人时，古老的武器从沉睡中苏醒，并找到了它们现成的方法。",
	"The city-states and nomadic tribes of Athas have a set of factions and alliances shaped by that world's harsh history. Here are suggestions for converting the adventure's faction references for Athas.": "阿塔斯的城邦和游牧部落有一套由这个世界的严酷历史形成的派别和联盟。这里有一些建议，可以将冒险中的派别参考资料转换为阿萨斯。",
	"The Veiled Alliance is a secret society dedicated to the overthrow of the evil sorcerer-kings who dominate the Tyr Region. Like the Harpers, its ranks include a number of rogues, spellcasters, and spies. Few organizations or movements in Athas operate across multiple city-states, but the Veiled Alliance is one of them. Heroes who give their allegiance to the Veiled Alliance would primarily be interested in stopping the defilers who serve the elemental cults and making sure the sorcerer-kings do not get their hands on the secrets of elemental power.": "隐蔽联盟是一个秘密组织，致力于推翻统治提尔地区的邪恶巫师王的统治。和哈珀斯一样，它的队伍中也有一些流氓、法术师和间谍。在阿萨斯，很少有组织或运动在多个城邦之间活动，但隐蔽联盟是其中之一。效忠于遮蔽联盟的英雄们主要是为了阻止那些为元素崇拜者服务的破坏者，并确保巫师王们不会得到元素力量的秘密。",
	"The desert wilds are dotted with the hidden camps and strongholds of Athas's slave tribes—bands of people who have managed to escape from slavery in one or another of the city-states. The Free is a tenuous, disorganized society or fellowship of the slave tribes of the Tyr Region. Even though the tribes do not cooperate with each other, they share important common values and work toward the same end: the destruction of slavery. They fulfill something like the role of the Order of the Gauntlet in Athas.": "沙漠荒野中遍布着阿萨斯奴隶部落的隐蔽营地和据点--这些人设法从某个城邦的奴役中逃脱出来。自由人是泰尔地区奴隶部落的一个脆弱的、无组织的社会或团契。尽管各部落之间并不互相合作，但他们拥有重要的共同价值观，并朝着同一个目标努力：消灭奴隶制。他们履行了类似于阿塔斯的高塔骑士团的职责。",
	"The Free are not directly concerned with fighting threats such as Elemental Evil, but they hate slaveholders and do everything they can to punish those who enslave others. The elemental cults take captives and force them to work on their mad projects, so the Free get involved to stop this practice and punish the perpetrators for their crimes.": "自由派并不直接关注与元素邪恶这样的威胁作斗争，但他们憎恨奴隶主，并尽其所能惩罚那些奴役他人的人。元素邪教抓走俘虏，强迫他们为他们的疯狂项目工作，所以自由派介入，阻止这种做法，并惩罚犯罪者的罪行。",
	"Athasian druids see themselves as guardians of the land and enemies to all who employ defiling magic. No great druid organizations span the entire Tyr Region, but a number of smaller, localized druid circles are concerned with the disturbances and disasters triggered by the cult's activities. One such circle roams the area between the Dragon's Bowl and the Valley of Tyr. Characters who want to fight for the forces of natural balance could be allies (or members) of the druids.": "阿塔西亚德鲁伊认为自己是土地的守护者，与所有使用污秽魔法的人为敌。没有大的德鲁伊组织横跨整个泰尔地区，但有一些较小的、本地化的德鲁伊圈子关注着由邪教活动引发的骚乱和灾难。一个这样的圈子在龙碗和泰尔谷之间的区域游荡。想为自然平衡的力量而战的角色可以成为德鲁伊的盟友（或成员）。",
	"The sorcerer-kings of the Tyr Region are bitter enemies of each other, so nothing like the Lords' Alliance is possible. However, the templar bureaucracy of a specific city-state can serve a similar role in a Dark Sun conversion of this adventure. The city-state most immediately concerned with the rise of a dangerous magical cult in the Great Alluvial Sand Wastes is Tyr, struggling to find its way after the death of King Kalak. The templars of Tyr can't allow a new threat to grow on their doorstep—or allow the templars of a rival city such as Urik to gain control of the cult's elemental magic.": "泰尔地区的巫师国王们是彼此间的死敌，所以不可能出现类似领主联盟的情况。然而，一个特定城邦的圣殿骑士官僚机构可以在这个冒险的黑暗太阳转换中起到类似的作用。在大冲积沙荒地，一个危险的魔法邪教组织的兴起，最直接关系到的城邦是泰尔，在卡拉克国王死后，它正在努力寻找自己的方向。泰尔的圣殿骑士们不能允许一个新的威胁在他们的门前滋生，也不能允许对手城市的圣殿骑士，如乌里克，获得对邪教元素魔法的控制。",
	"The great merchant houses of the Tyr Region maintain warehouses and emporiums in all the major city-states. All are fiercely competitive and seek out any advantage to use against their rivals, but House Tsalaxa of Draj is widely regarded as the most ruthless of them all. Agents of House Tsalaxa do not hesitate to engage in assassination, bribery, or even sponsoring raids against the caravans of rival houses. For the Tsalaxa, the Cult of Elemental Evil represents a threat to the existing order; widespread destruction is bad for business, even by House Tsalaxa's standards. If the house's agents can seize the cult's secrets in the process of eliminating the threat, so much the better.": "提尔地区的大商行在所有主要的城邦都有仓库和商品交易中心。所有的商行都具有激烈的竞争性，并寻求任何优势来对付他们的对手，但德拉吉的Tsalaxa家族被广泛认为是他们中最无情的一个。Tsalaxa家族的代理人会毫不犹豫地参与暗杀、贿赂，甚至赞助对立家族的商队进行突袭。对于Tsalaxa来说，元素邪恶崇拜代表了对现有秩序的威胁；即使以Tsalaxa家族的标准，广泛的破坏也不利于生意。如果该家族的代理人能够在消除威胁的过程中夺取该邪教的秘密，那就更好了。",
	"Home to the Dragonlance saga, the world of Krynn has been a favorite of many over the years. With some minor adjustments, you can adapt {@i Princes of the Apocalypse}to your Dragonlance campaign. The story of Elemental Evil can be recast as the forces of Chaos seeking another way to destroy the world of Krynn.": "作为《龙之谷》传奇的故乡，克莱恩的世界多年来一直是许多人的最爱。通过一些小的调整，你可以将{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}改编成你的《龙之谷》战役。元素之恶的故事可以被改编为混沌势力寻求另一种方式来摧毁克莱恩世界。",
	"Both time and place must be considered when converting this adventure for use in a Dragonlance campaign. Each era of Krynn's history provides its own challenges. Does the adventure take place during the pre-Cataclysm Age of Might? Before or during the War of Lance? Where on Krynn will Elemental Evil arise: the hills and mountains of Solamnia? Ergoth? Or the soon-to-be destroyed Istar? We suggest setting the campaign when and where the Dragonlance saga began: in the lands of Abanasinia, near Solace and Haven, at the end of the Time of Darkness in the year or two preceding the War of the Lance.": "在将这个冒险转换为《龙之谷》战役使用时，必须考虑时间和地点。Krynn历史上的每个时代都有自己的挑战。这个冒险是否发生在大灾变前的强盛时代？在兰斯战争之前或期间？元素邪恶会在克莱恩的什么地方出现：索兰尼亚的丘陵和山脉？埃尔戈特？还是即将毁灭的伊斯塔？我们建议将战役设定在《龙枪》传奇开始的时间和地点：在阿巴纳西尼亚的土地上，靠近索拉斯和海文，在长枪战争前一两年的黑暗时代结束时。",
	"In this scenario, the Sumber Hills are replaced by the hills and mountains between Solace and Haven. Instead of Red Larch, the starting town of the adventure is Gateway, some distance south of Solace. The forks of the White-Rage River replace the Dessarin River, and many of the adventure locations can be located north and south of Gateway along the river or in the mountains to the west. The biggest city of the region is Haven, which can serve the same role as Yartar.": "在这个场景中，桑伯山被索拉斯和海文之间的丘陵和山脉所取代。冒险的起始城镇不是红落叶松，而是盖特威，在索拉斯南部的一段距离。白怒河的分叉口取代了德萨林河，许多冒险地点都可以在盖特威的南北两边沿河或西边的山脉中找到。该地区最大的城市是黑文（Haven），它可以起到与雅尔塔相同的作用。",
	"The background information regarding the ancient dwarven nation of Besilmer can survive by incorporating it into the history of Thorbardin, predating the Kinslayer Wars.": "关于古代矮人国家贝西尔默的背景资料，可以通过将其纳入索尔巴丹的历史，在弑君者战争之前就已经存在。",
	"Before recorded history, the god known as Chaos was trapped by Reorx in the Graygem, but echoes of Chaos remained in the world. These took the form of nodes buried deep in the earth, where they should have been forgotten for all time.": "在有记载的历史之前，被称为混沌的神被Reorx困在了灰宝石中，但混沌的回声仍然存在于世界上。这些回声以节点的形式深埋于地底，它们本应在那里被永远遗忘。",
	"Thousands of years before the Cataclysm, a group of dwarf settlers established an enclave in the mountains north of Thorbardin, which they called Tyar-Besil. Unbeknown to the dwarves, the settlement was built less than a mile from the location of one such Chaos node. After the Kinslayer Wars, the dwarves retreated south of Pax Tharkas and into Thorbardin, abandoning the underground city, but only after sealing it against any intrusion. In the Elemental Evil campaign, this city becomes the location of the four elemental temples.": "在大灾变的数千年前，一群矮人定居者在索尔巴丁北部的山区建立了一块飞地，他们称之为泰尔-贝西尔。矮人不知道的是，这个定居点离一个混沌节点的位置不到一英里。在弑君者战争之后，矮人从帕克斯-塔卡斯（Pax Tharkas）南部撤退到索巴丁（Thorbardin），放弃了这座地下城市，但只是在将其封存以防止任何入侵。在元素邪恶战役中，这座城市成为四个元素神殿的所在地。",

	"The calamitous forces of the Cataclysm destroyed and buried countless cities, but also unearthed ancient ruins and places of power. In the wake of this destruction, the perceived absence of Krynn's gods led humans to seek out other sources of magic that could rival the divine. Four of these seekers found their way into the lost city of Tyar-Besil and discovered newly opened tunnels that led to the Fane of the Eye, the ancient Chaos echo buried deep beneath the mountains of Abanasinia. These four seekers became the elemental prophets. Wielding the power of the elemental weapons, the four prophets recruited their cultist followers and began to work to further the mysterious designs of the Elder Elemental Eye.": "大灾变的灾难性力量摧毁并掩埋了无数的城市，但也发掘出了古老的遗迹和权力场所。在这场毁灭之后，克莱恩诸神的缺席让人类开始寻找其他可以与神性相媲美的魔法来源。其中四位探索者发现他们进入了失落的城市泰尔-贝西尔，并发现了新开辟的隧道，这些隧道通向眼睛之窗，即深埋在阿巴纳西尼亚山下的古老混沌回声。这四个探索者成为了元素先知。挥舞着元素武器的力量，这四位先知招募了他们的崇拜者，并开始努力推进上古元素之眼的神秘设计。",

Instead of an established faction, treat the various Harper contacts in the adventure as friendly NPCs who are willing to help the characters along, so long as they appear to be working for the forces of good.": "在Krynn，没有任何一个组织能与这个横跨世界的组织相比。与其说是一个既定的派别，不如把冒险中的各种哈珀联系人视为友好的NPC，他们愿意帮助角色，只要他们看起来是在为正义的力量工作。",
	"Replace the Order of the Gauntlet with the Knights of Solamnia, who are dedicated to upholding the cause of good. Although the Knights don't exercise political power in the region, it is not unreasonable for the player characters to be their agents, on the lookout for unrest as the threat of war looms.": "用索兰尼亚骑士团取代高塔骑士团，他们致力于维护善的事业。虽然骑士团不在该地区行使政治权力，但玩家角色成为他们的代理人也不是没有道理的，他们在战争威胁逼近的时候会注意到动乱。",

Some nobles among Seeker-controlled towns might also be part of this alliance, working against the Theocrats politically.": "领主联盟代表的是阿巴纳西尼亚不受探索者控制的零散城镇的地方统治者。这些定居点大多位于沙尔西海峡的海岸线上，因为内陆的城镇要么在探索者的控制之下，要么是平原人的村庄。探寻者控制的城镇中的一些贵族也可能是这个联盟的一部分，在政治上反对神权者。",
	"In the Abanasinia region, the role of organized crime is mostly filled by the Seeker theocracy. While some Seekers truly do search for evidence of the gods, many are more concerned with establishing and controlling local rule, and do not shy away from using coercion and threats to get their way.": "在阿巴纳西尼亚地区，有组织犯罪的作用主要由探索者神权机构来承担。虽然有些探索者确实在寻找诸神的证据，但许多人更关心建立和控制当地的统治，并不避讳使用胁迫和威胁来达到他们的目的。",
	"Even with the suggested changes to the factions and locations, a key component of the Dragonlance setting is still missing: dragons! If you want to add a draconic influence to the campaign, consider the following changes and additions.": "即使对派别和地点进行了建议的修改，《龙之谷》设定的一个关键组成部分仍然缺失：龙! 如果你想在战役中加入龙族的影响，可以考虑以下的改变和补充。",
	"In this variant, the Dragon Highlords are also interested in the power that the elemental nodes represent. They dispatch forces to help the cultists defend themselves, but also to secure the elemental nodes when the time is right.": "在这个变体中，龙族高地主也对元素结点所代表的力量感兴趣。他们派遣部队帮助邪教组织保护自己，同时也在时机成熟时确保元素节点的安全。",
	"These corrupted offspring of good dragons are tainted by elemental power in the Dragonlance setting. Draconians could be found in elemental temples, especially near the prophets. They should not be the first enemies the characters face when they encounter the elemental cults, but an attack by a draconian squad can replace one of the cultist responses when one of the dungeons is cleared.": "在《龙之谷》的设定中，这些好龙的堕落后代被元素的力量所玷污。龙人可以在元素神庙中找到，特别是在预言家附近。他们不应该是人物在遇到元素邪教时首先面对的敌人，但当其中一个地下城被清理后，龙人小队的攻击可以取代邪教的一个反应。",
	"There isn't space in this book to provide stat blocks for draconians, but you can make your own by adding the half-dragon template (see the Monster Manual) to hobgoblins or lizardfolk. Add a Death Throes trait to complete the transition: for example, baaz draconians turn to stone when killed, and kapak draconians dissolve into pools of acid.": "本书中没有空间提供龙人的状态块，但你可以通过将半龙人模板（见《怪物手册》）加入到霍布林或蜥蜴人中来制作自己的状态块。添加一个死亡之喉的特性来完成过渡：例如，巴兹龙人在被杀后会变成石头，而卡帕克龙人则会溶入酸液池中。",
	"The power of Elemental Evil attracts dragons. You can place a young dragon or a couple of wyrmlings in or near each of the elemental temples. Good examples include a pair of blue dragon wyrmlings in the air temple, a young black dragon near the water temple, or even a corrupted copper dragon somewhere near the earth node. (The Weeping Colossus already contains a red dragon.) These dragons might be part of the dragonarmies, or might instead be drawn to the elemental power of the Chaos node. They can be integrated within the elemental cults, or might be as much a threat to the cultists as they are to the adventurers.": "元素之恶的力量吸引着龙。你可以在每个元素神庙中或附近放置一条年轻的龙或几只巫妖。很好的例子包括在空气神庙中放置一对蓝龙巫妖，在水神庙附近放置一条年轻的黑龙，甚至在大地节点附近放置一条腐败的铜龙。(这些龙可能是龙军的一部分，也可能被混沌节点的元素力量所吸引。它们可以被整合到元素崇拜中，也可能对崇拜者和冒险者都是一种威胁。",
	"Many long-time D&D players regard Oerth, the world of the Greyhawk campaign setting, as the natural and proper home for the Elemental Evil campaign. {@i The Temple of Elemental Evil}, the classic adventure, is set in the world of Greyhawk. {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} draws many inspirations from the original adventure, but this is not the same adventure in a new edition. New story elements such as the elemental prophets, the cults' use of {@i devastation orbs}, and the search for the missing delegation make this a much more far-reaching and event-driven adventure than the original site-based campaign.": "许多长期从事D&D的玩家认为，灰鹰战役设定的世界Oerth是元素邪恶战役的自然和适当的家园。{@i The Temple of Elemental Evil}，这个经典的冒险，是以灰鹰世界为背景的。{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}从原来的冒险中汲取了许多灵感，但这并不是新版本中的同一个冒险。新的故事元素，如元素先知、邪教对{@i devastation orbs}的使用，以及对失踪代表团的搜寻，使这一冒险比原来的现场活动影响更深远，更有事件驱动性。",
	"The classic home of the Temple of Elemental Evil is in the Kron Hills, a lightly populated frontier between the small state of Verbobonc and the elven kingdom of Celene. The Sumber Hills are replaced by the eastern portion of the Kron Hills and the western border of the Gnarley Forest. Instead of Red Larch, the starting town of the adventure is Hommlet. The adventure content described in chapter 6 of this book is a good parallel to the classic adventure, {@i The Village of Hommlet}, and the various sites in and around Red Larch can easily be relocated to the surrounding Kron Hills to introduce the player characters to the region and its people.": "元素邪恶神殿的经典家园在克伦丘陵，这是一个人口稀少的边境地区，位于小国韦尔博邦克和精灵王国塞林之间。桑伯丘陵被克伦丘陵的东部和格纳利森林的西部边界所取代。冒险的起始城镇不是红松，而是霍姆雷特。本书第6章描述的冒险内容与经典的冒险内容有很好的平行性，（%0%），红落叶松及其周围的各个景点可以很容易地迁移到周围的克伦山，向玩家角色介绍该地区及其人民。",
	"Combine the settlements of Womford and nearby Bargewright Inn into the corrupt town of Nulb. The small river known as Imeryds Run serves as the Dessarin River, carrying the barge traffic (and river piracy) that interests the Cult of the Crushing Wave. The gnome town of Tulvar replaces Westbridge, while the Etterboek takes the place of Beliard. The city of Verbobonc can easily serve as both Yartar and Waterdeep. It's the most important city anywhere in the area, and the events described in the \"Dark Dealings in Yartar\" side trek could easily be set along Verbobonc's river wharves. You can add Summit Hall and the Haunted Keeps as they stand to the area around Hommlet; there is no reason places such as these couldn't be located in this corner of the Flanaess.": "将沃姆福德（Womford）和附近的巴格莱特旅馆（Bargewright Inn）的定居点合并为腐败的努尔布镇。被称为Imeryds Run的小河作为Dessarin河，承载着碎浪教感兴趣的驳船运输（和河流海盗）。侏儒城镇图尔瓦取代了西桥，而埃特博克取代了贝利亚德。维尔博邦克（Verbobonc）城可以很容易地同时作为亚尔塔和水底世界。它是该地区最重要的城市，\"雅尔塔的黑暗交易 \"侧线中描述的事件可以很容易地沿着韦尔博邦克的河岸码头进行。你可以在霍姆雷特周围地区加入高峰厅和闹鬼堡垒，因为它们的存在；没有理由不把这样的地方设在弗拉纳斯的这个角落。",
	"In the classic Greyhawk adventure, the temple wasn't built on top of dwarven ruins. Omit any mention of the ancient realm of Besilmer and the underground ruins of Tyar-Besil. Instead, the huge underground stronghold the player characters explore in chapter 4 is the subterranean fortress constructed by an older incarnation of the Cult of Elemental Evil, which has now been reoccupied by the current group of elemental prophets and their followers.": "在经典的灰鹰冒险中，神庙并不是建在矮人废墟之上的。省略任何关于贝西尔默古国和泰尔-贝西尔地下废墟的提及。相反，玩家角色在第四章中探索的巨大地下堡垒是由元素邪恶教派的一个旧的化身建造的地下堡垒，现在已经被现在的元素先知团体和他们的追随者重新占领。",
	"Elemental Evil is not a new threat in the world of Greyhawk. The Temple of Elemental Evil was built long ago and spawned hordes of bloodthirsty monsters that ravaged the lands between Celene and Veluna on several occasions in the past. As far as anyone in the area knows, the temple is currently abandoned and has not posed a threat for several generations. In the last year or so, the dark force known as the Elder Elemental Eye secretly called a new group of elemental prophets to its ancient stronghold. These four individuals found their way down to the Fane of the Eye and took up the elemental weapons, beginning the work of establishing their cults.": "在灰鹰的世界里，元素邪恶并不是一个新的威胁。元素邪恶神庙很早以前就建好了，过去曾多次催生出成群的嗜血怪物，蹂躏塞莱尼和维鲁纳之间的土地。据该地区的人所知，该寺庙目前已被遗弃，几代人以来都没有构成威胁。在过去的一年左右，被称为长老元素之眼的黑暗势力秘密地召集了一批新的元素先知到其古老的据点。这四个人找到了下到眼球之窗的方法，并拿起了元素武器，开始了建立其教派的工作。",
	"The Haunted Keeps described in chapter 3 of this adventure are old castles or strongholds that lie nearby. They were raised by the adventurers of an earlier century who dealt with one of the previous manifestations of Elemental Evil in this spot, but fell into ruin over time. They guard hidden accesses to the dungeons beneath the sprawling surface ruins of the temple. Rivergard Keep lies on the bank of the nearby Imeryds Run.": "本冒险第三章中描述的闹鬼堡垒是位于附近的古老城堡或据点。它们是由早先一个世纪的冒险者建立的，他们在这个地方处理了以前的一个元素邪恶的表现，但随着时间的推移而陷入了破败。他们守卫着通往神庙表面废墟下的地牢的隐藏通道。河岸堡垒位于附近的伊梅里兹河的河岸上。",
	"The missing delegation that serves as the adventure's initial spur to action instead hails from the Principality of Ulek, bound for the city of Dyvers or perhaps Chendl, capital of the nearby kingdom of Furyondy.": "作为冒险的最初动力，失踪的代表团来自乌列克公国，目的地是戴弗斯城，也可能是附近的福瑞迪王国的首都陈德尔。",
	"Instead of the Forgotten Realms factions, the Flanaess has its own set of knightly orders, mage guilds, and elite societies that serve as power groups the player characters can ally themselves with.": "与《被遗忘的王国》中的派别不同，弗拉纳斯有自己的一套骑士团、法师公会和精英社团，作为玩家角色可以与之结盟的权力团体。",
	"The closest equivalent to the Harpers is the Circle of Eight. Although membership in the circle itself is restricted to the most powerful wizards, the group employs many agents and spies to look after its interests. The Circle of Eight is much less benevolent than the Harpers; its wizards are not particularly concerned about tyranny and are more interested in preserving a balance of power throughout the Flanaess. However, major magical threats (such as the rise of Elemental Evil) are very much within the circle's purview.": "与哈珀斯最相近的是八人帮。虽然圈子里的成员只限于最强大的巫师，但该组织雇用了许多代理人和间谍来照顾其利益。八人帮没有哈珀斯那么仁慈；它的巫师们并不特别关心暴政，他们更关心的是保持整个弗拉纳斯的权力平衡。然而，主要的魔法威胁（如元素邪恶的兴起）在很大程度上属于该圈子的管辖范围。",
	"Greyhawk is home to several different paladin orders that could serve as a substitute for this faction, but the best fit is the Church of Saint Cuthbert. The Church includes clerics, paladins, and fighters who stand for law and order and generally oppose evil, and it is found in many different lands throughout the Flanaess.": "灰鹰有几个不同的圣骑士团，可以作为这个派别的替代品，但最适合的是圣卡斯伯特教会。教会包括牧师、圣骑士和战士，他们支持法律和秩序，并普遍反对邪恶，而且在整个弗拉纳斯的许多不同土地上都能找到他们。",
	"The druids of the Flanaess belong to a great order known as the Old Faith. Each region of the continent falls under the purview of a Great Druid, who in turn oversees a hierarchy of lower-ranking druids scattered throughout the lands under his or her dominion. Among their other concerns, the Druids of the Old Faith are staunch enemies of the followers of Elemental Evil and root out its worshipers wherever they arise. Player characters who are not members of the druid class could belong to one of the societies or groups affiliated with the servants of the Old Faith; for example, the Gnarley Forest is home to the Gnarley Rangers, a fellowship that cooperates closely with the druids.": "弗拉纳斯的德鲁伊属于一个被称为古老信仰的伟大组织。大陆的每个地区都属于一个大德鲁伊的管辖范围，而大德鲁伊又监督着散布在他或她统治下的土地上的低级德鲁伊的等级制度。在他们关注的其他问题中，旧信仰的德鲁伊是元素邪恶的追随者的坚定敌人，并在任何地方根除其崇拜者。不是德鲁伊阶级成员的玩家角色可以属于隶属于旧信仰的仆人的某个社团或团体；例如，格纳利森林是格纳利游侠的家，这是一个与德鲁伊密切合作的团体。",
	"The time for a close association between good kingdoms and city-states has not yet come to pass in the Flanaess; nothing like the Lords' Alliance can be found in the lands near the Kron Hills. The closest analogue in the world of Greyhawk is the Knights of the Order of the Hart (usually referred to as the Knights of the Hart). This society of human and elf nobles has branches in Furyondy, Veluna, and the Vesve Forest. Though principally concerned with the danger posed by Iuz, the half-demon tyrant, the order seeks to defend its constituent lands against all sorts of monstrous threats.": "在弗拉纳斯，良好的王国和城邦之间建立紧密联系的时代还没有到来；在克伦山附近的土地上找不到类似领主联盟的东西。灰鹰世界中最接近的类似物是哈特骑士团（通常被称为哈特骑士）。这个由人类和精灵贵族组成的社团在福瑞迪、维鲁纳和维斯夫森林都有分部。虽然主要关注的是半魔族暴君伊兹所带来的危险，但该骑士团试图保护其成员的土地免受各种怪物的威胁。",
	"The Thieves' Guild of Greyhawk is a good conversion for the Zhentarim. Based in the Free City of Greyhawk, the Thieves' Guild seeks to control trade and influence events in many lands throughout the Flanaess. Like the Zhentarim, its members have a reputation as troublemakers but often are forced to meet the threat posed by truly abhorrent villains and monsters, and the cults of Elemental Evil certainly qualify.": "格雷霍克的盗贼公会是赞塔林人的一个很好的转换。盗贼公会以灰鹰自由城为基地，试图控制贸易并影响整个弗拉纳斯许多土地上的事件。与镇塔林一样，它的成员也有麻烦制造者的名声，但经常被迫迎接真正可恶的恶棍和怪物所带来的威胁，而元素邪恶的邪教当然也符合条件。",
	"Replace any mention of deities specific to the Forgotten Realms setting with appropriate Greyhawk deities. For example, the knights based in Summit Hall should be followers of Heironeous instead of Helm or Tyr. (They could be followers of Saint Cuthbert, but that would mean that one of the player character factions has an important stronghold in the region; better if they are potential allies for a character who belongs to the right faction.) In addition, the Elder Elemental Eye might be an aspect of the imprisoned god Tharizdun, a dark power of destruction, entropy, and eternal darkness. Whether the elemental prophets see themselves as worshipers of Tharizdun or only as servants of the Elder Elemental Eye is not relevant to the adventure; madness is madness, after all.": "用适当的灰鹰神灵取代任何提及被遗忘的领域的特定神灵。例如，驻扎在Summit Hall的骑士应该是Heironeous的追随者，而不是Helm或Tyr。(他们可以是圣卡斯伯特的追随者，但这意味着玩家角色的某个派别在该地区有一个重要的据点；如果他们是属于正确派别的角色的潜在盟友则更好）。此外，上古元素之眼可能是被囚禁的神Tharizdun的一个方面，这是一种毁灭、熵和永恒黑暗的黑暗力量。元素先知们是把自己看作是塔里兹敦的崇拜者，还是只看作是上古元素之眼的仆人，这与冒险无关；毕竟，疯狂就是疯狂。",
	"With its emphasis on mystery and exploration, the Eberron campaign setting is a natural fit for {@i Princes of the Apocalypse}. Most of the work in adaptation involves changing place names to fit into Eberron. As you do, consider ways you can use the specifics of the Eberron setting to heighten certain adventure motifs.": "由于强调神秘和探索，Eberron战役设定自然适合（%0%）。大多数改编的工作涉及到改变地名以适应Eberron。在此过程中，考虑如何利用Eberron设定的具体内容来加强某些冒险主题。",
	"Eberron is a place of mystery, and there's already plenty of that in {@i Princes of the Apocalypse.} The first part of the adventure is largely about uncovering the hidden evil that lurks in the region's small towns and frontier strongholds. You have ample ways to play up the sense of mystery. Chapter 3 starts with a missing-persons investigation, for example, and the \"Cure of the Fire Witch,\" \"Dark Dealings in Yartar,\" and \"Halls of the Hunting Axe\" side treks all involve hidden evil and betrayal.": "Eberron是一个充满神秘感的地方，而且在{@i Princes of the Apocalypse.}冒险的第一部分主要是揭开潜伏在该地区的小镇和边疆据点中的隐藏的邪恶。你有足够的方法来渲染神秘感。例如，第三章以失踪人员调查开始，而 \"火巫师的治疗\"、\"雅尔塔的黑暗交易 \"和 \"猎斧大厅 \"的侧翼旅行都涉及隐藏的邪恶和背叛。",
	"If you make additions of your own to the adventure, you can build on the {@i noir} aspects of hidden evil. Make more of the ostensibly friendly NPCs secretly work for one of the four cults. Have the cults lean harder on the leadership of the communities scattered across the region, threatening, blackmailing, and corrupting them so they do the cults' bidding.": "如果你对冒险进行自己的补充，你可以在{@i noir}方面建立隐藏的邪恶。让更多表面上友好的NPC秘密地为四个邪教之一工作。让邪教更加倚重散布在该地区的社区领导，威胁、勒索和腐蚀他们，使他们听从邪教的命令。",
	"Eberron is also about exploration, which is natural fit for a sandbox adventure such as {@i Princes of the Apocalypse}. If you want to enhance the players' feeling of being pioneers, stretch out the distances between communities (the Eberron map is huge, so you should have plenty of room). Have the NPCs know less about goings-on beyond their backyards, and consider giving the players a more limited map of the area with key locations missing. Just finding the Haunted Keeps should feel like an accomplishment. The players (and maybe the characters as well) can gain a sense of accomplishment if they have a more-or-less complete map of the region by the time the adventure draws to a close.": "Eberron也是关于探索的，这自然适合于像{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}这样的沙盒冒险。如果你想增强玩家作为先驱者的感觉，可以拉长社区之间的距离（Eberron地图很大，所以你应该有足够的空间）。让NPC对他们后院以外的事情了解得更少，并考虑给玩家一个更有限的、缺少关键地点的区域地图。只要找到鬼堡就应该有成就感。如果玩家（也许还有角色）在冒险结束时拥有一张或多或少完整的地区地图，他们就能获得一种成就感。",
	"Khorvaire is a sprawling continent with plenty of thinly settled frontiers, so it's relatively easy to find a good place to set {@i Princes of the Apocalypse.} Here are a few examples:": "Khorvaire是一个无垠的大陆，有很多稀疏的边界，所以相对来说，很容易找到一个好的地方来设置{@i Princes of the Apocalypse.}这里有几个例子。",
	"In western Aundair, the wilderness around the town of Wyr is a good choice; the Eldeen Reaches function as the High Forest does in this adventure.": "在昂代尔西部，维尔镇周围的荒野是个不错的选择；艾尔迪恩峡谷（Eldeen Reaches）在这次冒险中的作用与高级森林相同。",
	"In Breland, the small city of Xandrar on the northern border can take the place of Red Larch, with the Haunted Keeps existing as abandoned fortresses from the Last War and the monsters of Droaam being an ongoing threat.": "在布雷兰，北部边境的小城市桑德拉可以代替红落叶，闹鬼堡垒作为最后一次战争中的废弃堡垒而存在，而德罗阿姆的怪物则是一个持续的威胁。",
	"Northern and eastern Karrnath has vast tracts of frontier—plenty of room for a region the size and scope of the Dessarin Valley. Halfling barbarians from the Talenta Plains can replace the Uthgardt barbarians in the adventure.": "Karrnath北部和东部有大片的边境--对于像Dessarin山谷这样的地区来说，有足够的空间。来自塔伦塔平原的半身人野蛮人可以取代冒险中的乌斯加特野蛮人。",
	"The border between Zilargo and Darguun is another frontier region with plenty of isolated settlements and marauding monsters.": "Zilargo和Darguun之间的边界是另一个边境地区，有很多孤立的定居点和掠夺性的怪物。",
	"There are enough blank spaces on the map in Eberron that you should be able to translocate the Dessarin Valley wholesale; such remapping just needs a few location name changes. To get an Eberron feel, it's more important that you come with campaign-specific equivalents for the following:": "在Eberron的地图上有足够多的空白，你应该可以把Dessarin Valley全盘搬过来；这样的重新定位只需要改变一些地点的名称。为了获得Eberron的感觉，更重要的是你要为以下的活动提供具体的对应物。",
	"A hilly region with a river running through it, though the Dessarin Valley is small enough that it might not show up on conventional Eberron campaign maps. Ideally, there should be analogues of the Uthgardt barbarians nearby, and the equivalent of a menacing orc horde that's more distant.": "一个有河流穿过的丘陵地区，尽管德萨林谷很小，以至于它可能不会出现在传统的Eberron活动地图上。理想情况下，附近应该有乌斯加特野蛮人的类似物，以及更遥远的兽人部落的类似物。",
	"A big city that's at least a few days' travel away, preferably reachable by both river and road. There shouldn't be airship or lightning rail access to the campaign area, though—the rural location is key to the adventure background.": "一个至少要走几天的大城市，最好是可以通过河流和公路到达。不过，不应该有飞艇或闪电般的铁路进入活动区域--农村的位置是冒险背景的关键。",
	"An untamed forest or other wilderness that can substitute for the High Forest, with an equivalent to the elves who live within it.": "一个未被驯服的森林或其他荒野，可以替代高级森林，与生活在其中的精灵相当。",
	"The biggest change you'll have to make is to the adventure's assumed cosmology. Eberron lacks the traditional elemental planes, so you'll have to replace them with the following (with the understanding that they aren't perfect matches):": "你要做的最大改变是对冒险的假设宇宙学。Eberron缺乏传统的元素位面，所以你必须用以下的元素位面来代替它们（但要明白它们并不完全匹配）。",
	"Syrania, the Azure Sky (air)": "塞拉尼亚，蔚蓝的天空（空气）",
	"Kythri, the Churning Chaos (earth)": "搅动的混沌Kythri(土)",
	"Fernia, the Sea of Fire (fire)": "费尔尼亚，火海（火）。",
	"Lamannia, the Twilight Forest (water)": "拉曼尼亚，暮色森林（水）。",
	"As the adventure begins, Eberron's sages note with interest that four planes will become coterminous with Eberron within the next several months—a rare occurrence even in the annals of astronomers and diviners. For them, it's a matter of academic interest. But for {@creature Imix|PotA}, {@creature Ogrémoch|PotA}, {@creature Olhydra|PotA}, and {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}, it's the chance they've been waiting for.": "随着冒险的开始，Eberron的贤者们饶有兴趣地注意到，在接下来的几个月里，有四个位面将与Eberron成为同位面，这即使在天文学家和占卜师的史册上也是罕见的。对他们来说，这只是一个学术上的兴趣问题。但对于{@creature Imix|PotA}、{@creature Ogrémoch|PotA}、{@creature Olhydra|PotA}和{@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}来说，这就是他们一直在等待的机会。",
	"Under direction of the nameless entity known as the Elder Elemental Eye (perhaps the Dragon Below, the Dreaming Dark, or the Lords of Dust), the four Elemental Princes assemble their cults as described in the adventure. Their goal isn't just to bring the region under the control of Elemental Evil, but to freeze the progression of all the planes of existence so that their four planes remain coterminous with Eberron. Then they will march vast armies from their extraplanar homes and bring all of Khorvaire—and eventually all of Eberron—under their control.": "在被称为 \"长老元素之眼 \"的无名实体（也许是 \"下面的龙\"、\"梦中的黑暗 \"或 \"尘埃领主\"）的指导下，四位元素王子按照冒险中所描述的那样组建了他们的教派。他们的目标不仅仅是将该地区置于元素邪恶的控制之下，而是要冻结所有存在位面的进程，使他们的四个位面与Eberron保持一致。然后他们将从他们的星外家园调集庞大的军队，将整个霍尔韦尔--最终将整个伊伯伦--置于他们的控制之下。",
	"It's not hard to find Eberron equivalents for the factions of the Forgotten Realms.": "要为被遗忘的领域的派别找到Eberron的对应物并不难。",
	"It's a bit of a stretch, but consider using one of Eberron's academic organizations—the Library of Korranberg or Morgrave University—as the equivalent of the Harpers. Their purpose is less political, but they're still altruistic and stand largely outside existing power structures. And with so many mysteries of Eberron waiting to be discovered, those organizations are out in the dangerous places of the world quite a bit—just like the Harpers.": "这有点牵强，但可以考虑用Eberron的一个学术组织--Korranberg图书馆或Morgrave大学--作为Harpers的对应机构。他们的目的不那么政治化，但他们仍然是利他主义的，并且在很大程度上站在现有权力结构之外。由于Eberron有那么多的谜团等待着人们去发现，这些组织经常在世界的危险地带活动，就像哈珀斯一样。",
	"The Church of the Silver Flame is more narrowly religious than the Order of the Gauntlet, but its overall tone is similar. Because the Silver Flame is Thrane's state religion, characters of any class from that nation might work toward the Silver Flame's ends.": "银色火焰教会比高塔骑士团更加狭隘的宗教，但其总体基调是相似的。因为银色火焰是瑟兰的国教，该国家的任何阶层的人物都可能为银色火焰的目的工作。",
	"The Wardens of the Wood are this faction's logical equivalent in Eberron if you're setting {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} anywhere near the Eldeen Reaches. Otherwise, the Gatekeepers are a good choice.": "如果你的设定{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}接近Eldeen Reaches的话，森林守护者是这个派别在Eberron的逻辑对应者。否则，守门人是个不错的选择。",
	"The Twelve serves as the defender of civilization much as the Lords' Alliance does, and its members are similarly vulnerable to occasional bouts of rivalry and infighting. The Aurum, while far less altruistic than the Lords' Alliance, fulfills a similar function in the world of Eberron, fighting to protect the status quo and ensure that those in power stay that way.": "十二人组和领主联盟一样，都是文明的捍卫者，其成员也同样容易受到偶尔的竞争和内斗的影响。曙光会虽然远不如领主联盟那么无私，但在Eberron世界中履行着类似的职能，为保护现状和确保当权者保持现状而战斗。",
	"Replace the Black Network with the Order of the Emerald Claw, though you should downplay the connection to Vol.": "用翡翠之爪勋章取代黑网，不过你应该淡化与沃尔的联系。",
	"As an alternative to the five factions, you can use Eberron's dragonmarked houses. If you do so, remember that many members of the houses don't possess dragonmarks, and that even houses dominated by one race (the half-elves of House Lyrandar, for example) include members of other races.": "作为五个派系的替代方案，你可以使用Eberron的龙纹家族。如果你这样做，请记住，这些家族的许多成员并不拥有龙印，而且即使是由一个种族主导的家族（例如Lyrandar家族的半精灵）也包括其他种族的成员。",
	"When you start the adventure, have every character choose a dragonmarked house in addition to a race, class, and background. House Deneith functions much like the Order of the Gauntlet, House Kundarak serves as the Lords' Alliance, House Lyrandar or House Tharashk is equivalent to the Harpers, House Phiarlan and House Thuranni are the Zhentarim, and House Vadalis fills in for the Emerald Enclave.": "当你开始冒险时，除了种族、等级和背景外，让每个角色选择一个龙纹家族。Deneith家族的功能很像高塔骑士团，Kundarak家族作为领主联盟，Lyrandar家族或Tharashk家族相当于哈珀人，Phiarlan家族和Thuranni家族是Zhentarim，而Vadalis家族则代表翡翠飞地。",
	"Once you've located the adventure in the world and figured out how you're going to handle the factions, only a few tasks remain.": "一旦你找到了世界上的冒险，并想好了如何处理各派别，就只剩下一些任务了。",
	"Give some of the magic items in the adventure an Eberron spin by connecting them to the magic of dragonshards. The four elemental weapons wielded by the prophets, for example, might be powered by Khyber dragonshards.": "将冒险中的一些魔法物品与龙石的魔法联系起来，使它们具有Eberron的特色。例如，先知们挥舞的四种元素武器可能是由开伯尔龙石驱动的。",
	"Connect the economy of the Dessarin Valley to the dragonmarked houses. Kaylessa runs Red Larch's inn, the Swinging Sword, on behalf of House Ghallanda, and many of the town's wagonwrights are affiliated with House Lyrandar. The missing delegation that kicks off the adventure in chapter 3 might be organized by House Kundarak.": "将德萨林谷的经济与龙纹屋联系起来。凯莉莎代表加兰达家族经营着红落叶的旅馆--摇摆之剑，而镇上的许多马车夫都隶属于利兰达家族。第三章中开启冒险的失踪代表团可能是由昆达拉克家族组织的。",
	"Include some NPCs of Eberron-specific races. Grund in Red Larch (described in chapter 6) can be a warforged; much of the town looks down on him anyway. The doppelganger in the \"Halls of the Hunting Axe\" side trek could be a changeling, and it's not difficult to imagine the prophet {@creature Vanifer|PotA} being one too. Some of the lycanthropes and druids at Scarlet Moon Hall (described in chapter 3) might be shifters.": "包括一些Eberron特定种族的NPC。红落叶松镇的格伦德（在第六章中描述）可以是一个战争锻造者；反正镇上很多人都看不起他。在 \"猎斧大厅 \"侧面的跋涉中，二重身可能是一个变种人，而且不难想象先知（%0%）也是一个。猩红之月大厅的一些狼人和德鲁伊（在第三章中描述）可能是变种人。",
	"Tweak the adventure's background to connect it to the Last War. Perhaps the four prophets are war refugees—or war criminals. And they found themselves picking up their elemental weapons for the first time on the Day of Mourning.": "调整冒险的背景，将其与最后的战争联系起来。也许这四位先知是战争难民，或者是战争罪犯。而他们发现自己在哀悼日第一次拿起了他们的元素武器。",
	"If you've created a fantasy world of your own to serve as the setting for your Dungeons & Dragons game, it will work just fine for the Elemental Evil campaign. The servants of the Elder Elemental Eye might operate under different names or present themselves in new guises, but elemental corruption can strike any world at any time. Heroes are always be needed to drive back the forces of darkness and destruction.": "如果你已经创建了一个属于你自己的幻想世界，作为你的龙与地下城游戏的背景，它就可以很好地适用于元素邪恶活动。长老元素之眼的仆人可能以不同的名字运作，或以新的身份出现，但元素的腐败可以在任何时候袭击任何世界。我们总是需要英雄来击退黑暗和毁灭的力量。",
	"The events of {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} take place in a thinly settled frontier, far from any kind of central authority. There are no power groups that can easily contest the rise of the elemental prophets—that's why the burden of action falls to the player characters. The easiest conversion is to take the whole Dessarin Valley and drop it into the map of your world. Locations such as Red Larch or the Sumber Hills are generic enough that they would fit in most D&D settings. You may want to rename deities or factions to the pantheon or power groups present in your campaign, but otherwise you can incorporate the adventure as written into a part of the world your player characters have not yet explored.": "{@i Princes of the Apocalypse}的事件发生在一个人口稀少的边境地区，远离任何类型的中央政权。没有任何权力团体可以轻易地对元素先知的崛起提出异议--这就是为什么行动的重任落在了玩家角色身上。最简单的转换是把整个德萨林谷丢到你的世界地图中。诸如红落叶松或桑伯山这样的地点足够通用，它们适合大多数D&D的设定。你可能想把神灵或派别重新命名为你的战役中存在的万神殿或权力集团，但除此之外，你可以把写好的冒险纳入你的玩家角色尚未探索的世界的一部分。",
	"Alternatively, you can find a suitable place in your world where you can arrange towns analogous to Red Larch, Womford, Beliard, and Westbridge in the vicinity of a desolate wilderness like the Sumber Hills. In this adventure, these towns are as much as 70 or 80 miles apart, but there is no reason you couldn't fit them in a much smaller area. As long as the towns are at least a day's travel from each other, you have enough wilderness to make moving from town to town a serious decision point for the players.": "或者，你可以在你的世界中找到一个合适的地方，在像桑伯山这样的荒凉荒野附近安排类似于红松、沃姆福德、贝利亚德和西桥的城镇。在这次冒险中，这些城镇相距多达70或80英里，但你没有理由不把它们安排在一个更小的区域。只要这些城镇之间至少有一天的路程，你就有足够的荒野，使从一个城镇到另一个城镇成为玩家的重要决策点。",
	"The Sumber Hills are presented as an area of dry badlands, but they don't have to be hills in your campaign. A region of uninhabited moorland, a wide marsh or swamp, or even a dark and haunted forest would serve just as well as a setting for the cult outposts and the events described in the search for the missing delegation from Mirabar. Naturally, you should select a setting where old castles are likely to be reoccupied by sinister newcomers, and a huge old subterranean complex could underlie the mysterious ruins.": "桑伯山是作为一个干燥的坏境区域出现的，但在你的战役中它们不一定是山丘。一个无人居住的荒地、一片宽阔的沼泽地，甚至是一片黑暗的、闹鬼的森林，都可以作为邪教前哨站和寻找米拉巴尔失踪代表团的事件的背景。当然，你应该选择一个古老的城堡有可能被险恶的新来者重新占领的环境，而一个巨大的古老的地下建筑群可能在神秘的废墟之下。",
	"For the Elemental Evil story, we tried to bring the elemental cults to life in a way that we'd never done before. We also wanted to make sure that each cult had its own identity and recurring motifs. Water cultists have scaly skin. Air cultists use elemental devices, such as {@i balloon packs} and {@i wingwear}, to fly. Fire cultists harness the forge to create all sorts of fiery implements and weird ironworks. Earth cultists meld their flesh with stone.": "对于《元素邪恶》的故事，我们试图以一种我们以前从未做过的方式将元素邪教带入生活。我们还想确保每个邪教都有自己的身份和反复出现的主题。水邪教的人有鳞片状的皮肤。空气崇拜者使用元素装置，如（%0%）和（%1%），来飞行。火崇拜者利用锻造术来创造各种火热的工具和奇怪的铁制品。大地崇拜者将他们的肉体与石头融为一体。",
	"Because the cultists are insane, it's easy to imagine many crazy ideas. Water cultists riding giant walruses! Earth cultists with purple worm hatcheries! It's all good. This appendix contains a sampling of the concept art we commissioned for the Elemental Evil story, not all of which ended up in this adventure. Sometimes we went in directions that proved too wacky for our tastes, but hopefully you'll see something here that inspires you.": "因为邪教分子是疯狂的，所以很容易想象出许多疯狂的想法。水上邪教徒骑着巨大的海象! 有紫色蠕虫孵化器的地球崇拜者! 这一切都很好。本附录包含了我们为《元素之恶》故事委托创作的概念艺术的样本，并非所有的作品都在这次冒险中出现。有时我们走的方向被证明对我们的口味来说太古怪了，但希望你能在这里看到一些能激发你的灵感。",
