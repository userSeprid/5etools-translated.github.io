	"Three hundred years ago, the Cataclysm brought ruin to the world of Krynn. In a single day, an age of wonders came to an end. Countless innocents died, the face of the world was reshaped, and the gods themselves faded into legend. Through ages of struggle, the peoples of Krynn survived, but the world isn't what it was. Those nations that remain linger in the shadows of their ancestors' wonders. Only slowly have they begun to push back centuries of darkness and rediscover how the world has changed.": "三百年前，大灾变给克莱恩世界带来了毁灭。在短短的一天里，一个充满奇迹的时代就这样结束了。无数无辜的人死去，世界的面貌被重塑，而诸神本身也消逝在传说中。经过漫长的斗争，克莱恩的人民幸存下来，但世界已经不是原来的样子。那些留下来的国家在他们祖先的奇迹的阴影下徘徊。只有慢慢地，他们才开始推倒几个世纪的黑暗，重新发现世界是如何改变的。",

	"War is coming—that truth I can no longer deny. Here in Solamnia's eastern reaches, rumors swirl of human-led armies on the march, their ranks swelled by hobgoblins, minotaurs, ogres, and mysterious hooded mercenaries, all seeking a share of the spoils. Our allies in Nordmaar have fallen silent, and desperate travelers say the people of Khur have joined the enemy en masse. Whispers also speak of winged doom, wild reports of riders on dragonnels—and I dare imagine worse.": "战争即将来临--这是我再也无法否认的事实。在索兰尼亚的东部地区，关于人类领导的军队正在行军的传言不绝于耳，他们的队伍中充斥着妖精、牛头人、食人魔和神秘的蒙面雇佣兵，他们都想分得一杯羹。我们在诺德玛尔的盟友已经陷入沉默，绝望的旅行者说库尔的人民已经集体加入了敌人的行列。窃窃私语中还提到了有翅膀的厄运，关于骑龙人的疯狂报道--我敢想象更糟糕的情况。",

Rather than providing an overview of the entire world, the book focuses on the region surrounding the city of Kalaman in the nation of Solamnia as the War of the Lance first reaches its borders.

Beyond this, the book is divided into the sections below.": "本书通过一场特定冲突的视角，展示了克莱恩世界的一瞥。本书没有对整个世界进行概述，而是在长矛战争首次到达边界时，将重点放在索兰尼亚国卡拉曼城周围的地区。世界的细节和卡拉曼所面临的危险通过这个介绍来呈现，并辅以索兰尼亚学者和士兵的报告。除此以外，本书还分为以下几个部分。",

	"While every world's history is vast and fractured, with missing pieces and forgotten perspectives, Krynn's tale has been shattered by the global catastrophe called the Cataclysm. The world of Krynn was forged and destroyed, yet—broken and scarred—it continued on. Most of its people, seeking merely to survive in their slowly healing lands, care little for eons past. But the sages who piece together fragments of the past focus on three periods: before the Cataclysm, the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since.": "每个世界的历史都是庞大而断裂的，有缺失的碎片和被遗忘的观点，而克莱恩的故事却被称为大灾变的全球灾难所打破了。克莱恩的世界被锻造和摧毁，但它仍在继续前进，而且伤痕累累。它的大多数人仅仅是为了在他们慢慢愈合的土地上生存，对过去的岁月并不关心。但那些将过去的碎片拼凑在一起的贤者们则专注于三个时期：大灾变之前，大灾变本身，以及大灾变之后的悲惨时代。",

This period's records are mere legends and scriptures, and few credit their details as fact.": "Krynn最早的几个世纪已经进入了神话史。故事开始于星辰时代，当时诸神从原始的混沌中铸造了这个世界。这个时期的记录仅仅是传说和经文，很少有人把它们的细节当作事实。",
	"Next came the Age of Dreams, a time when heroes battled the forces of evil. Many modern cultures and institutions saw their origins in this era, including the Knights of Solamnia, the Mages of High Sorcery, and the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin. Ironically, these cultures often dismiss one another's foundational stories as baseless myths while fiercely insisting on the veracity of their own.": "接下来是梦想时代，这是一个英雄与邪恶力量战斗的时代。许多现代文化和机构都起源于这个时代，包括索兰尼亚骑士团、高阶巫术法师和矮人王国索巴丁。具有讽刺意味的是，这些文化经常将彼此的基础故事视为毫无根据的神话而加以驳斥，同时却激烈地坚持自己的故事的真实性。",
	"During a terrible conflict known as the Third Dragon War, the knight Huma Dragonbane was granted the first of the fabled {@item Dragonlance|FTD|dragonlances}. He used it to defeat the evil god Takhisis the Dragon Queen and end the war, forcing the god and her dragons to leave Krynn. The good dragons of Krynn soon departed as well, leaving the world to mortals and the remaining gods.": "在一次被称为第三次龙族战争的可怕冲突中，骑士Huma Dragonbane被授予了第一个传说中的（%0%）。他用它打败了邪恶的龙后塔克西丝神，结束了战争，迫使神和她的龙离开克莱恩。克莱恩的好龙们很快也离开了，把世界留给了凡人和剩余的神。",
	"During the thousand years before the Cataclysm, known as the Age of Might, several human nations flourished, conquering vast swaths of the continent of Ansalon in the name of good. But the triumph of the Age of Might sowed the seeds of its downfall.": "在大灾变之前的一千年里，也就是所谓的强权时代，几个人类国家蓬勃发展，以善的名义征服了安萨隆大陆的大片土地。但强大时代的胜利却为它的衰落埋下了种子。",
	"Over the centuries, the city of Istar in eastern Ansalon grew into a continent-spanning empire, thanks in part to a military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Istar came to be ruled by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and themselves the holy messengers of the gods of good. Under their leadership, Istar declared war on actions, peoples, and even thoughts the kingpriests considered evil. Increasingly rigid and theocratic, Istar reached its apex of power just before its apocalyptic fall. The last kingpriest undertook ever more audacious magical feats, culminating in a ritual to attain godhood and rule Krynn forever in the name of good. At last, the gods acted, united in their condemnation of Istar.": "几个世纪以来，安萨隆东部的伊斯塔城发展成为一个横跨大陆的帝国，这部分归功于与索兰尼亚骑士团的军事联盟。伊斯特城由一系列祭司统治，他们宣称伊斯特城是世界的中心，自己是善神的神圣使者。在他们的领导下，伊斯塔向那些被祭司认为是邪恶的行为、民族、甚至思想宣战。Istar越来越僵化，越来越神权化，在其世界末日来临之前达到了权力的顶峰。最后一位祭司进行了更加大胆的魔法表演，最终在一个仪式中达到了神的地位，并以善的名义永远统治克莱恩。最后，众神采取了行动，联合起来谴责伊斯特。",
	"As a last effort to avoid mass destruction, the gods sent the Thirteen Warnings, a series of signs meant to deter the kingpriest. Trees wept blood, fires raged unnaturally, and cyclones struck the gleaming Temple of the Kingpriest. The gods also warned a few chosen mortals, reasoning that if any of them reached Istar and prevented the ritual, the world might not be beyond redemption. But the messengers failed—the kingpriest and his followers dismissed the warnings as the work of evil and continued on their path. As the hour of the kingpriest's ritual to attain godhood arrived, the gods whisked away their most devout followers and unleashed punishment on all who remained.": "作为避免大规模破坏的最后努力，众神发出了十三条警告，这是一系列旨在威慑王师的迹象。树木泣血，大火不正常地肆虐，旋风袭击了金碧辉煌的王师庙。诸神还警告了一些被选中的凡人，认为如果他们中的任何一个人到达伊斯塔并阻止了仪式，世界可能就不会被救赎。但是信使们都失败了--祭司和他的追随者们将这些警告视为邪恶之举，继续走他们的路。当国王牧师举行成神仪式的时刻到来时，诸神带走了他们最虔诚的追随者，并对所有留下来的人进行了惩罚。",
	"A mountain of fire fell from the sky, destroying Istar. The Blood Sea—a new ocean that split eastern Ansalon—consumed the empire. Coastlines shifted all over the world, sundering nations, drowning whole regions, and stranding ports miles from the sea. Though some lands escaped the worst of the destruction, none were spared divine wrath.": "一座火山从天而降，摧毁了伊斯塔。血海--一个分割安萨隆东部的新海洋，吞噬了整个帝国。世界各地的海岸线都发生了变化，分裂了国家，淹没了整个地区，并将港口搁置在离海数英里的地方。虽然有些地方躲过了最严重的破坏，但没有人能够幸免于神的愤怒。",
	"The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names were all but forgotten.": "然后，诸神和他们的祝福就从世界上消失了，久而久之，连他们的名字都被遗忘了。",
	"The Cataclysm! It looms larger than any other event in the history of our world, forever dividing time into before and after. Even our calendar reflects this, marking our last four chaotic centuries in years After Cataclysm (AC), while the millennia before, stretching back into shrouded myth, are Pre-Cataclysm (PC).": "大灾变! 它比我们世界历史上的任何其他事件都要大，永远将时间分为之前和之后。甚至我们的日历也反映了这一点，在大灾变（AC）之后的四个混乱的世纪，而之前的几千年，一直延伸到被遮蔽的神话中，是大灾变之前（PC）。",
	"Many records of the time before the Cataclysm are lost to us. Those that do survive are often perplexing, referencing nations and cultures that no longer exist and geography that has changed beyond recognition.": "大灾变之前的许多记录对我们来说已经消失了。那些幸存下来的记录往往令人困惑，提到了不再存在的国家和文化，以及已经改变得面目全非的地理环境。",
	"Still, it is possible to piece these scattered sources together. At the request of the good knights of Maelgoth, here are my notes, compiling a rough introduction to the histories recorded here at the Great Library of Palanthas.": "不过，我们还是有可能将这些零散的资料拼凑起来。应梅尔戈斯的好骑士们的要求，这里是我的笔记，对帕兰萨斯大图书馆这里记录的历史进行了粗略的介绍。",

	"The Cataclysm ushered in a period of chaos. During the next three centuries, known as the Time of Darkness, cultures and ecologies were radically altered, causing famine, plague, and mass migrations. The Knights of Solamnia, the champions who might've kept Ansalon united, were distrusted as former allies of Istar and persecuted across the continent, even in Solamnia.": "大灾变迎来了一个混乱的时期。在接下来的三个世纪里，也就是所谓的黑暗时期，文化和生态环境被彻底改变，造成了饥荒、瘟疫和大规模移民。索兰尼亚骑士，这些可能使安萨隆保持团结的冠军，作为伊斯塔的前盟友而受到不信任，在整个大陆甚至在索兰尼亚都受到迫害。",
	"The elven nations shut their borders. The dwarves of Thorbardin withdrew to their deep tunnels, refusing entrance to refugees from the surface. Many societies turned on one another or fell to disease and war. Nations of hobgoblins and ogres spread, capitalizing on humanity's decline and claiming whole regions. Much that survived the Cataclysm was lost in darkness.": "精灵族国家关闭了他们的边界。索尔巴丹的矮人撤回了他们的深坑，拒绝来自地面的难民进入。许多社会彼此反目，或倒向疾病和战争。妖精和食人魔的国家蔓延开来，利用人类的衰落，占领了整个地区。在大灾变中幸存下来的许多东西都消失在黑暗中。",
	"At length, the worst effects of the disaster waned. Though many elves and mountain dwarves remained reclusive, other cultures tentatively rebuilt. Explorers ventured forth to map the drastically altered continent. Societies reestablished bonds of trade that united and diversified them.": "渐渐地，灾难的最坏影响减弱了。虽然许多精灵和山地矮人仍然隐居，但其他文化却在试探性地重建。探险家们冒险去绘制这个被彻底改变的大陆。各个社会重新建立了贸易纽带，将他们团结在一起并使之多样化。",
	"As the civilizations of Krynn rebuilt, and new societies arose, the world learned to live with a jarring truth: the gods were truly gone. Religion on Krynn was altered forever. True clerics, who once worked miracles on behalf of their gods, had vanished. While some people remained devout, many others turned to false religions in search of answers and comfort. Some of these new faiths were founded by charlatans, others by zealots. Some claimed the names of the gods, others dismissed them entirely. In this radically changed world bereft of immortal insight, truth became subject to conjecture, even among Krynn's most dedicated scholars.": "随着克莱恩文明的重建和新社会的出现，世界学会了接受一个令人震惊的事实：诸神真的消失了。克莱恩的宗教被永远改变了。曾经代表他们的神明创造奇迹的真正的神职人员已经消失了。虽然有些人仍然很虔诚，但许多人转向了虚假的宗教以寻求答案和安慰。这些新的信仰有些是由骗子建立的，有些是由狂热者建立的。有些人宣称有神的名字，有些人则完全否定了它们。在这个失去了不朽洞察力的彻底改变的世界里，真理成为猜测的对象，即使在克莱恩最敬业的学者中也是如此。",
	"Even as Ansalon healed, a new threat grew. The Dragon Queen Takhisis—known as Tiamat on other worlds—was banished from Krynn over a thousand years ago. Since then, she had waited patiently, plotting her return. Unbeknownst to the other gods, she planted a piece of the kingpriest's ruined temple at Neraka—hidden in the volcanic Taman Busuk region. There it grew into a baleful shadow of Istar's greatest edifice. Though this allowed the Dragon Queen to influence the world through a portal opened there, a fragment of the temple's foundation stone was missing, preventing her from fully returning to the world. She called on the evil dragons who served her, long withdrawn from the world, and began once more to plot the conquest of Krynn.": "即使在安萨隆痊愈的时候，一个新的威胁也在增长。龙后塔克西丝（Takhisis）在其他世界被称为提亚马特（Tiamat），在一千多年前被驱逐出克莱恩。从那时起，她一直耐心地等待着，策划着她的回归。在其他神明不知情的情况下，她在内拉卡（Neraka）种植了一块国王牧师的废墟神庙--隐藏在塔曼布苏克火山地区。在那里，它成长为Istar最伟大的建筑的一个可怕的阴影。虽然这使龙后能够通过在那里打开的门户影响世界，但神庙基石的碎片缺失，使她无法完全返回世界。她召唤了为她服务的恶龙，这些恶龙早已退出了这个世界，并再次开始策划对克莱恩的征服。",
	"Chromatic dragons, acting on their god's orders, stole the eggs of good metallic dragons. The metallic dragons reluctantly pledged to not interfere in the coming war in exchange for the promised safety of their abducted broods.": "色素龙根据他们的神的命令，偷走了好的金属龙的蛋。金属龙不情愿地承诺不干涉即将到来的战争，以换取他们被绑架的孩子的安全承诺。",
	"But the Dragon Queen's servants secretly broke their promises. Takhisis taught her followers to corrupt the stolen eggs into monstrous warriors known as draconians, gambling that draconian armies will conquer Ansalon by the time the metallic dragons learn of this betrayal.": "但龙后的仆人们秘密地违背了他们的承诺。塔克西丝教导她的追随者将偷来的龙蛋腐蚀成被称为龙人的畸形战士，赌的就是当金属龙知道这一背叛时，龙人军队将征服安萨隆。",
	"Unrivaled by gods or dragons, the Dragon Queen unleashes her forces upon a shattered world. In their god's name, these Dragon Armies begin their conquest of Krynn.": "诸神和龙都无法匹敌，龙后将她的力量释放在一个破碎的世界上。以他们神的名义，这些龙族军队开始了对克莱恩的征服。",
	"The Dragon Queen's forces are organized into five Dragon Armies. Draconians fill the ranks of each, though the armies' numbers also include humans, goblins, hobgoblins, ogres, and others who seek wealth and a return to pre-Cataclysm glories. Each Dragon Army is supported by chromatic dragons and their smaller kin, such as dragonnels and wyverns. These winged terrors provide a staggering advantage not seen on battlefields for over a thousand years.": "龙后的部队被组织成五支龙军。龙人充斥着每支军队，尽管军队的人数也包括人类、地精、妖精、食人魔，以及其他寻求财富和恢复大灾变前辉煌的人。每支龙族军队都由色龙和它们较小的亲属支持，如龙巢和狼人。这些长着翅膀的恐怖动物提供了一个在战场上超过千年未见的惊人优势。",
	"The Dragon Queen has elevated her five most cunning and devout followers to the rank of dragon highlord, each commanding one of her armies. The highlords all report to Takhisis's champion, Duulket Ariakas, but there is no shortage of treachery between—and within—the Dragon Armies. The Dragon Queen encourages these conflicts, trusting them to bring the most ruthless and capable leaders to prominence.": "龙女王将她的五个最狡猾、最虔诚的追随者提升为龙族领主，各自指挥着她的一支军队。这些领主都向塔克西丝的冠军杜尔克特-阿里阿卡斯（Duulket Ariakas）报告，但龙族军队之间和内部都不乏背叛行为。龙女王鼓励这些冲突，相信它们会让最无情和最有能力的领导人崭露头角。",
	"The Red Dragon Army—the first, largest, and most powerful of Takhisis's forces—is commanded by the fanatical Dragon Highlord Verminaard, but he has temporarily given control of many of its troops to his acolyte, Dragon Highmaster {@creature Kansaldi Fire-Eyes|DSotDQ}, tasking her with spearheading a daring attack on Solamnia. Meanwhile, Verminaard's force follows whispers from the Dragon Queen into the southern lands of Abanasinia.": "红龙军--塔克西丝的第一支、最大、最强大的部队--由狂热的龙族大领维米纳德（Verminaard）指挥，但他把许多部队的控制权暂时交给了他的信徒，龙族大领（%0%），让她带头对索兰尼亚进行大胆的攻击。同时，弗米纳德的部队听从龙后的耳语，进入阿巴纳西尼亚的南部土地。",
	"The ambitious Highlord Kitiara Uth Matar commands the Blue Dragon Army. Second in power among the Dragon Queen's forces, the Blue Dragon Army prepares to join the Red Dragon Army's multipronged invasion of Solamnia. The Green Dragon Army recently came under the command of Salah-Khan, a Khur leader who united the region's nomads under Dragon Army rule. The half-ogre Lucien of Takar commands the Black Dragon Army, whose focused force supports the other armies and occupies the lands they conquer, including Nordmaar and Goodlund. Finally, the small White Dragon Army is led by Highlord Feal-Thas, a Silvanesti elf and black-robed member of the Mages of High Sorcery.": "雄心勃勃的大领主基蒂亚拉-乌斯-马塔尔指挥着蓝龙军。在龙后的部队中，蓝龙军的实力排名第二，准备加入红龙军对索兰尼亚的多路入侵。绿龙军最近在萨拉赫-汗的指挥下，他是库尔人的领袖，将该地区的游牧民族团结在龙军统治之下。塔卡的半戈尔人卢西恩指挥着黑龙军，其重点部队支持其他军队并占领他们所征服的土地，包括诺德玛尔和古德隆。最后，小规模的白龙军由高阶领主费尔-塔斯（Feal-Thas）领导，他是希尔瓦内斯的精灵和高阶巫术法师的黑袍成员。",

Rather than fight a protracted campaign, Ariakas allowed the cunning Khur leader Salah-Khan to defeat the Green Dragon Army's original highlord in battle, then offered to make Salah-Khan highlord in his place. In exchange for control over Khur and the surrounding lands, Salah-Khan accepted and pledged his people to Takhisis, adding to the Dragon Armies' ranks.

	"Kalaman began as a sleepy fishing village on the coast of the Turbidus Ocean. It might have remained so if not for the arrival of an Istarian trading mission centuries before the Cataclysm. Seeing the potential of a deep harbor so close to the mouth of a great river, the Empire of Istar invested heavily in the town, transforming it into a thriving trade hub. Solamnia soon found Istar's stranglehold on the booming port intolerable, and after a climactic battle on the plains west of the city, Istar ceded control of Kalaman.": "卡拉曼起初是浊海沿岸的一个沉睡的渔村。如果不是因为大灾变前几个世纪一个伊斯塔利亚贸易代表团的到来，它可能一直如此。Istar帝国看到了靠近大河入海口的深水港的潜力，对该镇进行了大量投资，将其改造成一个繁荣的贸易中心。索兰尼亚很快发现伊斯塔对这个蓬勃发展的港口的扼制是无法容忍的，在城市西部的平原上进行了一场高潮迭起的战斗后，伊斯塔放弃了对卡拉曼的控制。",
	"Today, long after the fall of Istar and the trials of the Cataclysm, Kalaman remains a thriving port city surrounded by tall Istarian-built walls that have never been breached. In its busy harbor, vessels from all over Ansalon go about their business under the light of the city's two grand beacons, pre-Cataclysm marvels that have survived for generations. At the center of the city, the ancient Castle Kalaman rises intimidatingly on a sheer hill. The castle's architectural marvels include defenses yet to be recreated in the modern age. The city of Kalaman is further detailed in {@area Chapter 4|16f|x}.": "今天，在伊斯塔的陨落和大灾变的考验之后很久，卡拉曼仍然是一个繁荣的港口城市，周围是伊斯塔利亚人建造的高大城墙，从未被攻破。在繁忙的港口，来自安萨隆各地的船只在城市的两座宏伟灯塔的照耀下开展业务，这些灯塔是大灾变前的奇迹，已经保存了几代人。在城市的中心，古老的卡拉曼城堡令人生畏地耸立在一座陡峭的山上。城堡的建筑奇迹包括尚未在现代重现的防御措施。卡拉曼市的详细情况见{@area Chapter 4|16f|x}。",
	"The city of Kalaman is notably cosmopolitan, while most people in surrounding communities make their livelihood through fishing and farming. Many of the region's inhabitants are Solamnic humans, while others descend from the city's Istarian founders. Traders from all over Ansalon settle in Kalaman through preference or necessity. As a result, some humans hail or have ancestors from Abanasinia, Nordmaar, Ergoth, Estwilde, and farther-flung lands. Kender, hill dwarves, and gnomes are common in the region, while some elves, mountain dwarves, and other people also make their home in the city. Anyone is welcome in Kalaman if they come peaceably with goods to trade.": "卡拉曼市是值得注意的国际大都市，而周围社区的大多数人则以捕鱼和耕作为生。该地区的许多居民都是索兰尼克人，而其他人则是该城市的伊斯特里安创始人的后代。来自安萨隆各地的商人因喜好或需要而在卡拉曼定居。因此，一些人类来自阿巴纳西尼亚、诺德玛尔、埃尔戈特、埃斯特维德以及更远的地方，或者他们的祖先来自这些地方。坎德人、山地矮人和地精在该地区很常见，而一些精灵、山地矮人和其他民族也在该市安家。卡拉曼欢迎任何人，只要他们带着货物和平地前来交易。",
	"To the west of the Kalaman region lies Hinterlund. Even farther west lie the Plains of Solamnia, from where crops and crafted goods make their way to Kalaman for trade.

	"North of Kalaman, the grasslands characteristic of Solamnia give way to the broken steppes and labyrinthine canyons known as the Northern Wastes. Deadly beasts, treacherous cliffs, and unpredictable flooding make the wastes a dangerous land where it's said nothing survives for long.": "在卡拉曼以北，索兰尼亚特有的草原让位于被称为北方荒原的破碎大草原和迷宫般的峡谷。致命的野兽、险恶的悬崖和不可预知的洪水使荒原成为一片危险的土地，据说在这里没有什么东西可以长期生存。",
	"East of Kalaman, the lands of Estwilde hold inhospitable terrain and peoples who have been unfriendly to Solamnia since the days of Istar. Across the bay in northern Estwilde lie the swamps of Qwalmish. To the south and east of Kalaman are the rolling steppes of Qlettaar, which in turn give way to the forbidding peaks of the Taman Busuk region beyond Estwilde.": "在卡拉曼的东部，埃斯特维尔德的土地拥有荒凉的地形和自伊斯塔时代就对索兰尼亚不友好的人民。在埃斯特维尔德北部的海湾对面，是奎尔米什的沼泽地。在卡拉曼的南部和东部，是Qlettaar连绵不断的大草原，而这些大草原又让位于埃斯特威尔德以外的塔曼-布苏克地区的险峻山峰。",
	"For generations, the Soths of Dargaard Keep—a family of Knights of Solamnia—ruled the Solamnic province once known as Knightlund. Before the Cataclysm, the gods of good forewarned Knightlund's leader, Lord Loren Soth, about the coming destruction and offered him a chance to stop it, but he failed to accomplish this task. Since then, the province has had a cursed reputation. People have come to know the land as Nightlund and ascribe the region's frequent storms to the old gods' disfavor.": "几代人以来，达尔加德堡的索斯家族--一个索兰尼亚的骑士家族--统治着曾经被称为奈特伦德的索兰尼亚省。在大灾变之前，善神向奈特伦德的领袖洛伦-索斯大人发出了即将到来的毁灭的警告，并给了他一个阻止毁灭的机会，但他没能完成这个任务。从那时起，该省就有了一个被诅咒的声誉。人们将这片土地称为Nightlund，并将该地区频繁发生的风暴归咎于旧神的不喜欢。",

	"The gods of Krynn are said to have abandoned the world, and in the great cities of Ansalon, temples and centers of faith are few. Nevertheless, small miracles occur across the world. Druids and hidden communities offer prayers in the old ways and employ mysterious magic. Long-lived peoples remember the worship of the gods and see their shapes in nature and the constellations above. Ancient, forgotten sanctuaries hold wonders beyond imagination, and divine whispers reach those with the minds and hearts to listen. The gods haven't wholly abandoned Krynn, and as threats grow, mortals turn to them once more—sometimes after a remarkable encounter with a messenger of the gods.": "据说克莱恩的众神已经抛弃了这个世界，在安萨隆的大城市中，寺庙和信仰中心很少。尽管如此，小的奇迹还是在世界各地发生。德鲁伊和隐藏的社区以古老的方式提供祈祷，并运用神秘的魔法。长寿的人们记得对神的崇拜，并在自然界和上方的星座中看到他们的形状。古老的、被遗忘的圣地拥有超乎想象的奇迹，神圣的低语传到那些有思想和心灵的人那里。诸神并没有完全抛弃克莱恩，随着威胁的增加，凡人再次转向他们--有时是在与诸神的信使有了非凡的接触之后。",
	"The gods of Krynn loosely align with one another along the principles of good, neutrality, and evil.

Betrayed and hungry, these surface dwarves allied with other desperate refugees and unsuccessfully attempted to take Thorbardin by force. The conflict that came to be called the Dwarfgate War caused deep enmity between the dwarven communities of the surface and those that live below.": "索尔巴丹的矮人以古老的部族划分。在大灾变之前的许多世代，居住在地表的矮人建立了尼达尔部族，以耕种土地和与其他地表居民进行贸易而闻名。在大灾变之后，由于食物匮乏和未来的不确定性，索尔巴丹的大王封住了王国的大门，禁止所有外来者进入，包括尼达尔人。在被背叛和饥饿的情况下，这些地表矮人与其他绝望的难民结盟，试图用武力夺取索尔巴丹，但未获成功。这场被称为 \"矮人之门战争 \"的冲突在地表的矮人社区和地下的矮人社区之间引起了深深的敌意。",

However, some dwarves grow tired of life within their ancient tunnels and wonder about rejoining the world above.": "在贵族海拉尔部族的领导下，山地矮人是索尔巴丹毋庸置疑的统治者。许多伟大的战士、工程师和工匠都以这些宏伟的大厅为家。骄傲而矜持，大多数索尔巴丹部族都不想与外人--不管是矮人还是其他人--发生任何关系。然而，一些矮人厌倦了在古老的隧道里的生活，想重新加入上面的世界。",
	"As a mountain dwarf, you might come from a dwarven nation like Kayolin or Thorbardin.

	"The dwarves barred from Thorbardin experienced the years following the Cataclysm on the surface. Now known as hill dwarves, they lived among the lands and peoples of the surface for centuries.

	"Over two thousand years ago, the Kinslayer War divided the high elves of Ansalon into two groups, Silvanesti in the east and Qualinesti in the west. Through the intervening millennia, neither group has sought reconciliation.

	"As the elves of Ansalon largely keep to themselves, half-elves are few and are rarely seen outside the elven nations.": "由于安萨隆的精灵们大多独来独往，半身人很少，在精灵国家之外也很少见到。",
	"Silvanesti, the original elven kingdom, lies in southern Ansalon. For untold generations, the aloof Silvanesti elves lived in a stratified society closed to outsiders. They don't hate their cousins in Qualinesti, but they consider their ways misguided.": "希尔瓦娜斯提，最初的精灵王国，位于安萨隆南部。无数代以来，冷漠的希尔瓦娜斯蒂精灵生活在一个对外人封闭的分层社会中。他们并不恨他们在奎林斯提的表亲，但他们认为他们的方式是错误的。",
	"In recent years, war has come to Silvanesti. When the Dragon Armies besieged the realm, the leader Lorac Caladon, Speaker of the Stars, ordered his people to evacuate. Lorac then attempted to defend the kingdom with an {@item orb of dragonkind}—but the artifact's magic unexpectedly warped Silvanesti into a nightmarish land. The surviving elves of Silvanesti now find themselves a people without a homeland. Most journeyed together across the sea to Southern Ergoth, seeking refuge with the Kagonesti, while others refused to give up Silvanesti and sought to reclaim their ancestral home.": "近年来，战争来到了希尔瓦内斯。当龙族军队围攻这个王国时，领袖Lorac Caladon，星星的发言人，命令他的人民撤离。然后，洛拉克试图用一个{@item orb of dragonkind}来保卫王国--但这个神器的魔法意外地将希尔瓦内斯蒂扭曲成一个噩梦般的土地。希尔瓦娜斯提幸存的精灵们现在发现自己是一个没有祖国的民族。大多数人一起渡海到南尔戈斯，向卡贡斯蒂人寻求庇护，而其他人则拒绝放弃希尔瓦娜斯蒂，并试图夺回他们的祖先家园。",
	"As a Silvanesti high elf, you know what few in Ansalon do: the home of the elves has fallen. During the Dragon Armies' invasion of Silvanesti, you might have been separated from your people or even taken captive before escaping the Dragon Armies in unfamiliar lands.

Or perhaps you've spent your life exploring the world, cultivating relationships with people other than your kin.": "作为一个希尔瓦娜斯提的高等精灵，你知道安萨隆中很少有人知道的事情：精灵的家园已经沦陷。在龙族军队入侵希尔瓦娜斯提的过程中，你可能与你的人民分离，甚至被俘虏，然后在陌生的土地上逃离龙族军队。你可能已经和你的人民一起逃离了希尔瓦娜斯提，但现在寻求恢复你的家园的方法。或者你一生都在探索世界，与你的亲属以外的人培养关系。",
	"Long ago, a group of high elves left Silvanesti, desiring a more egalitarian society. They traveled far to the west and founded a new forested homeland called Qualinesti. Less hierarchical than their progenitors and more willing to deal with outsiders, Qualinesti elves even enjoyed good relations with the dwarves of Thorbardin. Since the Cataclysm, however, they've withdrawn from the world, and few outsiders dare approach their well-guarded borders.": "很久以前，一群高等精灵离开了希尔瓦内斯蒂，渴望一个更加平等的社会。他们远赴西方，建立了一个新的森林家园，叫做奎林斯蒂。与他们的祖先相比，奎林斯蒂的等级制度较少，而且更愿意与外来者打交道，奎林斯蒂的精灵们甚至与索尔巴丹的矮人保持着良好的关系。然而，自从大灾变以来，他们已经从这个世界上撤走了，很少有外人敢接近他们守卫森严的边界。",
	"As a Qualinesti high elf, you might have been raised in seclusion in the forests of Qualinesti.

	"Kagonesti are the descendants of elves who never settled in the forest cities of Silvanesti, instead living a nomadic way of life and seeking harmony with nature. Most of these wood elves live in small tribes in the forests of Southern Ergoth.

	"Two groups of sea elves inhabit the oceans surrounding Ansalon. Dargonesti, also known as deep elves, call the vast oceans home. Their cousins, Dimernesti, are often called shoal elves.

	"Before the Cataclysm, Solamnia was a beacon of peace and prosperity.

Originally put forth by Vinas Solamnus as an organizational scheme and code of conduct for the knightly orders, the Measure grew over the years to encompass thirty-seven volumes, covering everything from courtly etiquette to the proper saddling of mounts. According to the Measure, the knights no longer have sufficient numbers to elect a new Grand Master, the highest office in the knighthood, leaving them without an authority who could overrule or update the Measure.": "与《誓言》相比，《措施》是一部复杂得令人吃惊、具体得令人痛苦的骑士生活指南。措施》最初是由维纳斯-索拉姆努斯提出的，作为骑士团的组织方案和行为准则，经过多年的发展，已经包括了37卷，涵盖了从宫廷礼仪到坐骑的正确配备的所有内容。根据该措施，骑士们不再有足够的人数来选举新的大团长，即骑士团的最高职位，使他们没有一个可以推翻或更新该措施的权威。",

	"Many magic-users on Krynn are members of an ancient organization known as the Mages of High Sorcery. Predominantly composed of wizards—with a lesser number of sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters—members are divided into three orders.

	"Often reviled and feared in equal measure, the Black Robes follow the example of the evil god Nuitari, the black moon of Krynn. A mage of the Black Robes is expected to first further their own ambitions, then pursue the goals of their order, and then support the continued well-being of the Conclave.": "黑袍人常常受到同样程度的谩骂和恐惧，他们以克莱恩的黑月--邪神努塔里为榜样。黑袍法师首先要实现自己的野心，然后追求自己的目标，最后支持协约国的持续福祉。",
	"Thousands of years ago, the Mages of High Sorcery cooperated to build five Towers of High Sorcery, centers of learning to advance the craft of magic and the interests of the orders.

Some order members hunt renegades, seeking to punish or slay those who've defied the Mages of High Sorcery.": "如果一个施法者离开或被赶出高阶巫术法师组织，或者他们没有通过高阶巫术测试而存活下来，该组织的领导者就会禁止他们继续练习魔法。蔑视协约组织而练习魔法的法师被视为叛徒。长袍骑士团的成员有义务举报和反对这些叛徒。有些教团成员会追捕叛徒，试图惩罚或杀死那些蔑视高阶巫术法师的人。",

	"More details on Kansaldi appear in {@adventure appendix B|DSotDQ|9}.": "关于Kansaldi的更多细节出现在（%0%）。",
	"As the Dragon Queen turns her ambitions toward Solamnia, she summons forth one of its foulest villains: the infamous death knight {@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ}. This villain has allied himself with the Dragon Queen to retake his ancestral land of Nightlund and take vengeance against the hated Knights of Solamnia. However, he isn't a member of the Dragon Army or a commander of its troops. Soth and his Undead knights keep their own council and have their own agendas. The only person whose lead Soth follows is {@creature Kansaldi Fire-Eyes|DSotDQ}, and that is only because she speaks on behalf of the Dragon Queen herself.": "当龙后将她的野心转向索兰尼亚时，她召唤出了索兰尼亚最肮脏的恶棍之一：臭名昭著的死亡骑士（%0%）。这个恶棍与龙后结盟，要夺回他的祖地夜郎，并向可恨的索兰尼亚骑士们复仇。然而，他并不是龙军的成员，也不是龙军的指挥官。索斯和他的亡灵骑士们保持着自己的议会，有自己的议程。索斯唯一听从的人是{@creature Kansaldi Fire-Eyes|DSotDQ}，那只是因为她代表龙女王本人说话。",
	"While {@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ} is well known in tales of the Dragonlance setting, this adventure doesn't assume the characters, or most of Kalaman's people, know the death knight's legend or expect him to be at work in the world. The characters can learn relevant details about {@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ} throughout the adventure. Even as the characters reach their highest levels, {@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ} likely remains too great a threat for them to defeat. Rather than presenting him as a foe to be challenged in combat, portray Soth as a terrifying example of the villains in the Dragon Queen's service—a lurking threat to be avoided. By the adventure's end, the characters will have opportunities to undermine Soth's plans and remove him from the Dragon Army's service—at least for a time.": "虽然{@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ}在《龙之谷》的故事中是众所周知的，但这个冒险并不假设人物或大多数卡拉曼的人知道死亡骑士的传说，也不指望他在这个世界上工作。在整个冒险过程中，角色们可以了解到关于（%1%）的相关细节。即使人物达到了最高等级，{@creature Lord Soth|DSotDQ}可能仍然是他们无法战胜的巨大威胁。与其把他描述成一个需要在战斗中挑战的敌人，不如把索斯描述成龙女王手下的恶棍的一个可怕的例子--一个需要避免的潜伏威胁。在冒险结束时，角色们将有机会破坏索斯的计划，并将他从龙军的服务中移除--至少是在一段时间内。",

Before you can, the object glows and then flashes with intense light.": "你站在一片森林空地的中心。灌木丛中回荡着钢铁的碰撞声。当你环顾四周时，你发现地面上堆满了尸体。其中一个倒下的人紧紧抓住胸前的东西。你不确定那是什么，但你感到有一种冲动想去拿它。在你伸手之前，那东西发着光，然后闪烁着强烈的光。",

Fishers, lumberers, hunters, and farmers live here peacefully, only occasionally interrupted by bandits or predators from the Northern Wastes. In addition to a volunteer militia maintained by Mayor {@creature Raven Uth Vogler|DSotDQ}, the village is ostensibly under the protection of Hinterlund's capital, Maelgoth.

	"The characters' visit to Vogler overlaps with the kickoff of the Kingfisher Festival, an annual celebration commemorating Solamnia's victory over the forces of Istar during a clash near the town centuries ago.

Its proprietor, an Ergothian woman named Yalme (neutral good, human {@creature commoner}), has an odd love of bad storytellers and inept musicians. One wall of the circular common room features a faded mural of two enormous crabs locked in combat, inlaid with brass details. The mural's origins are lost to time, but if asked, Yalme says she named the crabs Fancy and Gorgeous George. Four short halls branch off the common room, each lined with rooms for rent.": "铜螃蟹是村里码头上的一家简陋的单层旅馆，其外观与它的名字依稀相似。它的老板，一个名叫雅尔梅（中性好，人类（%0%））的厄尔尼诺女人，对糟糕的说书人和无能的音乐家有一种奇怪的喜爱。圆形公共休息室的一面墙上有一幅褪色的壁画，画的是两只巨大的螃蟹在搏斗，上面镶嵌着铜质的细节。这幅壁画的起源已被时间淹没，但如果有人问起，雅尔梅说她给这两只螃蟹取名为 \"花式 \"和 \"华丽乔治\"。公共房间外有四个短的大厅，每个大厅里都有出租的房间。",
	"After a long day on the river, many of Vogler's fishers gather at the Fishbowl to tell tales, quench their thirst, and indulge in baked fish pies.

	"High Hill stands a mile north of Vogler. Centuries ago, Solamnic and Istarian forces clashed here, and legends claim the spirits of fallen knights haunt the hill and watch over the town.

Amid this collection of stalls, vendors sell fresh river fish, fishing supplies, crafts, the bounty of local farms, and all manner of mundane equipment.

Known as the Ironclad Regiment, the soldiers here are under the command of Captain Ridomir \"Cudgel\" Ironsmile (introduced in the \"{@area Final Farewell|0ea|x}\" section). Cudgel is a friend of the deceased Ispin Greenshield and many others in town, and she brought her company to Vogler a week ago to attend Ispin's funeral.

	"During the day, Cudgel remains in the camp with her lieutenants—the half-ogre Gragonis and the human {@creature Jeyev Veldrews|DSotDQ}—along with several dozen mercenaries.

	"Those who enter Vogler from the north pass through the unguarded River Gate, a 15-foot-tall wooden archway carved with two leaping fish on its frame. Over the years, locals have etched the coin-sized scales of these fish with prayers for bountiful fishing. Two large wooden doors stand within the arch, but they haven't been closed for years and are embedded in the surrounding dirt.": "从北方进入沃格勒的人要经过无人看守的河门，这是一个15英尺高的木制拱门，门框上雕刻着两条跳跃的鱼。多年来，当地人在这些鱼的硬币大小的鳞片上刻下了对丰收的祈祷。拱门内有两扇大木门，但多年来一直没有关闭，而是嵌入周围的泥土中。",

Thornwall Keep's steward, the knight {@creature Becklin Uth Viharin|DSotDQ} (introduced in the \"{@area Final Farewell|0ea|x}\" section), maintains the keep. Partially ruined walls surround the keep's three-story tower. The tower's ground level holds a small library and a collection of local relics: over forty pieces of rusty tools and armor. The second floor holds the quarters of Becklin's squire, {@creature Darrett Highwater|DSotDQ} (introduced in the \"{@area Parting Gift|108|x}\" section later in this chapter).

	"Vogler's resident tinker gnome, Than, built an elaborate catapult-like contraption on the roof of the keep. A friend of Becklin and Darrett, Than occasionally drops by to fine-tune this device, called a gnomeflinger (detailed in {@adventure appendix A|DSotDQ|8}). Though it looks like a weapon of war, the contraption is a mode of rapid transportation originally devised by the tinker gnomes of Mount Nevermind. Becklin tolerates the gnomeflinger—and the noise of Than's occasional early-morning tinkering—because she sees the catapult-shaped device as a deterrent against attack.": "沃格勒的常驻工匠地精，Than，在堡垒的屋顶上建造了一个精心设计的类似弹弓的装置。作为贝克林和达雷特的朋友，丹恩偶尔会过来微调这个被称为地精的装置（详见（%0%））。虽然它看起来像战争武器，但这个装置最初是由内华达山的工匠地精设计的一种快速运输方式。贝克林容忍地精的存在，也容忍丹恩偶尔在清晨修补的噪音，因为她认为这个弹弓状的装置是对攻击的一种威慑。",

This green is encircled by a dirt road that branches off into streets leading north out of the village and south to the ferry across the Vingaard, and others radiating out into the town.

In times of need, anyone who vigorously rings the bell summons the mayor and {@dice 2d12} volunteer militia members ({@creature Guard||guards}) who arrive in about 5 minutes.

	"South of Vogler, an incomplete stone bridge begins to stretch across the Vingaard River. Half-constructed before the Cataclysm using techniques lost in the ages since, the bridge looks like a glorified pier—a remnant of once-promised glory. A simple ferry system of ropes and winches follows the bridge's supports and connects with posts on the opposite shore. Simple rafts and skiffs allow travelers and even small wagons to cross the river. The process is safe but slow, taking approximately 10 minutes for a raft to cross the broad river. Travelers can make use of the crossing themselves or hire a ferrier to aid them for 1 sp.": "在沃格勒的南部，一座不完整的石桥开始延伸到文加德河上。这座桥是在大灾变之前利用已经失传的技术建造的，看起来就像一个荣耀的码头--曾经承诺的荣耀的遗迹。一个由绳索和绞盘组成的简单渡轮系统沿着桥的支架，与对岸的柱子相连。简单的木筏和小艇让旅行者甚至是小马车都能过河。这个过程是安全的，但也是缓慢的，一个木筏需要大约10分钟才能穿过宽阔的河流。旅行者可以自己利用这个渡口，也可以雇佣一个渡工来帮助他们，费用为1比索。",
	"The horseshoe-shaped structure known as Westide House is only slightly larger than the other homes in Vogler, but its owner speaks of it as if it were an opulent country manor.

	"Local fishers crowd these docks each dawn and dusk, rowing out with empty nets and returning with the day's catch. At the end of the southernmost pier, a centuries-old wooden post bears an eroded carving of a bird with a fish in its mouth. Many locals rub it for luck before seeking the morning catch.

	"Unbeknownst to anyone in the village, Cudgel's lieutenant in the Ironclad Regiment—Gragonis (neutral evil {@creature Half-Ogre (Ogrillon)||half-ogre}) has betrayed his leader.

	"Passing through woods and fields, Vogler's parade of militia members and reenactment spectators finally reaches High Hill. The grassy slope is spotted with trees and crumbled stone fencing. Near the base, several dozen soldiers in matching armor stand in even formation.

The two groups will clash midway in a mock fight, with the mercenaries' Istarian forces eventually retreating.

	"After much laughter and jostling, the mayor, Cudgel, and other spectators walk to a nearby vantage to watch. As they do, the militia takes up its position atop High Hill—the same hill Solamnic troops held centuries ago. They face the mercenaries of the Ironclad Regiment at the base of the hill, arrayed as the forces of Istar once were. Although the event is only a reenactment, a tingle of excitement fills the field. Somewhere on the line, a reenactor hoots and yells, \"Let's send those Istarian rats running!\"": "在许多笑声和打闹声中，市长、卡德格尔和其他观众走到附近的有利位置观看。当他们这样做的时候，民兵们在高山顶上站好了位置--几个世纪前，索拉姆尼克的军队也曾占据过这座山。他们在山脚下面对铁甲军团的雇佣兵，他们的阵容与伊斯塔的部队曾经的阵容一样。虽然这只是一场重演，但场内却充满了兴奋的感觉。在队伍的某处，一个重演者吼叫着说：\"让我们让那些伊斯塔利亚的老鼠跑起来！\"",

The character who rolls the highest notices the sun glinting off the mercenaries' spear tips and their half-ogre leader gesturing with a steel axe. Regardless of how the characters react to this, it's too late to stop the attack. The mounted mercenaries lead their forces in a charge up the hill. When they clash with the militia members, an actual battle begins.": "当这两队人马冲锋时，让每个角色做一个智慧（（%0%））检查。掷出最高分的角色注意到太阳在佣兵的矛尖上闪闪发光，他们的半兽人首领用钢斧做着手势。不管角色们对此有何反应，要阻止攻击已经太晚了。骑兵们带领他们的部队向山上冲去。当他们与民兵们发生冲突时，一场真正的战斗开始了。",
	"The unexpected sound of metal clashing on armor rings across the field, silencing laughter and melodramatic boasts. A ribbon of red splashes over the grassy hill, followed by shocked screams.
