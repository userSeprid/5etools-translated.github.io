	"This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item in the adventure. In the course of reading this overview and playing this adventure, you'll learn the basics of how to run a D&D game.": "本书是为地下城管理员编写的。它包含了一个完整的龙与地下城冒险，以及冒险中每个生物和魔法物品的描述。在阅读这个概述和玩这个冒险的过程中，你会学到如何运行一个D&D游戏的基本知识。",
	"This is not a typical D&D adventure, though. As it's set in the world of {@i Rick and Morty}, much of the adventure beyond this introduction and the book's appendices are written by Rick Sanchez. While Rick's encounters are wildly unpredictable (and sometimes include his outlandish viewpoints), this adventure generally works as any other D&D adventure world. There's just more in-character narration from the author and a lot more butt jokes. The experience here is meant to feel slapstick and wild, so try not to take things too seriously. Additionally, if you feel the need to paraphrase any of Rick's descriptions (or cut back on his personal editorializing) feel free—you have a better sense of what your players will enjoy than Rick does!": "不过，这并不是一个典型的D&D冒险。由于它设定在{@i Rick and Morty}的世界里，除了这段介绍和书中的附录之外，大部分的冒险都是由瑞克-桑切斯写的。虽然瑞克的遭遇是疯狂的不可预测的（有时还包括他离奇的观点），但这个冒险一般来说和其他的D&D冒险世界一样有效。只是有更多来自作者的角色叙述和更多的笑料。这里的体验是为了让人感到滑稽和狂野，所以尽量不要把事情看得太严重。此外，如果你觉得有必要转述瑞克的任何描述（或减少他的个人编辑），请随意，你比瑞克更清楚你的玩家会喜欢什么。",
	"The rulebook in this boxed set contains everything you need to adjudicate the situations that arise during play. As this adventure is more frantic than most, don't worry about messing up. This adventure is all about seat-of-your-pants action, so if there's a rules slip-up, just roll with it. And, if at any point you're uncertain of how to proceed, refer to the \"Dungeon Master Tips\" section.": "这套盒装的规则书包含了你在游戏中出现的情况所需的一切裁决。由于这次冒险比大多数的冒险都要疯狂，所以不用担心会出乱子。这个冒险是所有关于你的裤子的行动，所以如果有一个规则的失误，只是滚动与它。而且，如果在任何时候你不确定该如何进行，请参考 \"地下城主提示 \"部分。",
	"{@i The Lost Dungeon of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy} is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 3rd level.

	"While the rulebook provides you with everything you need to create your own characters, this adventure assumes players are using the {@i Rick and Morty} {@adventure pregenerated characters|rmbre|0|Pregenerated Characters} provided in this boxed set. If they're not, that's fine, but players might want to consider why their characters find themselves on an adventure in the unpredictable world of {@i Rick and Morty}—or not, and just be prepared for whatever weirdness comes their way!": "虽然规则手册为你提供了创建自己的角色所需的一切，但这次冒险假定玩家使用的是本盒装中提供的{@i Rick and Morty} {@adventure pregenerated characters|rmbre|0|Pregenerated Characters}。如果他们不使用，那也没关系，但玩家可能要考虑为什么他们的角色会在不可预测的{@i Rick and Morty}世界中发现自己的冒险--或者不使用，只要准备好迎接任何奇怪的事情就好了",

	"The DM is a {@b narrator}. The DM sets the pace of the story and presents the various challenges and encounters the players must overcome.

	"The DM {@b plays monsters}. The DM plays the monsters and villains the adventurers battle against, choosing their actions and rolling dice for their attacks. The DM also plays the part of all the other characters the players meet in the course of their adventures, like the prisoner in the goblin lair or the innkeeper in town.": "管理员（%0%）。管理员扮演冒险者对抗的怪物和恶棍，选择他们的行动并为他们的攻击掷骰子。DM还扮演玩家在冒险过程中遇到的所有其他角色，如地精巢穴中的囚犯或城镇中的旅馆老板。",
	"Although the DM controls the monsters and villains in the adventure, the relationship between the players and the DM isn't adversarial.

	"The most important thing to remember about being a good DM is that the rules are a tool to help you have a good time. The rules aren't in charge. You're the DM—you're in charge of the game. Guide the play experience and the use of the rules so that everybody has fun.": "要成为一个好的管理人，最重要的是要记住，规则是一个工具，帮助你有一个好的时间。规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏。引导游戏体验和规则的使用，使每个人都有乐趣。",

	"Who should be the Dungeon Master for your group? Whoever wants to be! The person with the most drive to pull a group together and start a game often ends up being the DM, but that doesn't have to be the case.": "谁应该是你的小组的地下城主？谁想做就做。最有动力把小组召集在一起并开始游戏的人往往最终会成为管理员，但这不一定是事实。",
	"As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes during the game. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.": "作为地下城管理员，当涉及到游戏中的规则问题或争议时，你是最终的权威。这里有一些准则，可以帮助你在出现问题时进行仲裁。",

	"{@b It's a shared story.} It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters.

	"{@b Be fair}. Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.": "{@b Be fair}. 使用你作为地下城管理员的权力只为了做好事。以公平和公正的方式对待规则和玩家。",

If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.": "{@b Pay attention}. 确保你偶尔环顾一下桌子，看看游戏是否进展顺利。如果每个人看起来都很开心，就放松并继续下去。如果乐趣减退，可能是休息的时候了，或者你可以试着让事情变得生动起来。",
	"The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful.

Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.": "冒险通常会告诉你角色在某种情况下可能会尝试哪些能力检查，以及这些检查的难度等级（DC）。有时冒险者会尝试一些冒险中不可能预料到的事情。由你来决定他们的尝试是否成功。如果看起来任何人都应该很容易做到，就不要要求进行能力检查；只要告诉玩家会发生什么。同样地，如果任何人都不可能完成这个任务，就告诉玩家这是不可能的。",

	"Use the {@book descriptions of the ability scores|rmr|0|Six Abilities} and {@book their associated skills|rmr|0|skills} in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:": "使用规则手册中的（%0%）和（%1%）来帮助你决定使用什么样的能力检查。然后确定任务的难度，这样你就可以设定检查的DC。DC越高，任务就越难。设定DC的最简单方法是决定任务的难度是简单、中等还是困难，然后使用这三个DC。",

A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.": "{@b Moderate (DC 15}). 一个中等的任务需要一个稍高的能力水平来完成。一个具有天赋能力和专门训练的人物，在更多情况下可以完成一个中等程度的任务。",

Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.": "{@b Hard (DC 20}). 艰巨的任务包括任何超出大多数人能力的努力，如果没有援助或特殊的能力。即使有能力和训练，一个角色也需要一定的运气或大量的专门训练来完成一项艰难的任务。",

	"The inside of the folding screen included in this set has information that can help you while running the adventure.

	"Map 1.1 shows the entire dungeon. This map is for your eyes only, providing insight into the dungeon's secrets and how encounters fit together. You probably don't want to share this map with the players, as it can spoil upcoming encounters. When characters arrive at a location marked on the map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate.

Focus on getting the shape and dimensions correct, and leave the rest to the players' imaginations.": "地图1.1显示了整个地牢的情况。这张地图仅供你观看，它提供了对地牢秘密的洞察力，以及遭遇战是如何组合的。你可能不想与玩家分享这张地图，因为它可能会破坏即将发生的遭遇。当角色到达地图上标记的地点时，你可以依靠口头描述来让他们对这个地点有一个清晰的印象，或者你可以把他们看到的东西画在一张图画纸上，复制地图上的内容，同时适当地省略一些细节。你的手绘地图是否与印刷的冒险中的内容完全一致并不重要。把重点放在形状和尺寸的正确性上，其余的留给玩家的想象力。",
	"The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. Many of those are Rick's words, and you're on your own to figure them out. The most important D&D related ones, though, are described here.

	"Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so the DM can run it effectively.

	"It goes without saying, but this is a great dungeon. How did the characters get here? Who cares?! They're here now, and that's enough to deal with without dwelling on the past.

That's up to you, although I say no rest for the Ricked.": "不言而喻，这是个伟大的地牢。人物是如何来到这里的？谁在乎呢？他们现在在这里，这就足够了，不必纠结于过去。也许这都是一个噩梦，或者是吃了恶心的虾而产生的一些幻觉。有安全的地方可以休息吗？这取决于你，虽然我说瑞克德人没有休息。",
	"What about the treasure the characters find here, can they sell it anywhere? Are there things they spend their gold on? To that I say: Isn't the acquisition of treasure the best part?

	"By the time they finish this dungeon, the characters should be 3rd level.

	"First of all, if the characters die in the dungeon, great. Working as intended. Second, if the characters die, the players also die in real life. Third, that was a joke—dead players are no fun for anybody. How are you supposed to lord your powers over corpses? Anyway, you can get creative about bringing back dead characters. One pro move is to take the dead character's sheet, cross out the old name, and write a new name with, like, one letter different from before. That's the player's new character, who suddenly steps in from the previous room! Carry on.": "首先，如果人物死在地牢里，很好。按计划进行。第二，如果角色死了，玩家在现实生活中也会死。第三，那是个笑话--死掉的玩家对任何人来说都不好玩。你怎么能把你的权力支配在尸体上呢？无论如何，你可以创造性地让死去的角色复活。有一个很好的办法是，把死去的角色的名单划掉，然后写一个新的名字，比如说，和以前不同的一个字母。这就是玩家的新角色，他突然从以前的房间里走了进来 继续下去。",

The coin also smells like pirate, yet, somehow, that doesn't decrease the value.": "舰长抛出的黑色东西看起来像是一个叫做（%0%）的袖珍超维空间！它是什么？不过，它不是。它只是一个松软的织物补丁，上面涂有一些新式的超黑油漆--而且有一股海盗的味道。但里面装的是1个pp。硬币也有海盗的味道，但是，不知为什么，这并没有降低它的价值。",

The experience is actually quite pleasant.": "为了安抚她，整个队伍必须安抚她悲痛的母性本能。如何做到这一点由他们自己决定，但最简单的方法是把自己伪装成猫头鹰小熊（使用羽毛和毛发团，在巢穴中很容易找到），与新妈妈亲密接触。这让猫头鹰熊很高兴，它立即把它们引入巢中，用它那锋利的喙为它们彻底梳理。这种经历实际上是相当愉快的。",
	"Once this is complete, the owlbear falls asleep contentedly in her nest.
