Tristan asks the characters to get rid of this menace.": "角色们被崔斯坦爵士召唤，他是位于一片孤独的山脉中的小领地的统治者。一头可怕的怪物，叫作thessalhydra，一直在攻击他的领地。它是一种奇怪而可怕的生物，有八个头，围绕着一张大圆嘴，边缘有锯齿。它的嘴里滴着酸液，它的尾巴末端是一对锋利的钳子。崔斯坦要求这些人物摆脱这种威胁。",

	"They find tracks made by the thessalhydra, but also tracks made by other monsters. But the tracks are impossible to follow. The tracks come and go. Sometimes they loop back on themselves. None of it makes any sense.": "他们发现了海蛇的足迹，但也发现了其他怪物的足迹。但这些足迹是无法追踪的。这些足迹来来去去。有时，它们会在自己身上循环往复。这一切都没有任何意义。",
	"When it's time to move the story forward, introduce the Proud Princess.": "当需要推进故事的时候，介绍骄傲的公主。",
	"With a blast of lightning and thunder, the Proud Princess appears on a hill near the characters. She is strong and proud, a warrior princess, who looks at the characters and instantly knows that they pose no danger to her. (No stats for her. She's not someone they should fight. If they insist on trying, they can hit her only with a critical hit, and even then she shrugs off whatever damage they do. Her attacks always hit them and deal {@dice 2d6 + 6} slashing damage.)": "随着一阵闪电和雷鸣，骄傲的公主出现在人物附近的一座山上。她强壮而骄傲，是一位战士公主，她看着这些人物，立刻知道他们对她不构成任何危险。 (对她没有统计数字。她不是他们应该战斗的人。如果他们坚持要打，他们只能用关键的一击来打她，即使如此，她也会甩掉他们的任何伤害。她的攻击总是击中他们并造成{@dice 2d6 + 6}的砍伤。）",
	"The Proud Princess has a quest of her own, though she will not talk about the details. She warns the characters to stay out of her way, for their own safety. Simply to keep them away, she tells them how to find the thessalhydra.": "骄傲的公主有自己的追求，尽管她不会谈论细节。她警告这些人物，为了他们自己的安全，不要挡她的路。为了让他们远离她，她告诉他们如何找到水蛇。",
	"The thessalhydra uses the Upside Down as a way to return to its lair without being tracked. The lair is a cave where the Material Plane and the Upside Down touch. A special plant grows there—a plant whose flowers bloom in both worlds. These flowers can be used to cross between worlds if you perform a certain ritual. A key component of this ritual is blood from a monstrosity (a type of creature). The thessalhydra is a monstrosity, so it can use its own blood to open a gateway.": "蛇头人利用颠倒空间作为返回其巢穴而不被追踪的方法。巢穴是一个山洞，物质世界和颠倒世界在这里接触。那里生长着一种特殊的植物--一种在两个世界都能开花的植物。如果你完成一个特定的仪式，这些花就可以用来穿越世界。这个仪式的一个关键组成部分是来自怪兽（一种生物）的血液。水螅是一种怪兽，所以它可以用自己的血来打开一个通道。",
	"The Proud Princess can point them to the cavern where the flowers grow, but if the characters want to open a gateway, they'll also need the blood of a monstrosity. Luckily, she knows of one that has been stalking around the Upside Down lately: a {@creature demogorgon|HftT}!": "骄傲的公主可以给他们指出生长花朵的洞穴，但如果角色们想打开一个通道，他们还需要一个怪兽的血。幸运的是，她知道有一个最近一直在颠倒世界中徘徊的怪物：一个（%0%）!",
	"She tells them that the demogorgon is attracted to the smell of blood. The easiest way to get its attention is to spill blood on the ground. But since there are so few creatures in the Upside Down, the only source is the characters themselves. Using a weapon carefully, a character can do minor damage (cutting their palm) causing 1 hp of damage and spilling a small amount of blood. If the group spills a total of 3 hp worth of blood, the demogorgon will arrive {@dice 1d6} minutes later, leaping from the darkness and attacking the group.": "她告诉他们，食人魔被血腥味所吸引。引起它注意的最简单方法是把血洒在地上。但由于天翻地覆中的生物太少，唯一的来源就是人物本身。仔细使用武器，一个角色可以造成轻微的伤害（切开他们的手掌），造成1hp的伤害并洒出少量的血。如果这群人总共溢出了价值3hp的血，那么魔形怪会在几分钟后到达（%0%），从黑暗中跃出，攻击这群人。",
	"If the characters don't want to spill their own blood, they can stalk the demogorgon, but this is very difficult. One character should try a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check for the group. If this is successful, they have found the demogorgon. If it fails, the group may try again (with the same character or a different one making the check). If the group fails three times, the demogorgon has found them and attacks, but the characters are surprised (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works).": "如果角色们不想洒自己的血，他们可以跟踪魔形怪，但这是非常困难的。一个角色应该为这群人做一个DC15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。如果成功的话，他们就找到了魔形怪。如果失败了，小组可以再试一次（由同一个角色或不同的角色进行检查）。如果他们三次都失败了，那么魔形怪就发现了他们并发动了攻击，但这些角色会感到惊讶（关于惊讶的作用，请参见规则手册的第二章）。",
	"A demogorgon is a monstrosity the size and shape of an adult human, but its mouth fills its face and opens like a blooming flower. One currently lives in the Upside Down, and no one knows where it came from originally. It's incredibly strong and can heal itself from damage it takes (even here in the Upside Down). Like a shark, a demogorgon is drawn to the scent of blood, and goes into a frenzy when blood is near.": "妖怪是一种怪物，其大小和形状与成年人类一样，但它的嘴巴充满了脸部，像一朵盛开的花一样张开。目前有一个住在颠倒区，没有人知道它最初来自哪里。它非常强壮，可以自我治愈它所受到的伤害（即使是在颠倒世界中）。像鲨鱼一样，迪摩根被血的气味所吸引，当血靠近时就会陷入狂热。",
	"The Proud Princess says that they need a few ounces of blood from the creature to open a gateway (filling an empty potion vial will do nicely, but let the characters solve the problem). If the {@creature demogorgon|HftT} is killed, they can get the blood easily. But let them try other ways if they don't want to fight to the death. For example, they can get blood off a sword blade immediately after it strikes and damages the creature (they must do this four times to get enough blood).": "骄傲的公主说，他们需要生物的几盎司血来打开一个通道（装一个空的药水瓶就可以了，但让人物来解决这个问题）。如果（%0%）被杀了，他们可以很容易地得到血。但如果他们不想拼命，就让他们尝试其他方法。例如，他们可以在剑刃击中并伤害生物后立即从剑刃上取血（他们必须这样做四次才能得到足够的血）。",
	"After the characters have gotten enough demogorgon blood, they can take it to the cavern with the flowers. If they pour the blood on one of the flowers, it bursts open violently (anyone standing next to the flower must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity save or be knocked {@condition prone}), creating a cross-planar gate. Stepping through leads to area 1 of the lair of the thessalhydra.": "当人物得到足够的恶魔之血后，他们可以把它带到有花的洞穴里。如果他们把血倒在其中一朵花上，它就会猛地爆开（站在花旁的人必须在DC12的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会被击倒（%0%）），形成一个跨平面的门。踏过这道门，就可以到达萨海德拉巢穴的第1区。",
	"When the characters step out of an oversized flower (like the one they stepped into in the Upside Down), they are back in the Material Plane—home. In fact, they are pretty close to Sir Tristan's castle (they can see the towers above the tree line). Prints in the dirt make it clear that the thessalhydra has come this way often, and the tracks lead into a nearby cave.": "当人物走出一朵超大的花（就像他们在颠倒世界中踏入的那朵花），他们就回到了物质世界--家。事实上，他们离特里斯坦爵士的城堡很近（他们可以看到树线上的塔楼）。泥土上的印记清楚地表明，海蛇经常走这条路，而足迹则通向附近的一个山洞。",
	"Entrance to the cave. Some of the cross-planar flowers grow along the rocks here.": "洞口的入口处。一些十字花沿着这里的岩石生长。",
	"This cave is thick with webs from floor to ceiling. Three giant spiders live here. If the characters don't bother them, they won't bother the characters.": "这个山洞从地板到天花板都有厚厚的网。这里住着三只巨型蜘蛛。如果人物不打扰它们，它们也不会打扰人物。",
	"There's a 20-foot-wide pit. It takes a successful DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to jump across. Failing a jump without a safety rope tied to you means you fall away into darkness and take {@dice 3d10} bludgeoning damage. The pit is 30 feet deep.": "这里有一个20英尺宽的坑。需要成功地进行DC12力量（（%0%））检查才能跳过去。在没有安全绳绑住你的情况下跳跃失败，意味着你会掉进黑暗中，受到{@dice 3d10}的重击伤害。这个坑有30英尺深。",
	"Nearby is a hidden passage (marked as an \"S\" on the map). It takes a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice it. Once found, it can be used freely.": "附近有一个隐藏的通道（在地图上标为 \"S\"）。需要通过DC12智慧({@skill Perception})检查才能发现它。一旦发现，就可以自由使用。",
	"A tribe of ten {@creature Troglodyte||troglodytes} live here. When the thessalhydra moved in, the trogs began to worship it as a god. Now they protect it while it sleeps. If the characters have already killed the thessalhydra, the trogs begin to worship them as their new gods.": "一个由10人组成的部落（%0%）生活在这里。当海蛇迁入后，特鲁格人开始把它当作神来崇拜。现在他们在它睡觉的时候保护它。如果人物已经杀死了水螅，特鲁格人就开始把他们当作新的神来崇拜。",
	"At the back of this cave is an area that appears wet, like a mud patch or a shallow puddle, and occasionally ripples or bubbles. It's actually an {@creature ochre jelly}. If the characters don't bother it, it won't bother them.": "在这个洞穴的后面，有一个看起来很湿的地方，就像一块泥地或一个浅水坑，偶尔会出现涟漪或气泡。它实际上是一个（%0%）。如果人物不打扰它，它也不会打扰他们。",
	"This is where the troglodytes go to leave offerings in worship of the thessalhydra. The walls are covered with small niches, each of which contains an offering. (See \"Conclusion\" below.)": "这里是troglodytes去留下祭品以崇拜thessalhydra的地方。墙壁上布满了小壁龛，每个壁龛都有一个祭品。(见下文 \"结论\"）。",
	"This cavern is where the {@creature thessalhydra|HftT} lurks. It is here and sleeping. If the characters can sneak up on it, they can take the creature by surprise (see chapter 2 of the rulebook for how surprise works).": "这个洞穴是（%0%）潜伏的地方。它就在这里，并且在睡觉。如果角色们能悄悄地接近它，他们就能出其不意地对付这个生物（关于出其不意的作用，请参见规则手册的第二章）。",
	"If the characters kill the thessalhydra, they have successfully completed this adventure. When they chop off the creature's heads and bring them back to Sir Tristan, he will welcome them as conquering heroes, shower them with treasure, and grant each one a boon (as long as it is within his power to do so). Additionally, in area 6 of the thessalhydra's lair they will find coins, gems, and artwork worth 1,000 gold pieces, plus one magic item of your (the Dungeon Master's) choice.": "如果角色们杀死了西斯尔海德拉，他们就成功完成了这次冒险。当他们砍下怪物的头颅并将其带回给崔斯坦爵士时，他将以征服者的身份欢迎他们，用财宝沐浴他们，并给予每个人一个恩惠（只要他有能力这样做）。此外，在深海巨兽巢穴的第6区，他们将找到价值1000金币的硬币、宝石和艺术品，以及你（地下城管理员）选择的一件魔法物品。",
	"Perhaps the best reward of all is that the characters each gain a level. Use the information in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to make them 4th level. They will then be ready to seek more adventure and rewards in future games of Dungeons & Dragons!": "也许最好的奖励是，人物各自获得一个等级。使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的信息，使他们达到第四级。然后，他们将准备好在未来的龙与地下城游戏中寻求更多的冒险和奖励!",
