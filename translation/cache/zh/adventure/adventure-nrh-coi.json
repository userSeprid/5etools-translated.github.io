	"Ever jealous of the cheery dispositions and colorful deliciousness of the NERDS, Emo the beholder and his hired muscle, Mr. Greystone, have struck a blow against the NERDS' beloved city of Harmony. After years of searching, the nefarious duo have found the sacred Prismatic Well that gives Harmony its vibrant and fabulous colors. Now, with access to the Prismatic Well, Emo and Mr. Greystone have begun to leech the color from the city of Harmony. If they aren't stopped, the city will gradually turn gray, with everything eventually becoming black and white.": "Emo和他的雇佣兵Greystone先生一直嫉妒NERDS的快乐性格和多彩的美味，他们对NERDS所热爱的城市Harmony进行了打击。经过多年的搜寻，这对邪恶的二人组已经找到了神圣的棱镜井，它赋予了和谐城鲜艳而美妙的色彩。现在，有了进入棱镜井的机会，埃莫和格雷斯通先生开始从和谐城中吸取颜色。如果不阻止他们，这个城市将逐渐变成灰色，所有东西最终都会变成黑色和白色。",
	"To the NERDS, the colors beginning to flicker and drain out of Harmony is an unsettling mystery. What brings the colors to Harmony is an enigma to them. All they can do is hope the power comes back on and restores the vibrancy of Harmony's colors once more.": "对于NERDS来说，颜色开始闪烁并从Harmony中流失是一个令人不安的谜。是什么给和谐号带来了色彩，对他们来说是个谜。他们所能做的就是希望电力恢复，再次恢复和谐号的色彩活力。",
	"But one group knows what's up, and that group is the Lorekeeper Society—a secret society sworn to protect Harmony. The Lorekeepers know about the power of the Prismatic Well, but its true location is lost even to themselves. However, they have a way to find the well using an ancient artifact known as the Amulet of Harmony, but to activate it they need to find the six Gems of Power. Once activated, the amulet guides whoever controls it to the secret location of the Prismatic Well. But once activated, the amulet also has the power to turn off the well.": "但有一个团体知道这是怎么回事，这个团体就是传说守护者协会--一个发誓要保护和谐的秘密团体。守望者协会知道棱镜井的力量，但它的真实位置连他们自己都不知道。然而，他们有办法通过一个被称为 \"和谐护身符 \"的古老神器来找到这口井，但要激活它，他们需要找到六颗力量宝石。一旦激活，护身符会引导控制它的人到达棱镜井的秘密地点。但一旦激活，护身符也有能力关闭水井。",

No one in the Lorekeeper Society knows the details of the magical beasts and traps guarding the gems, but our heroic NERDS are more than up to the challenge of restoring Harmony!": "力量宝石很久以前就被藏在地牢、森林和塔楼里保管起来了。守望者协会中没有人知道守护宝石的魔兽和陷阱的细节，但我们英勇的NERDS足以应对恢复和谐的挑战!",
	"Due to the solo player nature of the adventures (with the exception of Adventure 7 Adventure Together), the power level of some monsters may be difficult with respect to the level of the character. You may want to present a roleplaying solution (such as making friends with the monster or tricking them) to players who are eager to rush into combat. With any encounter in this or subsequent adventures, feel free to present opportunities for unconventional solutions and alternatives to combat.": "由于冒险的单人性质（《冒险7》《一起冒险》除外），一些怪物的力量等级可能与角色的等级有一定的差距。你可能想向那些急于投入战斗的玩家提出一个角色扮演的解决方案（如与怪物交朋友或欺骗它们）。在这次或以后的冒险中遇到的任何情况，都可以自由地提出非常规的解决方案和战斗的替代方案的机会。",
	"You can also adjust the story to be more benevolent in nature, allowing automatic successes on rolls, having monsters become instant friends, or giving your player advantage on all their rolls.": "你也可以把故事调整得更仁慈一些，允许卷轴自动成功，让怪物立即成为朋友，或者让你的玩家在所有的卷轴上获得优势。",
	"In solo play, there's always a chance the character can die. In the case of a single adventurer, this death results in the end of play; which isn't optimal for an afternoon of fun! One way to avoid death is to have healing readily available to the adventurer. If they're without healing, have the character find the odd {@item potion of healing} lying in a dusty crate or have them discover a special healing plant on their journey that, if eaten, puts them back to full hit points.": "在单人游戏中，角色总是有可能死亡。在单个冒险者的情况下，这种死亡会导致游戏的结束；这对于一个下午的乐趣来说并不是最理想的。避免死亡的一个方法是让冒险者随时可以得到治疗。如果他们没有治疗，让角色找到躺在尘土飞扬的箱子里的奇数（%0%），或者让他们在旅途中发现一种特殊的治疗植物，如果吃了它，就能让他们恢复到全额命中。",

	"Whenever you're both ready, you can start the session.": "每当你们都准备好了，你们就可以开始治疗了。",
	"The adventure begins in the vibrant and colorful city of Harmony where mysterious \"color outages\" are beginning to cause a bit of alarm. Being NERDS, the populace of Harmony has an optimistic outlook, and tries to carry on as best they can without being too worried, but the lack of color is concerning to even the most ebullient of NERDS.": "冒险开始于充满活力和色彩斑斓的和谐市，在那里，神秘的 \"颜色中断 \"开始引起了一些恐慌。作为NERDS，Harmony的居民有一个乐观的前景，并试图在不太担心的情况下尽可能地继续下去，但色彩的缺乏甚至让最热情的NERDS也感到担忧。",

	"Recently, however, a strange phenomenon has shaken the citizens of Harmony. In the past few weeks, \"color outages\" have been reported throughout the city, turning its vibrant streets dull and gray, with very little clue as to what might be causing them. These outages are causing the citizens of Harmony distress and no one's sure what to do.": "然而，最近，一个奇怪的现象震撼了和谐城的市民。在过去的几周里，整个城市都出现了 \"断色 \"的报告，使其充满活力的街道变得暗淡和灰暗，但几乎没有任何线索表明可能是什么原因造成的。这些停电给和谐市的市民带来了困扰，没有人知道该怎么做。",
	"This evening, you're relaxing in your favorite seat in the tavern when a fastidious-looking fellow wearing a suit and horn-rimmed glasses pulls up a chair next to you and looks around nervously before speaking.": "这天晚上，你在酒馆里最喜欢的位置上休息，这时，一个穿着西装、戴着角质眼镜、看起来很谨慎的家伙拉着椅子坐到你旁边，在说话前紧张地环顾四周。",
	"The nervous man introduces himself as {@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC} and says to Green that he needs their help in a matter of utmost importance. If Green is willing to hear Mr. Honeycutt out, he tells Green that he's the current Magister of the Lorekeeper Society—an ancient and secret group dedicated to the defense of Harmony. He believes he knows how to solve the mystery of the color outages and to do this, he needs to recover the Emerald Gem. He believes this gemstone is in the possession of a thief who's somewhere in the Circus of Illusions, an entertainment mainstay of Harmony. Mr. Honeycutt says a bard of Green's talent and charm could easily infiltrate the circus as a performer. If Green is amenable, Mr. Honeycutt gives Green a {@item potion of healing} and whispers \"Watch out for the clowns.\" He awaits Green's return in the tavern.": "这个紧张的男人自我介绍说他是{@creature Mr. Honeycutt|NRH-TCMC}，并对格林说他需要他们的帮助来处理一件最重要的事情。如果Green愿意听Honeycutt先生说完，他告诉Green，他是Lorekeeper协会--一个致力于捍卫和谐的古老而秘密的团体--的现任教官。他相信他知道如何解决颜色中断之谜，要做到这一点，他需要恢复翡翠宝石。他认为这颗宝石在一个小偷手里，而这个小偷就在和谐城的娱乐主力--幻觉马戏团的某个地方。哈尼卡特先生说，像格林这样有天赋和魅力的吟游诗人可以很容易地以表演者的身份渗透到马戏团中。如果格林同意，霍尼卡特先生给了格林一个{@item potion of healing}，并低声说 \"小心小丑\"。他在酒馆里等待着格林的归来。",
	"The Circus of Illusions has a massive big top tent in the heart of Harmony. The circus serves as an entertainment venue every weeknight and weekend, featuring magic acts, bard performances, illusory animals, trapeze artists, and more.": "幻觉马戏团在和谐城中心有一个巨大的大顶帐篷。马戏团每个星期的晚上和周末都是娱乐场所，有魔术表演、吟游诗人表演、幻觉动物、空中飞人等等。",

	"Green can choose to pay 1 sp and enter by the main gate or to sneak in. The circus is patrolled by tough-looking clowns wearing colorful costumes, big boots, and red noses. Although the clowns honk horns and act jolly, it's clear they could handle themselves in a fight.": "绿色可以选择支付1英镑，从正门进入，也可以选择偷偷摸摸进入。马戏团由身着五颜六色的服装、穿着大靴子和红鼻子、看起来很强硬的小丑巡逻。虽然这些小丑按着喇叭，表现得很高兴，但很明显他们在战斗中也能应付自如。",
	"Should anyone try to break into the circus or cause trouble, they run afoul of a couple of these clowns. Avoiding the clowns requires a successful DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. On a failure, {@dice 1d4} {@creature clown|NRH-CoI|clowns} investigate, ready to pummel and eject any trespassers or ne'er-do-wells. If Green turns to run away, the clowns don't give chase, but shout taunts and honk horns at them.": "如果有人试图闯入马戏团或制造麻烦，他们会触犯这些小丑中的几个。躲避这些小丑需要成功地进行DC12灵巧（（%0%））检查。如果失败，{@dice 1d4}{@creature clown|NRH-CoI|clowns}就会进行调查，准备殴打并驱逐任何闯入者或新来者。如果格林转身逃跑，小丑们不会追赶，而是对他们大喊嘲讽和鸣笛。",

	"Finster spends most of their time in {@creature Magnifico|NRH-CoI}'s tent, in rat form, primping their whiskers and waiting for their nightly show just before midnight.

	"If Finster feels they can use the Emerald Gem to advance their career or make another deal, they do.

	"{@creature Magnifico|NRH-CoI} heard of the Emerald Gem through some shady characters he knows.

On a success, minds are blown, the crowd goes wild, and there are calls for encores. After the show, signatures are demanded. From now on, Green is a celebrity in the city of Harmony.
