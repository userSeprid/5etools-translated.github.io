	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这场冒险的大部分内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@i The Rise of Tiamat}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@i The Rise of Tiamat}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named {@creature Severin|RoT} Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.": "邪教的新领袖是一个名叫（%0%）西拉金的卡利希特人，他认为真正的龙族知识和力量属于活龙，而不是不死龙。",
	"{@creature Severin|RoT}'s ambition amused {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "{@creature Severin|RoT}的雄心壮志让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}感到高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响他们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组装好的面具，邪教可以把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After {@creature Severin|RoT} (subtly guided by {@creature Tiamat|RoT}) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, {@creature Severin|RoT} became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在{@creature Severin|RoT}（在{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于寻找失传已久的龙面具的秘密藏身处。当他找到红色面具时，{@creature Severin|RoT}成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人很快就跟上了。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.": "迄今为止，神龙教一直对其将（%0%）带入世界的目标保密。许多人都知道该邪教在剑海岸一带的活动有所增加，尤其是在北部，但其复苏背后的原因却不得而知。",
	"Besides his cultists, {@creature Severin|RoT} has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named Rath Modar, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.": "除了他的崇拜者，{@creature Severin|RoT}还与泰伊红袍巫师的一个分裂派别结成联盟。这个小而隐秘的团体由一个名叫拉斯-莫达尔（Rath Modar）的弃儿领导，计划将巫师萨斯-塔姆（Szass Tam）从他在红袍巫师的位置上赶下来。拉斯认为，作为释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的交换条件，她会给予他所需的力量来推翻萨斯-谭。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, {@creature Severin|RoT} initiates the second part of his plan to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT}: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，{@creature Severin|RoT}启动了他释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力吸引了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙及其盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward.During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅程中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim（一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织）中获得了一些意外的盟友。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私者的窝点被卸下，运往一个早已被遗弃的城堡。",
	"A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, Talis the White, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.": "城堡下面的一个传送门连接到邪教最强大和最不满的成员之一--白衣塔利斯的据点，他既可以成为致命的敌人，也可以成为角色们的重要合作者。不管有没有塔利斯的帮助，角色们都必须进入一个云端巨人放置在邪教手中的飞行城堡，并阻止它到达龙之井的目的地。",
	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"This adventure uses the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, completing certain events in the campaign causes the characters to level up. See \"{@area Advancement|028|x}\" later in this introduction.": "这个冒险使用了里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，完成战役中的某些事件会使角色的等级提高。见本介绍后面的\"（%0%）\"。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤古老的魔法和大量的龙族盟友，龙的崇拜试图将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老和最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}收集了一个囤积物--然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品，为龙面具打开通往九层地狱的入口的仪式提供能量，让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}能够前往物质世界。",
	"These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile Rath Modar and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.": "这些计划继续向前推进，因为泰雅族的流亡者拉斯-莫达尔和他的红袍巫师为邪教带来了召唤魔法的专业知识，准备了一个巨大的血祭来增强仪式的力量。然而，巫师和邪教徒之间的联盟是脆弱的，因为双方都不完全相信对方的承诺。",
	"This second volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons} assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What's unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.": "这部《%0%》的第二卷假定善盟冒险者的派别和剑海岸的人们都知道邪教所带来的威胁。不清楚的是如何处理它。根据角色的性质以及他们与各派别的关系，不同的团体可能会向英雄们推荐不同的行动方案。这就需要玩家想出他们要如何进行。",
	"At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see {@area chapter 9|05f|x} for details).": "在这次冒险的开始，整个剑海岸的团体和派别的代表开会讨论他们对神龙教的关注，并制定了反对该教派的计划。冒险家们被召集到沃特迪普参加一个峰会，这个峰会将被称为沃特迪普议会（详见{@area chapter 9|05f|x}）。",
	"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力集团彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不相干的、有争执的团体打造成一个协调的力量。只有所有的派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging {@i The Rise of Tiamat}, and the chapters are numbered for ease of reference. You can even add more chapters of your own devising, or which expand on ideas the players generate.": "本书中的事件是按照逻辑顺序安排的，便于上演（%0%），各章都有编号，便于参考。你甚至可以添加你自己设计的更多章节，或者对玩家产生的想法进行扩展。",
	"The events of {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} lead directly into {@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}.} The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的事件直接导致了{@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"The characters are invited by NPCs they know and trust to the first session of the Council of Waterdeep. (If you played {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, Leosin Erlanthar or Ontharr Frume are likely candidates.)": "角色被他们认识和信任的NPC邀请参加水底议会的第一次会议。（如果你玩过（%0%），Leosin Erlanthar或Ontharr Frume可能是候选人。）",
	"The adventurers learn the location of one of the cult's highest-ranking leaders—Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT}. After discovering that {@creature Varram|RoT} is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.": "冒险家们得知了邪教最高级别的领袖之一--巫师（%0%）的位置。在发现(%%)被元老们囚禁在蛇山之后，冒险者们可以与元老们战斗，并通过谈判取得对该邪教者的监护。",
	"{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}，一个奥术兄弟会的铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物，是他们的事业。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The Emerald Enclave requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest—a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker {@creature Neronvain|RoT}, who has a surprising connection to the council.": "翡翠飞地要求冒险家们帮助他们调查迷雾森林中绿龙领导的邪教袭击事件的后果--一条可能被邪教的一个巫师控制的龙。这项调查导致了与绿龙楚斯和巫师（%0%）的对决，而巫师与议会有着惊人的联系。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",

	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划至关重要的一个龙面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "这个仪式将把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}带到法鲁恩，对于邪教的施法者来说，如果没有他们的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友--所有泰雅族的流亡者，就无法完成这个仪式。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的理由时必须小心谨慎。",

A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads.

	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-塔姆质疑泰伊之外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",

The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from the Nine Hells.

Rath Modar hopes that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, Rath Modar plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是拉斯-莫达尔相信，一旦{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些忠诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。拉斯-莫达尔希望{@creature Tiamat|RoT}会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，给予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在推翻萨斯-谭之后，拉斯-莫达尔计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的首领。{@creature Tiamat|RoT}是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，目前还不得而知。",

The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "剑海岸上并不是每一个{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}都在为拉斯-莫达尔或神龙教工作。有些人追求自己的利益，有些人则是萨斯-谭的间谍。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己与他们通常不会信任的人物结成了不安的联盟，因为消灭一个为邪教服务的（1%）的最简单和最肯定的方法就是将该巫师的位置出卖给萨斯-谭的特工。然而，那些过于接近萨斯-谭的仆人和他对流亡者（%2%）的偏执性仇杀的人物可能会发现自己受到了泰安人的摆布。这种可能性将在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到更充分的探讨。",

	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} into the world is a massive undertaking, and {@creature Severin|RoT} has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼没有任何关系。然而，将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，{@creature Severin|RoT}已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。虽然他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面很有经验，但这样做绝不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils aren't numerous in {@i The Rise of Tiamat} until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，魔鬼的数量并不多（%0%），但是他们在冒险的其他地方的出现（包括额外的遭遇 \"魔鬼的要求\"）应该让细心的玩家对魔鬼和龙之间的联系感到好奇。魔鬼是最高的操纵者，如果角色有机会与不为邪教工作的魔鬼交谈，不要害怕向他们提供邪恶的帮助。这样的提议应该让所有的角色--不仅仅是那些有良好关系的角色--陷入困境。与魔鬼讨价还价是一个愚蠢的游戏，但是如果替代方案是世界末日，这可能是冒险家们的唯一选择。",

	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous.

Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",

The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks.

Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",

	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep.

Like Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism.

Though not an actual member of the Lords' Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance's nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士是一位前冒险家和科米尔的紫龙骑士。虽然他不是领主联盟的实际成员，但他作为联盟名义上的达格福特代表出席了沃特德普的议会。然而，这个小定居点对打败龙之崇拜的努力贡献不大，事实上，伊斯特瓦尔被科米尔征召，以深入了解其西部边境上似乎正在酝酿的一场战争。",
	"Isteval has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties—to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords' Alliance, and to all good folk—are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.": "伊斯特瓦尔非常尊重其他代表，不会对他们隐瞒这些信息，他向在场的人保证，他对达格福特、科米尔、领主联盟和所有善良的人们的忠诚并不相悖。但这种直截了当的做法还是在其他代表中引起了骚动，冒险家们必须参与其中，以确保伊斯特瓦尔不被驱逐出议会会议。",
	"A veteran dragon slayer, Isteval bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity's ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"Sir Isteval has much in common with Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士与高塔骑士团的昂赛尔-弗鲁姆有很多共同点。两人在所有事情上都是潜在的盟友，这让其他一些领主联盟的成员感到担忧。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see {@creature Tiamat|RoT} ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到（%0%）升天是两回事。镇塔林对龙女王的回归对他们的计划意味着什么不抱幻想。想要从阴影中为自己秘密统治世界，黑网的领导人并不希望成为某个小神和她的龙族同伙的代理人和跑腿者。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT} to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in {@creature Varram|RoT}'s portion of the \"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\" chapter.": "至少有一个黑网任务是不计报酬地进行的。在Zhentarim以外的人不知道的情况下，他们的一个特工已经渗透到了邪教，并接近了Wyrmspeaker（%0%），偷走了（%1%）。这次偷窃引发了一连串的事件，在\"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"章节的{@creature Varram|RoT}部分达到高潮。",

Characters who played {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome Jamna Gleamsilver. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.": "黑网特工是有用的NPC，你可以在冒险过程中的适当时候介绍他们。玩过{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的角色已经见过黑网的一个成员--女地精Jamna Gleamsilver。如果角色需要他们无法通过其他方式获得的信息或装备，寻找或被一个Zhentarim特工接近是你提供信息的一个简单方法。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",

She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them.

	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost.

Brave and heroic feats that individual leaders might approve of could be frowned on by a faction as a whole if those deeds don't line up with the faction's agenda.": "大多数派系都向水底城议会派遣了一个代表团，由几个重要人物和他们的助手组成。一般来说，只有每个代表团的领导人会出席冒险家们参加的议会会议。然而，无论个别代表对人物的事迹有何反应，他们也会听从不出席议会会议的同僚的话。如果个别领导人可能赞同的勇敢和英雄事迹不符合派别的议程，那么整个派别就会对这些事迹不屑一顾。",
	"The format of the four council meetings as described below follows the flow of the adventure as set out in the \"Campaign Overview\" section. If events unfold differently in your campaign, adjust the meetings and their events accordingly. For each council meeting, a brief justification for the different attitudes of the factions is provided. More information on the factions and their delegates is provided under \"Allies\" in the book's introduction.": "下面描述的四次理事会会议的形式是按照 \"运动概述 \"部分所规定的冒险的流程进行的。如果在你的活动中，事件的发展情况不同，请相应地调整会议及其事件。对于每个议会会议，都提供了关于各派别不同态度的简要理由。关于各派别及其代表的更多信息，见本书介绍中的 \"盟友 \"部分。",
	"Each session of the council discusses the setup for chapters meant to be played as a result of that session, and the follow-up for previous chapters whose outcome is resolved in that session. In all cases, see those specific chapters for full details.": "理事会的每届会议都讨论了作为该届会议结果的各章节的设置，以及在该届会议上解决了结果的以前各章节的后续工作。在所有情况下，请参阅这些具体章节以了解全部细节。",
	"Two preliminary events help to set up the first session of the council: news of the assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, and the sounding of the {@i Draakhorn}.": "两个初步的事件有助于建立议会的第一次会议：水底城假面领主之一阿尔萨加斯特-乌尔布林特被暗杀的消息，以及{@i Draakhorn}的声音。",
	"Though the leadership of the Cult of the Dragon could not have realized it, one of the key events in the fight to thwart {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans was the cult's assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and husband of Remi Haventree of the Harpers. News of Arthagast's recent murder has spread across the Sword Coast, and has galvanized opposition to the cult in Waterdeep.": "虽然神龙教的领导层不可能意识到这一点，但在挫败{@creature Severin|RoT}计划的斗争中，关键事件之一是该教派暗杀了沃特德普的假面领主、哈珀斯人雷米-哈文特里的丈夫阿萨加斯特-乌尔布林特。Arthagast最近被谋杀的消息已经传遍了整个剑海岸，并激发了水底世界对邪教的反对。",
	"In her grief, Remi Haventree has sworn to destroy the cult and the threat it presents to the Sword Coast. She has been instrumental in bringing the factions together for this Council of Waterdeep, setting up the potential for alliances that the adventurers must now complete.": "悲痛之余，雷米-哈文特里发誓要摧毁这个邪教，以及它对剑海岸的威胁。她在召集各派别参加这次水底议会中发挥了重要作用，为冒险家们现在必须完成的联盟设定了可能性。",
	"Shortly after the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, operatives of the Cult of the Dragon sounded the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} at the distant Well of Dragons. An ancient magic relic, the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} is being used by the cult to summon chromatic dragons to their dark cause.": "在Skyreach城堡坠毁或被占领后不久，龙之教的成员在遥远的龙之井发出了（%0%）的声音。作为一个古老的魔法遗物，（1%）正被邪教用来召唤色龙，以实现他们的黑暗事业。",
	"As the characters are arriving in Waterdeep, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物到达沃特迪普时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"A sudden shift in the wind brings with it a strange sense of unease. The feeling is akin to the drop in air pressure before the approach of a deadly storm, or faint tremors felt from a landslide or earthquake far away. You're not the only ones who have noticed. The city around you goes unnaturally quiet suddenly. No dogs bark, no birds squawk. Even the street vendors have gone silent.": "风的突然转变带来了一种奇怪的不安感。这种感觉类似于致命风暴来临前的气压下降，或者远处山体滑坡或地震带来的微弱震荡。你们不是唯一注意到的人。你周围的城市突然变得不自然的安静。没有狗叫，没有鸟叫。甚至连街上的小贩也变得沉默了。",
	"The silence lasts only a moment before the normal sounds of Waterdeep return to mask the unexplained sensation. If the characters get to a quiet place, they notice the disturbance again, like a rumbling almost too faint to hear. As well, subtle changes in the behavior of animals can be noted. Dogs are nervous and on edge, horses are skittish, cats are more feral than usual, and rats gather in large, bold packs. Sensitive NPCs are also affected, becoming nervous, fearful, and impatient.": "寂静只持续了一会儿，然后水底世界的正常声音又回来了，掩盖了这种无法解释的感觉。如果人物到了一个安静的地方，他们又会注意到这种干扰，就像隆隆声一样，几乎微弱得听不到。同样，也可以注意到动物行为的微妙变化。狗很紧张，马很胆小，猫比平时更野性，老鼠则聚集成大群。敏感的NPC也会受到影响，变得紧张、恐惧和急躁。",
	"During the first session of the council (or earlier if the characters make efforts to investigate the strange phenomenon), the adventurers are approached by Dala Silmerhelve—a Waterdhavian noble. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters speak to Dala.": "在议会的第一次会议上（如果人物努力调查这个奇怪的现象，则更早），冒险家们被达拉-西尔梅赫夫（Dala Silmerhelve）找去了，他是一个沃特达威的贵族。当人物与达拉交谈时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"\"The disturbance that's been sensed across the Sword Coast is the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient device whose sounding alerts dragons across Faerûn that great events are unfolding. It's impossible to say what the sounding means, but the dragons hear it clearly and will eventually answer its call. \"": "\"整个剑海岸所感应到的干扰是{@item Draakhorn|RoT}--一个古老的装置，它的声音提醒整个法鲁恩的龙，伟大的事件正在展开。不可能说这声音意味着什么，但龙能清楚地听到它，并且最终会响应它的召唤。\"",
	"Lady Silmerhelve learned this from her family's secret benefactor, an ancient bronze dragon named Nymmurh. She knows a little more about the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, but she waits to reveal it until she attends the first council meeting. She flatly refuses to tell anyone the source of her knowledge if asked. This makes Ulder Ravengard, King Conneerad, and Ontharr Frume suspicious, but others take the secrecy in stride. If Lady Silmerhelve is treated poorly, It might affect how Nymmurh interacts with the characters in {@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}\"": "西尔梅赫夫夫人是从她家族的秘密恩人那里得知的，那是一条名叫尼姆赫的古老青铜龙。她还知道一点关于{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的事情，但她等到参加第一次议会会议时才透露。如果被问及，她断然拒绝告诉任何人她的知识来源。这让乌尔德-拉文加德（Ulder Ravengard）、康奈拉德国王（King Conneerad）和昂赛尔-弗鲁姆（Ontharr Frume）起了疑心，但其他人对这种保密态度也很坦然。如果Silmerhelve女士受到恶劣的对待，可能会影响Nymmurh与{@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}中人物的互动。\"",
	"Having accepted the invitation to the council meeting, the adventurers are received at the Lords' Palace. Make the introduction to the City of Splendors and the Lords' Palace as detailed or as simple as fits your campaign style.": "在接受了议会会议的邀请后，冒险家们在领主府受到了接待。根据你的活动风格，对辉煌之城和领主府的介绍可以很详细，也可以很简单。",
	"Once inside the Lords' Palace, the party is escorted to the secret council chambers by Leosin Erlanthar. The outer galleries are packed with nobles engaged in heated debate, and the guards are wearing livery from city-states across the North.": "进入领主府后，一行人在利奥辛-埃兰萨的陪同下前往秘密议事厅。外面的长廊挤满了正在进行激烈辩论的贵族，卫兵们穿着来自北方各城邦的制服。",
	"Although Erlanthar is not invited to the council discussions, Remallia Haventree has informed him of the agenda and the reason the party has been summoned. He advises the characters that though the factions are all nominally committed to stopping the Cult of the Dragon, none of the delegates have made substantive pledges yet.": "虽然埃尔兰萨没有被邀请参加议会的讨论，但雷玛利亚-哈文特里（Remallia Haventree）已经告诉了他议程和聚会被召集的原因。他告诉这些人物，虽然各派别在名义上都致力于阻止神龙教，但还没有一个代表做出实质性的承诺。",
	"Too much mistrust still burdens the factions, and not enough is known about the situation. Erlanthar thinks the leaders need someone to show them the right path—heroes who will lead the forces of the Sword Coast with certainty into the coming darkness. He believes that the adventurers have a chance to be those heroes. However, he explains that each faction will weigh every word the characters say and scrutinize every one of their decisions. What pleases one group might anger another, and it will be incredibly difficult to make all parties happy.": "太多的不信任仍然困扰着各派别，而且对局势的了解也不够多。埃兰萨认为领袖们需要有人为他们指明正确的道路--那些能够带领剑海岸的军队确定地进入即将到来的黑暗的英雄。他认为冒险者们有机会成为这些英雄。然而，他解释说，每个派别都会权衡人物所说的每一句话，仔细检查他们的每一个决定。让一个团体高兴的事可能会激怒另一个团体，要让各方都满意是非常困难的。",
	"Once introductions are made, Dagult Neverember summarizes the situation if the adventurers did not play through {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. This includes the plan to summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, increased dragon raids led by the cult, the treasure collection system, the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, and the importance of the wyrmspeakers and dragon masks to the cult.": "介绍完毕后，如果冒险者没有玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，达古特-纽伦堡就总结一下情况。这包括召唤（%1%）的计划，由邪教领导的龙族突袭的增加，宝藏收集系统，天际城堡的崩溃或被占领，以及巫术师和龙面具对邪教的重要性。",
	"If the party played through the previous adventure, Dagult explains that the council has heard reports from Ontharr, Leosin, and other witnesses, but that the delegates wish to hear from the heroes at the center of recent events. (At this point, use Neverember to also fill in any information the characters did not gather during {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} that you deem important.)": "如果队伍经历了之前的冒险，达古特解释说议会已经听取了昂赛尔、利奥辛和其他证人的报告，但代表们希望听取处于最近事件中心的英雄们的意见。(在这一点上，请用 \"永生 \"来填补人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}期间没有收集到的任何你认为重要的信息）。",
	"Most of the factions recognize that Skyreach Castle needed to be stopped, and they are happy if the castle was crashed. However, some members of the Lords' Alliance think it unconscionable that such a resource would be destroyed, intentionally or otherwise. These dissidents believe it would have been better for the characters to have waited for reinforcements, then attacked to secure the castle (regardless of how unrealistic that plan might have been).": "大多数派别都认识到，天际城堡需要被阻止，如果城堡被撞毁，他们也很高兴。然而，领主联盟的一些成员认为，不管是有意还是无意，这样的资源被摧毁是不合情理的。这些持不同意见的人认为，角色们最好先等待援军，然后再进攻以确保城堡的安全（不管这个计划可能有多么不现实）。",
	"The fate of the dragon hatchery divides opinion as well. Most delegates respect a decision to destroy the hatchery, accepting that having fewer dragons to deal with later on is an advantage. However, the Harpers would have preferred the eggs to be kept for ransoming back to their parents, potentially keeping those dragons from cooperating with the cult. Dagult would have sold the valuable eggs to \"responsible buyers,\" then used that gold to hire more mercenaries. The Emerald Enclave is firmly against any dragon eggs being destroyed, believing that the chromatic dragons are a part of the natural order and that killing their young upsets the balance of that order. Taern Hornblade and Lady Laeral Silverhand think there might have been a way to leverage the eggs as ransom, but both recognize that they would have been dangerous to hold onto—and even more dangerous to return.": "龙的孵化场的命运也存在意见分歧。大多数代表尊重摧毁孵化场的决定，认为以后少一些龙来处理是一个好处。然而，哈珀斯人更倾向于保留这些龙蛋，以便将其赎回给它们的父母，这可能会使这些龙不与邪教合作。达古特会把这些有价值的蛋卖给 \"负责任的买家\"，然后用这些黄金来雇佣更多的雇佣兵。翡翠飞地坚决反对销毁任何龙蛋，认为色龙是自然秩序的一部分，杀死它们的幼龙会破坏这种秩序的平衡。Taern Hornblade和Lady Laeral Silverhand认为可能有办法利用这些龙蛋作为赎金，但他们都认识到，持有这些龙蛋会很危险，而归还龙蛋则更危险。",
	"When the discussion around the events from {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is concluded, the council moves on to current matters. It's obvious to all that the adventurers have taken a firm hand in addressing this crisis, and that they have proven their worth. The council deputizes the characters with emergency investigative powers and a writ demonstrating such. This grants the characters access to resources and sites they deem necessary for their investigation, but carries with it the burden of oversight from the council. If the adventurers misbehave or abuse their powers, their actions will be reviewed and the writ will be revoked.": "当围绕{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}事件的讨论结束后，议会转而讨论当前的事务。很明显，冒险家们在处理这场危机时采取了坚定的态度，他们已经证明了自己的价值。议会授予这些人物紧急调查的权力和证明这种权力的文件。这使他们有机会进入他们认为必要的资源和地点进行调查，但同时也承担了理事会的监督责任。如果冒险者行为不端或滥用他们的权力，他们的行为将被审查，令状将被撤销。",
	"Once the characters have been vested with their powers, the first stages of the adventure await.": "一旦人物被赋予了他们的力量，冒险的第一阶段就会到来。",
	"One of Remallia Haventree's first acts in her fight against the Cult of the Dragon was to encourage the Harpers to focus all their resources on the cult's activities and its most powerful members. Those efforts have been successful, and Leosin Erlanthar reports to the adventurers of the movements of {@creature Varram|RoT}, the cult's White Wyrmspeaker. This leads to \"{@adventure Varram the White|RoT|3|Varram the White},\" Part of \"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12: Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\".": "雷玛利亚-哈文特里（Remallia Haventree）在与巨龙教的斗争中的第一个行动就是鼓励哈珀人将所有的资源集中在该教派的活动和其最强大的成员身上。这些努力是成功的，Leosin Erlanthar向冒险者们报告了该邪教的白巫师（%0%）的动向。这导致了\"{@adventure Varram the White|RoT|3|Varram the White}\"，\"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12: Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"的一部分。",
	"The sounding of the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} weighs heavily on all the leaders of the Sword Coast. Seeking more information on the horn and its whereabouts leads the party on an expedition to the frozen North, and {@adventure chapter 10|RoT|2}.": "{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的响声让剑海岸的所有领导人感到沉重。为了寻求更多关于号角和它的下落的信息，党员们开始了对冰冷的北方的远征，并且（%%1%）。",
	"At the Second Council of Waterdeep, the adventurers see two new faces. Lord Neverember has been replaced as Open Lord of Waterdeep by Lady Laeral Silverhand, who now sits at the head of the council table. Dagult sits to her right, alongside a human female introduced as Elia (see below).": "在水底世界的第二次会议上，冒险者们看到了两张新面孔。永恒之神（Lord Neverember）已经被银手女士（Lady Laeral Silverhand）取代，成为水底世界的公开领主，她现在坐在议会桌的首位。达古特坐在她的右边，旁边还有一个被介绍为伊利亚的人类女性（见下文）。",
	"The delegates discuss the raids in their various domains after receiving the characters' report, providing flavor for the ongoing activities of the cult and giving a clear impression that the situation is escalating.": "代表们在收到人物的报告后讨论了他们各个领域的突击行动，为邪教正在进行的活动提供了味道，并给人以局势正在升级的清晰印象。",
	"In response to the fate of Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Harpers and Taern are upset if the dwarf was slain without being interrogated, and Connerad is upset that {@creature Varram|RoT} was not captured and made an example of in a court of dwarven law. Though most are pleased with capturing {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Emerald Enclave is nonplussed, believing that capturing him only complicates matters. {@creature Varram|RoT} has already demonstrated a willingness to corrupt the natural order, making a trial excessive—and potentially opening the door to a rescue attempt.": "对于Wyrmspeaker{@creature Varram|RoT}的命运，哈珀斯和塔恩对这个矮人没有被审问就被杀死感到不满，而康纳德对{@creature Varram|RoT}没有被抓到并在矮人法庭上被当做例子感到不满。虽然大多数人对抓捕{@creature Varram|RoT}感到高兴，但翡翠飞地却不以为然，认为抓捕他只会让事情变得复杂。{@creature Varram|RoT}已经表现出了腐蚀自然秩序的意愿，使审判变得过分，并有可能为救援行动打开大门。",
	"The Arcane Brotherhood are powerful allies, and all are pleased if the party wins their allegiance—with the exception of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ontharr Frume knows that the Arcane Brotherhood does not police its members in what kinds of knowledge they pursue, and that they tolerate many evil wizards in their company. Bringing the Arcane Brotherhood into the alliance doesn't lose Frume's respect, but neither does it earn it.": "奥术兄弟会是强大的盟友，如果党派赢得了他们的效忠，所有人都会很高兴--除了高塔骑士团之外。昂赛尔-弗鲁姆知道，奥术兄弟会并不监管其成员追求什么样的知识，而且他们容忍许多邪恶的巫师与他们为伍。将奥术兄弟会带入联盟并不会失去弗鲁姆的尊重，但也不会赢得他的尊重。",
	"Delaan Winterhound of the Emerald Enclave is involved with investigations into recent dragon attacks in the Misty Forest. King Melandrach waves away Delaan's concerns, saying that dragon attacks in the area have stopped since his elves increased their patrols and fortified their positions. Discovering the truth will lead the adventurers to \"{@area Neronvain,|12d|x}\" part of \"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12:Death to the Wyrmspeakers.|RoT|3}\"": "翡翠飞地的德拉安-温特猎犬参与了对迷雾森林最近发生的龙类攻击的调查。梅兰德斯国王对德拉恩的担忧置之不理，说自从他的精灵们加强巡逻和加固阵地后，该地区的龙攻击就停止了。发现真相后，冒险家们将前往\"{@area Neronvain,|12d|x} \"的一部分\"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12:Death to the Wyrmspeakers.|RoT|3}\"",
	"During the council, the adventurers are introduced to the silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos, in her human guise as Elia. She bears an invitation from the metallic dragons to a council of their own, and the council delegates ask the adventurers to attend. This leads into {@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}.": "在议会期间，冒险家们被介绍给银龙奥塔里亚克卡诺斯，她的人类身份是埃利亚。她带着金属龙的邀请函参加他们自己的议会，议会代表要求冒险者们参加。这导致了{@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}。",
	"The third council features another new face—the tiefling Rian Nightshade, introduced as a special adviser to Lord Neverember. Characters who pay attention notice that some at the meeting—including Sir Isteval, Ontharr Frume, and Ambassador Brawnanvil—are doing their best to ignore the secret Zhentarim delegate, who makes no statements unless addressed by the party.": "第三次会议的主角是另一张新面孔--铁皮人里安-夜影，他被介绍为纽伦堡爵士的特别顾问。有心人注意到，会议上的一些人--包括伊斯特瓦尔爵士、昂萨-弗鲁姆和布劳南维尔大使--都在尽力忽视那个秘密的赞塔林代表，除非有当事人发言，否则他是不会发言的。",
	"News that the dragon attacks in the elven forest have ended is gratefully received by all on the council. However, King Melandrach responds with cold fury to news of his son {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s betrayal. He remains hesitant to put elves in the front lines of combat, but no longer acts as a roadblock to negotiations. His pragmatism means that he no longer has any qualms against the adventurers' securing the allegiance of Red Wizards, giants, or even devils in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon—as long as such allies are conveniently arrayed in front of his elves in battle.": "精灵森林中的龙族攻击已经结束的消息被议会中的所有人欣然接受。然而，梅兰德斯国王对他儿子{@creature Neronvain|RoT}背叛的消息做出了冷酷的反应。他仍然对把精灵放在战斗前线犹豫不决，但不再充当谈判的路障。他的实用主义意味着他不再对冒险者在对抗龙之教的斗争中获得红袍巫师、巨人甚至魔鬼的效忠有任何顾虑，只要这些盟友在战斗中能方便地排列在他的精灵面前。",
	"All the delegates are impressed if the party has gained the support of the metallic dragons, even if their own faction was asked to make concessions. The good dragons are wise and just creatures, and their acceptance of the party greatly boosts the adventurers' standing in everyone's eyes.": "如果党获得了金属龙的支持，即使他们自己的派别被要求做出让步，所有代表都会留下深刻印象。好的龙是明智而公正的生物，他们对党的接受大大提升了冒险者在大家眼中的地位。",
	"King Melandrach is furious if the characters agreed to an apology for the {@i Dracorage mythal}. He makes the apology because honor demands it, but he resents the party for forcing his hand. Connerad Brawnanvil is similarly unhappy if a concession was made in response to the ancient dragonmoots of the dwarves. The traditions of the dragonmoot saved many lives in their time, and the fact that one metallic dragon was injured indicates that it was probably misbehaving. Dwarves have no patience for tolerating misbehaving dragons, no matter what their color.": "如果人物同意为（%0%）道歉，梅兰德斯国王很生气。他做出道歉是因为荣誉的要求，但他怨恨党人强迫他出手。如果针对矮人的古老龙卷风做出让步，康纳德-布劳南威尔也同样不高兴。Dragonmoot的传统在他们的时代拯救了许多人的生命，而一条金属龙受伤的事实表明，它可能是行为不端。矮人没有耐心容忍行为不端的龙，无论其颜色如何。",
	"Bartering away portions of the hoard that the cult stole is the only way some factions can make concessions. For every concession that was made for a share, circle a negative (−) icon in the following order: Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet. The Emerald Enclave is not affected by such concessions, since the order has not been overly affected by the dragon raids.": "用邪教偷来的囤积物的一部分进行交换，是一些派别做出让步的唯一方式。对于每一个做出让步的份额，按以下顺序圈出一个负数（-）的图标。Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet。翡翠飞地不受这种让步的影响，因为该骑士团没有受到龙族突袭的过度影响。",
	"As an effect of the way in which the adventurers have impressed the dragon council, it now falls to them to allocate the dragons that have pledged their service to the factions. Dragons allocated to a delegate of the Lords' Alliance are assigned to protect the capital city of the delegate's territory. A dragon assigned to the Harpers will be used for intelligence gathering. The Order of the Gauntlet sends any dragons to the city of Elturel, while the Emerald Enclave sends dragons to guard the ancient treant known as the Grandfather Tree. The party can also distribute dragons to specific regions. In such a scenario, a dragon protects a 100-mile-radius area around the point where it is assigned, stopping draconic raids in that area.": "由于冒险家们给龙会留下了深刻的印象，现在由他们来分配那些已经承诺为各派别服务的龙。分配给领主联盟代表的龙被指派保护该代表领地的首都。分配给哈珀斯的龙将被用于收集情报。高塔骑士团将任何龙派往Elturel城，而翡翠飞地则派龙守护被称为祖父树的古老树人。党派也可以将龙分配到特定区域。在这种情况下，一条龙会保护它被分配到的地点周围100英里半径的区域，阻止龙族在该区域的突袭。",
	"At the summit, information comes to the characters revealing that a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon seeks to defect from the group, and that the cultist is offering a dragon mask as part of his plea for aid. Though the offer could be a trap, the council delegates believe that the risk is worth it. The defector is holed up in a fortress known as Xonthal's Tower, recently taken over by the cult. Because a small team has a better chance to successfully infiltrate the tower than a larger force, the adventurers are asked to investigate. This leads to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "在峰会上，这些人物得到的信息显示，神龙教的一名高级成员试图叛离该组织，而且该邪教分子提供了一个龙的面具作为他请求援助的一部分。虽然这个提议可能是一个陷阱，但议会代表们认为这个风险是值得的。叛逃者被藏在一个被称为Xonthal's Tower的堡垒里，最近被邪教组织占领了。因为小队比大队更有机会成功潜入塔内，所以冒险家们被要求进行调查。这导致了{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}。",
	"The Red Wizards are integral to the cult's plans for summoning {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, but the Red Wizards allied with the Cult of the Dragon are exiles with no connection to Thay. The Thayan Red Wizards approach the Council of Waterdeep asking for an envoy to be sent to Thay, where they must convince the most reviled wizards in Faerûn to join with the forces of the Sword Coast for the common good. This paves the way for {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "红袍巫师在邪教的召唤计划中不可或缺（%0%），但与神龙教结盟的红袍巫师是流亡者，与泰伊没有关系。泰伊的红袍巫师找到水底议会，要求派遣特使前往泰伊，他们必须说服法鲁恩最遭人唾弃的巫师，为了共同的利益与剑岸的力量联合起来。这为{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}铺平了道路。",
	"The fourth council is the final meeting between the faction leaders and the adventurers. Hundreds of chromatic dragons have been sighted near the Well of Dragons, and the time has come to strike. At the end of this council, the delegates make their final decisions of support for the adventurers and their cause, if they haven't done so already.": "第四次会议是各派别领导人和冒险者之间的最后一次会议。在龙之井附近发现了数百条色龙，现在是出击的时候了。在这次会议结束时，如果代表们还没有做出支持冒险者和他们的事业的最后决定，他们会做出这样的决定。",
	"At an appropriate point in the council meetings, Rian Nightshade approaches the characters and asks for a private audience. She explains her position as an emissary of the Zhentarim, and of the Zhentarim's interest in current affairs. She bemoans the dithering of the other factions, stating that the Black Network is willing to act immediately and unflinchingly—if the party can help arrange agreeable terms for the Zhentarim's support.": "在理事会会议的一个适当时刻，里安-夜影走近这些人物，要求进行私人会谈。她解释了她作为Zhentarim使者的身份，以及Zhentarim对当前事务的兴趣。她哀叹其他派别的犹豫不决，并表示黑网愿意立即毫不犹豫地采取行动--如果该党能够帮助安排赞塔林支持的合意条款。",
	"Rian points out that the Zhentarim have a keen interest in Xonthal's Tower. Ownership of the tower is under discussion by the council, but the tiefling wants to deal directly with the adventurers, who have claim to the tower by right of conquest. The Zhentarim are willing to purchase the adventurers' interest in the tower for 50,000 gold pieces, and Rian can throw in a {@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}, a {@item potion of frost giant strength}, and a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell earthquake} to sweeten the deal. This price could go up considerably if the party negotiates agreeable terms from the other factions for the Zhentarim's support—up to an additional 25,000 gp, at your discretion.": "里安指出，Zhentarim对Xonthal的塔有浓厚的兴趣。议会正在讨论该塔的所有权，但铁皮人想直接与冒险者打交道，因为他们有征服权，对该塔有要求。镇塔人愿意以50,000金币的价格购买冒险者在塔中的权益，而且里安可以在{@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}、{@item potion of frost giant strength}和{@item spell scroll}的{@spell earthquake}中加入甜头。如果党派从其他派别那里谈判出同意的条款，以获得Zhentarim的支持，这个价格可能会大幅上升--最多可额外增加25000金币，由你决定。",
	"Any alliance with the Red Wizards is a mixed blessing. More pragmatic factions and delegates—including the Harpers, King Melandrach, Dagult Neverember, and Taern Hornblade—are impressed by the diplomacy such an arrangement demonstrates, and know that regardless of the Red Wizards' character and previous plots against the Sword Coast, they are a significant asset. Sir Isteval, Ambassador Brawnanvil, and the Order of the Gauntlet object to the idea of even opening dialogue with the Red Wizards, and believe that the Thayans would agree to an alliance only if it furthered their own plots to rule the Sword Coast and all Faerûn. Lady Laeral and Ulder Ravengard both think the Red Wizards unpredictable but necessary, believing that the only important factor is how the Thayans influence the outcome of the final battle.": "任何与红袍巫师的联盟都是喜忧参半的。更加务实的派别和代表--包括哈珀人、梅兰德斯国王、达古特-纽伦堡和泰恩-霍恩布拉德--对这种安排所展现的外交手段印象深刻，并知道无论红袍巫师的性格和之前对剑海岸的阴谋如何，他们都是一笔重要的资产。Isteval爵士、Brawnanvil大使和Gauntlet骑士团反对与红袍巫师展开对话的想法，并认为只有在促进他们自己统治剑海岸和整个Faerûn的阴谋的情况下，Thayans才会同意建立联盟。拉伊尔夫人和乌尔德-拉文加德都认为红袍巫师是不可预测的，但也是必要的，他们认为唯一重要的因素是塔扬人如何影响最后的战斗结果。",
	"The outcome of the support of the metallic dragons (as allocated in the third council) is accounted for in this fourth council. Factions that did not receive draconic aid suffer terribly in the cult's raids, and some delegates resent the adventurers for withholding the service of their dragon allies. Only Isteval, Connerad, and the Harpers maintain their respect for the adventurers regardless of how the dragons were assigned. Cormyr remains largely untouched by the cult, whose operations remain focused on the Sword Coast. The Harpers have no strongholds, and so suffer less than other factions. Ambassador Brawnanvil appreciates the value of dragon guards, but his strongholds are deep underground and hard for the cult to reach—and all dwarves know how even good dragons covet dwarven gems and gold.": "金属龙支持的结果（如在第三次议会中的分配）在这第四次议会中得到了说明。没有得到龙族援助的派别在邪教的袭击中遭受了极大的伤害，一些代表对冒险者扣留龙族盟友的服务感到不满。只有伊斯特瓦尔（Isteval）、康纳德（Connerad）和哈珀斯（Harpers）对冒险者保持尊重，不管龙是如何被分配的。科米尔在很大程度上没有受到邪教的影响，他们的行动仍然集中在剑海岸。哈珀人没有据点，所以比其他派别受到的影响要小。布劳南威尔大使很欣赏龙族守卫的价值，但他的据点深入地下，邪教很难到达--所有矮人都知道即使是好龙也会觊觎矮人的宝石和黄金。",
	"Every faction will donate troops and resources to the struggle against the Cult of the Dragon. However, to win the battle requires the full, unconditional support of multiple factions.

	"Which way a faction leans is determined by the adventurers' actions and accomplishments during the adventure. Successfully completing an chapter of the adventure will usually gain support from multiple factions. However, each faction has its own priorities, and sometimes a heroic deed that pleases one faction can anger or disappoint another. In some cases, a faction might even prefer that the characters engage in antiheroic acts—by executing certain enemies rather than taking prisoners, for example. The adventurers might also be seen to be favoring certain factions, if metallic dragon allies are sent to defend the interests and settlements of one faction over another.": "一个派别倾向于哪个方向是由冒险者在冒险过程中的行动和成就决定的。成功完成冒险的某一章节通常会获得多个派系的支持。然而，每个派别都有自己的优先权，有时一个英雄的行为如果让一个派别高兴，就会让另一个派别感到愤怒或失望。在某些情况下，一个派别甚至可能希望人物从事反英雄的行为--例如，处决某些敌人而不是俘虏。如果金属龙的盟友被派去捍卫一个派别的利益和定居点，而不是另一个派别，那么冒险者也可能被视为偏袒某些派别。",

Gigantic icebergs wander listlessly through this glasslike sea, or are sent smashing and grinding against each other by bitterly cold winds, the sea spray transformed into fantastic frozen shapes around them. Only creatures adapted to severe cold can survive such frigid extremes, but many beasts—and even people—make their homes in the Sea of Moving Ice. One such creature is the white dragon Arauthator, known as \"Old White Death\" by those he stalks and terrorizes. In this section of the adventure, the heroes' battle against the cult leads them to one of Arauthator's iceberg lairs.": "在遥远的北方，在世界之脊之外，甚至在冰风谷之上，是移动的冰海。巨大的冰山无精打采地在这片玻璃般的海洋中游荡，或者被严寒的风吹得粉碎，相互摩擦，海浪在它们周围变成了奇妙的冰冻形状。只有适应严寒的生物才能在如此寒冷的极端环境中生存，但许多野兽，甚至人类都在移动的冰海中安家。白龙Arauthator就是这样一种生物，他被那些被他跟踪和恐吓的人称为 \"老白死\"。在冒险的这一部分中，英雄们与邪教的战斗将他们带到了阿劳特的一个冰山巢穴中。",

More than a century ago, during one of the cyclical periods of draconic violence known as the Rage of Dragons, Arauthator joined with a dozen other dragons in attacking the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Their assault toppled the west arm of the tower, and Arauthator was seen scooping up numerous items of great magical importance and power, including at least three tomes of rare spells. The possibility of recovering those books is part of what drew {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT} to the Sea of Moving Ice.": "除了他的体型、狡猾和凶猛之外，Arauthator还拥有法术能力，这使他成为一个特别危险的敌人。一个多世纪以前，在被称为 \"龙之怒 \"的龙族暴力周期中，Arauthator与其他十几条龙一起袭击了卢斯坎的奥术主机塔。他们的攻击推翻了塔的西臂，人们看到Arauthator捡起了许多具有巨大魔法重要性和力量的物品，包括至少三本稀有的法术书。恢复这些书籍的可能性是吸引{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}来到移动冰海的部分原因。",

At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon's back. She has never accepted his death, and still speaks to him as if he were alive.

If the characters and crew don't intend to haul {@i Frostskimmr} onto an ice floe for the night, one of the scrags swims beneath the ship and wrenches a plank loose, causing a serious leak that requires the ship to be pulled onto the ice for repairs.": "这个事件只在晚上发生，而且只在冰上发生。当{@i Frostskimmr}坐在浮冰上等待天亮时，三个被称为{@creature Scrag|TftYP|scrags}的水生巨魔（游泳速度30英尺，可以在水下呼吸）攻击了船只。如果角色和船员不打算把{@i Frostskimmr}拖到浮冰上过夜，其中一个水怪就会游到船下，把一块木板拧松，造成严重的泄漏，需要把船拉到冰上修理。",
	"This event can occur only by day. A hunting party from Oyaviggaton (12 {@creature Tribal Warrior|| tribal warriors}) is spotted pursuing seals on an ice floe, whether {@i Frostskimmr} is on the water or on an adjacent ice floe. The hunters are surly and uncommunicative if approached, knowing that they must return to the iceberg before nightfall or their kin will be punished. Captain Lerustah is puzzled by their behavior, knowing that the Ice Hunter people are shy but never hostile. The hunters quickly paddle their khyeks away to the northeast. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll.": "此事件只能在白天发生。来自奥亚维加顿（12（%0%））的狩猎队被发现在浮冰上追捕海豹，无论（%1%）是在水上还是在相邻的浮冰上。如果有人接近，猎人们会很生气，不善言辞，因为他们知道必须在天黑前返回冰山，否则他们的亲属会受到惩罚。勒鲁斯塔船长对他们的行为感到疑惑，他知道猎冰人很害羞，但从来没有敌意。猎人们很快就划着船向东北方向走去。如果人物跟随猎人，或在下一阶段的旅程中使用该方位，他们的下一次日间活动卷轴将获得+1奖励。",
	"This event occurs only during the day. A group of fishers from Oyaviggaton (12 {@creature Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors}) are spotted in their characteristic boats, whether {@i Frostskimmr} is in the water or on a nearby ice floe. They are unfriendly and uncommunicative if approached, paddling away to the northeast as soon as they are able. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll.": "这一事件只发生在白天。一群来自奥亚维加顿的渔民（12人（%0%））被发现在他们特有的船上，无论（%1%）是在水中还是在附近的浮冰上。如果接近他们，他们是不友好的，也不善于沟通，一有机会就会向东北方向划去。如果人物跟随猎人或使用该方位进行下一阶段的旅行，他们的下一个白天事件卷获得+1奖励。",
	"This event can occur by day or night. There's no mistaking the silhouette of this massive iceberg as matching the description given by {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}. With a flattened expanse at one end rising to jagged peaks at the other, the characters' objective is at hand.": "这一事件可以在白天或晚上发生。这座巨大的冰山的轮廓与{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}给出的描述一致，不会有错。一端是平坦的大山，另一端是参差不齐的山峰，人物的目标就在眼前。",
	"Arauthator's iceberg lair rises from the sea to form a floating island. The portion of the berg above the water appears roughly triangular, with rounded corners. The plateau portion of the iceberg rises more than a hundred feet above the water, and the jagged ice peaks add another two hundred feet above that.": "Arauthator的冰山巢穴从海中升起，形成一个浮动的岛屿。冰山高出水面的部分看起来大致呈三角形，有圆角。冰山的高原部分高出水面一百多英尺，参差不齐的冰峰在此之上又增加了两百英尺。",
	"The Ice Hunter village is a collection of snow shelters and tents sitting at the center of the island. The village can't be seen from the sea because of the berg's height, but a large shelf of ice where the Ice Hunters beach their boats is clearly visible from the water. Approximately 60 feet across, the shelf rises a few feet above sea level and is littered with enormous, cracked bones—including ribs that arch taller than a human.": "猎冰者村是一个由雪棚和帐篷组成的集合体，坐落在岛屿的中心。由于冰山的高度，从海上看不到村子，但从水面上可以清楚地看到猎冰人停泊船只的一个大冰架。冰架大约有60英尺宽，高出海平面几英尺，到处都是巨大的、破裂的骨头--包括比人还高的肋骨。",
	"A character proficient in {@skill Nature} recognizes that the bones are mostly from whales and huge seals (or Captain Lerustah can supply that information). Any character who spends a few minutes examining the bones discovers tooth marks with a monstrous bite radius—evidence that a gigantic predator (Arauthator) ate at least some of these creatures. Examining the bones reveals smaller human bones in the pile as well, all of which show the same bite marks.": "一个精通{@skill Nature}的人物认识到，这些骨头主要来自鲸鱼和巨大的海豹（或者Lerustah船长可以提供这些信息）。任何花几分钟检查这些骨头的人物都会发现具有巨大咬合半径的牙印--这证明一个巨大的食肉动物（Arauthator）至少吃了这些生物中的一部分。检查这些骨头时发现，在这堆骨头中还有一些较小的人骨，它们都有同样的咬痕。",
	"An ice chasm splits the cliff face above the ice shelf, rising to the top of the plateau. The chasm is 20 feet wide near the bottom but narrows to 5 feet wide at the top. Steps are cut into the ice, making for an easy climb to the top of the plateau.": "一条冰鸿沟劈开了冰架上方的悬崖面，上升到高原的顶部。鸿沟在底部有20英尺宽，但在顶部缩小到5英尺宽。冰面上开有台阶，可以很容易地爬到高原的顶部。",
	"Captain Lerustah would like to keep his crew members aboard {@i Frostskimmr} rather than marching them up to the plateau. He's not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving his ship without the strongest possible complement of guards. If the characters are unable to communicate with the Ice Hunters (who speak only their own language, Uluik), one of the crew members speaks enough Uluik to get by. The translator will accompany the characters onto the iceberg if he's paid a bonus of at least 50 gp, but he returns to the ship as soon as the characters descend into the ice caves.": "Lerustah船长想把他的船员留在船上（%0%），而不是把他们赶到高原上。他对在没有最强大的警卫的情况下离开他的船的想法一点也不舒服。如果角色无法与猎冰人（他们只说自己的语言，Uluik）沟通，其中一名船员会说足够的Uluik语。如果翻译得到至少50金币的奖励，他就会陪同人物进入冰山，但当人物进入冰洞后，他就会返回船上。",
	"The top of Oyaviggaton is a plateau, but it's not level. The ground is uneven, fractured by narrow ice chasms and divided by rills, snowdrifts, and ice ridges taller than a human, sculpted by sea spray and wind. The ridges block the view of the village until characters are 200 feet from the nearest shelter.": "奥亚维加顿的顶部是一个高原，但它并不平整。地面凹凸不平，被狭窄的冰裂缝分割，被山丘、雪堆和比人还高的冰脊分割，被海浪和风雕琢而成。这些冰脊挡住了村庄的视线，直到人物离最近的避难所有200英尺。",
	"The first sight that greets the adventurers when they emerge onto the plateau is a row of ten corpses frozen into a wall of ice: three Luskar warriors, a dwarf, and six Ice Hunters. The bodies have been preserved in the ice, making it impossible to tell how long they've been here. The southerners and the dwarf were some of {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}'s companions, killed by Arauthator. The Ice Hunters used the bodies to put up this grisly warning, in the hope that other intruders might fear the same fate and turn back. The dead Ice Hunters tried to flee from the iceberg but were hunted and killed by Arauthator, who forced their kin to add them to the horrid display.": "当冒险者出现在高原上时，迎接他们的第一个景象是一排被冻成冰墙的十具尸体：三个卢斯卡战士、一个矮人和六个猎冰者。这些尸体被保存在冰中，无法判断他们在这里呆了多久。南方人和矮人是(%%)的一些同伴，被阿劳特杀死。猎冰者们用这些尸体发出了这个可怕的警告，希望其他入侵者会害怕同样的命运而回头。死去的猎冰人试图逃离冰山，但被阿劳特追杀，阿劳特强迫他们的亲属将他们加入到这个可怕的展览中。",
	"The village sits in a sheltered spot near the center of the iceberg. When the wind blows—which is most of the time—snow whips off the surrounding drifts and surrounds the settlement in a swirling shroud of white.": "这个村子坐落在靠近冰山中心的一个避风点。当风吹来时--大部分时间都是如此--雪从周围的漂流物上拂过，将定居点包围在一片白色的漩涡中。",
	"Twenty structures make up the village, divided between snow-block shelters similar to igloos and double-walled yurts made from sealskin stretched over whalebone frames. Sixteen of these structures are small, one-room family dwellings. One ice-block shelter is a storeroom used for gear owned in common by the tribesfolk, including fishing nets and heavy ropes used for whaling. One yurt near the center of the village is slightly larger than the others, and is home to the Ice Hunter chieftain, Barking Seal. A yurt standing apart from the rest of the shelters is home to the shaman Bonecarver, as indicated by the many animal totems and whalebone carvings around the hut. The shaman's hut features a lesser-used entrance to the ice caves.": "该村有20座建筑，分为类似于冰屋的雪块棚和用海豹皮延伸到鲸骨框架上的双壁蒙古包。这些建筑中有16个是小型的、单间的家庭住宅。有一个冰块住所是一个储藏室，用来存放部落居民共同拥有的装备，包括捕鲸用的渔网和沉重的绳索。靠近村子中心的一个蒙古包比其他的稍大一些，是猎冰人首领巴金海豹的家。一个与其他住所分开的蒙古包是萨满Bonecarver的家，从小屋周围的许多动物图腾和鲸骨雕刻就可以看出。萨满的小屋有一个较少使用的冰洞入口。",
	"The largest structure in the village is the meeting hall, heavily decorated with whalebone and the skulls of fish and mammals. Consisting of one large room, the hall has a wooden floor made of planks salvaged from ships caught and crushed in the Sea of Moving Ice. Beneath the planks in a back corner is an entrance to the ice caves under the village, which lead to Arauthator's grotto. A long coil of rope hangs on the wall near that corner, and a large iron pulley has been left suspended from a beam above the hole.": "村里最大的建筑是会议厅，用鲸骨以及鱼和哺乳动物的头骨进行了大量的装饰。大厅由一个大房间组成，其木质地板是由在移动的冰海中被捕获和压碎的船只打捞上来的木板制成。在木板下面的一个角落里，有一个通往村子下面的冰洞的入口，它通向阿劳特的石窟。在那个角落附近的墙上挂着一卷长长的绳子，一个大铁滑轮被悬挂在洞口上方的横梁上。",
	"No columns of smoke rise above the village to give away its location, since the Sea of Moving Ice features no wood or peat to burn. The only artificial heat comes from lamps and tiny stoves burning whale oil. The villagers live on fish, whale meat, and seal meat, eaten raw or dried on racks scattered around the village. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Survival}) check, a character examining the racks realizes that the village must produce far more food than the number of villagers alone would require.": "由于移动的冰海没有木材或泥炭可供燃烧，所以村子上空没有烟柱，也不会泄露它的位置。唯一的人工热量来自于灯和燃烧鲸油的小炉子。村民们以鱼、鲸鱼肉和海豹肉为生，生吃或晒在散落在村庄周围的架子上。在成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查的情况下，检查架子的人物意识到，村子里生产的食物必须远远超过村民人数的需求。",
	"If the characters approach by the obvious path up the chasm from the ice ledge, they are noticed by the village's 12 sled dogs (treat as {@creature Wolf||wolves}). As soon as the dogs begin barking and growling, the whole village turns out armed and alert—25 {@creature Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors} (males and females; including the chieftain, Barking Seal), 30 {@creature Commoner||commoners}, 1 {@creature druid} (Bonecarver, tribal shaman, female), and 1 {@creature gladiator} (Orcaheart, village champion, male).": "如果角色从冰架上的明显路径接近鸿沟，他们会被村里的12只雪橇犬注意到（视为（%0%））。当狗开始吠叫和咆哮时，整个村子就会出现武装和警戒--25个（1%）（男性和女性；包括首领Barking Seal）、30个（2%）、1个（3%）（Bonecarver，部落萨满，女性）和1个（4%）（Orcaheart，村庄冠军，男性）。",
	"The chieftain and shaman do all the talking for the villagers, who speak only their own language, Uluik. The chieftain also knows a little of a rough Illuskan dialect. The Ice Hunters have two main interests: finding out why strangers have come to Oyaviggaton, and getting them to leave. They lie freely and well, telling tales of sea monsters and ravaging scrags in the area. If the characters ask about Arauthator or other dragons, the shaman claims a dragon known as Old White Death was killed a year ago by frost giants. She describes the heap of whale and seal bones on the waterside ice shelf as all that's left of the monster. Otherwise, the bones are described as evidence of monstrous predators in the area.": "酋长和萨满为村民们做所有的谈话，他们只说自己的语言--乌卢克语。酋长还懂一点粗略的伊鲁斯坎方言。猎冰人有两个主要兴趣：找出陌生人来到奥亚维格顿的原因，并让他们离开。他们自由自在地撒谎，讲述海怪和蹂躏该地区的擦伤的故事。如果角色们问起Arauthator或其他龙，萨满声称一条被称为老白死的龙在一年前被冰霜巨人杀死。她将水边冰架上的一堆鲸鱼和海豹的骨头描述为那个怪物的全部遗物。除此之外，这些骨头被描述为该地区怪物捕食者的证据。",
	"While Barking Seal and Bonecarver speak with the adventurers, the other members of the tribe circle around the party, frowning and muttering as the dogs growl. Eight warriors lope off with their weapons toward the icy staircase and the ice shelf below, where they keep a cautious eye on {@i Frostskimmr}. Wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks among the party attract scornful looks. Do your best to communicate an atmosphere of tense hostility to the players.": "当 \"吠叫海豹 \"和 \"波纳佛 \"与冒险者交谈时，部落的其他成员围着队伍转，在狗的咆哮声中皱着眉头，嘀咕着。八个战士拿着武器向冰冷的楼梯和下面的冰架蹒跚而去，他们在那里谨慎地注视着（%0%）。队伍中的魔法师、巫师和术士都吸引了鄙夷的目光。尽力向玩家传达一种紧张的敌对气氛。",
	"Any crew member accompanying the characters can point out that this behavior is highly unusual. Though the Ice Hunters avoid contact with outsiders, they are almost never hostile.": "任何陪同人物的船员都可以指出，这种行为是非常不寻常的。虽然猎冰人避免与外人接触，但他们几乎从不敌视。",
	"During this interaction, allow the characters to attempt DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks. A character who succeeds notices several villagers slipping away one by one and disappearing into the meeting hall. From the hall, the villagers descend into the ice caves to warn Arauthator's servants that strangers have come, then quickly slip back up to the surface.": "在这个互动过程中，允许角色尝试DC20智慧（（%0%））检查。成功的角色注意到几个村民一个接一个地溜走，消失在会议厅里。从大厅里，村民们下到冰洞里，警告Arauthator的仆人有陌生人前来，然后迅速溜回地面。",
	"Encounters in the ice caves assume that the presence of intruders on the iceberg is already known. If the party has maintained stealth since they arrived, they have a chance to surprise creatures in the ice caves.": "在冰洞中的遭遇假定已经知道冰山上有入侵者的存在。如果队伍在抵达后一直保持隐身状态，他们就有机会让冰洞中的生物感到惊讶。",
	"The Ice Hunters are determined not to allow the strangers inside the village hall, where they might discover the entrance to the ice caves. They know that letting powerful adventurers get past them into the dragon's lair means torture or death for every adult and child of the tribe.": "猎冰人决心不允许陌生人进入村庄大厅，因为他们可能会在那里发现冰洞的入口。他们知道，让强大的冒险者越过他们进入龙的巢穴，意味着对部落的每一个成人和儿童都是折磨或死亡。",
	"As they stall for time, Barking Seal, Bonecarver, and Orcaheart are also sizing up the adventurers' strength. If the characters refuse to leave the iceberg, Barking Seal proposes a contest: the village's champion against any warrior among the strangers. If the champion wins, the characters must hand over some of their fine steel weapons and sail away immediately, never to return. If the adventurer wins, the strangers will have earned their place among the villagers. They can spend the night in the village, after which Bonecarver will answer their questions to the best of her ability.": "在拖延时间的同时，Barking Seal、Bonecarver和Orcaheart也在衡量冒险家们的实力。如果角色们拒绝离开冰山，Barking Seal提议进行一场比赛：村里的冠军对阵陌生人中的任何一个战士。如果冠军赢了，人物必须交出他们的一些精钢武器，并立即驶离，不再回来。如果冒险家赢了，陌生人就会在村民中赢得自己的地位。他们可以在村子里过夜，之后波纳弗会尽其所能回答他们的问题。",
	"If the characters agree to the duel, one of them must fight Orcaheart one-on-one. No magic is allowed, but if the character possesses a magic weapon or magic armor with no obvious effects, the villagers are unlikely to notice. The fight continues until one contestant is {@condition unconscious} and dying. (Allow Orcaheart to make death saving throws if he drops to 0 hit points.) At that point, the match ends and each combatant's allies can step in to provide healing and assistance.": "如果角色同意决斗，他们中的一个必须与奥卡心一对一地战斗。不允许使用魔法，但如果角色拥有一件没有明显效果的魔法武器或魔法盔甲，村民们不太可能注意到。战斗继续进行，直到有一个参赛者{@condition unconscious}并死亡。(如果Orcaheart的命中率降到0，允许他进行死亡拯救。)在这一点上，比赛结束，每个战斗人员的盟友可以介入提供治疗和援助。",
	"During the fight, a combatant forfeits if he or she gains assistance of any kind from allies. Despite this, however, Bonecarver aids Orcaheart during the fight if she can. She positions herself so that when he is struck, he can fall backward and land in front of her. When she helps him back onto his feet, she surreptitiously casts {@spell cure wounds}. If a player states specifically that a character is watching the crowd for signs of interference, that character can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Success means that Bonecarver was spotted in the act, though she denies providing assistance if accused of cheating.": "在战斗中，如果战斗者从盟友那里获得任何形式的援助，那么他或她就会放弃。然而，尽管如此，波纳弗在战斗中还是尽可能地帮助奥卡心。她摆好姿势，当他被击中时，他可以向后倒下，落在她面前。当她帮助他重新站起来的时候，她偷偷地施放了（%0%）。如果有玩家特别说明某个角色正在观察人群中的干扰迹象，该角色可以尝试进行DC15智慧（（%1%））检查。成功意味着博纳弗的行为被发现了，尽管如果被指控作弊，她会否认提供帮助。",
	"If Orcaheart loses the match, the Ice Hunters go through the motions of honoring their pledge. They offer to let the characters sleep in the village storage hut, which barely qualifies as shelter. Bonecarver brings them a platter of slightly spoiled raw fish, explaining (truthfully) that her people prefer the tanginess of meat that's gone past its prime. The fish won't hurt characters who eat it—but the poison Bonecarver added to it will. The sharp tang of the fish covers the bitter poison so well that a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check is needed to detect it.": "如果Orcaheart输掉了比赛，猎冰人就会去履行他们的承诺。他们提出让这些人物睡在村里的储藏室里，这几乎不能算作住所。博纳弗给他们带来了一盘略微变质的生鱼，解释说（如实）她的族人更喜欢已经过了黄金期的肉的味道。这条鱼不会伤害吃它的人，但博纳卡弗在里面添加的毒药会伤害他们。鱼的尖锐味道很好地掩盖了苦涩的毒药，需要成功地进行DC20智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查或DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查才能发现它。",
	"Any character who eats the poisoned fish must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character takes 13 ({@dice 3d8}) poison damage and becomes {@condition unconscious} for 8 hours. On a successful save, the character takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage. If all the characters are rendered {@condition unconscious} by the poison, they are tied up and carried down to area 1 in the ice caves, where they awaken to see 5 {@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads} (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}) examining their belongings.": "任何吃了毒鱼的角色都必须做一个DC15的宪法救赎动作。失败意味着该角色会受到13({@dice 3d8})的中毒伤害，并在8小时内变成{@condition unconscious}。救赎成功时，角色会受到9({@dice 2d8})的中毒伤害。如果所有的角色都被毒药弄得{@condition unconscious}，他们就会被捆绑起来，并被带到冰洞的1号区域，在那里他们会醒来看到5个{@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads}（见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}）在检查他们的物品。",
	"Of all the Ice Hunters, Bonecarver is the only one whose favor the characters have any chance of winning. She does not initially trust the adventurers, and is as keen to see them depart Oyaviggaton as the rest of her people. However, she knows that the Ice Hunters will eventually perish under Arauthator's wrath, and she has long dreamed that the totem spirits will send heroes with the strength to best the dragon.": "在所有的猎冰人中，博纳卡弗是唯一一个人物有机会赢得其青睐的人。她一开始并不信任这些冒险者，并且和其他的人一样热衷于看到他们离开奥雅维格顿。然而，她知道猎冰者最终会在阿劳特的愤怒下灭亡，而且她长期以来一直梦想图腾之灵会派出有实力的英雄来打败龙。",
	"With effective roleplaying and a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, Bonecarver will meet privately with the adventurers and speak the truth of her people's plight. A druid, ranger, or some other character who can truthfully express an understanding of the shaman's animal totem-based faith has advantage on this check. Bonecarver is not willing to risk the lives of her tribesfolk in a battle against the dragon.

	"Beneath the village lies a network of ice caves inhabited by Arauthator and his minions. Two entrances lead into the caves from the village: one hidden inside the meeting hall and the other inside the shaman's hut.

	"Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon's many treasures and trophies. The ice toads are good at this job, thanks to their exceptionally intelligent leader, {@creature Marfulb|RoT}.": "Arauthator吸引了许多冰蟾蜍来到奥亚维加顿，它们帮助维护冰山和龙的许多宝藏和战利品。冰蟾蜍很擅长这项工作，这要归功于他们异常聪明的领袖，（%0%）。",
	"Feeding on seals, sea birds, and fish caught for them by the Ice Hunters, Oyaviggaton's ice toads are not automatically hostile to strangers. Once characters get inside Arauthator's lair, they might find that these creatures can be helpful to their quest. Ice toads normally speak only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Draconic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick and their pronunciation atrocious. {@creature Marfulb|RoT} is fluent in Draconic thanks to many hours spent conversing with Arauthator.": "奥亚维加顿的冰蟾蜍以海豹、海鸟和猎冰人为食，对陌生人不会自动产生敌意。一旦人物进入阿劳特的巢穴，他们可能会发现这些生物会对他们的探索有所帮助。冰蟾蜍通常只说自己的晦涩语言。Oyaviggaton的人知道一点Draconic和Uluik（冰雪猎人的语言），但他们的口音很重，发音很难听。{@creature Marfulb|RoT}由于与Arauthator交谈了很多时间，所以能说一口流利的Draconic语。",
	"When the characters encounter ice toads, their intelligence won't be apparent until they act or attempt to speak. Even then, characters might not recognize the ice toads' croaking as language. Ice toads move on all fours, but their webbed front feet are surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.": "当人物遇到冰蟾蜍时，他们的智力不会被发现，直到他们采取行动或试图说话。即使如此，角色们也未必能认出冰蟾的呱呱叫声是语言。冰蟾以四肢移动，但它们有蹼的前脚却出奇的灵巧。有些冰蟾将工具和有用的物品放在脖子上的袋子里。",

	"The floors inside the iceberg are worn glass-smooth from decades of traffic. Arauthator, the ice trolls, and the ice toads move across the slick ice with ease thanks to claws and bony spurs on their feet that give them traction.

The cloak is fastened with a silver-and-ivory brooch bearing a design reminiscent of a stylized, branching tree—the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Two kobold attendants stand nearby, glancing nervously between you and the tiefling. After a few moments, the tiefling looks up with an expression of pale disinterest and asks, \"Have you come to save me or kill me?

	"When Maccath arrived at Oyaviggaton three years ago, Arauthator would normally have killed her without a second thought. However, the brooch of the Arcane Brotherhood she wore suggested to Arauthator that the tiefling might present a solution to two problems. First, the dragon possessed numerous items stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood, some of which defied his understanding even after decades of study. Second, Arauthator had long sought to help his mate Arveiaturace overcome her grief over the death of the wizard she once served. Replacing that wizard with a member of the Arcane Brotherhood seemed a perfect solution.": "三年前，当马卡斯来到奥亚维加顿时，Arauthator通常会不假思索地杀死她。然而，她佩戴的奥术兄弟会的胸针向Arauthator建议，这个铁皮人可能是两个问题的解决方案。首先，这条龙拥有许多从奥术兄弟会那里偷来的物品，其中一些物品即使经过几十年的研究也让他无法理解。第二，Arauthator长期以来一直试图帮助他的伴侣Arveiaturace克服她对她曾经服务的巫师的死亡的悲痛。用一个奥术兄弟会的成员取代那个巫师似乎是一个完美的解决方案。",
	"Maccath was smart enough to convince the dragon that his offer had won her over, expecting that she would eventually be able to seek a means of escape from the iceberg. However, she has so far been thwarted by Arauthator's potent magic—including spells and rituals stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood—which have kept her sealed and helpless in Oyaviggaton, invisible to scrying and unable to use {@spell sending} to call for help. Before he turns Maccath over to Arveiaturace, Arauthator has had the tiefling deciphering his stolen writings, though the work has gone slowly thanks to the inherent complexity and danger of the material. Maccath is studying one of the stolen scrolls when the characters walk in.": "马卡斯很聪明，他说服了龙，他的提议赢得了她，期望她最终能够寻求一种逃离冰山的方法。然而，到目前为止，她一直被阿罗伊特的强大魔法--包括从奥术兄弟会偷来的咒语和仪式--所挫败，这些魔法使她被封印在奥亚维加顿而无能为力，对窥探术不可见，也无法使用（%0%）来呼救。在他把马卡思交给阿尔维雅图拉斯之前，阿罗伊特让这个盗贼破译他偷来的文字，尽管由于这些材料本身的复杂性和危险性，这项工作进展缓慢。当这些人物走进来时，马卡斯正在研究其中一份被盗的卷轴。",
	"If the characters announced their presence by fighting the {@creature ice troll|RoT}, the 2 {@creature Kobold||kobolds} will be visibly agitated, even though Maccath shows little concern. The kobolds have been directed to stay with the tiefling and follow her orders, which mostly means undertaking errands to the scriptorium (area 11).

The trolls might flee without a word, or they might decide they like Oyaviggaton and make it their permanent home.": "{@b If Arauthator is killed}，冰蟾蜍很悲伤，但它们不会对角色采取任何行动。与此相反，哥布林因悲痛而暴怒，以狂热的、自杀式的攻击方式向角色投掷。冰巨魔的反应可能会受到角色们之前与他们的互动的影响。巨魔可能一言不发地逃走，也可能决定喜欢奥亚维加顿并把它作为自己的永久家园。",
	"The Ice Hunters are elated over the dragon's death. When the characters emerge from the iceberg, the normally reserved villagers greet them with cheers and offers of the choicest fermented fish. The villagers then begin packing their few belongings into their hide boats and prepare to leave immediately.": "猎冰人对龙的死亡感到欣喜。当这些人物从冰山中走出来时，平时矜持的村民们欢呼着迎接他们，并提供了最美味的发酵鱼。然后，村民们开始把他们为数不多的财物装进他们的皮船，准备立即离开。",
	"{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath or {@creature Marfulb|RoT} know enough of the dragon to predict that he will spend months recovering at one of his other lairs before returning to Oyaviggaton. The Ice Hunters believe that this gives them enough time to lose themselves in the vast expanse of the Sea of Moving Ice and find a new home where Arauthator can't track them. The dragon is vengeful, but with everything else going on, Maccath believes Arauthator won't put any real effort into seeking out his former thralls. The Ice Hunters have no contact with civilization, so they can't possibly spread word of his humiliating defeat.": "{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath或{@creature Marfulb|RoT}对龙的了解足以预测他在返回奥亚维加顿之前会在他的一个其他巢穴中度过几个月的恢复期。猎冰人认为，这使他们有足够的时间在广袤的移动冰海中迷失自我，并在阿罗伊特无法追踪他们的地方找到一个新家。这条龙是报复性的，但由于发生了其他事情，马卡斯相信阿劳特不会花任何真正的精力去寻找他以前的王族。猎冰者与文明社会没有联系，所以他们不可能传播他的耻辱性失败的消息。",
	"With the dragon's disappearance, the kobolds hide if they can, while the ice toads demonstrate the same impassive stoicism they show if the dragon is killed. The ice trolls shy away from Arauthator's treasure as long as he is alive, knowing better than to come between a dragon and its hoard. They don't really care if someone else plunders items from the dragon's hoard, and they're too stupid to think they might be blamed for any such thefts.": "随着龙的消失，哥布林们尽可能地躲藏起来，而冰蟾蜍则表现出与龙被杀时一样的无动于衷。只要Arauthator还活着，冰巨魔就对他的财宝敬而远之，因为他们知道最好不要在龙和它的囤积物之间来回穿梭。他们并不关心是否有其他人从龙的囤积物中掠夺物品，而且他们太愚蠢了，认为自己可能会因为任何此类盗窃而受到指责。",
	"The characters have no chance to sail away from the iceberg aboard {@i Frostskimmr} while Arauthator is free to attack. The dragon can strike just as easily from the sky or from beneath the water, freezing or capsizing the ship, then picking off the crew at his leisure. If the adventurers try to sneak away with Maccath, the sorcerer's absence is noticed by the kobolds and ice toads within a day.": "当Arauthator可以自由攻击时，人物没有机会从冰山上驶离（%0%）。这条龙可以很容易地从天上或水底发动攻击，冻结或击沉船只，然后在他的闲暇时挑走船员。如果冒险者试图带着马卡思溜走，巫师的缺席在一天之内就会被哥布林和冰蟾蜍发现。",
	"If Arauthator was beaten in combat and forced to retreat, he will not pursue {@i Frostskimmr} as the characters sail away. The adventurers and the crew might see the dragon shadowing them in the far distance, but Arauthator is too proud and fearful to face the party again.": "如果Arauthator在战斗中被击败并被迫撤退，那么当人物扬长而去时，他将不会追击（%0%）。冒险者和船员们可能会看到龙在远处的影子，但Arauthator太过骄傲和恐惧，不敢再面对队伍。",
	"If Old White Death is killed or driven away, he leaves his iceberg lair's treasure hoard behind. (Because Oyaviggaton is just one of a number of minor lairs maintained by the dragon, the treasure here represents only the smallest part of his total wealth.)": "如果老白死被杀或被赶走，他就会把他的冰山巢穴的财宝囤积起来。(因为奥亚维加顿只是巨龙维护的若干小巢穴之一，这里的宝藏只代表他总财富的最小部分)。",
	"Areas 19 and 20 contain a total of 700 gp, 1,000 sp, and 20 precious stones (five each worth 200 gp, 400 gp, 600 gp, and 800 gp). In addition, add potions, scrolls, and magic items at your discretion. Alternatively, use the {@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to generate a hoard whose value is in line with your campaign.": "19区和20区共有700金币、1,000英镑和20块宝石（每块宝石价值200金币、400金币、600金币和800金币）。此外，可酌情添加药水、卷轴和魔法物品。或者，使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}来生成一个价值与你的活动相一致的囤积物。",
	"To claim this treasure, it must be hacked out of the ice in the lair cavern. Doing so takes half a day (and is thus impossible if Arauthator is still in the lair).": "要想得到这个宝藏，必须把它从巢穴的冰层中砍出来。这样做需要半天时间（因此，如果阿劳特还在巢穴中，就不可能做到）。",
	"{@creature Marfulb|RoT}'s four decades of data on Arauthator is priceless to the Arcane Brotherhood (a fact Maccath will recognize if the characters don't) or to other collectors of draconic lore. If the dragon is dead, {@creature Marfulb|RoT} can be talked into letting this material be transported south, provided she gets to come along. If Arauthator still lives, the ice toad would prefer to stay and continue her work with her records intact.": "{@creature Marfulb|RoT}四十年来关于Arauthator的资料对奥术兄弟会来说是无价之宝（如果角色不认识，Maccath会认识到这一点），对其他龙族传说的收集者来说也是如此。如果龙已经死了，{@creature Marfulb|RoT}可以被说服让这些材料被运往南方，只要她能一起去。如果Arauthator还活着，冰蟾更愿意留下来继续她的工作，并保留她的记录。",
	"Arauthator is a strong ally of the Cult of the Dragon, and the adventurers deal a solid blow to the cult by defeating him. Additionally, by returning Maccath and the stolen lore of the Hosttower, the characters can earn the allegiance of the Arcane Brotherhood in the fight against the cult's plans.": "Arauthator是神龙教的强大盟友，冒险者们通过击败他给神龙教带来了沉重的打击。此外，通过归还马卡思和被盗的主塔传说，人物可以在对抗邪教计划的斗争中赢得奥术兄弟会的效忠。",

	"This section comprises two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, the characters track {@creature Varram|RoT}, keeper of the {@item White Dragon Mask|RoTOS}, to an ancient crypt overrun by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills. In the second chapter, the adventurers go up against {@creature Neronvain|RoT}, wyrmspeaker of the {@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS}, in a hidden stronghold and dragon lair in the Misty Forest. These chapters play out at different points during the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, but are presented together because they form two halves of a single mission—taking the fight to the wyrmspeakers as a means of thwarting {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plots.": "本节包括两个不同的章节。在第一章中，人物追踪{@item White Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的守卫者{@creature Varram|RoT}，来到蛇山中被元帝占领的古老墓穴。在第二章中，冒险者在迷雾森林的一个隐藏据点和龙穴中与{@creature Neronvain|RoT}，{@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的巫师对话。这些章节在水底议会的第一和第二届会议期间的不同时间点上进行，但由于它们构成了一个任务的两个部分--向巫术师作战，作为挫败{@creature Severin|RoT}阴谋的一种手段，所以被一起介绍。",

	"If the yuan-ti have no idea why the characters have attacked, the priestess knows only that {@creature Varram|RoT} has been begging for his life by promising the yuan-ti great wealth if he is freed.

She is willing to turn over the dwarf, but explains that his soul has been temporarily drawn from his body by powerful yuan-ti magic. When the characters have left the enclave, it will be returned.

Both Prince Alagarthas and Delaan Winterhound of the Emerald Enclave believe that more attacks are imminent, and that the green dragon's master might be one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. But what neither realize is that the Green Wyrmspeaker is actually Alagarthas's own half-brother {@creature Neronvain|RoT}—the disgraced second son of King Melandrach, exiled by his people and long thought dead. They now seek the adventurers' help to find this dragon master.": "在国王Melandrach的指挥下，迷雾森林的精灵们加强了防御，邪教的攻击已经停止了。梅兰德斯认为威胁已经结束，尽管他的儿子阿拉加索不同意。Alagarthas王子利用翡翠飞地寻找袭击来源的线索，他们已经了解到，一个与绿龙一起出现的精灵似乎在指挥这只野兽。Alagarthas王子和翡翠飞地的Delaan Winterhound都认为，更多的袭击即将发生，而绿龙的主人可能是邪教的巫师之一。但他们都没有意识到，绿龙的主人其实是阿拉加斯同父异母的弟弟（%0%）--被他的人民流放并长期被认为已经死亡的梅兰德斯国王的次子。他们现在寻求冒险者的帮助来找到这位龙的主人。",
	"Delaan Winterhound comes to the adventurers during the Council of Waterdeep or while they are returning to the city after completing another chapter. He speaks of the draconic incursions in the Misty Forest mentioned at the council, and says that the Emerald Enclave's agents have been working with the support of Prince Alagarthas to prevent a new round of attacks. With his agents already scattered throughout the Misty Forest, he wants the adventurers to travel to one of the few dragon-raided settlements left standing in the aftermath—a village called Altand.

	"This chapter takes place within the Misty Forest—a vast woodland concealed by thick mist and rain. Enormous spruce trees dominate the northern end of the forest where Altand is found—and where {@creature Neronvain|RoT} and Chuth have established their stronghold.

	"Altand is primarily a wood elf settlement, blending almost seamlessly into the forest around it. The village exists on two levels, with a few structures built on the ground around an ancient monument to an elven ranger. Residences and the village temple are built into the upper boughs of the forest. The elves string rope bridges between these sites and construct circular walkways around the trees.": "阿尔坦德主要是一个木精灵定居点，几乎与周围的森林融为一体。村庄分两层，一些建筑建在地面上，围绕着一个古老的精灵游侠纪念碑。住宅和村里的神庙则建在森林的上部枝桠上。精灵们在这些地方之间架设绳索桥，并在树周围建造环形人行道。",
	"Like many other settlements raided by the dragon, pulley-operated platforms connect the two levels of the village, and provide an excellent defense against the orcs that occasionally enter the forest as an alternative to raiding human settlements along the Trade Way. However, those defenses proved a deathtrap against the flying green dragon, leaving many elves unable to reach the ground quickly enough to escape.": "像许多其他被龙袭击的定居点一样，滑轮式平台连接着村子的两层，对偶尔进入森林的兽人提供了很好的防御，而兽人则是沿着贸易之路袭击人类定居点的替代方案。然而，这些防御措施被证明是对付飞翔的绿龙的死亡陷阱，使许多精灵无法迅速到达地面以逃脱。",
	"Of the three hundred residents of the village, more than half survived the raid—a different outcome than at other raided settlements, where the dragon hunted and killed the elves to the last adult and child. Many of the residents of Altand were on the ground when the attack came. Of the elves in the upper level of the village, many died of the dragon's poisonous breath while waiting to descend, or fell to their deaths as bridges and walkways collapsed under the weight of panic.": "在村里的三百名居民中，有一半以上的人在突袭中幸存下来--这与其他被突袭的定居点的结果不同，在那里，巨龙把精灵们猎杀到最后一个成人和儿童。攻击来临时，阿尔坦德的许多居民都在地面上。在村子上层的精灵中，许多人在等待下山时死于龙的毒气，或者在恐慌的重压下因桥梁和走道坍塌而摔死。",
	"Most survivors fled and saw little of what ensued. However, by asking careful questions of a number of villagers, the characters can learn the following:": "大多数幸存者都逃走了，几乎没有看到随后发生的事情。然而，通过仔细询问一些村民，人物可以了解到以下情况。",
	"The dragon swooped down and attacked on the ground first. Nearly half of the village's victims died during that first assault.": "这条龙俯冲下来，首先攻击地面。村里近一半的受害者在第一次攻击中死亡。",
	"Humans in the regalia of the Cult of the Dragon followed the dragon, killing all those they found. The village's priest stepped out to lead others in fighting the dragon, but the beast swallowed him whole.": "穿着神龙教服饰的人类追随巨龙，杀死所有他们发现的人。村里的牧师站出来带领其他人与龙战斗，但那只野兽把他整个吞了下去。",
	"Some survivors claim to have seen a cultist riding atop the dragon. Most of those refer to the dragon rider as human, like the other cultists. However, a few people report that the figure moved with the grace of an elf.": "一些幸存者声称看到一个邪教人员骑在龙的上面。大多数人称骑龙者为人类，就像其他邪教人员一样。然而，有几个人报告说，这个身影的动作像精灵一样优雅。",
	"With the priest dead, the village's warden, Galin, has become the leader of Altand. Though he was in the thick of the fight, he survived unscathed, and has been a potent force for rallying the survivors.": "随着牧师的死亡，村里的典狱长加林成了阿尔坦德的领袖。虽然他身处战斗之中，但他毫发无损，并且一直是团结幸存者的强大力量。",
	"The attack lasted only a short while, then the dragon unexpectedly retreated. The cultists followed, but as they fled, they took nothing of value from the village. This is a stark contrast to the dragon's other raids, which were focused on capturing treasure.": "攻击只持续了一小会儿，然后龙意外地撤退了。邪教徒们紧随其后，但在逃离时，他们没有从村子里带走任何有价值的东西。这与龙的其他突袭形成了鲜明的对比，这些突袭的重点是夺取财宝。",
	"Galin the warden is a nervous-looking elf with a dark secret. The folk of the village describe him as suffering from the weight of his new leadership role and the deaths of more than a hundred villagers—including his own wife.": "典狱长加林是一个看起来很紧张的精灵，有一个黑暗的秘密。村里的人说他被新的领导角色和一百多个村民的死亡（包括他自己的妻子）所困扰。",
	"In response to any question about Galin, the characters are directed to his residence in the upper boughs of the village.": "在回答关于加林的任何问题时，人物都被引导到他在村子上层树桠的住所。",
	"Stepping into a modest dwelling suspended among iron-strong boughs, you enter a cozy sitting room.

	"Galin answers any questions the characters put to him, but his responses echo only what the other survivors know. He claims to have not seen the dragon rider and disbelieves those who say they did, dismissing such reports as the result of fear and chaos during the raid. A successful DC 18 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that the elf warden is withholding information. If he is pressed on this, he admits that he saw the dragon kill his wife and is wracked by guilt that he could not save her. A follow-up successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that even this isn't the whole truth, but Galin takes umbrage if the character ply him with any more questions.": "加林回答了人物向他提出的任何问题，但他的回答只回应了其他幸存者知道的情况。他声称没有看到龙骑士，并且不相信那些说他们看到了的人，认为这些报告是突袭中的恐惧和混乱造成的。成功通过DC18智慧({@skill Insight})检查，可以发现精灵典狱长在隐瞒信息。如果他被问及此事，他承认他看到龙杀死了他的妻子，并且因为没能救她而感到内疚。后续成功的DC16智慧检查显示，即使这不是全部的事实，但如果人物再向他提问，加林就会感到不满。",
	"Where the humanoid witnesses to the attack are limited in their knowledge, the characters have other potential resources to draw on. By using {@spell speak with plants}, the characters can draw on the impressions and memories of the trees themselves. Though the spell allows only for impressions of the previous 24 hours to be recalled by its subjects, the trees of Altand can report that late the previous night, they witnessed Galin sneaking out of the village and disappearing into the woods, accompanied by his pet raven. Galin has been making this sojourn most nights since the attack, giving {@creature Neronvain|RoT} information on other elven settlements, which the wyrmspeaker is using to plan his next round of assaults.": "袭击事件的人形目击者的知识有限，而人物则有其他潜在的资源可以利用。通过使用（%0%），角色可以利用树木本身的印象和记忆。虽然这个法术只允许其对象回忆起前24小时的印象，但阿尔坦德的树木可以报告说，前一天深夜，它们目睹了加林偷偷溜出村庄，消失在树林里，旁边还有他的宠物乌鸦。加林在袭击发生后的大多数晚上都会进行这样的旅行，提供其他精灵定居点的信息，而巫师正利用这些信息来计划他的下一轮袭击。",
	"If the characters use {@spell speak with animals} to question the raven, they learn that Galin walked a mile or more into the woods and came face to face with the green dragon Chuth and his rider the previous night. Remember that an animal intelligence is not as articulate as a humanoid, and it might take subtle coaxing to get the raven to describe a scene that likely frightened it.": "如果角色使用{@spell speak with animals}来询问乌鸦，他们会了解到加林在森林里走了一英里或更远，并在前一天晚上与绿龙楚斯和他的骑手面对面。记住，动物的智慧不像人那样善于表达，可能需要巧妙的哄骗才能让乌鸦描述出可能吓到它的场景。",
	"The characters might also choose to watch and follow Galin on one of his late night excursions. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} does not show up that night, but the warden's prearranged meeting place is a spot of flattened brush where a dragon has clearly landed more than once.": "人物也可以选择观察和跟踪加林的一次深夜出游。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}当晚没有出现，但典狱长预先安排的会面地点是一处被压扁的灌木丛，显然龙已经在那里降落了不止一次。",
	"If confronted with evidence against him, Galin accuses the adventurers (publicly if necessary) of being in league with the cult and attempting to break the resolve of Altand's survivors. If the characters have access to {@spell zone of truth} or similar magic, he flatly refuses to take part in any further questioning.": "如果面对对他不利的证据，加林会指责冒险者（必要时公开指责）与邪教勾结，试图破坏阿尔坦德幸存者的决心。如果人物能够使用（%0%）或类似的魔法，他就会断然拒绝参与任何进一步的询问。",
	"Galin will not respond to intimidation. However, effective roleplaying can be used to tap into his guilt. If he is offered commiseration for his wife's death—as opposed to accusations—the warden eventually breaks down. He confesses that after seeing his wife killed, he found himself face to face with {@creature Neronvain|RoT} in the thick of battle and begged for his life, offering anything in return. {@creature Neronvain|RoT} took the warden up on his offer, agreeing to spare Galin and leave Altand intact in exchange for information on other settlements that would become the targets of the cult's next round of raids.": "加林不会对恐吓做出反应。然而，可以利用有效的角色扮演来挖掘他的内疚感。如果有人对他妻子的死表示同情--而不是指责，监狱长最终会崩溃。他承认在看到他的妻子被杀后，他发现自己在激烈的战斗中与{@creature Neronvain|RoT}面对面，并乞求他的生命，提供任何回报。{@creature Neronvain|RoT}接受了典狱长的提议，同意放过加林，让阿尔坦德完好无损，以换取其他定居点的信息，这些定居点将成为邪教下一轮袭击的目标。",

If they investigate, they see a venerable woman with her leg trapped under a heavy fallen tree. She calls out for help when she sees the party. This {@creature druid} is the caretaker of this part of the forest.": "当人物在森林中旅行时，他们听到了一棵大树断裂的脆响，接着是一个女声的哭喊。如果他们进行调查，就会看到一个可敬的女人，她的腿被困于一棵倒下的大树下。当她看到这群人时，她大声呼救。这个人（%0%）是森林这块地方的看守人。",
	"Three {@creature Awakened Tree||awakened trees} are hidden among the other trees nearby—one of which has intentionally and harmlessly fallen across the druid, allowing her to feign injury and draw the characters to her.

Two other trees standing nearby shift back along the ground as the elf stands and smiles, showing no sign of injury.": "你们花了所有的力气来抬起这棵树，知道如果这棵树向你们倾斜，你们就会把自己置于危险之中。但是，即使在你接近释放这个女人的时候，这棵树开始自己上升。站在附近的另外两棵树沿着地面向后移，因为精灵站着并微笑着，没有受伤的迹象。",

She lays a garland around each of your necks, then suddenly transforms into an owl. Her awakened tree servants stomp after her into the forest.": "这个女人从她的头发上摘下你发誓刚才还没有的花朵，然后像变魔术一样用手指把它们编成花环。她在你们每个人的脖子上挂了一个花环，然后突然变身为猫头鹰。她那被唤醒的树上的仆人在她身后跺着脚进入森林。",
	"As long as the characters wear these garlands, they are {@condition invisible} to Chuth's animal spies (part of the magic imbued into the area around the dragon's lair) as they approach {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s stronghold. In addition, the first time a character wearing a garland is confronted by Chuth, he or she feels a stirring warmth from the garland and automatically succeeds on the saving throw against the dragon's Frightful Presence.": "只要角色戴着这些花环，当他们接近{@creature Neronvain|RoT}龙的据点时，对楚斯的动物间谍来说，他们就是{@condition invisible}的动物间谍（龙的巢穴周围被灌输的魔法的一部分）。此外，戴着花环的角色第一次面对楚斯时，会感受到花环带来的刺激性温暖，并自动成功抵御龙的可怕存在。",
	"If the characters ignore the druid, she calls out pitifully for help as they move away, offering a last lament against their cowardice as they disappear. If the adventurers attack the druid, the awakened trees attack. They fight to the death as the druid turns into an owl and flies away.": "如果角色无视德鲁伊，她会在他们离开时可怜地呼救，在他们消失时对他们的懦弱发出最后的哀叹。如果冒险者攻击德鲁伊，被唤醒的树木就会攻击。当德鲁伊变成猫头鹰飞走时，他们就会拼命地战斗。",
	"A quarter of a mile from Chuth's lair, thin strands of spiderweb begin to be seen, hanging nearly invisible in the misty air. The webs mark the overlap between the dragon's lair and the hunting grounds of a brood of spiders. The webbing combines with the dense mist of the forest to make the area around the lair heavily obscured and {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, up to when the party reaches the pool (area 1). Because the webs are moist, they do not burn away easily. The direct application of fire destroys webs, but fire doesn't spread among them.

	"Removing Chuth and {@creature Neronvain|RoT} from the stronghold for an initial foray allows the characters to explore and eliminate the guards without the pressure of an imminent dragon attack.

	"A steep slope descends from the cave behind the waterfall to the entrance to area 2, its surface slick from billowing mist. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check or a DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to climb or crawl down the slope. Failure indicates that the character tumbles 40 feet down the slope, taking 9 ({@dice 2d8}) bludgeoning damage. Characters using a rope to descend the slope can do so safely.": "一个陡峭的斜坡从瀑布后面的山洞下到2号区域的入口处，其表面因波涛汹涌的雾气而变得滑腻。角色必须通过DC12灵巧（（%0%））检查或DC12力量（（%1%））检查才能爬下斜坡。失败表示角色会从斜坡上翻滚40英尺，受到9({@dice 2d8})的重击伤害。使用绳子下坡的角色可以安全地完成。",

	"Chuth uses his {@sense blindsight} to detect when the characters are approaching the entrance to the cave. He then dives through the waterfall, soaring above the characters as he uses his Poison Breath, attacking with surprise if no one in the party noticed him. Characters not wearing the garlands are also exposed to the dragon's Frightful Presence. Characters who fail their saving throws against Frightful Presence likely flee back into the woods, where spiders might be waiting. On the dragon's next turn, it retreats back to area 2 to await the heroes' next move.": "丘特用他的{@sense blindsight}探测到人物接近洞口的时候。然后他潜入瀑布，在使用他的毒气时翱翔于人物之上，如果队伍中没有人注意到他，他就会出其不意地攻击。没有佩戴花环的角色也会被暴露在龙的恐怖存在之下。对惊恐的存在判断失败的角色可能会逃回树林里，那里可能有蜘蛛在等着。在龙的下一个回合，它退回到2区，等待英雄们的下一步行动。",

They are expecting more cultists to arrive at the lair, and savvy characters might be able to bluff or roleplay past them.

	"If the characters were attacked by {@creature Adult Green Dragon||Chuth} at the pool, the dragon clings to the ceiling in this area, using his breath weapon on the characters as soon as they enter the caves.

Chuth refrains from using his breath weapon if doing so might hurt or hinder his allies.": "如果人物在水池边受到（%0%）的攻击，龙就会在这个区域的天花板上附着，当人物进入洞穴时，就会对他们使用他的呼吸武器。然后他向队伍撞去，用他的近战攻击专注于精灵而不是其他人类。如果使用他的呼吸武器可能会伤害或妨碍他的盟友，楚斯就不会这样做。",

	"If the characters kill or incapacitate all of {@creature Neronvain|RoT} and Chuth's servants, the dragon hides in the pool and emerges each time his breath weapon recharges. While hiding in the water, the dragon is heavily obscured.Chuth is amphibious and can use any of his attacks underwater, as well as his lair actions. Characters swimming through the underwater passage might be suddenly restrained by underwater vines, making them easy targets for the dragon's breath weapon, or putting them at risk of drowning if they cannot free themselves.": "如果角色们杀死了{@creature Neronvain|RoT}和楚斯的所有仆人或使其丧失能力，龙就会躲在池子里，每次他的呼吸武器充能时就会出现。躲在水中时，龙会被严重遮蔽。楚斯是水陆两栖的，可以在水下使用他的任何攻击，以及他的巢穴行动。游过水下通道的角色可能会突然被水下的藤蔓束缚住，使他们很容易成为龙的呼吸武器的目标，或者使他们在无法挣脱时有被淹死的危险。",

	"The elves are terrified of Chuth, and the cunning dragon has convinced them that he will free them in time if they are loyal.

The dragon is unlikely to enter the inn building, opting to use its breath weapon through the windows or attacking any characters or bystanders who step outside.": "如果角色们住在旅馆里，邪教分子可能会选择直接攻击，从前门冲进去。一种更隐蔽的方法是，他们每次进入旅店时，先伪装成顾客，然后在人物人数较少且被包围时进行攻击。龙不太可能进入客栈的建筑，它会选择通过窗户使用它的呼吸武器，或者攻击任何走出去的人物或旁观者。",
	"As the characters are traveling, the cultists can get ahead of them and lay an ambush. Alternatively, cultists might follow the party at a distance by day, then move closer when the characters stop to rest for the night. A surprise attack in the dark or at dawn is particularly dangerous, granting the dragon complete freedom of movement and creating the possibility that some party members will be asleep or unarmored.": "当人物在旅行时，邪教分子可以走在他们前面并设下埋伏。另外，邪教分子可能会在白天远远地跟着队伍，然后在人物停下来休息过夜时靠近。在黑暗中或黎明时分的突然袭击特别危险，因为它给予了龙完全的行动自由，并创造了一些党员睡着或没有盔甲的可能性。",
	"Because the cult has underestimated the heroes' strength, this first assault is doomed to fail. However, try to ensure that at least one cultist escapes to report what happened. If no one gets away alive, leave signs that other cultists were hanging back as reinforcements, but fled when the original force was overwhelmed.": "因为邪教低估了英雄们的力量，所以这第一次攻击注定要失败。但是，要尽量保证至少有一个邪教人员逃脱，报告所发生的事情。如果没有人活着离开，就留下痕迹，表明其他邪教分子作为援军在后方徘徊，但在原来的部队被压倒时逃跑了。",
	"Make sure the characters understand what this attack was about. If it makes sense for the circumstances of the attack, the cultists will be dressed in full regalia, complete with masks and dragon-wing capes. With their last breaths, dying cultists should curse the characters and exclaim, \"The dragons rise! You cannot stop us!\"": "确保人物明白这次袭击是为了什么。如果对这次攻击的情况来说是合理的，那么邪教分子将身着盛装，戴着面具，穿着龙翼披风。濒临死亡的邪教徒应该用他们最后的呼吸来诅咒角色，并感叹道：\"龙的崛起！你无法阻止我们！你无法阻止我们！\"",
	"The first attack established that the heroes are an even more dangerous threat than the cult believed. In this second encounter, a stronger cult force attacks to kill.": "第一次攻击确定了英雄们是比邪教相信的更危险的威胁。在这第二次遭遇中，一股更强大的邪教力量发动了攻击，要杀人。",
	"Place this encounter at a point when the characters are not at their strongest or most well prepared. Wait until they are scattered, their spells and features are depleted by previous fighting, or they are injured and low on healing. In particular, if the attack comes during a long rest but before the characters have finished that rest, they won't yet have recovered full hit points, spells, and other resources. Such an attack puts the characters at a huge disadvantage, but reinforces that the Cult of the Dragon wants the adventurers dead.": "在人物不是最强壮或准备最充分的时候安排这个遭遇战。等到他们被打散了，他们的法术和功能被之前的战斗耗尽了，或者他们受伤了，治疗能力不足。特别是，如果攻击发生在长时间的休息期间，但在人物完成那次休息之前，他们还没有恢复全部命中率、法术和其他资源。这样的攻击使人物处于巨大的劣势，但却强化了龙之教想要冒险者死亡的事实。",
	"A dramatic location works best for this attack. The cultists not only want to eliminate a threat, they want to send a message to all others who oppose them. Attacking at an important public building such as a major temple or a palace declares that no place is safe from the cult, while an assault at a large marketplace or a royal garden guarantees a maximum number of witnesses.": "一个戏剧性的地点对这种攻击最有效。邪教分子不仅想消除威胁，他们还想向所有反对他们的人发出信息。攻击重要的公共建筑，如主要的寺庙或宫殿，宣布没有一个地方是安全的，而攻击大型市场或皇家花园，则保证有尽可能多的证人。",
	"The second attack force comprises a team led by a {@creature dragonsoul|RoT} cultist (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}). If this is an isolated fight with the characters at or near full strength, choose adversaries that create a deadly encounter. If the adventurers are weakened from earlier encounters, aim for a hard encounter instead.": "第二支攻击部队包括一个由{@creature dragonsoul|RoT}邪教徒领导的团队（见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}）。如果这是一场孤立的战斗，人物处于或接近全盛状态，那么就选择能创造致命遭遇的对手。如果冒险者在之前的遭遇战中被削弱了，那就以艰难的遭遇战为目标。",
	"Don't be reluctant to use forces that are likely to kill one or more characters. The destruction of the heroes is the goal of this attack, and if the risk of death doesn't feel real, the players won't take the threat of the cult seriously.": "不要勉强使用可能会杀死一个或多个角色的力量。毁灭英雄是这次攻击的目标，如果死亡的风险感觉不真实，玩家就不会认真对待邪教的威胁。",
	"These attackers know more about their targets than the first group did, thanks to the survivors from that battle.": "这些攻击者比第一批人更了解他们的目标，这要归功于那场战斗的幸存者。",
	"The attackers launch their assault while the characters are visiting an important location crowded with innocent bystanders. The black dragon begins by tearing off a section of the roof to incite as much terror as possible. While the characters are distracted by that assault, {@condition invisible} nycaloths move in and attack with surprise. The mezzoloths use {@spell cloudkill} to surround the characters, unconcerned about NPCs caught up in the attack.": "袭击者在人物访问一个挤满无辜旁观者的重要地点时发起攻击。黑龙一开始就撕掉了屋顶的一部分，以尽可能地煽动恐怖。当角色们被这次攻击分散注意力时，{@condition invisible}尼卡洛特人进入并发动了突袭。狼牙棒使用{@spell cloudkill}来包围角色，对被攻击的NPC毫不在意。",
	"An attack in a marketplace, garden, or some other outdoor location opens with the black dragon and one or more flying nycaloths appearing overhead to create a panic. The cultists are hanging on to the dragon, but they drop down to engage the party in melee while the dragon circles above, attacking with its breath weapon and using its Frightful Presence on rounds when its breath is still recharging. While the crowd inhibits the characters' movement, mezzoloths can easily and rapidly teleport through it.": "在集市、花园或其他户外场所的攻击中，黑龙和一只或多只飞蛾出现在头顶，制造恐慌。邪教徒们被挂在龙身上，但他们会掉下来与党派进行近战，而龙则在上面盘旋，用它的呼吸武器进行攻击，并在它的呼吸还在充能的时候使用它的恐怖存在进行回合。虽然人群抑制了角色的移动，但马佐洛特人可以轻松而迅速地穿过它。",
	"Don't be afraid to engage in some triumphal monologuing by the dragonsoul cultist leading the attack. Whether the attackers are winning or losing, the cultist fights with cries of \"The dragons rise!\" and \"We are unstoppable!\" At some point, the leader lets important information slip: \"The Masks are joined, the call has sounded! Soon the Gates of the Nine Hells shall swing wide and She shall return!\"": "不要害怕领导进攻的龙魂崇拜者进行一些胜利的独白。无论攻击者是赢是输，邪教者都会以 \"龙族崛起！\"和 \"我们是不可阻挡的！\"的呼声进行战斗。在某些时候，领导者泄露了重要信息。\"面具人已经加入，召唤已经响起! 很快，九层地狱之门将大开，她将回来！\"",
	"As with the first assault on the adventurers, try to ensure that if the attackers are defeated, at least one escapes to report the outcome of the battle. Most easily, the dragon can fly away if the battle turns against it.": "与第一次袭击冒险者一样，尽量保证如果袭击者被打败，至少有一个人逃出来报告战斗的结果。最容易的是，如果战斗结果对它不利，龙可以飞走。",
	"The yugoloths were summoned by Red Wizards and paid by the cult to kill the adventurers, but they have no loyalty to their benefactors. If a yugoloth takes damage from a single attack that deals more than half its remaining hit points, it withdraws from combat on its next turn. If it hasn't already tried to summon another yugoloth, it does so immediately. If it's already used that power, it simply flees, intending to regroup with other survivors later.": "这些尤格立斯是由红袍巫师召唤出来的，并由邪教付钱给他们来杀死冒险者，但他们对他们的恩人并不忠诚。如果尤格罗特受到一次攻击的伤害超过其剩余命中率的一半，它将在下一回合退出战斗。如果它还没有试图召唤另一个尤戈洛人，它就会立即这样做。如果它已经使用了这种力量，它就会简单地逃走，打算以后与其他幸存者重新组合。",
	"Because the yugoloths are mercenaries, the characters can attempt to buy them off with a better offer—one that not only exceeds what the cult is paying but covers the damage to reputation that comes from changing sides in the middle of battle. A good starting offer is 10,000 gp, or 2,000 gp per yugoloth if more than five of them are in the fight.": "由于尤戈洛人是雇佣兵，角色们可以尝试用更好的报价来收买他们--这个报价不仅要超过邪教所支付的费用，还要包括在战斗中改变立场所造成的声誉损失。一个好的开价是10,000金币，如果超过5个尤格罗人参加战斗，则每个尤格罗人可以得到2,000金币。",
	"In addition to damaging bystanders, this encounter can easily destroy buildings and great landmarks. This formidable assault should provide a sense of the destruction that will wash over the Sword Coast if the Cult of the Dragon is successful in its plans.": "除了伤害旁人之外，这种遭遇可以轻易地摧毁建筑物和伟大的地标。如果神龙教的计划获得成功，这种强大的攻击应该能让人感受到剑海岸将面临的破坏。",
	"The attackers might win this fight and kill all the characters. However, that doesn't need to end the adventure. Healers in the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and the Emerald Enclave can restore the characters to life so they can continue waging war for the forces of good. Surprisingly, dying in this battle might give the characters an advantage. When the attackers report to {@creature Severin|RoT} that the meddling adventurers are dead, they'll be written off as a threat. If the raised characters make an effort to keep out of sight of the cult's spies, their next blow against the cult could come as a complete surprise.": "攻击者可能会赢得这场战斗并杀死所有的角色。然而，这并不意味着冒险的结束。高塔骑士团、哈珀人和翡翠飞地的医护人员可以让角色恢复生命，这样他们就可以继续为正义的力量发动战争了。令人惊讶的是，在这场战斗中死亡可能会给人物带来优势。当攻击者向（%0%）报告说爱管闲事的冒险者已经死了，他们就会被注销掉，成为一个威胁。如果被提拔的人物努力避开邪教的间谍，他们对邪教的下一次打击可能是完全出乎意料的。",
	"The characters gain a level at the end of this event.": "角色在这个事件结束时获得一个等级。",
	"The second attack was meant to finish off the heroes. If a third attack proves necessary, the cult escalates to the highest level.": "第二次攻击是为了解决英雄们的问题。如果证明有必要进行第三次攻击，邪教就会升级到最高级别。",
	"If nothing else, the second attack should impress on the characters that the first attack wasn't a fluke or a one-time event. They have a price on their heads. Additionally, the potency of the second attack should make the characters understand that if a third strike is even more powerful than the second, they won't survive. If it doesn't occur to the players that the characters should take steps to protect themselves, a concerned NPC can make the suggestion.": "如果不出意外的话，第二次攻击应该让角色们印象深刻，第一次攻击并不是侥幸或一次性事件。他们的头顶上有一个价格。此外，第二次攻击的威力应该使角色们明白，如果第三次攻击比第二次攻击更强大，他们将无法生存。如果玩家们没有想到人物应该采取措施保护自己，那么一个关心他们的NPC可以提出建议。",
	"This attack can occur in any settlement the characters are staying in or passing through. Ideally, use a location where one or more characters have homes or family.": "这种攻击可以发生在人物逗留或经过的任何定居点。理想的情况是，使用一个或多个角色有家或家人的地方。",
	"After the second cult attack, allow the characters to complete one or two chapters of the adventure before the cult makes this final attempt on their lives. Because this attack is an all-out assault, the characters should have full access to spells, healing, and other resources.": "在邪教的第二次攻击之后，在邪教对他们的生命进行最后的尝试之前，让角色们完成冒险的一到两章内容。因为这次攻击是一次全面的攻击，所以人物应该能够充分使用法术、治疗和其他资源。",
	"Enough chromatic dragons have responded to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} call that a full flight of young red dragons can be dispatched to deal with the heroes once and for all. For this final assault, the cult bolsters the red dragons with a handful of cultists, half-dragons, and Red Wizards (mages) who are members of Rath Modar's splinter sect. The cultists and Red Wizards arrive on the backs of the red dragons.": "足够多的色龙响应了{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}的号召，可以派出一整队年轻的红龙来彻底解决英雄们的问题。在这最后的攻击中，邪教用少量的邪教徒、半龙人和红袍巫师（法师）来支持红龙，他们是拉斯-莫达尔的分裂教派成员。邪教徒和红袍巫师是在红龙的背上到达的。",
	"Make this a deadly encounter—and not just by the numbers prescribed in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|3|Creating a Combat Encounter}{@i}. By now, the cult knows how the characters fight, and so do you. Sometimes players can make a group of characters tougher than their basic game statistics indicate. If that's the case for your group, take that into account when selecting the attacking force.": "让这是一场致命的遭遇战--不仅仅是通过{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|3|Creating a Combat Encounter}{@i}中规定的数字。现在，邪教组织知道这些角色是如何战斗的，你也知道。有时，玩家可以让一组角色比他们的基本游戏统计数字显示的更强硬。如果你的小组是这种情况，在选择攻击力量时要考虑到这一点。",
	"This encounter should challenge the adventurers in every way. The characters should be no easy match for the attacking force, such that retreat and escape might be their best option if they hope to survive. However, if the characters haven't made escape plans ahead of time, the attackers will have taken steps to make retreat impossible. The specifics are up to you, but should be based around any obvious features of the encounter area. Standard escape paths such as back doors and known sewer entrances will be watched, and tactics the characters have used before will be known. Only a special escape route—a secret passage known only to a palace's most trusted servants, for example—should come as a surprise to the cultists and Red Wizards.": "这次遭遇战应该在各个方面挑战冒险者。角色们应该不是攻击部队的简单对手，如果他们希望活下来，撤退和逃跑可能是他们最好的选择。但是，如果人物没有提前制定逃跑计划，攻击者就会采取措施使他们无法撤退。具体细节由你决定，但应围绕遭遇区的任何明显特征。标准的逃生路径，如后门和已知的下水道入口将被关注，人物以前使用过的战术也将被了解。只有特殊的逃跑路线--例如只有宫殿里最信任的仆人知道的秘密通道--才会让邪教分子和红袍巫师感到惊讶。",
	"Because clever ruses and ambush have failed in previous attacks, the cult's third assault opts for overwhelming force. The dragons attack the characters from the air, attempting to draw them outside if they are indoors. When they finally face off against the adventurers, the attackers fight to kill. If the characters try to stay inside and under cover, the dragons attack whatever building they hide in, setting it ablaze. Half-dragons, cultists, and mages watch all known exits, including underground ones, to prevent the characters from slipping away.": "由于之前的攻击中巧妙的诡计和埋伏都失败了，邪教的第三次攻击选择了压倒性的力量。龙从空中攻击人物，如果他们在室内，则试图将他们引到室外。当他们最终与冒险家们对峙时，攻击者们就会拼命杀人。如果人物试图呆在室内和掩护下，龙就会攻击他们所躲藏的建筑物，将其烧毁。半龙人、邪教徒和法师监视着所有已知的出口，包括地下的出口，以防止人物溜走。",
	"This battle will likely be a challenge to run. It is designed to create an emotional low spot in the adventure, during which overall defeat for the forces of good looks like a real possibility. Character death—even if temporary—can crush some players' spirits.": "这场战斗很可能是一个挑战。它的目的是在冒险中创造一个情感的低点，在这个过程中，善的力量的整体失败看起来是真实的可能性。角色的死亡--即使是暂时的--也会压垮一些玩家的精神。",
	"For those players, don't make this battle just a relentless slog toward death. Give the adventurers opportunities to save innocent townsfolk from being slaughtered and turn dragons away from fleeing crowds. The characters can clear burning buildings, use magic to douse flames or save the dying, and stand up for those who cannot defend themselves. Let their sacrifice during this fight mean something.": "对于这些玩家来说，不要让这场战斗只是无情地走向死亡。让冒险者有机会拯救无辜的镇民，使他们免于被屠杀，让龙远离逃亡的人群。角色们可以清理燃烧的建筑物，使用魔法浇灭火焰或拯救垂死的人，并为那些无法自卫的人站出来。让他们在这场战斗中的牺牲意味着什么。",
	"Great heroes rebound from losses to fight even harder for the cause they believe in. Thanks to {@spell raise dead}, a lost battle is a setback, not a defeat. It's a wake-up call to any players who assumed that the characters' victory was assured. The Cult of the Dragon is committed to its goal and will stop at nothing to achieve it. The characters must be even more committed to theirs.": "伟大的英雄们从失败中反弹，为他们所相信的事业更加努力地战斗。由于{@spell raise dead}，一场失败的战斗是一种挫折，而不是失败。这对任何认为角色的胜利已经得到保证的玩家来说是一个警钟。神龙教致力于其目标，并将不惜一切代价来实现它。角色们必须对自己的目标更加坚定。",
	"Depending on how the adventure unfolds, feel free to alter the forces and tactics in the second and third attacks as you see fit. For example, you might want to hold off with the yugoloths until the third attack, or you might want Red Wizards showing up in the second attack rather than the third.": "根据冒险的发展情况，你可以随意改变第二和第三次攻击的力量和战术，因为你认为合适。例如，你可能想把尤戈洛特人推迟到第三次进攻，或者你可能想让红袍巫师在第二次进攻中出现而不是在第三次进攻中出现。",
	"When the Cult of the Dragon sounded the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, its tremors were felt across the North. In response, many metallic dragons began to investigate what the sounding meant, and to gather what information they could on the cult from nearby humanoid cultures.": "当神龙教发出\"%0%\"的声音时，整个北方都感受到了它的震颤。作为回应，许多金属龙开始调查这声响意味着什么，并从附近的人形文化中收集关于该邪教的信息。",
	"One of those dragons, an ancient gold wyrm named Protanther, invoked an ancient draconic rite of council, summoning ambassadors from among the metallic dragons. Meeting in the Nether Mountains, the council will determine what metallic dragons should do in the face of the looming threat of {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "其中一条龙，一个名为Protanther的古老的黄金巫妖，调用了一个古老的龙族议会仪式，从金属龙中召唤出了大使们。在尼瑟山开会，议会将决定金属龙在面对迫在眉睫的{@creature Tiamat|RoT}威胁时应该做些什么。",
	"The council includes representatives from each of the five metallic dragon races, who will spread word to their fellows of the council's decision. Of specific importance to the factions of Waterdeep is the question of whether the dragons should aid the civilized humanoid races in their fight against the cult, or whether they will act on their own.": "委员会包括来自五个金属龙族的代表，他们将向他们的同伴传达委员会的决定。对于沃特德普的各个派别来说，最重要的问题是，龙族是否应该帮助文明的人形种族对抗邪教，或者它们是否会独自行动。",
	"During the council, the adventurers have a chance to engage and debate some of Faerûn's wisest and most powerful creatures. They must convince the dragons that the cause of the humanoid folk of the Sword Coast is just, and that dragons and non-dragons need to support each other in this conflict.": "在议会期间，冒险者们有机会与法鲁恩最睿智、最强大的生物进行交流和辩论。他们必须说服龙，让他们相信剑海岸的人形生物的事业是公正的，而且龙和非龙需要在这场冲突中相互支持。",
	"To broker such an alliance, the characters might need to promise concessions on behalf of different factions—whether they have those factions' permission to offer concessions or not. If they are successful, the adventurers can gain not only the support of the dragons as a whole but also the specific favor of certain councilors, including valuable magic items from those dragons' own hoards.": "为了促成这样的联盟，人物可能需要代表不同的派别承诺让步--无论他们是否得到这些派别的许可，都要提供让步。如果他们成功了，冒险家们不仅可以获得整个龙族的支持，还可以获得某些议员的特别青睐，包括来自这些龙族自己囤积的宝贵魔法物品。",
	"By ancient tradition, the draconic council includes ambassadors from the diminutive humanoid races. The silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos—in the guise of the human Elia—comes to the Council of Waterdeep to extend the invitation to the draconic council, at which point, the delegates discuss who should be sent as ambassadors for the humanoid factions of the Sword Coast. As a group not aligned overall with any specific faction or cause, the party is deemed to be the best fit.": "根据古老的传统，龙人议会包括来自矮小的人形种族的大使。银龙奥塔利亚卡诺斯（Otaaryliakkarnos）以人类伊利亚的身份来到沃特德普议会，向龙人议会发出邀请，这时，代表们讨论应该派谁作为剑海岸人形派系的大使。作为一个整体上不与任何特定派别或事业结盟的团体，该党被认为是最合适的。",
	"The journey from Waterdeep to the Nether Mountains is more than six hundred miles. Otaaryliakkarnos is willing to grant the characters the special boon of flying them there on her back in only two days. However, this offer is extended only if the adventurers leave directly from the council, rather than first pursuing any other business.": "从Waterdeep到Nether Mountains的旅程超过了六百英里。Otaaryliakkarnos愿意给予人物特殊的恩惠，让他们在她的背上飞到那里，只需两天时间。然而，只有在冒险者直接从议会出发，而不是先去做其他事情的情况下，才会提供这一优惠。",
	"The journey takes the characters through areas suffering under the cult's attacks. Whether from horseback or by air, they see the ruins of isolated settlements and smoke hanging on the horizon. If the characters travel overland, they might pass through some of these ruined settlements, or encounter cult marauders, brigands, refugees, and chromatic dragons bent on destruction. Use your own discretion when choosing how many combat encounters the journey should encompass.": "旅程中，人物穿越了遭受邪教攻击的地区。无论是骑马还是乘飞机，他们都会看到孤立的定居点的废墟和地平线上的烟雾。如果人物走陆路，他们可能会经过一些废墟上的定居点，或者遇到邪教掠夺者、强盗、难民和一心想要毁灭的色龙。在选择旅程中应包括多少次战斗遭遇时，请自行斟酌。",
	"Five ancient dragons make up the council charged with deciding their metallic kin's response to the cult. Though they are not necessarily the wisest or most powerful specimens of dragonkind, all are well respected. Any decision made by these dragon councilors will be accepted by the metallic dragons as a whole.": "五条古龙组成了委员会，负责决定他们的金属亲属对邪教的反应。虽然他们不一定是龙族中最聪明或最强大的标本，但都很受尊重。这些龙族理事做出的任何决定都将被整个金属龙族所接受。",
	"The dragons have no need to judge the different factions of the Sword Coast, for they know of their reputations and actions already. The dragons' attitudes are effectively fixed in that regard. However, they know also that among all the humanoid races, leaders often determine the character of societies. Though they understand that the adventurers are not the nominal leaders of any faction, the dragons already know that the heroes' actions have set the course of the factions' battle against {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. As such, if the dragons side with the humanoids, it will be as a statement of personal faith in the party—and in the party's ability to bring all the factions into the fight.": "龙族没有必要评判剑海岸的不同派别，因为他们已经知道了他们的声誉和行动。在这方面，龙族的态度实际上是固定的。然而，他们也知道，在所有的人形种族中，领袖往往决定着社会的特征。虽然他们明白冒险者不是任何派别的名义领袖，但龙族已经知道，英雄们的行动已经确定了各派别对抗（%0%）的路线。因此，如果龙族站在人族一边，这将是对党的个人信仰的声明--以及对党将所有派别带入战斗的能力的声明。",
	"Each dragon councilor has one of four attitudes in this chapter, ranging from {@b unfriendly} to {@b cautious}, {@b neutral}, and {@b friendly}. To secure the cooperation of the metallic dragons as a whole, the party must conclude this chapter with at least three dragon councilors having a friendly attitude and with none unfriendly. If the characters make a promise or perform an act aimed at a specific dragon, they gain a two-step improvement in the attitude of that dragon (for example, from unfriendly to neutral, or from cautious to friendly). A general concession grants a one-step improvement to a single dragon of your choosing.": "每位龙族议员在本章中都有四种态度之一，从{@b unfriendly}到{@b cautious}、{@b neutral}和{@b friendly}。为了确保整个金属龙的合作，在本章结束时，一方必须至少有三个龙族议员持友好态度，没有一个持不友好态度。如果人物做出承诺或做出针对特定龙的行为，他们会在该龙的态度上获得两步的改善（例如，从不友好到中立，或从谨慎到友好）。一般性的让步可以使你选择的一条龙获得一步的改善。",
	"Metallic dragons are exceedingly wise, but they sometimes have difficulty distinguishing individual humanoids from each other. As such, an individual dragon's initial attitude depends on the party's racial makeup—and on ancient interactions and past wrongs.": "金属龙是非常聪明的，但它们有时很难将单个人类区分开来。因此，个别龙的最初态度取决于当事人的种族构成--以及古代的互动和过去的错误。",
	"See \"{@adventure Chapter 9:Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1}\" for information on the effects of the concessions offered by the adventurers to secure the metallic dragons' allegiance.": "关于冒险家为确保金属龙的效忠而提供的优惠的效果，请参见\"{@adventure Chapter 9:Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1}\"。",
	"Protanther is the leader of the council. A former King of Justice—a royal title among the gold dragons—he does not care for humanoids, particularly humans and elves. Though he sees both good and bad in the lesser races, he believes that their capacity for attaining great power despite their physical limitations makes them dangerous. For all their capability, humanoids have little time to learn the wisdom to direct that capability.": "普罗坦瑟是议会的领袖。他曾是正义之王--一个金龙的皇家头衔，他不关心人类，尤其是人类和精灵。虽然他认为较小的种族有好有坏，但他认为，尽管他们的身体有局限性，但他们获得巨大力量的能力使他们变得危险。对于他们的能力，人类几乎没有时间去学习指导这种能力的智慧。",
	"The gold dragon knows that many of the world's most blighted creatures descend from humans who bargained with dark forces for power, including yuan-ti and tieflings. He considers the cycle of failed human civilizations across Faerûn as a sign of a quintessential flaw in human nature. Moreover, he is quick to point out that humans make up the majority of evil archmages and liches—including Sammaster, who founded the Cult of the Dragon, and Szass Tam's Red Wizards. Even the current leader of the Cult of the Dragon, {@creature Severin|RoT}, and a majority of the cult's members are human.": "金龙知道，世界上许多最糟糕的生物都是与黑暗势力讨价还价的人类的后代，包括元老和铁皮人。他认为整个Faerûn的人类文明失败的循环是人类本性中一个典型缺陷的标志。此外，他还迅速指出，人类构成了大多数邪恶的大法师和地衣--包括建立了龙之教的萨姆斯特，以及萨斯-谭的红袍巫师。甚至龙之教的现任领袖（%0%），以及该教派的大部分成员都是人类。",
	"Protanther can at least appreciate that the crimes of the humanoid races are usually directed against each other. He knows that the short lives of many humanoids means they might not even recognize their own evil. The elves, however, live for long years and possess great knowledge—and have used that knowledge to the detriment of dragonkind in the past. It was the elves who shaped the magic of the {@i Dracorage mythal}, causing dragons across Faerûn to go mad with rage. Convincing Protanther to trust humanoid factions that include elves is a difficult task.": "Protanther至少可以理解，人形种族的罪行通常是针对彼此的。他知道许多类人族的短暂生命意味着他们甚至可能认识不到自己的邪恶。然而，精灵们活了很久，拥有丰富的知识--并且在过去利用这些知识对龙族造成了伤害。正是精灵们塑造了{@i Dracorage mythal}的魔法，导致整个法鲁恩的龙因愤怒而发狂。说服普罗坦斯信任包括精灵在内的人形派别是一项艰难的任务。",
	"Protanther would prefer that the dragons rally their forces with no regard for the humanoid factions, striking immediately and decisively before the cult and its chromatic dragon allies can muster their full strength. If this puts the humanoids at risk, so be it.": "普罗坦斯更希望龙族集结力量时不考虑人形派别，在邪教及其色龙盟友能够集结全部力量之前，立即果断地进行打击。如果这让人形生物处于危险之中，那就这样吧。",
	"Neutral. If there are humans or tieflings in the party, Protanther is instead cautious. If there are elves in the party, he is unfriendly.": "中性。如果党内有人类或铁弗林，普罗坦斯反而会很谨慎。如果党内有精灵，他就不太友好。",
	"Protanther wants a formal apology from one who speaks for elvenkind for the abomination that was the {@i Dracorage mythal}. He is willing to trust that the adventurers can wring such an apology from King Melandrach on the council.": "普罗坦斯希望代表精灵族的人对{@i Dracorage mythal}的可恶行为进行正式道歉。他愿意相信冒险者们能从议会的梅兰德斯国王那里获得这样的道歉。",
	"Ileuthra is an ancient brass dragon who travels the planes in search of knowledge and ever more challenging games. Legend has it that he resides with Oghma, god of knowledge, but the dragon is cagey on that point.": "Ileuthra是一条古老的铜龙，他在各个星球上旅行，寻找知识和更有挑战性的游戏。传说中，他与知识之神奥格玛住在一起，但龙在这一点上很狡猾。",
	"Seeing good and bad in equal measure among the lesser races, Ileuthra recognizes that helping the humanoids is less a case of deciding whether they are worthy of aid, and more about deciding whether these adventurer ambassadors can be trusted to properly lead the factions.": "在较小的种族中看到好的和坏的并存，Ileuthra认识到，帮助人族与其说是决定他们是否值得援助，不如说是决定这些冒险家大使是否可以被信任来正确领导各派。",
	"Ileuthra has no preconceived sense of what might be the best course, and he is willing to hear all sides of the discussion.": "Ileuthra对什么可能是最佳方案没有先入为主的感觉，他愿意听取各方的讨论。",
	"Neutral. Ileuthra has watched the lesser races for long centuries from the planes, and he understands that every individual humanoid possesses the potential for good or evil in equal measure. He is truly undecided, and will weigh all options for action against the cult.": "中性。Ileuthra已经在各个星球上观察了较小的种族长达几个世纪之久，他明白每一个人形生物都拥有同等程度的善与恶的潜力。他确实没有决定权，并将权衡所有针对邪教的行动选项。",
	"Ileuthra believes that the dragon masks are too dangerous to remain in the worldin the world if the humanoid races are aware of where they are. If the characters agree that all dragon masks will be handed over to the metallic dragons as soon as they are found—including any masks captured after the final battle—his attitude can be improved.": "Ileuthra认为，如果人形种族知道龙面具的位置，那么龙面具留在这个世界上就太危险了。如果角色们同意，所有的龙面具一旦被发现就会被移交给金属龙--包括最后一战后捕获的任何龙面具--他的态度就能得到改善。",
	"The representative of the silver dragons believes that among the lesser races, neither good nor bad is ever absolute. The humanoids are in need of protection and guidance, and should be shown Bahamut's righteous way of living rather than ignored and treated as children. If the dragons refuse to engage the humanoids and focus only on their own advancement, the humanoids will persist in making the same mistakes again and again.": "银龙的代表认为，在较小的种族中，好与坏都不是绝对的。人族需要保护和指导，应该向巴哈姆特展示正义的生活方式，而不是被忽视和当作孩子对待。如果龙族拒绝与人族接触，只关注自己的进步，人族就会坚持一次又一次地犯同样的错误。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos's faith in the potential of humanoids has something of a blind spot when it comes to dwarves, however. She resents the dwarves for their Dragonmoots of old—great hunts during which clans would come together to end the perceived threat of a particular dragon. Centuries before, Otaaryliakkarnos's niece was killed in a Dragonmoot, and with the long ancestral memory of the metallic dragons, she holds all dwarves responsible.": "然而，当涉及到矮人时，奥塔利雅克-卡诺斯对人的潜力的信心却有一些盲点。她憎恨矮人，因为他们有古老的Dragonmoots--伟大的狩猎活动，在这些活动中，各族会聚集在一起，以结束对某条龙的威胁。几个世纪以前，奥塔利雅克-卡诺斯的侄女在一次 \"龙啸 \"中丧生，由于对金属龙有着悠久的祖先记忆，她认为所有的矮人都有责任。",
	"Neutral. If the party includes one or more dwarves, Otaaryliakkarnos is instead unfriendly.": "中立。如果队伍中包括一个或多个矮人，奥塔里亚克卡诺斯反而不友好。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos would like the metallic dragons to strike now as Protanther suggests, but she does not know if they can succeed alone. An alliance would reduce casualties for all parties, but the dragons must be certain of the intentions of the factions and their leaders.": "Otaaryliakkarnos希望金属龙现在就像Protanther建议的那样出击，但她不知道他们是否能单独成功。一个联盟将减少各方的伤亡，但龙必须确定各派别及其领导人的意图。",
	"Otaaryliakkarnos knows that the skin of her slain kin was used to make armor for the dwarf lord who slew her. She demands the remains be returned and that Ambassador Brawnanvil make an apology on behalf of all dwarves for the wrongful deaths the Dragonmoots have caused.": "Otaaryliakkarnos知道，她被杀的亲属的皮肤被用来为杀害她的矮人领主制作盔甲。她要求归还遗体，并要求布劳南威尔大使代表所有矮人为 \"龙魔 \"造成的错误死亡道歉。",
	"Of all the dragons on the council, Nymmurh disagrees most strongly with Protanther. He knows that the metallic dragons are made in the image of Bahamut, and have no choice in the matter of being good or evil. Thus, how much greater and more precious is good when it is freely chosen by the humanoids, who must consciously turn away from villainy?": "在议会的所有龙中，尼莫尔最不同意普罗坦斯的观点。他知道，金属龙是按照巴哈姆特的形象制造的，在善恶问题上没有选择。因此，如果善是由人族自由选择的，他们必须有意识地远离恶行，那么善是多么伟大和珍贵？",
	"Nymmurh's belief in the potential of humanoids is partly driven by his affection for and protection of the noble Silmerhelve human family in Waterdeep (including Dala Silmerhelve; see \"{@adventure Chapter 9:Council of Waterdeep|RoT|1}\").": "尼玛相信人形生物的潜力，部分原因是他对水底世界高贵的西尔梅赫夫人家族（包括达拉-西尔梅赫夫；见\"（%0%）\"）的喜爱和保护。",

	"Nymmurh needs no concession unless the characters have somehow offended him. In such a scenario, the adventurers must prove their worth and goodness in a way you deem suitable.": "除非人物以某种方式冒犯了他，否则Nymmurh不需要让步。在这种情况下，冒险者必须以你认为合适的方式证明他们的价值和善良。",
	"Tazmikella is fond of humans and has spent a great deal of time living among them, but she has reservations about supporting the factions.

She fears what might happen if one or more factions turn against the metallic dragons to demonstrate loyalty to {@creature Tiamat|RoT}.": "塔兹米凯拉喜欢人类，并花了大量时间生活在他们中间，但她对支持各派别有保留。她的巢穴和囤积物已经不止一次成为狡猾的小偷和快嘴骗子的目标，她认为背叛是人类的特征。她担心如果一个或多个派别为了显示对{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的忠诚而背叛金属龙会发生什么。",
	"The copper dragon also believes that unrestricted interaction between humanoids and dragons has been disastrous for both races. The {@i Dracorage mythal} serves as a sore reminder of the animosity that has often arisen between the two peoples.": "铜龙还认为，人类和龙之间不受限制的互动对两个种族都是灾难性的。{@i Dracorage mythal}是对两个民族之间经常出现的敌意的一个痛心提醒。",
	"Tazmikella agrees with Protanther that the metallic dragons could strike against the chromatic dragons themselves. However, she is not convinced they would succeed, and having humanoid allies would reduce casualties for both sides.": "塔兹米凯拉同意普罗坦瑟的观点，即金属龙可以自己对色龙进行攻击。然而，她不相信他们会成功，而且有类人的盟友会减少双方的伤亡。",

	"Pick one magic item owned by a member of the party, and which was found during a previous adventure. That item turns out to have once belonged to Tazmikella, and was part of a hoard she took from an ancient black dragon she defeated. ({@spell Legend lore} or similar magic used on the item confirms this story.) The item holds sentimental value to her—or it did until a thief stole it from her hoard. Returning the item to her with an apology improves Tazmikella's attitude.": "挑选一件党员拥有的魔法物品，而且是在以前的冒险中发现的。那件物品原来曾经属于塔兹米凯拉，是她从一条被她打败的古老黑龙那里得到的囤积物的一部分。({@spell Legend lore}或对该物品使用的类似魔法证实了这个故事。) 这件物品对她来说具有感情上的价值--或者说，在一个小偷从她的囤积物中偷走它之前，它是如此。把物品还给她并表示歉意可以改善塔兹米凯拉的态度。",
	"Metallic dragons are known to bestow magic and treasure from their hoards to help heroes from time to time. If the characters do an excellent job impressing the dragons—for example, bringing all five dragons up to an attitude of friendly—or if they roleplayed the encounter well, the council dragons might grant one or more characters with a token of their esteem. This is likely a set of 3 {@item Arrow of Slaying||arrows of slaying (dragons)}, or {@item Armor of Resistance||armor of resistance (lightning)}. Either will prove useful against the cult, especially if the characters have yet to play through {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}. Tazmikella can even return the item the characters gave to her as a concession. (She does not covet it when it might do others good, but simply resents having had it stolen.)": "众所周知，金属龙会不时地从它们的囤积物中赐予魔法和财宝来帮助英雄。如果角色们做得很好，给龙留下了深刻的印象--例如，让所有五条龙都表现出友好的态度--或者如果他们对这次遭遇的角色扮演得很好，议会龙可能会授予一个或多个角色以他们的敬意的信物。这可能是一套3（%0%），或（%1%）。两者都会被证明对邪教很有用，特别是如果这些角色还没有玩过（%2%）。塔兹米凯拉甚至可以把人物给她的物品作为一种让步归还。(她并不觊觎可能对他人有益的物品，而只是对被盗的物品感到不满）。",
	"The party can make general concessions to the dragons to appease them as a group, rather than make personal concessions to individual dragons. A general concession improves the attitude of a single dragon of your choice by one step.": "党派可以对龙做出一般的让步，以安抚它们作为一个团体，而不是对个别龙做出个人让步。一般性让步可以使你选择的一条龙的态度提高一步。",
	"Even good dragons love treasure, and bestowing a share of the hoard the cult has collected for {@creature Tiamat|RoT} goes a long way toward improving the attitudes of the council dragons. The party can effectively treat the dragons as another faction receiving an equal portion of the hoard, granting one share of the total treasure divided among eleven factions. Doing so improves the attitude of a single dragon by one step. For every additional share the dragons are promised (two shares among twelve factions, three shares among thirteen factions, and so on), the party improves the attitude of another dragon by one step.": "即使是好龙也喜欢财宝，将邪教收集到的囤积物分给他们（%0%），对改善议会龙的态度有很大帮助。党派可以有效地把龙当作另一个派别，接受囤积物的同等部分，给予11个派别分得的总财宝中的一份。这样做可以使一条龙的态度提高一个档次。龙族每多分得一份（12个派别分得两份，13个派别分得三份，以此类推），党派就会使另一条龙的态度提高一步。",
	"The attitude of the dragons is improved by wealth in the following order: Tazmikella, Otaaryliakkarnos, Ileuthra, Protanther, and Nymmurh.

	"Though {@creature Severin|RoT}'s hold on the Cult of the Dragon is strong, there remain traditionalist elements within the cult that long for the old ways of reverence for the dracoliches. Many such elements center around scholars and academics, for whom the cult's new focus has made their knowledge and research irrelevant. Others think that {@creature Severin|RoT} is being taken in by devils and that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will play him for a fool—a notion fairly close to the truth.": "虽然{@creature Severin|RoT}对神龙教的控制力很强，但在神龙教中仍有一些传统派的成员，他们渴望着对神龙教的敬畏的旧方式。许多这样的人以学者和学术界为中心，对他们来说，邪教的新焦点已经使他们的知识和研究变得无关紧要。另一些人认为（1%）被魔鬼收买了，（2%）会把他当傻子耍--这种想法相当接近于事实。",
	"Two of the leading dracolich traditionalists—a dragonsoul named Jorgen Pawl and his trusted lieutenant {@creature Iskander|RoT}—have been most vocal in their objections. As the time of the summoning ritual approaches, {@creature Severin|RoT} understands that he can't risk losing loyal troops to infighting and insurrection. He has thus agreed to give Jorgen Pawl and his followers a dragon mask to examine, allowing them to determine whether {@creature Severin|RoT}'s understanding of the masks' power is correct. If {@creature Severin|RoT} is wrong, he will know before risking everything on a do-or-die gamble. If he is right, the traditionalists will give their support to {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans.": "两个主要的龙族传统主义者--一个叫约根-波尔的龙魂和他信任的副官{@creature Iskander|RoT}--一直是最强烈的反对意见。随着召唤仪式时间的临近，{@creature Severin|RoT}明白他不能冒因内讧和叛乱而失去忠诚部队的风险。因此，他同意给约根-波尔和他的追随者一个龙形面具来检查，让他们来确定{@creature Severin|RoT}对面具力量的理解是否正确。如果{@creature Severin|RoT}是错的，他就会在把一切都押在一场不死不休的赌局上之前知道。如果他是对的，传统主义者会支持{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划。",
	"What Jorgen does not know is that {@creature Severin|RoT} asked his {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies to create a false mask, supplying the scholar with a duplicate of the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} that appears both powerful and inscrutable, though it holds little in the way of real magic. {@creature Severin|RoT} knows the scholars will discover the deception eventually, but he hopes that the false mask will keep the traditionalists occupied while he completes his plans.": "约根不知道的是，{@creature Severin|RoT}让他的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友制造了一个假面具，给学者提供了一个{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的复制品，看起来既强大又难以捉摸，尽管它没有什么真正的魔法。{@creature Severin|RoT}知道学者们最终会发现这个骗局，但他希望在他完成计划的时候，这个假面具能让传统主义者忙得团团转。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon recently took control of Xonthal's Tower—an ancient and mysterious wizard's tower on the southern slope of Mount Hlim.

	"The wizard Xonthal was an extraordinary figure. Beginning as a lowly adventurer, he traveled across Faerûn and beyond, reaching distant Zakhara, Kara-Tur, and even Maztica. His work focused on conjuration and elemental evocation, so he often kept elementals and genies for company.": "巫师Xonthal是一个非凡的人物。从一个卑微的冒险家开始，他走遍了法鲁恩和其他地方，到达了遥远的扎哈拉、卡拉图尔，甚至是马兹提卡。他的工作重点是施展魔法和元素召唤，所以他经常与元素和精灵为伴。",
	"Xonthal prized solitude, so he designed his tower and its surrounding hedge maze to deter intruders and unwanted visitors. Over a century ago, the wizard kicked his apprentices out and sealed the tower. No one knows what Xonthal has been up to in the intervening decades, or whether he's even still alive. Some think he must have become a lich, while others believe he's just dead. All that's certain is that the hedge maze remains a frustrating barrier, and the spells and wards protecting the tower against entry remain as powerful as ever.": "Xonthal珍视孤独，所以他设计了他的塔和周围的树篱迷宫，以阻止入侵者和不受欢迎的访客。一个多世纪以前，这位巫师把他的学徒们赶了出去，并封存了这座塔。没有人知道Xonthal在这几十年里做了什么，或者他是否还活着。有些人认为他一定是变成了一个巫师，而其他人则认为他只是死了。所有可以确定的是，树篱迷宫仍然是一个令人沮丧的障碍，保护塔的法术和防护装置仍然像以前一样强大。",
	"Spreading out along the edge of the hedge maze is a village, also called Xonthal's Tower. The settlement began as a place where Xonthal's many apprentices established homes of their own. As years passed, more settlers were drawn to the area as word spread that the wizard and his apprentices offered excellent protection against marauding orcs and monsters. The village is smaller now than in the tower's heyday, but about three hundred people still live there.": "沿着树篱迷宫的边缘蔓延开来的是一个村庄，也叫Xonthal的塔。这个定居点最初是Xonthal的许多学徒建立自己的家的地方。随着时间的推移，更多的定居者被吸引到这个地区，因为有消息说，巫师和他的学徒们提供了很好的保护，可以抵御兽人和怪物的掠夺。现在的村庄比塔的全盛时期要小，但仍有大约三百人住在那里。",
	"The locals are friendly enough, but they're wary of strangers who ask too many questions about the tower. Things were quiet there for a long time, but for almost a year now, the villagers have seen lights through the windows at night and heard unearthly sounds. A few claim to have seen a blue dragon lingering in the sky high above. Some villagers scoff at that idea, but everyone agrees that the tower has been reoccupied.": "当地人足够友好，但他们对那些问太多关于塔的问题的陌生人很警惕。那里的事情平静了很久，但近一年来，村民们在晚上看到了透过窗户的灯光，并听到了非人的声音。有几个人声称看到一条蓝龙在高高的天空中徘徊。一些村民对这一想法嗤之以鼻，但大家都认为塔已经被重新占领了。",
	"Once the villagers are satisfied that the adventurers haven't come to lay waste to the tower (fearing that an all-out battle would likely destroy the village too), they're interested in talking of little else besides who could be inside. The most popular theories are that Xonthal has returned or has awakened as a lich, or that one of the genies and elementals he once imprisoned finally broke free of its restraints but remains trapped inside the tower.": "一旦村民们确信冒险家们不是来浪费塔的（担心一场全面的战斗很可能也会摧毁村庄），他们就会有兴趣谈论除了谁可能在里面之外的其他事情。最流行的理论是，Xonthal已经回来了，或者已经觉醒为一个巫师，或者他曾经囚禁的某个精灵和元素最终挣脱了束缚，但仍然被困在塔里。",
	"The villagers warn the characters sternly about the danger of entering the maze. Few who enter it ever come back out, and those who do come out are much worse for wear. Even animals and birds avoid the maze.": "村民们严厉地警告这些人物进入迷宫的危险。进入迷宫的人很少有机会出来，而那些出来的人则更惨。甚至连动物和鸟类都避开了迷宫。",
	"The tower and the maze are protected by brilliantly crafted {@spell Wish||wishes} cast by Xonthal.

	"The hedge maze surrounding the central tower is an astounding work of magical construction. In certain regards, it's even more impressive than the tower because of the powerful ways it manipulates space.": "围绕中央塔楼的篱笆迷宫是一个令人震惊的魔法建筑作品。在某些方面，它甚至比塔楼更令人印象深刻，因为它以强大的方式操纵着空间。",
	"A gently curving path leads into the maze from the edge of the village. The villagers built a low fence across the entrance to keep young children and animals from wandering in. Fear of the maze is hammered into all other residents of the village from the time they're old enough to appreciate its dangers, and they shun it diligently.": "一条缓缓弯曲的小路从村子的边缘通向迷宫。村民们在入口处建了一道低矮的栅栏，以防止年幼的孩子和动物误入其中。村子里的其他居民从长大到能体会到迷宫的危险时，就对迷宫产生了恐惧，他们也会努力避开它。",
	"Seen from above—either by a flying character or from nearby rooftops—the maze appears to be an overgrown, tangled mess with no discernible paths longer than a dozen yards. It looks exactly like what it is: a hedge maze left untended for more than a century, grown into a nearly solid mass of hedge and thorn.": "从上面看--无论是从飞行角色还是从附近的屋顶--迷宫似乎是一个杂草丛生、纠缠不清的烂摊子，没有超过十几码的可辨认的路径。它看起来就像它是什么：一个被遗弃了一个多世纪的树篱迷宫，成长为一个几乎由树篱和荆棘组成的固体。",
	"Seen from ground level, however, the maze appears to be a pleasant, hedge-ringed garden with no resemblance to a maze at all. Villagers are quick to point out this anomaly, to prove to the characters that the maze is nothing to take lightly. The view from above reveals the maze as it exists in the real world. The view up the path from ground level looks into the extradimensional space that Xonthal crafted as a barrier around his home.": "然而，从地面上看，迷宫似乎是一个令人愉快的、有树篱环绕的花园，与迷宫一点也不相像。村民们很快就指出了这一反常现象，以向人物证明迷宫是不可轻视的。从上面看，迷宫就像它在现实世界中存在的那样。从地面往上看，可以看到Xonthal在他家周围制作的作为屏障的超维空间。",
	"The tower's entrance exists only within this extradimensional space. Entering the maze any other way than walking up the main path quickly leads characters into densely tangled brush that is all but impassable, and that doesn't physically connect to any tower entrance. Characters who cut their way through to the tower, fly across to it, or tunnel beneath the maze to the outside wall find only smooth, unbroken stone that cannot be breached or bypassed by any means. A balcony juts out from the top level of the tower, but it is surrounded by an invisible, impenetrable barrier that deflects all objects and effects. The only way to reach the tower's entrance is through Xonthal's extradimensional maze.": "塔的入口只存在于这个超维空间中。除了走上主路之外，以任何其他方式进入迷宫都会很快将角色带入密密麻麻的灌木丛中，这些灌木丛几乎无法通行，而且在物理上并不与任何塔的入口相连。角色们通过切入塔楼的方式，飞过塔楼，或者在迷宫下面的隧道里找到外墙，却发现只有光滑的、没有破损的石头，无法通过任何手段突破或绕过。一个阳台从塔的顶层伸出来，但它被一个无形的、不可逾越的障碍物所包围，使所有的物体和影响发生偏转。到达塔的入口的唯一方法是通过Xonthal的次元迷宫。",
	"Because the maze doesn't exist in normal space, it cannot be traditionally mapped. Instead, it is shown here as a set of seven nodes where encounters occur. Moving between two nodes takes {@dice 2d6} rounds regardless of whether characters walk or run. Characters experience such movement as if walking down a well-groomed path in a hedge garden. The path curves so that characters can't see more than 15 feet ahead, exactly as if they were in a circular garden with concentric paths. Cutting through hedges has no effect on how long it takes characters to get from one node to the next. Characters who return to look for a spot previously cut through will never find it.": "由于迷宫不存在于正常的空间中，所以它不能被传统地映射出来。取而代之的是，它在这里被显示为一组七个节点，这些节点会发生遭遇战。在两个节点之间移动需要{@dice 2d6}个回合，不管角色是走还是跑。角色体验这样的运动，就像走在篱笆花园里一条修剪整齐的小路上。路径弯曲，使角色无法看到前方超过15英尺的地方，完全就像他们在一个有同心小径的圆形花园里一样。穿过树篱对人物从一个节点到下一个节点所需的时间没有影响。角色如果返回去寻找之前被切开的地方，将永远找不到它。",
	"The hedge walls are 8 feet tall, allowing the adventurers to see the tower above them from many locations. This view provides no clue to direction, however. Characters who see the tower to the left one moment might spot it to the right, or behind, or closer or farther away a moment later. When trying to focus on the tower's new location, characters suddenly find that they can't remember its old location clearly, or begin to wonder if it was in its current spot all along.": "篱笆墙有8英尺高，使冒险者可以从许多地方看到他们头上的塔。然而，这种视野并没有提供方向的线索。一会儿看到左边的塔，一会儿看到右边的，一会儿看到后面的，一会儿看到更近的、更远的。当试图把注意力集中在塔的新位置时，人物突然发现他们不能清楚地记得它的旧位置，或者开始怀疑它是否一直在现在的位置上。",
	"If a character who entered the extradimensional maze along the path tries to fly above it once inside, the tower immediately fades from view, and the view becomes endless hedge-lined paths stretching to the horizon in every direction. Alternatively, characters who fly above the maze are shunted back into the real world, emerging above the hedge tangle with their companions nowhere in sight. The only way for them to rejoin the party is to enter the maze again and retrace their steps, dealing with all encounters along the way. (Use this option carefully if you're not a fan of splitting the party.)": "如果一个沿着路径进入超时空迷宫的角色在进入迷宫后试图飞到它上面，塔就会立即从视野中消失，而视野则变成了无尽的树篱小径，从各个方向延伸到地平线。另外，飞到迷宫上方的人物会被分流回现实世界，出现在树篱纠结的上方，而他们的同伴却不见踪影。他们重新加入队伍的唯一方法是再次进入迷宫，重新走一遍，处理沿途的所有遭遇。(如果你不喜欢分头行动，请谨慎使用这个选项）。",
	"If the characters enter the maze at night, starlight from a clear sky is bright enough for them to find their way through—and even bright enough for the sundial in {@area area 1|19c|x} to cast a shadow. However, anyone with a passing familiarity of the sky notices that the constellations are completelyunfamiliar.": "如果人物在晚上进入迷宫，来自晴朗天空的星光足以让他们找到通过的方法--甚至足以让{@area area 1|19c|x}的日晷投下阴影。然而，任何对天空稍有了解的人都会注意到，这些星座是完全不熟悉的。",
	"Area 1 is the heart of the maze, and characters will return there many times as they seek the entrance to the tower. If they do things correctly, they won't need to face any of the maze's dangers. That's unlikely, though.": "区域1是迷宫的中心，人物在寻找塔的入口时将多次回到那里。如果他们做得正确，他们将不需要面对迷宫中的任何危险。但这是不可能的。",
	"Although the maze is devilishly hard to get through, it's easy to leave. All the characters need to do is express a desire to leave the maze while they're in area 1, and whatever route they take next leads them back to the entrance and the path at the edge of the village. They can turn around and come back in again, and they'll wind up in area 1, at the start of the maze.": "虽然这个迷宫非常难通过，但要离开却很容易。角色们只需要在1号区域内表达离开迷宫的愿望，无论他们接下来走什么路线，都会把他们带回入口和村子边缘的小路。他们可以转身再回来，然后他们就会回到迷宫的起点--1号区域。",
	"Unless the characters took extreme measures to hide their approach to the maze, they are spotted by the cultists in the tower. (The cultists watch the village closely, and immediately recognize any stir caused by the adventurers' arrival.) The cultists don't know the adventurers' plans, but with the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} on hand, they don't intend to take chances. Their preparations alarm {@creature Iskander|RoT}, who sees his chance for escape dwindling. In a panic, he grabs the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} and dashes to the tower balcony.": "除非角色们采取了极端的措施来隐藏他们进入迷宫的方式，否则他们会被塔里的邪教分子发现。(邪教徒们密切注视着村庄，并立即识别出冒险家们的到来所引起的任何骚动)。邪教分子不知道冒险者的计划，但由于手头有{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}，他们不打算冒险。他们的准备工作惊动了（1%），他看到自己逃跑的机会越来越少。慌乱中，他抓起{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}，冲向塔楼的阳台。",
	"As the characters prepare to enter the maze for the first time, or if they are spending too long in the village, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物准备第一次进入迷宫时，或者如果他们在村子里呆的时间太长，读一下或转述一下以下内容。",
	"As you prepare to step onto the garden path, you notice movement high up on the tower. A human male dressed in black robes stands on the balcony, waving something over his head. It's hard to make out details from this distance, but it might be a blue mask.": "当你准备踏上花园小路时，你注意到塔楼上的动静。一个身穿黑色长袍的男性人类站在阳台上，在头上挥舞着什么。从这个距离看很难看出细节，但它可能是一个蓝色的面具。",
	"\"Heroes,\" the figure screams, \"they saw you in the village! I've taken the mask, but they'll realize it's missing within minutes! Look for me beneath the tower, for it's the only place I have a chance to hide. This is the key that will let you teleport into the dungeon.\" As he speaks, the figure holds aloft a second item—some sort of white, glimmering hourglass. \"I will leave it behind after I use it, but others may find it before you do.\"": "\"英雄们，\"那个人影尖叫道，\"他们在村子里看到了你！我拿走了面具，但他们在几分钟内就会发现它不见了。我拿走了面具，但他们在几分钟内就会发现它不见了! 在塔下找我，因为这是我唯一有机会藏身的地方。这是一把钥匙，可以让你传送到地牢里。\" 在他说话的时候，这个人物高举着第二件物品--某种白色的、闪闪发光的沙漏。\"我使用后会把它留下，但其他人可能会在你之前找到它。\"",
	"The speaker looks over his shoulder as another figure suddenly dashes out onto the balcony. A flash of blades and spell-fire erupts. Then the figure who spoke pitches his attacker over the railing before dashing back inside.": "当另一个人影突然冲到阳台上时，说话者向他的肩膀看去。一阵刀光剑影和法术火焰爆发出来。然后那个说话的人把他的攻击者扔到栏杆上，然后冲回屋里。",
	"After walking up the entrance path into the maze, this is the first area the characters arrive at, entering along pathway E.": "走上进入迷宫的入口路径后，这是人物到达的第一个区域，沿着E路径进入。",
	"You've entered an intersection where eight paths converge symmetrically. You can see Xonthal's Tower dead ahead above the hedge wall, but the way the paths curve, there's no telling which one might lead to it.": "你已经进入了一个交叉口，那里有八条小路对称地汇合在一起。你可以看到Xonthal的塔就在篱笆墙的正前方，但从小路的弯曲程度来看，不知道哪条路会通向它。",
	"A sundial stands in the center of the intersection, the shadow from its gnomon pointing straight toward the tower—which is highly odd, because the sun isn't behind you. Your shadows point in the proper direction. Only the sundial's shadow points ahead.": "一个日晷矗立在十字路口的中央，其日晷的影子直指塔楼--这非常奇怪，因为太阳不在你身后。你的影子指向正确的方向。只有日晷的影子指向前方。",
	"The sundial is anchored to the ground and cannot be moved or shifted. The eight paths leading out of this area are identical. If the characters try to make any identifying marks on the ground or leave items in this area, the marks and items are gone the next time they arrive here. The adventurers shouldn't know whether they're coming back to the same spot each time or whether more than one identical sundial intersection exists in the maze.": "日晷被固定在地面上，不能被移动或移位。通往这个区域的八条路都是一样的。如果人物试图在地上做任何识别标记或在这个区域留下物品，那么在他们下次到达这里时，这些标记和物品就会消失。冒险家们不应该知道他们是否每次都会回到同一个地方，或者迷宫中是否存在不止一个相同的日晷交叉点。",
	"The sundial's shadow indicates the correct path. If the characters follow one of the paths not indicated by the sundial, it leads them to one of the other areas of the maze (your choice). There is no turning back from a wrong path. Once the last character has gone out of sight of the sundial (15 feet along the curving path), reversing direction delivers all characters to the same area they would have reached if they'd kept going forward.": "日晷的影子表示正确的路径。如果人物沿着日晷没有指示的一条路走，就会把他们带到迷宫的其他区域（你选择）。走错的路是不能回头的。一旦最后一个角色离开了日晷的视线（沿着弯曲的路径走了15英尺），扭转方向就会把所有角色带到他们如果继续向前走就会到达的相同区域。",
	"If the characters take the correct path, they return to area 1 after {@dice 2d6} rounds. Each time they return, the sundial points toward a different path, in the order presented below. However, each time the characters enter this area after the first, the gnomon casts more than one shadow. The adventurers must deduce the correct path from among multiple shadows, but those solutions aren't obvious or even fair. Xonthal was trying to keep enemies and curiosity-seekers out—not just to present them with an enjoyable mental challenge.": "如果角色走的是正确的道路，他们会在{@dice 2d6}回合后回到区域1。每次他们返回时，日晷都指向不同的路径，其顺序如下所示。然而，每次人物在第一次之后进入这个区域，日晷都会投下一个以上的阴影。冒险家们必须从多个影子中推断出正确的路径，但这些解决方案并不明显，甚至也不公平。Xonthal试图将敌人和好奇心强的人拒之门外--而不仅仅是为他们提供一个愉快的精神挑战。",
	"Sundial": "日晷",
	"Edge of hedge": "树篱的边缘",
	"The {@b first three sundials} are straightforward, even if the solutions are not always obvious.": "{@b first three sundials}是直截了当的，即使解决方案并不总是显而易见。",
	"The {@b fourth sundial} casts four shadows in an \"X\" shape. As the characters examine them, the shadows start slowly rotating around the face of the sundial, spinning faster and becoming shorter until they shrink into the gnomon and the sundial shows no shadow at all. The correct path in this case is the sundial itself. A character who jumps or climbs onto the sundial is drawn into its stone surface, then is suddenly dropped out of the sky to land harmlessly around sundial 5.": "{@b fourth sundial}投下四个 \"X \"形的影子。当人物检查它们的时候，影子开始围绕日晷的表面慢慢旋转，旋转的速度越来越快，越来越短，直到它们缩进日晷，日晷上根本没有影子。在这种情况下，正确的路径是日晷本身。跳上或爬上日晷的人物会被卷入其石面，然后突然从空中落下，无害地落在日晷5周围。",
	"The {@b fifth sundial} casts eight shadows that point at every possible pathway. No path is the right one. To correctly bisect the shadows, characters must move between the paths, straight into the end of any hedge. As soon as a character steps, runs, or dives headlong into a hedge, he or she emerges safely at the foot of the tower.": "{@b fifth sundial}投下八个影子，指向每一条可能的路径。没有一条路是正确的。为了正确地将影子一分为二，角色必须在路径之间移动，直接进入任何树篱的末端。只要一个角色迈步、奔跑或一头扎进树篱，他或她就会安全地出现在塔的脚下。",
	"Each time the characters choose a wrong path, they emerge at one of the other maze areas described below, which you can use in any order you like. If the characters make the wrong choice more than six times, you can reuse areas, create new ones of your own, or let the characters wander down a path much longer than usual before encountering the sundial again.": "每次人物选择错误的道路，他们就会出现在下面描述的其他迷宫区域之一，你可以按你喜欢的顺序使用这些区域。如果人物的错误选择超过六次，你可以重复使用这些区域，自己创造新的区域，或者让人物在再次遇到日晷之前在一条比平时更长的路上徘徊。",
	"Characters always return to the same sundial puzzle they most recently departed (sundial 1 through 5), so that they do not need to retrace their steps from the very beginning after each wrong turn. However, they have no way to tell whether they have returned to the same specific sundial, as noted above.": "角色总是回到他们最近离开的那个日晷谜题（1至5号日晷），这样他们就不需要在每次转错弯后从头开始重走一步。然而，如上所述，他们没有办法知道自己是否回到了同一个特定的日晷。",
	"Some parties are going to try splitting up in the hope of outwitting the maze. No matter how the characters attempt to do so, however, they always wind up back together. If groups take separate paths, they meet at the same destination. If one character stays at the sundial while others take a path, that path leads back to the sundial where the character is waiting. Moreover, that character swears that the others have been gone for {@dice 1d6} hours—long enough to gain the benefit of a short rest (though taking a long rest is impossible in the maze). As usual, any identifying marks made in the area vanish during those hours without anyone noticing.": "一些当事人要尝试分开，希望能智取迷宫。然而，无论这些人物如何尝试，他们最后总是会回到一起。如果各组采取不同的路径，他们会在同一个目的地相遇。如果一个角色留在日晷上，而其他人走了一条路，那条路就会回到日晷上，这个角色就在那里等着。此外，该角色发誓其他人已经离开了{@dice 1d6}小时，足以获得短暂休息的好处（尽管在迷宫中不可能长时间休息）。像往常一样，在这几个小时里，任何在该地区做的识别标记都会消失，没有人注意到。",
	"When the characters complete the maze by successfully entering the hedge at the fifth sundial, they emerge within sight of a teleportation circle at the foot of the tower. The body of a dead cultist lies sprawled on the ground (the one {@creature Iskander|RoT} threw off the balcony earlier). Behind them, the characters see a straight path that leads directly to the sundial intersection. Another path extends thirty yards beyond the sundial, ending at the exit to the village.": "当人物成功进入第五个日晷处的树篱而完成迷宫时，他们出现在塔脚下的传送圈的视线内。一个死去的邪教徒的尸体躺在地上（就是之前从阳台上扔下来的那个（%0%））。在他们身后，人物看到一条直路，直接通向日晷的交叉点。另一条小路延伸到日晷之外的三十码处，在通往村庄的出口处结束。",
	"A few seconds after the first character steps onto the circle, all creatures in the circle are teleported to{@area  area 8|1b6|x}. Alternatively, the characters can walk out of the garden from the foot of the tower without any detours or difficulties. However, any gems they collected in the maze (see below) will mysteriously vanish from their possession.": "在第一个角色踏上圆圈的几秒钟后，圆圈内的所有生物都被传送到{@area  area 8|1b6|x}。另外，人物可以从塔脚下走出花园，不需要走任何弯路或困难。然而，他们在迷宫中收集的任何宝石（见下文）将从他们身上神秘地消失。",
	"Filling the center of this eighty-foot-square courtyard is a circular pool of water sixty feet across. The water is dark and murky, reducing visibility to about one foot. A garnet gemstone hovers one foot above the center of the pool. Another path leaves the area through the hedge wall on the far side of the pool, directly opposite where you entered.": "在这个八十英尺见方的院子里，有一个六十英尺宽的圆形水池，充满了中心。水是黑暗和浑浊的，能见度降低到大约一英尺。一颗石榴石宝石在水池中心上方一英尺处盘旋。另一条路通过水池远处的篱笆墙离开这里，正对着你进来的地方。",
	"Four {@creature Chuul||chuuls} dwell in this dark water. They stay hidden as long as the characters remain in the courtyard, but attack any creature that enters the pool or touches the gem. Attacking chuuls try to paralyze characters, then drag or throw them into the 50-foot-deep pool to drown them. They are fascinated by magic, though, and if any magic item is dropped into the pool, the chuuls are distracted for 5 rounds. They won't attack during that time, and if they were already attacking, they stop and dive to the bottom of the pool to inspect their new treasure.": "四个{@creature Chuul||chuuls}住在这个黑水里。只要人物还在院子里，他们就一直隐藏着，但会攻击任何进入水池或接触宝石的生物。攻击者试图麻痹角色，然后把他们拖或扔到50英尺深的水池里淹死他们。不过它们对魔法很着迷，如果有任何魔法物品掉进池子里，楚尔人就会被分散注意力，持续5个回合。在这段时间内，它们不会攻击，如果它们已经在攻击了，它们会停下来并潜入池底检查它们的新宝藏。",
	"If the characters attempt to leave the area without retrieving the garnet, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk. If the characters leave any marks, items, or companions behind in this area, all the same conditions apply here as in area 1.": "如果人物试图离开这个区域而不取回石榴石，两条路都会转弯，走一段路后会回到这里。如果人物在这个区域留下了任何标记、物品或同伴，那么所有的条件都会在这里适用，就像在区域1一样。",
	"If the garnet is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "如果石榴石被带出这个区域，无论哪条路都能让人物回到日晷上。",
	"The bottom of the pool holds the treasure that's been dropped in by various visitors: six {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}, one {@item potion of growth}, one {@item potion of fire breath}, a {@item wand of fear}, three {@item +1 Dagger||+1 daggers}, a {@item driftglobe}, and an {@item Elemental Gem, Blue Sapphire||elemental gem (clear sapphire/air elemental)}.": "池底放着被不同游客丢进去的宝物：六个（%0%）、一个（%1%）、一个（%2%）、一个（%3%）、三个（%4%）、一个（%5%）和一个（%6%）。",
	"You emerge from the path into an area far larger than any open area you expected to encounter in the maze garden. This rectangular space must be ninety feet across, with its far side almost 150 feet away. It looks like a boulder-strewn pasture, with a large pond to one side and a fenced vegetable garden and oversized cottage on the other. Sheep graze in the pasture, tended by a pair of cyclopes, but none of them are moving. They all appear frozen in time.": "你从小路走出来，进入一个远大于你预期在迷宫花园中遇到的任何开放区域。这个长方形的空间一定有九十英尺宽，它的远侧几乎有一百五十英尺远。它看起来像一个布满巨石的牧场，一边是一个大池塘，另一边是有围栏的菜园和超大的别墅。羊群在牧场上吃草，由一对独眼巨人照看，但它们都没有动。它们似乎都被冻结在时间中。",
	"As soon as any character advances into the area, the creatures here spring to life, with the sheep grazing and the cyclopes chatting idly with each other. When the cyclopes notice the characters, they exchange a few unheard words, then play some sort of game analogous to rock/paper/scissors. One loses, and both cyclopes approach the characters. They don't appear to be carrying weapons.": "只要有角色进入这个区域，这里的生物就会活跃起来，羊群在吃草，独眼巨人在闲聊。当独眼巨人注意到这些角色时，他们交换了几句没听清的话，然后玩起了类似于石头/剪子/布的某种游戏。一个人输了，两个独眼巨人就会接近这些角色。他们似乎并没有携带武器。",
	"When the cyclopes are within 20 feet of the characters, the one that lost the game scoops up a small boulder from the ground and gestures toward the party. He then looks downfield and heaves the boulder 100 feet, where it bounces and rolls another 20 feet. Both cyclopes then turn and look at the characters expectantly.": "当独眼巨人在人物的20英尺范围内时，输掉比赛的那只独眼巨人从地上捡起一块小石块，向队伍打手势。然后他往下看，将巨石抛出100英尺，在那里反弹后又滚了20英尺。然后两个独眼巨人都转过身来，满怀期待地看着这些角色。",
	"The boulders at this end of the field are all at least 2 feet in diameter and weigh 500 pounds or more.": "场地这一端的巨石都至少有2英尺的直径，重达500磅或以上。",
	"The cyclopes speak only Giant. If any character addresses them in that language, they ignore any questions but explain the rules of their game: the characters' boulder must fly farther than the cyclops's. How the characters accomplish this is unimportant to the cyclopes, but the boulder can't be dragged or carried—it must fly at least part of the distance.": "剑水蚤只会说巨人语。如果任何角色用这种语言和他们说话，他们会忽略任何问题，但会解释他们的游戏规则：角色的巨石必须比独眼巨人的飞得更远。角色如何实现这一目标对独眼巨人来说并不重要，但巨石不能被拖动或搬运，它必须至少飞过一部分距离。",
	"The characters can beat this challenge in several ways. The most straightforward solution is to reduce the boulder with an {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell, then use the same spell to enlarge a strong character to throw it. Other solutions might involve casting {@spell levitate} on the rock and giving it a push, digging a trench for the rock to roll down the length of the field, or propelling it with magic in some other way. The cyclopes will accept any solution the characters attempt, as long as it propels the stone farther than the cyclops did.": "角色们可以通过几种方式战胜这个挑战。最直接的办法是用{@spell enlarge/reduce}的法术减少巨石，然后用同样的法术放大一个强壮的人物来扔它。其他的解决方案可能包括对石头施展（%1%），然后推它一把，挖一条沟让石头滚下场地的长度，或者以其他方式用魔法推动它。剑水蚤会接受角色尝试的任何解决方案，只要它能将石头推得比剑水蚤更远。",
	"Each {@creature cyclops} defends itself if attacked, and killing them changes nothing. The characters still need to propel a stone farther than the cyclops did to get back to the sundial.": "如果受到攻击，每个（%0%）都会自我防御，杀死它们不会改变什么。人物仍然需要把石头推得比独眼巨人更远，才能回到日晷前。",
	"When the characters beat the challenge, the stone that the cyclops threw splits in half, revealing a topaz gemstone inside. If the topaz is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "当角色们战胜挑战时，独眼巨人扔出的石头会裂成两半，露出里面的黄宝石。如果把黄宝石带出这个区域，无论哪条路都能把人物带回到日晷上。",
	"If the characters attempt to leave the area without winning the contest, both paths curve away and bring them back here after a short walk.

	"A large flower grows on each northern and southern side of each square on the map except the square with the fountain. As the characters get closer, they can see that the shimmering of the flowers comes from a large pearl set into each one. However, if any of these carnivorous flowers is attacked, or if a character tries to remove a pearl from a flower, all twelve flowers attack any enemy they can reach. Use the statistics of an {@creature otyugh} to represent each flower, except they have speed 0, and they have the plant type.": "除了有喷泉的广场外，地图上每个广场的南北两侧各生长着一朵大花。当人物走近时，他们可以看到这些花的光泽来自于镶嵌在每朵花上的一颗大珍珠。然而，如果这些食肉花中的任何一朵被攻击，或者如果一个角色试图从一朵花上取下珍珠，所有12朵花都会攻击它们所能到达的任何敌人。用一个{@creature otyugh}的统计数据来代表每朵花，除了它们的速度为0，而且它们有植物类型。",
	"Once a flower is killed, its pearl can be removed. If a pearl is carried out of this area, either path leads the characters back to the sundial.": "一旦一朵花被杀死，它的珍珠就可以被取出。如果珍珠被带出这个区域，无论哪条路都会把人物带回到日晷。",

You hear exotic music being played on a stringed instrument.": "一个平静的池塘填满了这个开放空间的中心。一座坚固的宝塔从一块巨石上升起，像一座岛屿一样矗立在水中。一座拱桥横跨水面通向宝塔，宝塔的红色屋顶由六根结实的柱子支撑，上面有雕刻的鱼。一个身穿绣有红色和金色鱼的黄色丝绸长袍的男性站在塔内。你会听到用弦乐器演奏的异国音乐。",
	"When the characters arrive, the robed figure bows to them, and sits down on the boulder where it protrudes through the floor of the pagoda. He waits patiently for the party to join him. Around the boulder, the floor of the pagoda is not wood, but rather is a rock garden of decorative stones and brushed sand. A charcoal pit smolders beside the boulder where the man sits.": "当人物到达时，长袍人向他们鞠躬，并在巨石上坐下，巨石突出于宝塔的地板。 他耐心地等待着当事人加入他。在巨石周围，宝塔的地板不是木头的，而是由装饰性石头和刷过的沙子组成的岩石花园。在那人坐着的巨石旁边，有一个炭火坑在冒烟。",
	"The master of the pagoda does not speak, and he waits as long as long as it takes for the adventurers to join him. When they enter the pagoda, he gives a brief smile and proffers silk cushions. He then waves his hand and an iron tea kettle rises up from beneath the embers. The kettle resembles a scowling face with thick features, and a character who studies it may recognize it as a dao with a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) or Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check.

Success indicates the character recognizes drakeswort, a potentially lethal herb.": "在成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}）检查后，角色意识到一种与生俱来的能力将茶壶从炭火中举起（{@spell move earth}作用于一个小泥柱）。看着叶子进入水壶的角色可以尝试用DC13智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Medicine}）检查。成功表明该人物认出了龙葵，一种潜在的致命草药。",

Ten feet across and stretching from floor to ceiling, it swirls endlessly, revealing a number of sparkling gems within it.": "一目了然，这个区域曾经是巫师的工作间。工作台上摆满了笔记、炼金瓶、烧杯、火炉和其他神秘的仪器。更令人吃惊的是占据房间中心的旋风。它有十英尺宽，从地板延伸到天花板，无休止地旋转着，里面露出许多闪闪发光的宝石。",
	"The whirlwind is not a creature, but one of Xonthal's experiments. The gemstones swirling inside it are {@item Elemental Gem||elemental gems}. If a hand or any other material object is pushed into the whirlwind, it disrupts the perfect balance of the airflow, causing an {@item elemental gem} to spin out and smash on the floor, summoning an angry {@b elemental}. You can choose the elemental's type or determine it randomly. The whirlwind contains eight gems, two of each elemental type. Every time the whirlwind is disturbed, another gem is ejected and breaks.": "这个旋风不是一个生物，而是Xonthal的一个实验品。在它里面旋转的宝石是（%0%）。如果一只手或任何其他物质物体被推入旋风中，就会破坏气流的完美平衡，导致一个（1%）旋转出来，砸在地上，召唤出一个愤怒的（2%）。你可以选择元素的类型或随机确定。旋风里有八颗宝石，每种元素类型有两颗。每当旋风受到干扰时，就会有另一颗宝石被弹出并破碎。",
	"The equipment here is now useless, and any reagents or components have long since dried up, decayed, or lost their potency. A character who spends a day poring over the notes can attempt a DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to understand that Xonthal was involved in a complex attempt to create elementals that fused the best traits of earth, air, fire, and water.": "这里的设备现在已经没用了，任何试剂或成分都早已干涸、腐烂或失去效力。一个花了一天时间研究这些笔记的人物可以尝试进行DC20智力（（%0%））检查，以了解Xonthal参与了创造元素的复杂尝试，融合了土、空气、火和水的最佳特性。",
	"Steps descend to a walkway that appears to stretch across infinite space. Thousands of stars twinkle in unfamiliar constellations, and meteors streak through the vastness above and below the path. Just past the base of the stairs, a door framed by nothingness rises from the path. Fifty feet beyond that, the path meets an intersection, with another door straight ahead.": "阶梯下降到一条似乎延伸到无限空间的走道。成千上万的星星在陌生的星座中闪烁，流星在路径上方和下方的浩瀚空间中闪耀。刚过楼梯底部，一扇被虚无所包围的门从路径上升起。再过50英尺，道路遇到一个十字路口，前方是另一扇门。",
	"This corridor is a relic of Xonthal's experimentation with extradimensional space. The path is formed by the floor of the corridor, which is perfectly solid and secure despite appearing to extend into the void. Reaching beyond the edge of the walkway confirms the absence of walls or ceiling. The atmosphere is thin and cold, but not uncomfortably so.": "这条走廊是Xonthal对超维空间进行实验的遗迹。这条路是由走廊的地板形成的，尽管看起来延伸到了虚空中，但它是完全坚实和安全的。伸到走道边缘之外，证实了没有墙壁或天花板。大气是稀薄和寒冷的，但并不令人感到不舒服。",
	"At an opportune moment when one or more characters are moving along the path, a swarm of tiny meteors shoots past, threatening to knock them off the walkway. All creatures on the path must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to dodge the meteors. On a failed save, a creature is struck, takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked off the walkway.": "在一个合适的时刻，当一个或多个角色在路上移动时，一群小流星射了过去，威胁着要把他们从走道上撞下来。所有在路上的生物都必须在DC10的灵巧救赎中成功，以躲避流星的攻击。如果救赎失败，生物会被击中，受到9({@dice 2d8})的重击伤害，并被击落在走道上。",
	"A creature knocked off the walkway appears to fall into infinite space. Unless the creature can fly or teleport back to the walkway, it quickly vanishes from sight. Roll {@dice 1d4 + 17}; the number rolled is the number of the room where the character materializes and crashes to the floor on the following round, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) bludgeoning damage from the fall.": "一个被撞出走道的生物似乎掉进了无限的空间。除非该生物能飞或传送回走道上，否则它很快就会从视线中消失。掷出{@dice 1d4 + 17}；掷出的数字是该角色实体化的房间的编号，并在下一回合坠落到地板上，从坠落中受到14({@dice 4d6})重击伤害。",
	"Though having a character fall off the walkway is dangerous (and potentially exciting), it makes it less likely that the adventurers can be tricked by the efreeti in {@area area 22|1d6|x}.": "虽然让角色从走道上掉下来很危险（而且有可能很刺激），但它使冒险者被伊夫里提欺骗的可能性降低了（%0%）。",
	"This circular room is obviously a library or study, its walls lined with bookshelves that extend from the floor to the gently domed ceiling twenty feet overhead. A wheeled ladder is connected to a rail that runs around the curved wall, allowing access to the upper shelves. A delicate, ornate desk stands at the center of the room, surrounded by piles of blank paper. A large map sits on the desk, its corners held down with stones.": "这个圆形的房间显然是一个图书馆或书房，墙壁上摆放着书架，从地板一直延伸到头顶20英尺高的平缓的圆顶。一个带轮子的梯子与环绕弧形墙壁的轨道相连，可以进入上部的书架。一张精致、华丽的书桌矗立在房间中央，周围是成堆的白纸。一张大地图放在桌子上，其四角用石头压住。",
	"The two secret doors in this area are concealed behind swinging bookshelves, and can each be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. The door to the spellbook study ({@area area 20|1d3|x}) is opened by shifting a book at floor level. The door to the observation room (area 19) is located 10 feet above the floor. It is opened by positioning the rolling ladder in front of the door and pushing on the shelf 15 feet above the floor.": "这个区域的两扇暗门隐藏在摇摆的书架后面，只要成功地进行DC15智力({@skill Investigation})检查，就可以找到它们。通往法术书研究室的门（{@area area 20|1d3|x}）可以通过移动地面上的一本书而打开。通往观察室（19区）的门位于离地面10英尺的地方。将滚梯放在门前，然后推开离地面15英尺的架子，就可以打开它。",
	"If anyone but Xonthal opens either secret door, the papers piled throughout the room begin to ruffle as though a breeze blows through the area. Thousands of sheets of heavy paper then fly into the air in a great whirlwind, slashing at any creature in the area. One distinct storm of paper forms around each character on the first round. Every round after that, two more cyclones form, to a maximum of three per character.": "如果除了Xonthal以外的任何人打开这两扇秘门，整个房间里堆积的纸张就会开始褶皱，就像一阵微风吹过这个区域。数以千计的厚重纸张在空中形成一股巨大的旋风，向该地区的任何生物扑去。在第一轮中，每个角色周围都会形成一个明显的纸张风暴。此后的每一轮，都会再形成两个旋风，每个角色最多形成三个。",
	"Treat these paper whirlwinds as {@creature Swarm of Ravens||swarms of ravens}, but they are constructs instead of beasts, and they have vulnerability to fire. When the paper swarms form, they remain on guard in the study for 30 minutes, then collapse to piles of paper once more. They won't pursue characters into the hallway, but will chase them into the two adjoining rooms.": "将这些纸旋风视为{@creature Swarm of Ravens||swarms of ravens}，但它们是构造物而不是野兽，而且它们对火有脆弱性。当纸群形成后，它们会在书房里守候30分钟，然后再一次倒塌成纸堆。它们不会追着人物进入走廊，但会追着他们进入相邻的两个房间。",
	"The contents of Xonthal's library are as valuable as they are voluminous. The wizard's collection includes nearly five thousand books, pamphlets, folios, quartos, scrolls, and tablets with a combined weight of more than a ton. The entire collection would be worth 50,000 gp if it could be moved. Alternatively, the characters can pick out a few especially valuable volumes.": "Xonthal的图书馆的内容既珍贵又庞大。巫师的收藏包括近五千本书籍、小册子、对开本、四开本、卷轴和石板，总重量超过一吨。如果能搬动的话，整个收藏品价值50,000金币。另外，人物可以挑出几本特别有价值的书。",
	"A character trained in one of the following skills can make a check to search the library for a work on that subject: {@skill Animal Handling}, {@skill Athletics}, {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Medicine}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Performance}, {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Religion}, or {@skill Sleight of Hand}. Multiply the total of the check by 10 to get the gp value of the single most valuable book a character can find on that subject. Each skill check takes 10 minutes, but many characters can be searching at the same time. Characters who search for more books take a cumulative–10 penalty to subsequent checks.": "受过以下技能训练的人物可以进行检查，在图书馆中寻找有关该主题的作品。{@skill Animal Handling}, {@skill Athletics}, {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Medicine}, {@skill Nature}, {@skill Performance}, {@skill Persuasion}, {@skill Religion}, 或 {@skill Sleight of Hand}。检查的总数乘以10，就可以得到一个角色在该主题上能找到的最有价值的书的GP值。每次技能检查需要10分钟，但许多角色可以同时进行搜索。搜索更多书籍的角色在随后的检查中会受到累计10的惩罚。",
	"The map shows the region of the Elemental Plane of Fire surrounding the fabled City of Brass. The map cannot be harmed by fire, and is worth 500 gp to a planar scholar or explorer.": "这张地图显示了传说中的黄铜城周围的火元素位面的区域。该地图不能被火伤害，对一个平面学者或探险家来说价值500金币。",
	"The floor of this room is 10 feet higher than the floor of area 18.": "这个房间的地板比18区的地板高10英尺。",
	"A circular pane of crystal ten feet in diameter hangs vertically in this chamber, anchored to the ceiling, walls, and floor by chains. A scene of roiling fire can be glimpsed within the crystal. In front of the crystal, an ornate rod is set into the floor.": "一块直径为10英尺的圆形水晶板垂直悬挂在这个房间里，用链子固定在天花板、墙壁和地板上。在水晶中可以瞥见一副火光冲天的场景。在水晶的前面，一根华丽的杆子被镶嵌在地板上。",
	"The scrying crystal allowed Xonthal to peer into other planes, and is currently set to view the Elemental Plane of Fire. The view is controlled by the rod set into the floor, and moving it shifts the scene. Doing so properly is challenging, however. A character can attempt a DC 20 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to move the rod. Success indicates that the crystal displays a brief glimpse of a stunning fiery vista near the City of Brass. Failure indicates that the crystal shows only flames.": "窥探水晶允许Xonthal窥探其他位面，目前被设置为查看火元素位面。视野是由镶嵌在地板上的杆子控制的，移动它就能转移场景。然而，正确地这样做是具有挑战性的。一个角色可以尝试用DC20的灵巧（（%0%））检查来移动杆子。成功的话，水晶会显示出黄铜之城附近令人惊叹的火光景象。失败则表明水晶只显示火焰。",
	"A large, simple desk with several ink pots, quill pens, and a single chair occupy the center of this otherwise empty room.": "一张简单的大桌子上有几个墨盒、羽毛笔和一把椅子，占据了这个原本空荡荡的房间的中心。",
	"Xonthal used this room for writing his spellbooks, but those books went with him when he vanished.

	"This area is lined with shelves holding hundreds of mundane and exotic reagents and components used by Xonthal in his experiments. Most of the supplies have evaporated, congealed, or decayed over long years, but any spellcasting characters can find enough useable materials here to replenish their material components if necessary.": "这个区域的架子上摆放着数百种Xonthal在实验中使用的世俗和奇异的试剂和组件。大多数物资在漫长的岁月中已经蒸发、凝固或腐烂，但任何施法者都能在这里找到足够的可用材料，在必要时补充他们的物质成分。",
	"Where the hallway bends to the northeast, it once again takes on the appearance of a stone corridor.": "在走廊向东北方向弯曲的地方，它再次呈现出石头走廊的样子。",
	"Light shines out ahead as the corridor opens into a room set with comfortable-looking oversized furnishings. In the center of the room, a red-skinned creature wearing armor of flame, bronze, and volcanic stone sits cross-legged on the floor, studying a chessboard.": "当走廊通向一个摆放着看起来很舒服的特大号家具的房间时，光线照亮了前方。在房间的中央，一个身穿火焰、青铜和火山石盔甲的红皮肤生物盘腿坐在地板上，研究一个棋盘。",
	"The creature is an {@creature efreeti} named Taraz the Fair. The name has nothing to do with his sense of justice or fair play, however, but refers to the light hues of his fiery hair. Xonthal trapped Taraz and was trying to bend or trick the efreeti into service when he disappeared. The trapped creature has had over a century of solitude to rue its fate.": "这个生物是一个{@creature efreeti}叫做公平的塔拉兹。然而，这个名字与他的正义感或公平竞争无关，而是指他火热头发的浅色调。Xonthal困住了Taraz，并试图屈服或欺骗efreeti为其服务，这时他消失了。被困的生物有一个多世纪的孤独，对自己的命运感到后悔。",
	"Taraz is held in this area by a thin line of magical salt. Imbued with potent wards by Xonthal, the salt rings the bases of all four walls and extends across the doorway in the joints between paving stones. A character with a passive {@skill Perception} of 18 or higher notices the salt automatically. Otherwise, a character who looks carefully spots the salt with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check.": "塔拉兹在这一区域被一条薄薄的魔法盐线所控制。Xonthal赋予了它强大的防护能力，盐环抱着所有四面墙的底部，并在铺路石之间的缝隙中延伸到了门口。被动（%0%）为18或更高的人物会自动注意到盐。否则，仔细观察的人可以通过成功的DC12智力（（%1%）或（%2%））检查发现盐。",
	"Taraz greets the adventurers with a fiery smile. He assumes correctly that the characters' arrival so soon after {@creature Iskander|RoT}'s appearance is no coincidence, and he uses the missing mage as leverage for negotiating. Taraz's only concern is escape, and he will do anything to win his freedom.": "塔拉兹带着火热的笑容迎接冒险者们。他正确地假设，人物在{@creature Iskander|RoT}出现后这么快就来到这里并不是巧合，他用失踪的法师作为谈判的筹码。塔拉兹唯一关心的是逃跑，他将不惜一切代价来赢得自由。",
	"Taraz's conversation with the adventurers covers the following points—many of which are utter lies designed to help him gain the characters' trust:": "塔拉兹与冒险者的对话包括以下几点--其中许多是完全的谎言，旨在帮助他获得人物的信任。",

	"Xonthal warded the chamber to prevent the efreeti from harming anyone, so that the wizard and the genie could play chess. Xonthal promised to set Taraz free if he ever won a match. (False on all counts. Xonthal never entered this area, because Taraz can and will harm creatures in his chamber.)": "Xonthal给密室装上了防护罩，以防止伊夫里提伤害任何人，这样巫师和精灵就可以下象棋。Xonthal承诺，如果塔拉兹赢了比赛，他将获得自由。(在所有方面都是假的。Xonthal从未进入过这个区域，因为Taraz可以而且会伤害他房间里的生物）。",
	"The characters are perfectly safe in the corridor. (True, as long as Taraz is confined to area 22.)": "人物在走廊里是完全安全的。(没错，只要塔拉兹被限制在22区。)",
	"Taraz has no desire to harm the characters, and couldn't even if he wanted to, thanks to Xonthal's protective magic. (False. Xonthal's wards confine the efreeti and its magic to area 22, but they don't protect other creatures in that area.)": "塔拉兹不想伤害这些人物，即使他想也不能，这要归功于桑塔尔的保护性魔法。(假的。Xonthal的防护罩将伊夫里提和它的魔法限制在22号区域，但它们并不保护该区域的其他生物）。",

	"{@creature Iskander|RoT} stumbled and fell off the walkway with the mask into the infinite space beyond, where he undoubtedly is still falling. To rescue him and recover the mask, the characters will need Taraz's help, for the only way to get the mask back from the cosmic well around the walkway is with a wish. The efreeti will bestow this powerful magic on the party in exchange for his freedom.

	"Freeing Taraz is as simple as breaking the line of salt across the entryway. (True.)": "释放塔拉兹就像打破横在入口处的盐线一样简单。(没错。）",
	"In the end, Taraz is desperate to escape the dungeon, and he will promise almost anything—short of continued servitude—to win his freedom. Unless the terms of the deal are ironclad, however, the efreeti will seek a way to weasel out of any bargain once he is free, and to attack the characters out of sheer malice. Because he can fly, Taraz has no fear of falling off the walkway, and he will push characters off it.": "最后，塔拉兹急于逃离地牢，他几乎会答应任何事情--除了继续当奴仆--来赢得他的自由。然而，除非交易的条款是铁的，否则一旦他获得自由，伊夫里提就会想办法摆脱任何交易，并出于纯粹的恶意而攻击这些人物。因为他能飞，塔拉兹并不害怕从走道上掉下来，他将把人物推下走道。",
	"Two massive hourglasses occupy this irregularly shaped chamber. Their glass globes are nearly fifteen feet across, with each hourglass rising almost to the ceiling thirty feet overhead. Each is suspended by chains, pulleys, and gears in such a way that it can be turned over to set its sand running.": "两个巨大的沙漏占据了这个不规则形状的房间。它们的玻璃球有近15英尺宽，每个沙漏几乎都升到30英尺高的天花板上。每个沙漏都被链子、滑轮和齿轮悬挂起来，这样就可以把它翻过来，让它的沙子运转。",

	"In addition to his mastery of spatial magic, Xonthal dabbled in the manipulation of time. These hourglasses were part of his attempt to control the flow of time, though he abandoned that research. The hourglasses can be rotated by pulling on their chains, but the only effect is a hideous, ear-grating groan. The sand runs, but the hourglasses' magic has long since dissipated.": "除了对空间魔法的掌握之外，Xonthal还涉足了对时间的操纵。这些沙漏是他试图控制时间流的一部分，尽管他放弃了这项研究。沙漏可以通过拉动它们的链子来旋转，但唯一的效果是发出可怕的、刺耳的呻吟声。沙子在流动，但沙漏的魔力早已消散。",

An hourglass has AC 5, 25 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning and thunder damage. An hourglass that drops to 0 hit points shatters, spilling its sand onto the floor. Sifting through the pile reveals {@dice 1d4 + 2} tiny diamonds amid the grains of sand. Each diamond has an apparent value of 100 gp, and a character in possession of a diamond can use a bonus action to teleport to a space it can see up to 30 feet away, whereupon the diamond disappears.": "施放{@spell detect magic}法术会在每个沙漏的沙子中显示出微弱的转化魔法的光环。一个沙漏有5点攻击力，25点命中率，易受击打和雷霆伤害。击中率降至0的沙漏会碎裂，沙子会洒在地上。筛查这堆沙子时，发现沙粒中夹杂着{@dice 1d4 + 2}的小钻石。每颗钻石的表面价值为100金币，拥有钻石的角色可以使用一个额外的行动来传送到它能看到的30英尺以外的空间，在那里钻石会消失。",

	"Like any smart foe, Lennithon tries to fight on its terms, not the enemy's. It stays in the air and uses its breath weapon to maximum effect. If the characters refuse to face it, Lennithon is happy to wreck the village and murder innocents in an effort to bring the heroes into the open.": "像任何聪明的敌人一样，Lennithon试图按照自己的条件而不是敌人的条件进行战斗。它呆在空中，使用它的呼吸武器来达到最大效果。如果角色们拒绝面对它，伦尼森很乐意破坏村庄并杀害无辜者，以努力将英雄们带到公开场合。",

	"The fact that the {@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS} is a forgery is quickly discovered by experts at Waterdeep. It becomes a cause for much concern among the members of the council, some of who see it as a sign that the cult might have placed spies within the council. {@spell Speak with dead} used to contact either {@creature Iskander|RoT} or Jorgen Pawl can shed some light on why a false mask might have been supplied to the cultists at Xonthal's Tower, but the false mask might otherwise remain a troubling mystery.": "{@item Blue Dragon Mask|RoTOS}是伪造的这一事实很快就被沃特德普的专家发现了。这引起了议会成员的极大关注，其中一些人认为这表明邪教可能在议会中安插了间谍。(用来联系{@spell Speak with dead}或乔根-波尔的方法可以说明为什么假面具会被提供给松塔尔塔的邪教分子，但假面具可能仍然是一个令人不安的谜。",

The adventurers have been specifically requested to represent the Sword Coast at this meeting, after which the characters will be returned to Waterdeep unharmed.": "在这一章的开始，人物被他们信任的水底议会的人召集到一个秘密会议。在会议上，他们了解到议会已经被一个名为Nyh Ilmichh的泰伊人（%0%）接触过。Ilmichh向议会发出邀请，希望他们能派一名特使前往泰伊，讨论泰伊和剑海岸在当前的危机中如何相互帮助。冒险家们被特别要求在这次会议上代表剑岸，在会议结束后，这些角色将安然无恙地回到沃特迪普。",
	"The visit to the embassy will last only a few days, but the location of the meeting is not negotiable. The duties of the tharchion (a Thayan governor) the characters will meet precludes her leaving her post. The characters' council contact tells them that Ilmichh has been carefully questioned and subjected to a {@spell zone of truth}, and that all she said has been confirmed.": "对大使馆的访问将只持续几天，但会面的地点是不能协商的。人物将会见的Tharchion（泰雅族总督）的职责不允许她离开她的岗位。人物的议会联系人告诉他们，伊尔米奇已经被仔细询问并接受了{@spell zone of truth}，她所说的一切都得到了证实。",
	"The characters should understand that without the Red Wizards, {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans are severely compromised. Moreover, it is common knowledge that Szass Tam wants all exiled Red Wizards dead in the worst possible way. Despite reservations from some on the council, most believe that since the factions and Szass Tam have a common goal, the invitation is worth accepting.": "人物应该明白，没有红袍巫师，{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划就会受到严重影响。此外，众所周知，萨斯-谭希望所有被流放的红袍巫师以最坏的方式死去。尽管议会中的一些人持保留意见，但大多数人认为，既然各派别和萨斯-谭有一个共同的目标，这个邀请是值得接受的。",
	"The final decision is up to the characters, of course. No one will compel them to go to Thay. But in the council's estimation, the potential to delay or even undo {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plan at a single blow is too much to pass up.": "当然，最后的决定由人物决定。没有人会强迫他们去找泰伊。但在议会的估计中，一举拖延甚至撤销{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划的可能性太大，不能放弃。",
	"Thay is an isolated and arid windswept plateau some twenty-five hundred miles east of Waterdeep, its dark skies constantly clouded by volcanic ash. This land is defined by the prevalence of undead within its borders. The supreme leader of Thay is the lich Szass Tam, whose council of advisers—the zulkirs—are powerful liches themselves. Everyone of consequence in Thay is a spellcaster, and necromancers are common there. Undead servants are everywhere, and many of the commanders in Thay's armies are the free-thinking undead soldiers (use the {@creature wight} statistics).": "泰伊是一个与世隔绝的干旱风沙高原，位于沃特德普以东约2500英里，其黑暗的天空一直被火山灰笼罩。这片土地的特点是边界内普遍存在着亡灵。萨伊的最高领导人是巫师萨斯-塔姆（Szass Tam），他的顾问团--祖尔基尔（zulkirs）--本身也是强大的巫师。在泰伊，每个有影响力的人都是施法者，死灵法师在这里很常见。亡灵仆从随处可见，泰伊军队中的许多指挥官都是思想自由的亡灵士兵（使用（%0%）统计）。",
	"Travelers to this land must be wary of its dark politics—rampant paranoia, a police-state mentality, and necromancers commanding the top of the social order—as much as the threats of the undead and Red Wizards that dwell here. Thay is a place filled with extraordinary danger.": "来到这片土地的旅行者必须警惕其黑暗的政治--猖獗的偏执狂、警察国家的心态和指挥社会秩序高层的死灵法师，以及居住在这里的亡灵和红色巫师的威胁。泰伊是一个充满了特殊危险的地方。",
	"The Harpers keep a close watch on developments in Thay, and they are the characters' best resource for current information on that land. If the characters don't seek advice from the Harpers, Leosin Erlanthar approaches them.": "哈珀人密切关注着泰伊的发展，他们是人物了解该地最新信息的最佳资源。如果人物不向哈珀斯寻求建议，利奥辛-埃兰萨就会接近他们。",
	"In addition to providing the characters with the information about Thay above, Erlanthar arranges for them to receive sealed warrants indicating that they are acting on behalf of the Lords of Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance. The party is under the protection of both groups, though such warrants are no guarantee of safety in Thay. Erlanthar advises the characters to address anyone of importance deferentially and by title, never by name only. As well, characters who know any necromantic magic should feel free to show it off.": "除了向人物提供上述关于泰伊的信息外，厄兰萨还安排他们收到密封的手令，表明他们是代表沃特德普领主和领主联盟行事。队伍受到这两个组织的保护，尽管这种授权书并不能保证在泰伊的安全。埃兰萨建议角色们对任何重要的人都要恭敬地称呼，而且要用头衔，不要只用名字。同样，懂得任何死灵魔法的人物应该自由地展示它。",
	"When the adventurers are ready to depart, Nyh Ilmichh teleports with them to Nethwatch Keep in the Tharch of Lapendrar, just inside the Thayan frontier.": "当冒险家们准备出发时，尼赫-伊尔米奇和他们一起传送到位于拉彭德拉的萨奇的耐特卫士堡，就在泰雅人的边界内。",
	"Nethwatch Keep is under the command of Tharchion Eseldra Yeth. She has been tharchion of Lapendrar for nearly a century—long enough to have firsthand memories of the past rebellion.": "Nethwatch Keep是由Tharchion Eseldra Yeth指挥的。她担任拉潘德拉的酋长已近一个世纪之久，足以对过去的叛乱有第一手记忆。",
	"At the fortress, the characters are assigned to luxurious individual rooms, though the doors have no locks. Nyh Ilmichh tells anyone who asks that they are utterly safe in the tharchion's keep. The adventurers see no other living creatures until their audience with Eseldra Yeth. All the servants and staff are undead, but the food and comforts of the fortress are of excellent quality and entirely safe.": "在堡垒里，人物被分配到豪华的个人房间，尽管门没有锁。Nyh Ilmichh告诉任何询问的人，他们在萨奇恩的堡垒中是完全安全的。冒险家们在觐见埃塞尔德拉-耶斯之前，没有看到其他生物。所有的仆人和工作人员都是不死之身，但堡垒里的食物和舒适度都是优质的，而且完全安全。",
	"Tharchion Eseldra Yeth is a female human {@creature vampire} spellcaster. In the audience chamber where the meeting takes place, she is accompanied by 10 Red Wizards (use {@creature mage} statistics if necessary) and 5 {@creature Wight||wights}. Eseldra Yeth reviews the characters' warrants briefly, then delivers a prepared message.": "Tharchion Eseldra Yeth是一位女性人类（%0%）施法者。在举行会议的觐见厅里，她身边有10个红袍巫师（必要时使用（%1%）统计）和5个（%2%）。艾塞德拉-耶斯简单地审查了人物的授权书，然后发表了一个准备好的信息。",

	"The tharchion waits for the characters' response, and engages them in a discussion of what is known of the plot to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and the Red Wizards aiding that plot. Her questions are straightforward and intelligent, and offer little opportunity for sly or clever responses. If a character is less than truthful, Eseldra Yeth probes for more information. She addresses questions to specific characters, never to the group in general. If she detects a lie (see below), she never addresses that character again.": "萨奇恩等待人物的回应，并让他们参与讨论关于释放（%0%）的阴谋和协助该阴谋的红袍巫师的已知情况。她的问题直截了当，充满智慧，几乎没有机会作出狡猾或聪明的回答。如果一个角色不那么诚实，埃塞尔德拉-耶斯就会探询更多信息。她的问题是针对特定的人物，而不是针对整个团体。如果她发现了一个谎言（见下文），她就不会再向那个角色提问。",
	"Toward the end of the audience, each character must make a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. (To maintain an aura of menace, ask for the check without revealing the DC.)

	"Feel free to introduce additional modifiers based on specific arguments the characters present and their overall behavior.

	"Each answer the character gives must be accompanied by a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check if the character answers truthfully, or a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check if the response is even partially false.

The character also takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) psychic damage and does not gain the benefit of a long rest from the night's sleep.": "当一个角色成功回答了五个问题或总共八个问题时，噩梦就会结束。如果最后一个问题回答成功，这个角色会在剩下的时间里睡得很香。如果最后一个问题没有回答成功，角色就会尖叫着醒来，浑身大汗淋漓。鲜血染红了床单，尽管该角色没有明显的伤口。该角色还受到10({@dice 3d6})的精神伤害，并且不能从晚上的睡眠中获得长时间休息的好处。",
	"In the morning, any character who underwent this questioning has a deathly pallor and dark, hollow-looking eyes. The character's appearance returns to normal when he or she finishes a long rest.": "在早晨，任何接受过这种询问的人物都会出现死一般的苍白，眼睛看起来黑而空洞。当他或她完成长时间的休息后，该人物的外表就会恢复正常。",

	"What she says is determined by the number of characters who answered five questions successfully during the dream. If that number accounts for more than half the non-elven party (that is, elves don't count toward the party total, because they cannot be affected by the Red Wizards' {@spell dream} spell), Nyh Ilmichh informs the characters that the Red Wizards have agreed to aid the factions of the Sword Coast, and that she will accompany them as Thay's ambassador to the council.

	"If the tally is half the number of non-elven characters in the party or fewer, Nyh Ilmichh states that Tharchion Yeth thanks them for their information, but that Thay's attention is commanded by matters within its own borders and the Red Wizards cannot help.

A moment later, the adventurers are standing in an abandoned and ruined farmhouse a mile north of Waterdeep. The barely visible outline of a Thayan teleportation circle fades around them and their neatly packed belongings.": "如果统计结果是党内非精灵人物数量的一半或更少，Nyh Ilmichh说Tharchion Yeth感谢他们的信息，但Thay的注意力被自己境内的事情所支配，红袍巫师无法提供帮助。在人物做出反应之前，另一个人（%0%）挥了挥手，人物周围地板上的一个先前（%1%）的魔法阵就焕发了活力。片刻之后，冒险者们站在沃特迪普以北一英里处的一个废弃的破旧农舍中。勉强可见的塔扬传送阵的轮廓在他们和他们整齐的物品周围逐渐消失。",
	"If the mission to Thay was a success, it benefits the factions during chapter 17. Additionally, hidden in a backpack or pocket, each character finds a human finger bone tied to a loop of dried gut.

In the chapters leading up to this one, both the Harpers and the Zhentarim have spies among the Cult of the Dragon. As such, both organizations can report that the cult's preparations are nearing completion.

The floor of the caldera is blanketed with the bones of dragons, mounded into immense, tangled heaps.": "神龙教在很久以前就发现了龙之井。在现在休眠的火山下蜿蜒的熔岩管形成了连接洞穴的天然走廊，邪教组织将其扩大为自己所用。在中央破火山口内，他们建立了一个仪式空间，用于创造龙的仪式，这些龙被吸引到这个地方，因为它们很快就会死去。在{@creature Severin|RoT}的领导下，破火山口和它下面的地下墓穴被重新利用，作为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的巨大神庙将被升起，龙后的新统治开始。火山口的地面上铺满了龙的骨头，堆积成巨大而纠结的一堆。",
	"The caldera of the Well of Dragons is roughly oval-shaped, with high, steep walls. The dragons flying above it are not scouting for infiltrators, thankfully, but are quarreling and posturing for each other before the battle.": "龙之井的火山口大致呈椭圆形，有高而陡峭的墙壁。谢天谢地，飞在上面的龙不是在侦察渗透者，而是在争吵，在战斗前为对方摆姿势。",
	"In the past, the number of cultists at the Well of Dragons seldom exceeded one hundred. Now, with ultimate victory near at hand, their numbers have swelled. Only cultists live and work in the warrens beneath the caldera. The thousands of mercenaries, giants, devils, and monsters serving the cult are camped chiefly along the north and east slopes.": "过去，龙之井的邪教徒人数很少超过100人。现在，随着最终的胜利近在咫尺，他们的人数已经膨胀了。只有邪教徒在火山口下的战壕里生活和工作。数以千计的雇佣兵、巨人、魔鬼和为邪教服务的怪物主要在北坡和东坡扎营。",
	"The map of the caldera shows the outline of where the Temple of {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will appear when it is raised by the Red Wizards' magic. That job will be finished by the time the characters and their allies arrive to do battle with the cult.": "火山口的地图显示了（%0%）神庙被红袍巫师的魔法升起后将出现的轮廓。当人物和他们的盟友到达与邪教进行战斗时，这项工作将完成。",
	"A mind-numbing structure has pushed up from beneath the tangled bones to tower above the blasted volcano. Partly volcanic ash fused with dragon bones and partly stone imbued with the dark magic of the Nine Hells, the Temple of {@creature Tiamat|RoT} is all chaotic angles and jutting buttresses. Within that snarl of cornices and soaring angulation, you make out five asymmetric towers topped by twisted steeples.": "一个令人头疼的结构从纠结的骨头下面挤了出来，耸立在被炸毁的火山上。一部分是与龙骨融合的火山灰，一部分是被九层地狱的黑暗魔法所浸染的石头，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}神庙全是混乱的角度和突起的壁垒。在这些飞檐和高耸的角度中，你可以看到五座不对称的塔楼，顶部是扭曲的尖塔。",
	"Lava tubes form natural pathways beneath the caldera of the extinct volcano. Over the decades since the Cult of the Dragon claimed the Well of Dragons, cultists enlarged the natural caverns connected by the lava tubes and excavated new ones.": "熔岩管在死火山的破火山口下形成天然通道。自从神龙教宣称拥有龙之井以来的几十年里，邪教分子扩大了由熔岩管连接的天然洞穴，并挖掘了新的洞穴。",
	"Most of the lava tube entrances are marked by visible paths along the slopes of the volcano. {@area Entrance 2A |1f9|x} sees little use, so the characters are likely to overlook it without a careful search. Entrance 3 is never used; the cult believes that this tunnel is still blocked after a collapse sixty years before.": "大多数熔岩管的入口都有明显的路径标志，沿着火山的山坡。{@area Entrance 2A |1f9|x}很少看到使用，所以人物不仔细搜索很可能会忽略它。3号入口从未被使用过；邪教认为这条隧道在六十年前的坍塌后仍然被封锁。",
	"The lava tubes range from 15 to 25 feet in diameter. They are large enough for dracoliches and dragons to move through easily.": "熔岩管的直径从15到25英尺不等。它们大到足以让龙虾和龙轻松通过。",
	"The lava tube corridors are dimly lit by lamps or torches hung on the walls at wide intervals. Chambers within the Well of Dragons are brightly lit by lamps unless otherwise noted.": "熔岩管走廊上每隔一段距离就有一盏灯或火把挂在墙上，光线很暗。除非另有说明，龙之井内的房间都有明亮的灯光。",
	"The sound of the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} constantly moans throughout the Well of Dragons, originating from {@area area 8|201|x}. Combined with the cult's activity in and above the caverns, it creates a constant thrum of background noise transmitted through the stone. Sounds of combat go unnoticed if a fight is over in 3 rounds or fewer, or if the combat is more than 200 feet away from creatures that might hear it. Especially loud noises, such as a {@spell thunderwave} spell, are easily heard.": "龙之井里不断传出{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的呻吟声，源自{@area area 8|201|x}。再加上邪教组织在洞穴内和洞穴上方的活动，它创造了一个持续的背景噪音，通过石头传播。如果战斗在3个回合或更短的时间内结束，或者如果战斗距离可能听到的生物超过200英尺，那么战斗的声音就不会被注意到。特别响亮的声音，如{@spell thunderwave}的咒语，很容易被听到。",
	"As the time for the ritual draws near, the Well of Dragons is crawling with cultists and their allies. Whether using stealth or disguising themselves as cultists, the characters can easily survey the entrances to the lava tubes or see the risen temple from the edge of the caldera. However, once the adventurers enter the Well of Dragons, disguises prove ineffective. The cultists working in and patrolling the caverns are on high alert, and use a complex system of checks and passwords as proof against spies and enemy agents.": "随着仪式时间的临近，龙之井里爬满了邪教分子和他们的盟友。无论是使用隐身术还是伪装成邪教徒，角色们都可以轻易地勘察熔岩管道的入口，或者从火山口的边缘看到上升的神庙。然而，一旦冒险者进入龙之井，伪装就会失效。在洞穴中工作和巡逻的邪教人员处于高度警戒状态，他们使用复杂的检查和密码系统来防止间谍和敌方特工。",
	"The advanced state of the ritual means that all cultists have been ordered to patrol or prepare for battle. If the characters tarry too long in one place or wander around the Well of Dragons without purpose, add additional guard patrols based on existing encounters.": "仪式的高级状态意味着所有邪教徒都被命令去巡逻或准备战斗。如果角色们在一个地方耽搁太久，或者毫无目的地在龙之井周围徘徊，那么就根据现有的遭遇增加额外的警卫巡逻。",
	"Entrance 1A sees the heaviest use of all the tunnel entrances along the north side of the caldera. All the treasure brought to the Well of Dragons passes through it on the way to {@area area 6|1fd|x} or {@area area 7|200|x}. Each of these entrances is guarded by 3 {@creature Dragonwing|HotDQ|dragonwings}, 3 {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws}, and 2 {@creature Guard Drake|HotDQ|guard drakes} (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12} for these creatures statistics).": "在火山口北侧的所有隧道入口中，1A入口的使用最为频繁。所有运往龙之井的财宝都要经过它，才能到达（%0%）或（%1%）。每个入口都有3个(2%)、3个(3%)和2个(4%)守卫（见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}这些生物的统计数据）。",

	"Of the tunnel entrances on the east side of the caldera, only 2C is heavily used. All the prisoners held in the warrens are brought through that tunnel on their way to areas {@area 16|20a|x}, {@area 17|20a|x}, or {@area 18|20a|x}. Entrance 2A is seldom used. Entrance 2B is used by the cultists who live in areas {@area 12|207|x} and {@area 13|207|x}, but by no one else.": "在火山口东侧的隧道入口中，只有2C号隧道被大量使用。所有被关押在战壕里的囚犯在前往{@area 16|20a|x}、{@area 17|20a|x}或{@area 18|20a|x}地区的路上都要经过该隧道。2A入口很少使用。住在{@area 12|207|x}和{@area 13|207|x}地区的邪教徒使用2B入口，但没有其他人使用。",

	"No cultist has used this entrance since the tunnel collapsed at the three-way intersection sixty years ago, rendering the passageway useless. Recently, an umber hulk burrowed by accident into these tunnels, reopening the passage in all three directions. As a result, this tunnel offers an unguarded entrance into the caldera and the warrens.": "自从六十年前隧道在三叉路口坍塌，使通道失去作用后，就没有邪教徒使用这个入口了。最近，一个黄褐色的大块头意外地钻进了这些隧道，重新打开了三个方向的通道。因此，这条隧道提供了一个进入火山口和战地的无人看守的入口。",
	"A character who scouts the mountain before charging in notices this entrance with a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any exploration of the entrance reveals that it is used by bats but shows no sign of cult activity.": "一个在冲锋陷阵前侦查过这座山的人物会注意到这个入口，并成功通过DC12智力（（%0%））或智慧（（%1%））的检查。对这个入口的任何探索都会发现它是由蝙蝠使用的，但没有显示出邪教活动的迹象。",
	"A thin wall of rubble still standing to the east of the three-way intersection makes the cultists believe the passage remains completely blocked. However, the wall can be carefully taken down to allow movement in that direction. Characters at the three-way intersection can feel air moving along the northern part of the tunnel, suggesting open space beyond.": "在三叉路口的东边仍有一堵薄薄的瓦砾墙，使邪教徒们认为通道仍然完全被封锁。然而，这堵墙可以被小心翼翼地拆掉，以允许在那个方向移动。在三叉路口的人物可以感觉到空气沿着通道的北部移动，这表明通道之外有开放的空间。",
	"Before {@creature Severin|RoT} assumed control over the Cult of the Dragon, the Well of Dragons was used to transform dying dragons into dracoliches. {@creature Naergoth Bladelord|RoT} (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12} for statistics) is a wight who commanded this site for centuries in the name of the Cult of the Dragon. After devoting many lifetimes of selfless service to the cult, he was shunted aside in favor of the new order. Though his loyalty remains unshakeable, Naergoth fears that {@creature Severin|RoT} will succeed in his plans, and that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will destroy the cult that freed her.": "在{@creature Severin|RoT}控制龙之崇拜之前，龙之井被用来将垂死的龙变成龙人。(%%1%)（统计数字见(%%2%)）是一个巫师，他以龙之教的名义指挥了这个地方几个世纪。在为该教派奉献了许多次无私的服务后，他被甩到一边，转而支持新的秩序。虽然他的忠诚仍然不可动摇，但纳戈斯担心{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划会成功，而且{@creature Tiamat|RoT}会摧毁解放她的邪教。",
	"As a wight, Naergoth has little use for quarters, but the presence of objects that belonged to him in life make this a pleasing spot for him. The chamber looks like the home of a noble knight that was abandoned centuries ago, its contents now covered in dust and hung with cobwebs and pathos.": "作为一个巫师，纳戈斯对宿舍没有什么用处，但生活中属于他的物品的存在使这里成为他的一个愉悦的地方。这间密室看起来就像几百年前被遗弃的贵族骑士的家，里面的东西现在被灰尘覆盖，挂满了蜘蛛网和悲怆。",

	"If all the above penalties are successfully applied, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} is effectively reduced to a challenge rating 18 foe—but that's still a deadly fight for four 15th-level characters. Without all five reductions, the characters stand little chance of surviving a battle against the Dragon Queen, much less winning it.": "如果上述所有的惩罚都被成功应用，{@creature Tiamat|RoT}实际上被降低到挑战等级18的敌人--但这对四个15级的角色来说仍然是一场致命的战斗。如果没有这五项减免，这些角色在与龙后的战斗中几乎没有生存的机会，更不用说获胜了。",
	"If the characters reduce {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to 0 hit points, her Discorporation trait kicks in. The portal collapses as the shrieking Dragon Queen disintegrates and is dragged back to Avernus. She will remain trapped there until someone else can recreate the conditions of the ritual and try again to free her.": "如果角色的命中率降低（%0%）到0，她的Discorporation特性就会启动。当尖叫的龙后瓦解时，传送门崩溃了，她被拖回了阿弗纳斯。她将继续被困在那里，直到有人能够重新创造仪式的条件并再次尝试释放她。",
	"Except as noted above, {@creature Tiamat|RoT} should not be arbitrarily weakened in the interest of a fair fight. Presenting the Dragon Queen as anything less than a deity undercuts the whole adventure. Characters who tangle with {@creature Tiamat|RoT} must know that they are in the fight of their lives.": "除了上面提到的，（%0%）不应该为了公平的战斗而被任意削弱。如果把龙后说成是一个神，就会削弱整个冒险的意义。与{@creature Tiamat|RoT}纠缠的角色必须知道他们是在为自己的生命而战。",
	"No individual's survival matters against the goal of stopping the Dragon Queen's return, and heroes sometimes die for the greater good.

	"None of the Dragon Queen's mortal agents receive the rewards they expected. The Red Wizards who freed her are devoured or driven away, hunted by the forces of Szass Tam. The cultists who orchestrated {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return fare little better, with the Dragon Queen not caring which mortals her draconic subjects hunt, consume, and enslave. The glorious reign of dragons that {@creature Severin|RoT} hoped to usher in and rule becomes a brutal world where evil dragons dominate all.": "龙女王的凡人特工没有一个得到他们期望的回报。释放她的红袍巫师被吞噬或赶走，被萨斯-谭的势力追杀。策划{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回归的邪教徒们的情况也好不到哪里去，龙后并不在乎她的龙族臣民猎杀、吞噬和奴役哪些凡人。(1%)希望迎来并统治的辉煌的龙的统治变成了一个邪恶的龙主宰一切的残酷世界。",
	"Such dark times need not mean the end of your campaign, however. The characters have lost a crucial battle, but they might survive to continue the war. Their new goal is to find a way to banish or destroy {@creature Tiamat|RoT} for good, bringing peace to the world once more.": "然而，这样的黑暗时期并不意味着你的活动的结束。角色们失去了一场关键的战斗，但他们可能会幸存下来，继续进行战争。他们的新目标是找到放逐或消灭{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的好办法，为世界再一次带来和平。",
	"{@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s threat ends if she is sent back to the Nine Hells, but the aftermath of victory can create challenges the adventurers must deal with. This includes helping the hundreds of prisoners remaining in the Well of Dragons. {@creature Severin|RoT}'s fall also leaves hundreds of unrepentant cultists still loose in the world, hungering for power and revenge in light of their recent failure.": "{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的威胁结束，如果她被送回九层地狱，但胜利的后果会给冒险家们带来必须处理的挑战。这包括帮助留在龙之井中的数百名囚犯。(1%)的陨落也让数百名不知悔改的邪教徒仍然逍遥法外，鉴于他们最近的失败，他们渴望权力和复仇。",
	"Moreover, much of the wealth of the Sword Coast is sitting in the Well of Dragons. Along with dealing with vengeful cultists, the characters might take a lead role in getting the treasure back to its original owners or their next of kin, while dealing with con artists, thieves, and treasure hunters looking to exploit what has suddenly become the richest dungeon in Faerûn.": "此外，剑海岸的许多财富都在龙之井中。在处理复仇的邪教徒的同时，这些角色可能会在将宝藏送回原主或其近亲的过程中发挥主导作用，同时还要对付那些想要利用突然成为法鲁恩最富有的地下城的骗子、小偷和寻宝者。",
	"Among the cult's former allies, the vindictive chromatic dragons scatter back to their lairs, but only after many of them try to claim choice pieces of treasure or barrels bulging with gold and gems from the cult's hoard. Furious at having their queen vanquished, the chromatic dragons might engage in sprees of destruction not seen in Faerûn for centuries.": "在邪教的前盟友中，报复心极强的半身龙会分散回它们的巢穴，但这只是在它们中的许多人试图从邪教的囤积物中索取精选的宝物或装满黄金和宝石的桶之后。愤怒于他们的女王被征服，色龙们可能会进行几个世纪以来在法鲁恩从未见过的疯狂破坏。",
	"Even victorious, the armies of good will have paid a steep cost in the fight against {@creature Tiamat|RoT}. In addition to soldiers, leaders representing the ruling nobility of countless regions and houses will have fallen in the fight. The situation is not all bleak, however. Stirring instances of generosity and cooperation will stand out amid the darkness—and none of those will be greater than the legend of the adventurers. For generations, folk will look to the exploits and sacrifices of the heroes for inspiration as they rebuild and set their sights on better days.": "即使取得了胜利，正义的军队也将在与{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的斗争中付出沉重的代价。除了士兵之外，代表无数地区和家族的统治贵族的领导人也将在战斗中倒下。然而，情况并不都是暗淡的。慷慨和合作的激动人心的事例将在黑暗中脱颖而出--其中最伟大的莫过于冒险家的传奇。几代人都会从英雄们的功绩和牺牲中获得灵感，因为他们要重建家园，把目光投向更美好的未来。",
