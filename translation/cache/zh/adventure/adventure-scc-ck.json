	"In this adventure, the characters explore campus as first-year students. They'll navigate orientation at the Biblioplex and settle into social life in rowdy gathering spots. They'll get roped into a thrilling dare. They'll watch—and maybe even take part in—an outdoor play and discover something jarring in a marsh adjacent to the campus. And along the way, hints of something sinister emerge. Danger crops up in the most unassuming places, and the characters must rise to the occasion. Will they become campus heroes? Or will these kerfuffles explode into something that threatens all of Strixhaven?": "在这次冒险中，角色们将作为一年级学生探索校园。他们将在图书馆的迎新活动中穿梭，并在喧闹的聚会场所融入社会生活。他们会被卷入一场惊心动魄的冒险。他们将观看，甚至可能参与户外表演，并在校园附近的沼泽地发现一些令人震惊的东西。在这一过程中，出现了一些险恶的暗示。危险出现在最不起眼的地方，而这些人物必须迎难而上。他们会成为校园英雄吗？或者这些争吵会爆发出威胁到整个Strixhaven的东西？",

	"The strange happenings on campus in this adventure are caused by a corrupted substance known as eldritch balm. Used at Strixhaven for decades, eldritch balm is an alchemical salve made from the sludgy, acidic waters of Sedgemoor, the bayou that encompasses the Witherbloom College campus. Once these waters undergo an alchemical process in Witherbloom's faculty laboratories, the resulting eldritch balm is used to magically treat and strengthen objects, from storage trunks to cooking vats to stage props and more. The balm's effects differ depending on the objects treated, but it typically provides resistance to certain types of damage or other protections useful on a campus where magic often goes awry.": "在这次冒险中，校园里发生的怪事是由一种被称为eldritch balm的腐败物质引起的。eldritch balm在Strixhaven使用了几十年，是一种炼金术药膏，由Sedgemoor的淤泥和酸性水制成，Sedgemoor是包括Witherbloom学院校园的河口。一旦这些水在威瑟布洛姆学院的实验室里经历了炼金过程，产生的长生不老药膏就会被用来神奇地治疗和强化物体，从储藏箱到烹饪桶到舞台道具等等。膏药的效果因处理的物体而异，但它通常提供对某些类型的损害的抵抗力或其他保护，在一个魔法经常出错的校园里很有用。",
	"Unknown to anyone on campus, Sedgemoor's waters were recently corrupted by the foul magic practiced by {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} Grenshel, the villain the characters ultimately confront in {@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}. {@creature Murgaxor|SCC} intended the eldritch balm to be affected by his sinister experiments and hoped the resulting chaos would disrupt life at Strixhaven.": "校园里的人都不知道，塞奇摩尔的水最近被{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}Grenshel施展的邪恶魔法腐蚀了，Grenshel是{@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}中人物最终面对的恶棍。{@creature Murgaxor|SCC}打算让长生不老药受到他邪恶实验的影响，并希望由此产生的混乱能扰乱斯特里克斯海文的生活。",

	"Once the frogs are no longer threats, a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that the frogs belched out a strange, black oily substance just before they grew in size and attacked.

	"The rules are simple: lob a sphere from the wizard gizzard and have the sphere land inside the bucket on the floor. The game takes 1 minute to play, and the character who lands the most spheres in the bucket during that minute wins the game. To determine how many spheres a character lands in the bucket, have the character make a Dexterity ({@skill Arcana}) check and divide the total by 3 (round down). If two or more characters land the same number of spheres in the bucket, have those characters repeat the check during a tiebreaker round. Continue to run tiebreaker rounds until one character wins.": "规则很简单：从巫师的胃里抛出一个球体，让球体落在地上的桶里。游戏需要1分钟，在这1分钟内将球体落入桶内最多的角色赢得游戏。要确定一个角色有多少球体落入桶中，让该角色做一个灵巧（（%0%））检查，然后将总数除以3（向下取整）。如果两个或更多的角色在桶中落下相同数量的球体，让这些角色在决胜轮中重复检查。继续进行决胜轮，直到一个角色获胜。",

	"Before and after the game, characters might mingle with other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a {@adventure Relationship encounter|SCC-CK|0|Using These Rules}, as described in those rules. For example, a character who loses the game but is gracious toward the winner might earn the winner's respect and seed a friendship.": "在游戏之前和之后，角色可能会与其他学生打成一片。如果有的学生希望获得关系分，就把它当作{@adventure Relationship encounter|SCC-CK|0|Using These Rules}，如这些规则中所述。例如，一个输了游戏但对赢家很亲切的角色可能会赢得赢家的尊重并播下友谊的种子。",

As soon as the mephits are dispatched, the magic flaring up in the kitchen fades.": "人物一出现，敌对的梅菲特就开始攻击，但它们并不是厨房里唯一的威胁。可怕的大量被召唤出来的闪电虫突然从食物准备区的袋子和盒子里涌出来，就在其他学生冲进人物身后的厨房时。当角色们对付更危险的Mephits时，描述他们的朋友和同学们在后台与他们一起工作，帮助把虫子从厨房里清除出去。一旦梅菲特被赶走，厨房里的魔法就会消失。",
	"If all the characters fall {@condition unconscious} during the fight, Tulk shows up at the start of the next round and dispatches the mephits. Tulk has two {@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing} stored behind the servers' station, and he offers them to any injured characters. If the discussion turns to what happened, Tulk explains that sometimes Curtie's culinary experiments go awry, so such chaos in the kitchen isn't unheard of. For her part, Curtie insists that the mephits were not part of any new recipe test, and that they came out of nowhere.": "如果在战斗中所有的角色都倒下了{@condition unconscious}，图尔克会在下一轮开始时出现，并打发掉这些梅菲特。图尔克有两个{@item Potion of Healing||potions of healing}储存在服务器站后面，他把它们提供给任何受伤的角色。如果讨论转向发生了什么，图尔克解释说，有时库尔蒂的烹饪实验会出错，所以厨房里的这种混乱不是没有发生过的。就她而言，库尔蒂坚持认为，梅菲特不是任何新配方测试的一部分，它们是突然出现的。",
	"Once the mephits are dispatched, a successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals the same oily black substance on the cauldrons that the characters might have seen belched out by the frogs before the Firejolt Café race and found on the trunk during orientation.
