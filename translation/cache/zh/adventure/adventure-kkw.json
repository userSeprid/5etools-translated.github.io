Adventurers can be affiliated with any of the guilds.": "\"{@creature Krenko|KKW}之路 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合4至6名1级冒险者，他们在冒险结束时可能会提升到2级。它的背景是拉夫尼卡的第十区，可以作为该设定的入门冒险。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。冒险者可以隶属于任何一个行会。",
	"{@creature Krenko|KKW} is the boss of a notorious goblin mob, and he has made his fortune and built his reputation by mostly staying out of the guilds' way. He has managed to cause no end of trouble for the citizens of the Tenth District, but not without attracting the attention of the guilds. A cunning opportunist, {@creature Krenko|KKW} has spent years consolidating goblin street rabble into his fiercely loyal gang. He cultivated connections among the ruthless and powerful, specializing in high-value theft and mayhem. At the apex of his influence, he got into a nasty turf war with the Shattergang Brothers, a rival goblin gang that often deals in illicit arms. Rumors swirled that {@creature Krenko|KKW} killed Dargig, the youngest of the three brothers, after a weapons drop went bad.": "{@creature Krenko|KKW}是一个臭名昭著的地精暴徒的老板，他主要是通过远离行会的方式发家致富并建立自己的声誉。他设法给第十区的市民带来了无穷的麻烦，但也不免引起了各大公会的注意。作为一个狡猾的机会主义者，(1%)多年来一直在巩固地精街头的乌合之众，使之成为他忠诚的团伙。他在无情和强大的人中培养关系，专门从事高价值的盗窃和破坏活动。在他的影响力达到顶点时，他与破碎岗兄弟（Shattergang Brothers）陷入了一场恶劣的地盘战争，这是一个经常从事非法武器交易的敌对地精团伙。有传言说，(2%)在一次武器投放失败后，杀死了三兄弟中最年轻的达吉。",
	"The remaining two brothers, Rikkig and Gardagig, attempted to kill {@creature Krenko|KKW} in retaliation for the death of their kin. Before they could do the deed, {@creature Krenko|KKW} was apprehended by the Boros Legion and thrown into Sawtooth Prison—near the legion's headquarters of Sunhome—to spend the rest of his life behind bars. But someone as well connected as {@creature Krenko|KKW} has ways of shortening his own sentence.": "剩下的两个兄弟，里基格和加达基格，试图杀死{@creature Krenko|KKW}以报复他们的亲属的死亡。在他们动手之前，(1%)被博罗军团逮捕，并被扔进锯齿监狱--靠近军团总部Sunhom--在监狱里度过他的余生。但像{@creature Krenko|KKW}这样有关系的人有办法缩短自己的刑期。",
	"Inciting a riot in prison secured him a transfer to Udzec, a maximum-security facility in Precinct Two of the Tenth District, administered by the Azorius Senate. During the transfer, agents of a former associate of {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s created a distraction, and he was able to slip away to rendezvous with his gang. He now plots his next move as he reestablishes power over his criminal enterprise.": "在监狱里煽动暴乱，使他被转移到乌泽克，一个位于第十区第二选区的最高安全设施，由阿佐里乌斯参议院管理。在转移过程中，{@creature Krenko|KKW}的一个前同伙的特工制造了一个分心，他得以溜走，与他的团伙会合。现在他正在策划下一步行动，因为他要重新建立对其犯罪企业的权力。",
	"{@creature Krenko|KKW}'s escape is no small matter.

	"Not every villain in a Ravnica campaign is a member of a guild, and not every scheme originates in the guildhalls. As you build your own adventures in Ravnica, you can use the suggestions in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for creating villains to craft a guildless villain, one who prefers the independence of operating outside the guild structure or even seeks to undermine that structure entirely. More often than not, though, the guilds turn out to be involved in the schemes of even minor villains.": "在拉夫尼卡的战役中，并非每个反派都是公会成员，也并非每个计划都源自公会。当你在拉夫尼卡建立自己的冒险时，你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于创建反派的建议来制作一个无公会的反派，一个喜欢在公会结构之外独立行动，甚至试图完全破坏这种结构的人。不过，更多时候，公会会被证明参与了甚至是小反派的计划。",

	"The adventure begins at Sawtooth Prison as the party is summoned by Nassius Ven, an official from the Chamber of the Guildpact.

	"The characters can retrace the route of the transfer, interview the guards for more information, and use their contacts in the city to find out more about {@creature Krenko|KKW}.

	"Eventually, the adventurers find {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s hideout: a warehouse near a canal. A final showdown with the goblin mob boss, his retinue, and possible Shattergang interlopers ensues.

	"At the beginning of the adventure, you can roll a patron from the table below, or you can choose one (preferably a guild that isn't represented by an adventurer in the party). The patron affects the story of {@creature Krenko|KKW}'s escape in a specific way (as indicated following the table) and, if you so choose, might influence future adventures.": "在冒险开始时，你可以从下表中掷出一个赞助人，或者你可以选择一个（最好是党内没有冒险者代表的公会）。这个赞助人会以特定的方式影响{@creature Krenko|KKW}的逃亡故事（如下表所示），如果你选择的话，可能会影响未来的冒险。",

	"Life in the Tenth District is never dull. A hub of constant activity, it always offers a new opportunity, a new challenge, a new intrigue.

	"This is Nassius Ven, a vedalken {@creature noble} and a proctor from the office of the Guildpact. While the Azorius and Boros help maintain the law and keep the peace, the office of the Guildpact tries to help quell disputes between the guilds while the Living Guildpact is away.

	"Nassius is evasive about any questions regarding why {@creature Krenko|KKW} shouldn't be interrogated or why the characters should bring him to the granary.

A heavy wooden table stands in the center of the room, ringed by six chairs. Under it is an iron box. To the south is a cot covered in blankets. Beside it is a sack full of clothes and the remains of several meals served on fine dinnerware.

Dozens of large boxes and crates are scattered around the warehouse, their integrity in question due to fire damage. A pair of wooden rails runs through the center of the room. On the rails sits a giant wooden wheeled cart. Towering over the cart is a ten-foot-high, soot-stained iron statue. It looks vaguely humanoid, with claw-like appendages at the ends of its arms. In place of its head is a cavity containing a seat with a series of levers all around it.": "一条猫道环绕着内部，离地面20英尺高。楼梯通向东墙中心附近。几十个大箱子和板条箱散落在仓库周围，由于火灾损坏，它们的完整性受到了质疑。一对木制轨道穿过房间的中心。栏杆上坐着一辆巨大的木制轮子车。车上耸立着一个10英尺高、沾满烟灰的铁质雕像。它看起来有点像人，手臂的末端有爪子一样的附属物。在它的头的地方有一个空洞，里面有一个座位，周围有一系列的杠杆。",

	"Near the cart is a {@creature loading rig|kkw} covered in soot and currently inactive. A seat cavity built into the top the rig contains a series of small plates and levers. A creature in the seat can attempt a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to figure out how to press the plates in the correct sequence to activate or deactivate the rig. Pressing the plates requires an action. Once the rig is activated, a creature in the seat can pilot it using the levers. The rig moves as its controller directs it, and the controller can use an action to direct the rig to take the Dash, Disengage, or {@action Dodge} action, or the Multiattack or Slam actions as given in its stat block.": "在小车附近有一个{@creature loading rig|kkw}被烟尘覆盖，目前没有活动。钻机顶部有一个空腔，里面有一系列的小板和杠杆。坐在座位上的生物可以尝试用DC10智力（（%1%））检查来找出如何以正确的顺序按压板子来激活或关闭设备。按压板子需要一个动作。一旦装备被激活，坐在座位上的生物可以使用杠杆来驾驶它。控制者可以使用一个行动来指示钻机采取冲刺、脱离或（2%）行动，或者按照其状态块中给出的多重攻击或猛击行动。",

	"{@creature Krenko|KKW} doesn't offer up any information on the allies that aided him in his escape, but he identifies them if pressed.

Nassius steps out of the entryway into the field, holding a small purse and flanked by two heavily armed guards.": "当雨势加剧为倾盆大雨时，你前往第十区的郊区。你被指引到纳西乌斯挑选的旧粮仓作为集合点。这座湿漉漉、摇摇欲坠的粘土建筑坐落在一片无人问津的田野上，长满了各种植被，几乎完全被野地开垦。纳西欧斯从入口处走出来，走进田野，手里拿着一个小钱包，身旁是两个全副武装的卫兵。",

	"Nassius doesn't answer any questions about where he's taking {@creature Krenko|KKW}, nor does he address the veracity of any claims of corruption.
