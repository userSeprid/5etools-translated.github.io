Twenty mascots occupy the stage, with each campus represented: two {@creature Art Elemental Mascot|SCC|art elementals} from Prismari, two {@creature Fractal Mascot|SCC|fractals} from Quandrix, two {@creature Inkling Mascot|SCC|inklings} from Silverquill, four {@creature Spirit Statue Mascot|SCC|spirit statues} from Lorehold, and ten {@creature Pest Mascot|SCC|pests}.": "一旦人物到达现场，拿着害虫诱饵的学生就会去喂害虫。20个吉祥物占据了舞台，每个校园都有代表：棱堡的两个{@creature Art Elemental Mascot|SCC|art elementals}，昆德拉克斯的两个{@creature Fractal Mascot|SCC|fractals}，银奎尔的两个{@creature Inkling Mascot|SCC|inklings}，洛雷霍德的四个{@creature Spirit Statue Mascot|SCC|spirit statues}，以及十个{@creature Pest Mascot|SCC|pests}。",

The students recently discovered it's a harmless snack that keeps pests docile, allowing anyone to play with the normally flighty mascots.": "学生们为害虫调制的诱饵是由糖浆与取自Witherbloom校园的蘑菇混合而成。学生们最近发现这是一种无害的零食，可以让害虫保持温顺，让任何人都可以和这些通常会逃跑的吉祥物玩耍。",
	"The students standing beside the stage hold wands that are ordinary spellcasting focuses imbued with a limited telekinesis-like effect. When pointed at a mascot within 5 feet, a wand magically lifts the mascot, places it atop another adjacent mascot, and stabilizes the stacked mascots. The mascots might still topple over afterward, but the wands allow the students to stack the mascots without having to physically manipulate them.": "站在舞台旁边的学生手持魔杖，这些魔杖是普通的施法焦点，被赋予了有限的类似心灵感应的效果。当指向5英尺内的吉祥物时，魔杖会神奇地抬起吉祥物，将其放在另一个相邻的吉祥物上，并稳定堆叠的吉祥物。吉祥物之后可能还是会翻倒，但魔杖允许学生在不需要物理操作的情况下堆叠吉祥物。",
	"In this game, the other mascots jovially participate in the stacking contest. The spirit statues offer to serve as each stack's base. The art elementals, fractals, and inklings gleefully wait to be piled on the stacks while the pests snack away, oblivious to the game.": "在这个游戏中，其他吉祥物欢快地参与到堆叠比赛中。精神雕像提供了作为每个堆叠的基础。艺术元素、分形体和inklings高兴地等待着被堆放，而害虫们则在一旁吃东西，对游戏视而不见。",
	"Stacking mascots without the creatures toppling over is a major bragging right, and the characters have the opportunity of earning that now.": "叠加吉祥物而不使其倾倒是一项重要的吹嘘权利，而人物现在有机会赢得这一权利了。",
	"Further, Greta Gorunn (chaotic good dwarf {@creature Lorehold apprentice|SCC}; see {@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0|Greta Gorunn}) has offered a {@item belt of dwarvenkind} as the prize for this contest. Her parents sent her the belt as a gift, but she thinks it's more fun to offer the belt as a trophy.": "此外，格雷塔-戈伦（混乱善良的矮人（%0%）；见（%1%））提供了一条（%2%）作为本次比赛的奖品。她的父母把腰带作为礼物送给她，但她认为把腰带作为战利品更有趣。",
	"In this contest, up to four teams of two students apiece race to create the highest stack of gathered mascots. At least one team should consist of NPC students, and you should make rolls for them. If the characters have Rivals, two of them form this opposing team. If not, choose students from the \"{@adventure Fellow Students|SCC-CK|0|Fellow Students}\" section in {@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}.": "在这场比赛中，最多四支队伍，每支队伍由两名学生组成，比赛创造出最高堆积的吉祥物。至少有一队应该由NPC学生组成，你应该为他们做卷。如果角色有 \"对手\"，他们中的两个人就组成这个对立的队伍。如果没有，就从{@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}中的\"{@adventure Fellow Students|SCC-CK|0|Fellow Students} \"部分选择学生。",

	"As noted above, each mascot-stacking team has two members, each of whom uses a wand. To determine which team stacks the most mascots, have each member of the team make one ability check of their choice, chosen from the following options: Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}), Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}), or Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}). Record the check totals for each team member, then combine them for each team. The team with the highest combined total wins the game.": "如上所述，每个叠加吉祥物的团队有两名成员，每人使用一根魔杖。为了确定哪支队伍叠加的吉祥物最多，让队伍中的每个成员自选一个能力检查，从以下选项中选择。灵活性({@skill Sleight of Hand})，智力({@skill Arcana})，或智慧({@skill Animal Handling})。记录每个队员的检定总数，然后将每队的检定总数合并。合并总数最高的一队赢得比赛。",
	"For example, if one member of a team gets a total of 16 on their Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check to expertly point their wand and the other member gets a total of 20 on their Wisdom ({@skill Animal Handling}) check to stack the mascots comfortably, their combined total is 36—and they win the game if no other team has a higher total.": "例如，如果一个团队的一个成员在他们的灵巧（{@skill Sleight of Hand}）检查中得到16分，以熟练地指向他们的魔杖，另一个成员在他们的智慧（{@skill Animal Handling}）检查中得到20分，以舒适地堆放吉祥物，他们的总和是36--如果没有其他团队有更高的总和，他们赢得比赛。",
	"If there's a tie, add a tiebreaker round or use your discretion to determine the winner.": "如果出现平局，就增加一个决胜轮，或由你来决定胜负。",
	"During this game, characters might mingle with the other students. If there are students the characters wish to earn Relationship Points with, treat this as a Relationship encounter, as described in the rules found in the \"Relationships\" section in {@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}. Have players note the results of this encounter on their tracking sheets.": "在这个游戏中，角色可能会与其他学生混在一起。如果有学生希望获得关系点数，就将其视为关系遭遇，如{@adventure chapter 3|SCC-CK|0}中 \"关系 \"部分的规则所描述。让玩家在他们的跟踪表上记下这次相遇的结果。",
	"As the winning team is declared, the pests in the mascot stacks suddenly transform into a hostile creature. Read or paraphrase the following:": "当宣布获胜的队伍时，吉祥物堆里的害虫突然变成了一种敌对的生物。阅读或解读以下内容。",
	"The cheering from the students on the Rose Stage suddenly turns to panicked shouts. The normal croaking, chirruping, and screeching of pests turns into guttural groans. The pests amalgamate, their bodies fusing into a multiheaded whole, while the other mascots scatter. The fused creature roars, spewing spittle from one of its heads. Everyone on stage is in danger!": "玫瑰舞台上的学生们的欢呼声突然变成了惊慌失措的叫喊声。害虫们正常的呱呱叫、啾啾声和尖叫声变成了阴森森的呻吟声。害虫们融合在一起，它们的身体融合成一个多头的整体，而其他吉祥物则散开。融合后的生物咆哮着，从它的一个头中喷出唾液。舞台上的每个人都处于危险之中!",
	"The amalgamated pests move as a single creature in {@adventure area R3|SCC-CK|0|R3. Main Stage} of the Rose Stage. The creature threatens an opposing team of mascot-stackers, and it uses the stat block of a {@creature chimera}, though it doesn't have a breath weapon. Because it's evening, the lighting in all areas of the Rose Stage is dim. The gathered students and other mascots flee or hide, and it's up to the characters to face this threat.": "合并后的害虫在玫瑰舞台的（%0%）中作为单一生物移动。该生物威胁着对方的吉祥物堆积队，它使用（%1%）的状态块，尽管它没有呼吸武器。因为是晚上，玫瑰舞台所有区域的灯光都很暗。聚集在一起的学生和其他吉祥物纷纷逃离或躲藏起来，而面对这种威胁，就要看人物的表现了。",
	"Once the characters reduce the amalgamated creature to 0 hit points, it collapses into its component pests, which look at the characters and blink in confusion. The pests appear unharmed by the event.": "一旦角色们将合并的生物减少到0点命中率，它就会崩溃成其组成部分的害虫，这些害虫看着角色们，困惑地眨眼。这些害虫看起来没有受到伤害。",
	"Pests don't normally amalgamate and turn hostile, then transform back into harmless pests. If the characters examine the pests after the amalgamation is defeated, a successful DC 16 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals little pools of regurgitated bait on the floor near the pests. Mixed in the pools are small, sharp pieces of same chitin found in {@adventure area W5|SCC-HfMT|0|W5. Southern Clearing} near Wiltroot Hall. The pests ingested this chitin, leading to their strange transformation.": "害虫通常不会合体并变成敌意，然后再变回无害的害虫。如果人物在合体被打败后检查害虫，成功通过DC16智力（（%0%））检查，就会发现害虫附近的地板上有一些反刍的诱饵。池子里混有小块的、尖锐的甲壳素，与在威尔特罗特大厅附近的{@adventure area W5|SCC-HfMT|0|W5. Southern Clearing}发现的一样。害虫们摄入了这种甲壳素，导致了它们的奇怪转变。",
	"Once the characters resolve the altercation with the amalgamated mascots, the party on the Rose Stage resumes. Before the characters leave the area, Rosie Wuzfeddlims (chaotic good gnome {@creature Lorehold apprentice|SCC}; see {@book chapter 7|SCC|8|Lorehold Apprentice}) approaches them. The gnome announces that Aerojaunt Field is reserved for the characters' Mage Tower team to practice.": "一旦人物解决了与合体吉祥物的争吵，玫瑰舞台上的聚会就会恢复。在角色们离开这个区域之前，罗西-伍兹费德林斯（混沌的好地精（%0%）；见（%1%））走近他们。侏儒宣布Aerojaunt场地保留给人物的法师塔团队练习。",
	"The characters' designated practice slot is at the end of this week. As a student referee, Rosie is tasked with helping the characters learn the rules of Mage Tower and the game's basic techniques.

	"Aerojaunt Field was once the university's primary sports field. Now, years after the construction of Strixhaven Stadium, the field sees far less use.

	"However, less competitive teams hold their matches on this field, most notably the Intramural Silkball Club. The elevated ramps used in silkball matches were permanently built into Aerojaunt Field, whose name evokes a popular silkball move that involves using magic to hop through the air.": "然而，竞争力较弱的球队也在这个场地上举行比赛，最引人注目的是校内丝球俱乐部。丝绸球比赛中使用的高架坡道被永久地建在Aerojaunt场地上，它的名字让人想起一种流行的丝绸球动作，即使用魔法在空中跳跃。",

Then she escorts the characters to the center of the ramp elevated to 20 feet (see {@adventure map 4.2|SCC-HfMT|0|Map 4.2: aerojaunt field}). She explains that the scrimmage will take place over three phases that each last twenty minutes; when she gives the signal, the teams should dash toward the opposing team's mascot, grab it, and try to bring it back to their own team's end of the field to score a point.
