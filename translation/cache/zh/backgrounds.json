Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.": "一些异议者受到恐惧的刺激，不想让自己在试验中（或为试验进行训练）遭受暴力死亡。有些人受良心的驱使，不愿意在审判中杀死他们的庄稼人。因为虽然他们不能否认神的存在，但他们可以否认神是公正的--并且可以通过斗争来证明不公正的神的命令不需要被服从。一些人认为，一个神（可能是邦图）破坏了试炼的过程和通往来世的道路。其他人正确地直觉到，神-法老在命令他们的社会时，实际上并没有考虑到人民的最大利益。",

Nothing is more important than that drive, they suggest—not the bonds of a crop, not friendship or love. Not even devotion to a deity.": "邦图已经完全接受了这一箴言，虽然她没有花什么力气来教导它，但她肯定以身作则。她的大臣们巧妙地播下种子，使其开花结果，成为神-法老所期望的雄心壮志。通过暗示，他们提醒信徒和入门者，以牺牲他人的利益来实现自己在来世的地位并不可耻，而是证明了入门者的决心和动力。他们建议，没有什么比这种动力更重要，不是作物的纽带，不是友谊或爱情。甚至对神灵的奉献也不重要。",
