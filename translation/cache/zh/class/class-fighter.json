	"A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.": "一个穿着铿锵有力的板甲的人类在她面前举着她的盾牌，向大批的地精跑去。她身后的一个精灵，身穿镶钉皮甲，用他精致的弓箭向地精们射去。旁边的半兽人喊着命令，帮助这两个战斗人员协调他们的攻击，以获得最佳优势。",
	"A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre's club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half-elf in scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.": "一个穿着链甲的矮人将他的盾牌插在食人魔的棍子和他的同伴之间，将致命的一击打到一边。他的同伴，一个身穿鳞甲的半精灵，挥舞着两把弯刀打出了一个刺眼的旋涡，她绕着食人魔转，寻找它防御的盲点。",
	"A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd's delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent's sword flares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning flashing forth to smite him.": "一个角斗士在竞技场上为运动而战，他是一个使用三叉戟和网的高手，熟练地推翻敌人，让他们在观众的欢呼声中移动，也是他自己的战术优势。他的对手的剑在她发出闪电击打他之前的一瞬间发出了蓝光。",
	"All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of characters in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings—as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.": "所有这些英雄都是战士，也许是《龙与地下城》世界中最多样化的一类角色。探险的骑士、征服的霸主、皇室的冠军、精锐的步兵、坚韧的雇佣兵和强盗之王--作为战士，他们都对武器和盔甲有着无与伦比的掌握，并对战斗技巧有着全面的了解。他们对死亡非常熟悉，既能将其击倒，又能轻蔑地盯着它。",
	"Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.": "战士们学习所有战斗风格的基础知识。每个战士都能挥舞斧头，用剑杆击剑，挥舞长剑或大剑，使用弓箭，甚至能在某种程度上熟练地将敌人困在网中。同样地，战士也善于使用盾牌和各种形式的盔甲。除了这种基本的熟悉程度之外，每个战士都擅长于某种战斗风格。有些人专注于射箭，有些人同时使用两种武器作战，有些人则用魔法来增强他们的武术技能。这种广泛的综合能力和广泛的专业化的结合，使战士们在战场上和地牢里都是卓越的战斗人员。",
	"Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen's army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.": "不是每一个城市守望者、乡村民兵或女王军队的成员都是战士。这些部队中的大多数是相对没有受过训练的士兵，只有最基本的战斗知识。老兵、军官、训练有素的保镖、专职骑士和类似的人物都是战士。",
	"Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving, monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.": "有些战士感到被吸引来使用他们作为冒险家的训练。深入地牢、杀死怪物和其他在冒险者中常见的危险工作是战士的第二天性，与他或她留下的生活没有什么不同。也许有更大的风险，但也有更大的回报--例如，在城市观察中很少有战士有机会发现一把神奇的焰舌剑。",
	"As you build your fighter, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.": "当你建立你的战士时，想想你的角色背景中的两个相关元素。你在哪里接受的战斗训练，是什么让你与周围的普通战士不同？你是否特别冷酷无情？你是否从导师那里得到了额外的帮助，也许是因为你的特殊奉献精神？首先是什么驱使你接受这种训练的？对祖国的威胁，对复仇的渴望，或者对证明自己的需要，可能都是因素。",
	"You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace.": "你可能在贵族的军队或地方民兵中接受过正式的训练。也许你在战争学院受训，学习战略、战术和军事历史。或者你可能是自学成才--没有经过打磨，但经过良好的测试。你拿起剑是为了摆脱农场生活的局限性，还是在遵循一个自豪的家族传统？你的武器和盔甲是从哪里获得的？它们可能是军方发行的或家族的传家宝，也可能是你节衣缩食多年买来的。你的武器现在是你最重要的财产之一，是你和死亡的拥抱之间唯一的东西。",
	"You can make a fighter quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on melee weapons or on archery (or finesse weapons). Your next-highest score should be Constitution, or Intelligence if you plan to adopt the Eldritch Knight martial archetype. Second, choose the {@background soldier} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名战士。首先，根据你是想专注于近战武器还是射箭（或精巧的武器），将力量或灵巧作为你的最高能力得分。你的第二高分应该是体质，如果你打算采用埃尔德里奇骑士的武术原型，则是智力。第二，选择（%0%）背景。",
	"Let me know when you're all done talking.": "你们都说完了就告诉我吧。",
	"Of all the adventurers in the worlds of D&D, the fighter is perhaps the greatest paradox. On the one hand, a singular feature of the class is that no two fighters ply their craft in quite the same way; their weapons, armor, and tactics differ across a vast spectrum. On the other hand, regardless of the tools and methods one uses, at the heart of every fighter's motivation lies the same basic truth: it is better to wound than to be wounded.": "在D&D世界中的所有冒险者中，战士可能是最大的矛盾。一方面，该类别的一个特点是，没有两个战士以完全相同的方式从事他们的工作；他们的武器、盔甲和战术在很大的范围内有所不同。另一方面，无论使用什么工具和方法，每个战士的动机的核心都是同一个基本真理：受伤总比被伤好。",
	"Although some adventuring fighters risk their lives fighting for glory or treasure, others are primarily concerned with the welfare of others. They put more value on the well-being of the society, the village, or the group than on their own safety. Even if there's gold in the offing, the true reward for most fighters comes from sending enemies to their doom.": "虽然有些冒险战士冒着生命危险为荣誉或财宝而战，但其他人主要关心的是他人的福利。他们把社会、村庄或团体的福祉看得比自己的安全更重要。即使有黄金在手，对大多数战士来说，真正的回报来自于将敌人送上绝路。",
	"The sections below offer ways to add a little depth and a few personal touches to your fighter character.": "下面的章节提供了为你的战士角色增加一点深度和一些个人修饰的方法。",
	"Fighters typically do battle for a cause. Some fight on behalf of kingdoms besieged by monsters, while others quest only for personal glory. In either case, a fighter often displays a heraldic sign that represents that cause, either adopting the symbol of a nation or a royal line, or creating a crest to represent one's self-interest.": "战士们通常是为了某种原因而战斗。有些人代表被怪物围困的王国而战，有些人则只为个人荣誉而战。无论是哪种情况，战士通常都会展示一个代表该事业的纹章标志，要么采用一个国家或王室的标志，要么创造一个代表自我利益的纹章。",
	"Your character could be affiliated with an organization or a cause, and thus might already travel under a banner of some sort. If that's not the case, consider devising a heraldic sign that symbolizes an aspect of your nature or speaks to what you see as your purpose in the world.": "你的角色可能隶属于一个组织或一个事业，因此可能已经在某种旗帜下旅行。如果不是这种情况，可以考虑设计一个象征你本性的一个方面的预示牌，或者说你认为你在这个世界上的目的。",

Others learned the basics of their combat prowess in their formative years from spending time in a military or some other martial organization, when they were taught by the leaders of the group.": "有些战士是天生的战斗员，有在战斗中生存的天赋。其他人则是在成长期通过在军队或其他一些武术组织中度过的时间，在团体领导人的教导下学会了他们战斗力的基本知识。",
	"A third type of fighter comes from the ranks of those who received one-on-one instruction from an accomplished veteran of the craft. That instructor was, or perhaps still is, well versed in a certain aspect of combat that relates to the student's background.": "第三种类型的战士来自于那些从有成就的老手那里接受一对一指导的人的行列。这位教官过去，或者现在仍然精通与学生背景有关的某一方面的战斗。",

	"Many fighters distinguish themselves from their peers by adopting and perfecting a particular style or method of waging combat. Although this style might be a natural outgrowth of a fighter's personality, that's not always the case—someone's approach to the world in general does not necessarily dictate how that person operates when lives are on the line.": "许多战士通过采用和完善一种特定的战斗风格或方法使自己从同龄人中脱颖而出。虽然这种风格可能是拳手个性的自然流露，但情况并不总是这样--一个人对世界的态度不一定决定了他在生命攸关的时候如何操作。",
