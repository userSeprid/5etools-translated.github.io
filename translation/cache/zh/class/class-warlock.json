{
	"With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.": "肩膀上蜷缩着一条假龙，一个身穿金色长袍的年轻精灵热情地微笑着，在他的蜜语中编织着一种神奇的魅力，使宫殿里的哨兵屈服于他的意志。",
	"As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.": "当火焰在她手中涌现时，一个老练的人类低声说出了她的恶魔守护者的秘密名字，为她的咒语注入了恶魔般的魔力。",
	"Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.": "他的目光在一本破旧的书本和头顶上奇怪的星星排列之间转移，一个野眼的盗贼吟唱着神秘的仪式，这将打开通往一个遥远世界的大门。",
	"Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular. Drawing on the ancient knowledge of beings such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of the Far Realm, warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.": "术士是对隐藏在多元宇宙结构中的知识的追求者。通过与具有超自然力量的神秘生物签订契约，术士们释放出既微妙又壮观的魔法效果。术士们利用诸如费伊贵族、恶魔、魔鬼、女巫和远界的外星实体的古老知识，拼凑出神秘的秘密来增强自己的力量。",
	"A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.": "一个术士的定义是与一个异世界的存在签订契约。有时，术士和守护者之间的关系就像牧师和神灵之间的关系，尽管作为术士的守护者的生命并不是神。一个术士可能会领导一个致力于恶魔王子、大恶魔或完全陌生的实体的崇拜者--这些人通常不为牧师服务。但更多时候，这种安排类似于师傅和学徒之间的关系。术士学习并增长力量，代价是偶尔为赞助人提供服务。",
	"The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlock's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.": "赋予术士的魔法范围很广，从对术士的微小但持久的改变（比如在黑暗中看东西或阅读任何语言的能力）到获得强大的法术。与书本上的巫师不同，术士们用一些徒手搏斗的技巧来补充他们的魔法。他们穿着轻质的盔甲，知道如何使用简单的武器。",
	"Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.": "术士们被一种对知识和力量的永不满足的需求所驱使，这迫使他们加入他们的契约，并塑造他们的生活。这种渴求促使术士们进入他们的契约，也塑造了他们后来的职业生涯。",
	"Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.": "术士将自己与恶魔结合的故事广为人知。但许多术士服务的主顾并不是恶魔。有时，一个在荒野中的旅行者来到一座奇特美丽的塔楼前，见到了塔楼的女主人或女郎，并在没有完全意识到的情况下偶然加入了一个契约。有时，在翻阅禁忌传说的书本时，一个聪明但疯狂的学生的头脑被打开，了解到物质世界以外的现实，以及居住在外部虚空中的外星生物。",
	"Once a pact is made, a warlock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he or she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained. Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring. Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward adventure.": "一旦达成契约，术士对知识和力量的渴求就不能仅靠学习和研究来满足。如果不打算使用由此获得的力量，没有人会与这样一个强大的守护者签订契约。相反，绝大多数的术士都在积极追求他们的目标，这通常意味着某种冒险。此外，他们的赞助人的要求促使术士们走向冒险。",
	"As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking about your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you. What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron? Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god? Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you? Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of the rewards promised to you?": "在你塑造你的术士角色时，花些时间思考你的守护者和你的契约对你施加的义务。是什么促使你订立契约，你是如何与你的守护者取得联系的？你是被引诱去召唤一个魔鬼，还是去寻找能让你与一个外星长老神接触的仪式？是你在寻找你的守护神，还是你的守护神找到并选择了你？你是在契约的义务下感到苦恼，还是在期待着承诺给你的回报时快乐地服务？",
	"Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in your character's adventuring career. Your patron's demands might drive you into adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.": "与你的DM合作，确定你的契约在你的角色的冒险生涯中会起到多大的作用。你的赞助人的要求可能会驱使你去冒险，也可能完全是你在冒险之间可以做的小恩惠。",
	"What kind of relationship do you have with your patron? Is it friendly, antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic? How important does your patron consider you to be? What part do you play in your patron's plans? Do you know other servants of your patron?": "你和你的赞助人有什么样的关系？是友好的、对立的、不安的，还是浪漫的？你的赞助人认为你有多重要？你在你的赞助人的计划中扮演什么角色？你认识你的赞助人的其他仆人吗？",
	"How does your patron communicate with you? If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice. Some warlocks find messages from their patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the clouds—messages that only the warlock can see. Other warlocks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.": "你的赞助人如何与你交流？如果你有一个熟悉的人，它可能偶尔会用你守护者的声音说话。有些术士发现他们的守护者的信息刻在树上，混在茶叶中，或漂浮在云端--这些信息只有术士能看到。其他术士在梦中或清醒的幻觉中与他们的守护者交谈，或者只与中间人打交道。",
	"You can make a warlock quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the {@background charlatan} background. Third, choose the {@spell eldritch blast} and {@spell chill touch} cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells {@spell charm person} and {@spell witch bolt}.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名术士。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。第二，选择{@background charlatan}的背景。第三，选择{@spell eldritch blast}和{@spell chill touch}的咒语，以及一级法术{@spell charm person}和{@spell witch bolt}。",
	"You think me mad? I think true insanity is being content to live a life of mortal drudgery when knowledge and power is there for the taking in the realm beyond.": "你认为我疯了吗？我认为真正的疯狂是满足于过着凡人的苦工生活，而知识和力量就在那里，可以得到超越的领域。",
	"Warlocks are finders and keepers of secrets. They push at the edge of our understanding of the world, always seeking to expand their expertise. Where sages or wizards might heed a clear sign of danger and end their research, a warlock plunges ahead, heedless of the cost. Thus, it takes a peculiar mixture of intelligence, curiosity, and recklessness to produce a warlock. Many folk would describe that combination as evidence of madness. Warlocks see it as a demonstration of bravery.": "术士是秘密的发现者和守护者。他们在我们对世界的理解的边缘推进，一直在寻求扩大他们的专业知识。圣人或巫师可能会注意到危险的明显迹象并结束他们的研究，而术士则勇往直前，不计代价。因此，产生一个术士需要一种奇特的智慧、好奇心和鲁莽的混合物。许多人将这种组合描述为疯狂的证据。术士们则认为这是勇敢的表现。",
	"Warlocks are defined by two elements that work in concert to forge their path into this class. The first element is the event or circumstances that led to a warlock's entering into a pact with a planar entity. The second one is the nature of the entity a warlock is bound to. Unlike clerics, who typically embrace a deity and that god's ethos, a warlock might have no love for a patron, or vice versa.": "术士是由两个元素定义的，这两个元素共同作用于他们进入这个等级的道路。第一个要素是导致术士与一个平面实体达成契约的事件或情况。第二个要素是术士所绑定的实体的性质。与牧师不同的是，他们通常拥护一个神灵和该神灵的精神，而术士可能对一个守护者没有爱，反之亦然。",
	"The sections that follow provide ways to embellish a warlock character that could generate some intriguing story and roleplaying opportunities.": "接下来的章节提供了美化术士角色的方法，可以产生一些引人入胜的故事和角色扮演的机会。",
	"Every relationship is a two-way street, but in the case of warlocks and their patrons it's not necessarily true that both sides of the street are the same width or made of the same stuff. The feeling that a warlock holds for their patron, whether positive or negative, might be reciprocated by the patron, or the two participants in the pact might view one another with opposing emotions.": "每一种关系都是双向的，但就术士和他们的赞助人而言，街道的两边不一定是相同的宽度或由相同的东西组成。术士对其赞助人的感情，无论是积极的还是消极的，都可能得到赞助人的回应，或者契约中的两个参与者可能以相反的情绪看待彼此。",
	"When you determine the attitude your warlock character holds toward your patron, also consider how things look from the patron's perspective. How does your patron behave toward you? Is your patron a friend and ally, or an enemy that grants you power only because you forced a pact upon it?": "当你决定你的术士角色对你的赞助人所持的态度时，也要考虑从赞助人的角度看问题。你的守护者对你的行为如何？你的守护者是一个朋友和盟友，还是一个只因为你强迫它签订契约而给予你力量的敌人？",
	"Your patron has guided and helped your family for generations and is kindly toward you.": "你的赞助人世代指导和帮助你的家庭，对你很友善。",
	"Each interaction with your capricious patron is a surprise, whether pleasant or painful.": "与你任性的赞助人的每一次互动都是一个惊喜，无论是愉快的还是痛苦的。",
	"Your patron is the spirit of a long-dead hero who sees your pact as a way for it to continue to influence the world.": "你的赞助人是一位早已去世的英雄的灵魂，他把你的契约看作是它继续影响世界的一种方式。",
	"Your patron is a strict disciplinarian but treats you with a measure of respect.": "你的赞助人是一个严格的纪律者，但对你有一定的尊重。",
	"Your patron tricked you into a pact and treats you as a slave.": "你的赞助人把你骗进了一个契约，把你当成了奴隶。",
	"You are mostly left to your own devices with no interference from your patron. Sometimes you dread the demands it will make when it does appear.": "你大部分时间都是自己的事情，没有赞助人的干扰。有时你会害怕它出现时提出的要求。",
	"A pact can range from a loose agreement to a formal contract with lengthy, detailed clauses and lists of requirements. The terms of a pact—what a warlock must do to receive a patron's favor—are always dictated by the patron. On occasion, those terms include a special proviso that might seem odd or whimsical, but warlocks take these dictates as seriously as they do the other requirements of their pacts.": "契约的范围可以是松散的协议，也可以是带有冗长、详细条款和要求清单的正式合同。契约的条款--一个术士必须做什么来获得赞助人的青睐--总是由赞助人决定的。有时，这些条款包括一个可能看起来很奇怪或异想天开的特殊条件，但术士们对这些规定的重视程度不亚于他们对契约的其他要求。",
	"Does your character have a pact that requires you to change your behavior in an unusual or seemingly frivolous way? Even if your patron hasn't imposed such a duty on you already, that's not to say it couldn't still happen.": "你的角色是否有一个契约，要求你以不寻常或看似轻浮的方式改变你的行为？即使你的赞助人还没有对你施加这样的责任，这并不是说它仍然不可能发生。",
	"When directed, you must take immediate action against a specific enemy of your patron.": "在得到指示时，你必须立即对你的主顾的特定敌人采取行动。",
	"Your pact tests your willpower; you are required to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants.": "你的契约考验着你的意志力；你被要求戒酒和其他麻醉品。",
	"At least once a day, you must inscribe or carve your patron's name or symbol on the wall of a building.": "每天至少一次，你必须在建筑物的墙壁上题写或雕刻你的赞助人的名字或符号。",
	"You must occasionally conduct bizarre rituals to maintain your pact.": "你必须偶尔进行怪异的仪式来维持你的契约。",
	"You can never wear the same outfit twice, since your patron finds such predictability to be boring.": "你永远不能穿同样的衣服两次，因为你的主顾觉得这种可预测性很无聊。",
	"When you use an eldritch invocation, you must speak your patron's name aloud or risk incurring its displeasure.": "当你使用长生召唤时，你必须大声说出你的守护者的名字，否则有可能招致它的不悦。",
	"Some patrons make a habit of, and often enjoy, marking the warlocks under their sway in some fashion. A binding mark makes it clear—to those who know about such things—that the individual in question is bound to the patron's service. A warlock might take advantage of such a mark, claiming it as proof of one's pact, or might want to keep it under wraps (if possible) to avoid the difficulties it might bring.": "有些赞助人有一个习惯，而且常常喜欢在他们手下的术士身上打上某种标记。对于那些了解这种事情的人来说，一个约束性的标记清楚地表明，这个人被约束在赞助人的服务中。术士可能会利用这样的标记，声称它是自己契约的证明，或者可能想把它藏起来（如果可能的话），以避免它可能带来的困难。",
	"If your warlock's pact comes with a binding mark, how you feel about displaying it probably depends on the nature of your relationship with the one who gave it to you. Is the mark a source of pride or something you are secretly ashamed of?": "如果你的术士契约带有约束性标记，你对展示它的感觉可能取决于你与给予它的人的关系的性质。这个标记是你的骄傲，还是你暗自感到羞愧的东西？",
	"One of your eyes looks the same as one of your patron's eyes.": "你的一只眼睛和你的赞助人的一只眼睛看起来一样。",
	"Each time you wake up, the small blemish on your face appears in a different place.": "每次你醒来的时候，你脸上的小瑕疵都会出现在不同的地方。",
	"You display outward symptoms of a disease but suffer no ill effects from it.": "你表现出某种疾病的外在症状，但没有受到疾病的影响。",
	"Your tongue is an unnatural color.": "你的舌头是一种不自然的颜色。",
	"You have a vestigial tail.": "你有一个残缺的尾巴。",
	"Your nose glows in the dark.": "你的鼻子在黑暗中发亮。",
	"At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being chosen from the list of available patrons. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.": "在1级的时候，你已经和一个异世界的生物达成了协议，这个生物是从可用的赞助者名单中选择的。你的选择使你在1级时获得特性，在6级、10级和14级时再次获得特性。",
	"Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.

	"The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your {@filter warlock spells|spells|class=warlock} of 1st through 5th level. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.": "术士表显示了你有多少个法术槽来施放你的（%0%）1到5级的法术。该表还显示了这些法术槽的等级；你所有的法术槽都是一样的等级。为了施展你的1级或更高等级的术士法术，你必须消耗一个法术槽。当你完成短时或长时休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术槽。",
	"For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell {@spell witch bolt}, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.": "例如，当你5级的时候，你有两个3级的法术槽。为了施放1级法术（%0%），你必须花费其中一个法术槽，并且你将其作为3级法术施放。",

	"Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.": "魅力是你的术士法术的施法能力，所以每当法术提到你的施法能力时，你就会使用你的魅力。此外，在设定你所施展的术士法术的蓄力DC时，以及用术士法术进行攻击卷时，你都会使用你的魅力修改值。",
