	"Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.": "一个精灵身着代表她地位的银色长袍，闭上眼睛，将战场上的杂念拒之门外，开始她安静的吟唱。她的手指在身前穿梭，完成了她的咒语，并向敌人的队伍发射了一颗小小的火珠，在那里爆发出一场吞噬士兵的大火。",
	"Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.": "一个人在检查和再检查他的工作，用粉笔在光秃秃的石板上划出一个复杂的魔法圈，然后沿着每条线和优美的曲线撒上铁粉。当圆圈完成后，他口中念着长长的咒语。圆圈内的空间打开了一个洞，从另一个世界的空间带来一缕硫磺的味道。",
	"Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.": "蹲在地牢路口的地板上，一个地精扔了一把刻有神秘符号的小骨头，对着它们嘀咕了几句有力量的话。他闭上眼睛，想更清楚地看到那些幻象，他慢慢地点点头，然后睁开眼睛，指向左边的通道。",
	"Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.": "巫师是至高无上的魔法使用者，通过他们所施展的法术来定义和凝聚成一个类别。利用渗透在宇宙中的微妙的魔法编织，巫师们施展出爆炸性的火焰、弧形的闪电、微妙的欺骗以及粗暴的精神控制等法术。他们的魔法从其他存在的星球上召唤出怪物，瞥见未来，或将被杀的敌人变成僵尸。他们最强大的法术将一种物质变成另一种物质，将流星从天空中召唤下来，或打开通往其他世界的门户。",
	"Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.": "魔法的力量狂野而神秘，形式和功能各不相同，吸引着那些寻求掌握其奥秘的学生。有些人渴望成为像神一样的人，塑造现实本身。虽然施展一个典型的法术只需要说出几个奇怪的词，转瞬即逝的手势，有时还需要捏起或粘上异国的材料，但这些表面的成分几乎没有暗示经过多年的学徒生涯和无数个小时的学习而获得的专业知识。",
	"Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.": "巫师靠他们的法术生存和死亡。其他都是次要的。他们随着实验和经验的增长学习新的法术。他们也可以从其他巫师、古籍或铭文，以及沉浸在魔法中的古老生物（如精灵）那里学习。",
	"Wizards' lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue lives of crime or domination.": "巫师的生活很少是平凡的。巫师最接近普通人的生活是在图书馆或大学里当圣人或讲师，教别人多元宇宙的秘密。其他巫师作为占卜者出售他们的服务，在军队中服务，或追求犯罪或统治的生活。",
	"But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.": "但是，知识和力量的诱惑，即使是最没有冒险精神的巫师也会走出他们安全的图书馆和实验室，进入破败的废墟和失落的城市。大多数巫师相信，他们在古代文明中的同行知道已被时代遗忘的魔法秘密，而发现这些秘密可以开启通向比现今时代的任何魔法都要强大的道路。",
	"Creating a wizard character demands a backstory dominated by at least one extraordinary event. How did your character first come into contact with magic? How did you discover you had an aptitude for it? Do you have a natural talent, or did you simply study hard and practice incessantly? Did you encounter a magical creature or an ancient tome that taught you the basics of magic?": "创造一个巫师角色需要一个至少由一个特殊事件主导的背景故事。你的角色是如何第一次接触到魔法的？你是如何发现自己有这方面的才能的？你是有天生的天赋，还是只是努力学习和不断练习？你是否遇到了一个神奇的生物或一本古老的书，让你学会了魔法的基本知识？",

Even the least of them can manipulate forces that flout the laws of nature, and the most accomplished among them can cast spells with world-shaking effects.": "世界上只有少数人是魔法的拥有者。在所有这些人中，巫师站在了技艺的顶峰。即使是最普通的人也能操纵藐视自然法则的力量，而其中最成功的人可以施展具有震撼世界的法术。",
	"The price that wizards pay for their mastery is that most valuable of commodities: time. It takes years of study, instruction, and experimentation to learn how to harness magical energy and carry spells around in one's own mind. For adventuring wizards and other spellcasters who aspire to the highest echelons of the profession, the studying never ends, nor does the quest for knowledge and power.": "巫师们为他们的掌握所付出的代价是最有价值的商品：时间。需要多年的学习、指导和实验才能学会如何利用魔法能量，并在自己的脑海中携带法术。对于冒险的巫师和其他有志于成为该职业最高层的施法者来说，学习永远不会结束，对知识和力量的追求也不会结束。",

	"Few aspiring wizards undertake the study of magic without some personal goal in mind.

	"From its inception as a martial and magical art, Bladesinging has been tied to the sword, more specifically the longsword. Yet many generations of study gave rise to various styles of Bladesinging based on the melee weapon employed. The techniques of these styles are passed from master to students in small schools, some of which have a building dedicated to instruction. Even the newest styles are hundreds of years old, but are still taught by their original creators due to the long lives of elves. Most schools of Bladesinging are in Evermeet or Evereska. One was started in Myth Drannor, but the city's destruction has scattered those students who survived.": "从一开始作为一种武术和魔法艺术，刀术就与剑联系在一起，更确切地说，是长剑。然而，经过几代人的研究，根据所使用的近战武器，产生了各种风格的刀术。这些风格的技术在小学校里从师傅传给学生，其中一些学校有专门的教学楼。即使是最新的风格也有几百年的历史，但由于精灵的长寿，他们仍然由最初的创造者教授。大多数刀术学校都在Evermeet或Evereska。有一所是在神话Drannor开始的，但城市的毁灭使那些幸存的学生分散了。",
	"Styles of Bladesinging are broadly categorized based on the type of weapon employed, and each is associated with a category of animal. Within that style are specializations named after specific animal types, based on the types of spells employed, the techniques of the master, and the particular weapon used. Bladesingers who apprentice to a master typically get a tattoo of their chosen style's animal. Some bladesingers learn multiple styles and bear many tattoos, wearing a warning on their skin of their deadly skills.": "刀术的风格根据所使用的武器类型进行了广泛的分类，每种风格都与一类动物有关。在这种风格中，根据所使用的法术类型、大师的技术和所使用的特定武器，有以特定动物类型命名的专业。拜师学艺的刀客通常会得到一个他们所选风格的动物纹身。有些刀客学习多种风格，并拥有许多纹身，在他们的皮肤上佩戴着他们致命技能的警告。",
	"Styles that employ a sword belong to this family. The lion style, the eldest, trains practitioners in the use of the longsword and doesn't favor any particular type of spells. Leopard style focuses on the shortsword and spells of illusion and stealth. Red tiger, a style just three centuries old, has its bladesingers using the scimitar in a whirling dance of defense from which they launch into sudden leaps and attacks.": "使用剑的风格属于这个家族。狮子式，是最古老的，训练练习者使用长剑，不偏重任何特定类型的法术。豹式专注于短剑以及幻术和隐身术的法术。红虎式是一个只有三个世纪历史的流派，它的刀手使用弯刀进行旋转式防御，并从中发起突然的跳跃和攻击。",
	"Styles that focus on the use of a hafted weapon, such as an axe or hammer, have been grouped together as bird styles, yet they vary wildly. All relatively new styles, they use weapons not typically favored by elves.

Raven style uses a war pick, and spells associated with it grant the bladesinger more agility in combat.": "注重使用斧头武器的风格，如斧头或锤子，被归为鸟类风格，但它们的差异很大。所有相对较新的风格，它们使用的武器通常不受精灵的青睐。鹰式刀客使用小手斧，该风格中的许多演习都集中在扔出武器和抽出新武器的流畅方式上。乌鸦式使用战镐，与之相关的法术赋予刀锋战士在战斗中更多的敏捷性。",
	"Practitioners of these styles use a flail, chain, or whip. Viper style uses a whip, despite its inelegance as a weapon, and has almost as long a history as the lion style. Its masters punctuate their bladesong with a stunningly rapid rhythm of whip cracks, which can keep many foes at bay and allow the bladesinger space to cast the cruel spells of poison and disease favored by the style.": "这些风格的练习者使用连枷、链条或鞭子。蝰蛇式使用鞭子，尽管它作为一种武器并不优雅，而且几乎和狮子式一样有着悠久的历史。它的主人用令人惊叹的快速的鞭子抽打节奏来点缀他们的剑鸣，这可以让许多敌人不敢轻举妄动，让剑客有空间施展该风格所喜爱的残酷的毒药和疾病法术。",

Was it awarded to you when you graduated from your academy of wizardry? Did it call to you in a jeweler's shop? Was it associated with the moment when your psionic powers first manifested? One morning, did you wake up with it humming under your pillow?": "将你的幻觉焦点带到你身边的事件可能具有个人意义。是你的师父在你的学徒生涯结束时给你的吗？它是在你从巫师学院毕业时授予你的吗？它是在珠宝店里召唤你的吗？它是否与你的幻觉能力首次显现的时刻有关？有一天早上，你是否在枕头下听到它的嗡嗡声而醒来？",
	"The form your psionic focus takes is also yours to define, likely being a reflection of how your magic came into being, a symbol of your own psyche, or an item you use to focus your thoughts. It is a handheld object that has special meaning to you, but that can't be a weapon or magic item. Perhaps it's a childhood memento, the skull of an alien creature, a crystal that makes you feel a certain way, a coin that only lands on its edge, a firescarred planchette, or any other enigmatic personal relic.": "你的幻觉焦点所采取的形式也由你来定义，可能是你的魔法如何产生的反映，是你自己心理的象征，或者是你用来集中思想的物品。它是一个对你有特殊意义的手持物品，但不能是武器或魔法物品。也许它是一个童年纪念品，一个外星生物的头骨，一个让你有某种感觉的水晶，一个只落在边缘的硬币，一个被火烧过的刨花，或者任何其他神秘的个人遗物。",
	"However the object arrived and whatever form it takes, your psionic focus is now yours, and you decide how to handle it. Will you mount it on a wand or staff? Would you prefer to wear it on a necklace or circlet? Have you embedded it into the cover of your spellbook? Wherever you put it, you can now channel your magic through it, and it is a sign of your membership in the revered tradition of psionic wizardry.": "不管这个东西是怎么来的，不管它是什么形式，你的幻觉焦点现在是你的了，你决定如何处理它。你会把它装在魔杖或法杖上吗？你愿意把它戴在项链或项圈上吗？你把它嵌入到你的法术书的封面上吗？无论你把它放在哪里，你现在都可以通过它来引导你的魔力，它是你在受人尊敬的幻术师传统中的一个标志。",
	"While you are carrying your psionic focus, you can use a bonus action to magically transform your body into pure psionic energy. The transformation lasts for 10 minutes, until you use a bonus action to assume your normal form, or until you are {@condition incapacitated} or die.": "当你带着你的幻象焦点时，你可以使用一个额外的动作，将你的身体神奇地转化为纯幻象能量。这种转化持续10分钟，直到你使用额外行动恢复正常形态，或者直到你被（%0%）或死亡。",
	"While in thought form, you are a figure of luminous psychic energy, with your psionic focus hovering within. Your form can appear as anything you wish, but it is obviously magical, is the same size as you, and sheds dim light in a 5-foot-radius. Any other equipment you are wearing or carrying transforms with you and melds into your thought form. You also gain the following benefits:": "当你处于思想状态时，你是一个发光的精神能量的形象，你的幻觉焦点盘旋在其中。你的形态可以表现为任何你想要的东西，但它显然是有魔力的，和你一样大小，并在5英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光。你所穿戴或携带的任何其他装备都会与你一起转变，并与你的思想形态融为一体。你还会获得以下好处。",
	"When you cast a spell while in thought form, you can cast the spell psionically. If you do so, the spell doesn't require verbal, somatic, or material components that lack a gold cost.": "当你在思想状态下施展法术时，你可以用幻术施展该法术。如果你这样做，该咒语不需要语言、体质或缺乏金币成本的物质成分。",

	"You take {@damage 1d10} force damage if you end your turn inside an object. If you return to your normal form while inside an object, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space, and you take {@damage 1d10} force damage for every 5 feet traveled.": "如果你在一个物体内结束你的回合，你会受到{@damage 1d10}力的伤害。如果你在物体内恢复正常形态，你会被分流到最近的无人空间，每走5英尺就会受到{@damage 1d10}力的伤害。",
	"Unlike the more common arcane traditions based around the schools of magic, the tradition of Technomancy does not focus on a singular type of spellcraft or magical energy. Rather, students of Technomancy concern themselves with how their spells interact with modern technology.": "与更常见的以魔法流派为基础的奥术传统不同，Technomancy的传统并不专注于单一类型的法术或魔法能量。相反，技术魔法的学生关注的是他们的法术如何与现代科技互动。",
	"Technomancers can make use of technology as both a conduit and a storage space for magic. In a campaign using the optional rules for magic item creation (see the Dungeon Master's Guide), a technomancer might craft disposable electronic devices and smartphone apps in lieu of potions and scrolls.": "巫师可以利用技术作为魔法的管道和储存空间。在使用魔法物品创造的可选规则的活动中（见《地下城主指南》），技术员可以制作一次性的电子设备和智能手机应用程序来代替药水和卷轴。",

	"Also at 2nd level, you trade out your spellbook for a specially attuned storage device of your choosing, capable of recording magical data.

Spells can be copied into this device at half the cost of copying spells into a spellbook.": "同样在2级时，你可以用你的法术书换取一个你选择的、能够记录魔法数据的特别调整过的存储设备。这个设备的计算能力必须等于或大于一台平板电脑。在任何时候都只能有一个存储设备与你相配。咒语可以被复制到这个设备中，成本是复制咒语书的一半。",
	"At 6th level, you can insert a spell within an electronic device of your choosing, so that by touching a key or flicking a switch using an action, the spell activates.

You can use this feature to place a programmed spell in only one device at a time, and a device can hold only one programmed spell. Only you can activate the programmed spell in the device. If the device is destroyed, the programmed spell is lost.": "一个已编程的咒语在其装置中保持48小时，一旦放电就会消失。你可以使用这个功能，一次只在一个装置中放置一个已编程的咒语，而且一个装置只能容纳一个已编程的咒语。只有你能激活装置中的编程法术。如果设备被毁，编程的咒语就会丢失。",

	"If the spell requires the caster to be seen, the target must see you or a live image of you. If the spell requires the caster to be heard, the target must be able to hear you or a live audio transmission of you. The spell's range is determined using the distance from you to your device, and then from the target to its device. You must be able to see or otherwise determine the location of the target. This feature can be used to cast only spells that target specific creatures. Spells that affect an area are not subject to online casting.": "如果咒语要求施法者被看到，目标必须看到你或你的实时图像。如果咒语要求施法者被听到，目标必须能够听到你或你的实时音频传输。咒语的范围由你和你的设备之间的距离决定，然后是目标和它的设备之间的距离。你必须能够看到或以其他方式确定目标的位置。这个功能只能用于施放针对特定生物的法术。影响一个区域的法术不受在线施法的限制。",

	"The School of Invention claims credit for inventing the other schools of magic—a claim other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school push magic to its limits. They stretch the known laws of arcane power and strive to reveal important truths about the nature of the multiverse.": "发明学派声称自己发明了其他魔法学派--这是其他巫师认为荒谬的说法。这个学派的巫师们将魔法推向极限。他们延伸已知的奥术力量法则，努力揭示关于多元宇宙本质的重要真理。",
	"Adherents of this school believe that innovation is best served through experimentation. They have a reputation for acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are scholars who have mastered their craft through careful study, rigorous practice, and endless hours of repetition. These wizards would rather throw spells together and see what happens.": "这一学派的信徒认为，创新最好通过实验来实现。他们以行动第一，思考第二而闻名。大多数巫师都是学者，通过仔细研究、严格练习和无休止的重复掌握了他们的技艺。这些巫师宁愿把法术扔在一起，看看会发生什么。",

	"Known as savants, followers of this tradition are a bookish lot who see beauty and mystery in the application of magic. The results of a spell are less interesting to them than the process that creates it. Some savants take a haughty attitude toward those who follow a tradition focused on a single school of magic, seeing them as provincial and lacking the sophistication needed to master true magic. Other savants are generous teachers, countering ignorance and deception with deep knowledge and good humor.": "这种传统的追随者被称为 \"救世主\"，他们是一群书生气十足的人，在魔法的应用中看到了美和神秘。对他们来说，咒语的结果没有创造它的过程那么有趣。有的救世主对那些追随传统、专注于单一魔法流派的人采取了傲慢的态度，认为他们是外行，缺乏掌握真正魔法所需的复杂程度。其他救世主是慷慨的老师，用渊博的知识和良好的幽默感来对抗无知和欺骗。",
	"While the Spell Secrets feature offers increased versatility, at the table its effects can be difficult to spot by the other players. If you're playing a savant, take a moment to describe how you alter your spells. Think of a signature change your character is particularly proud of. Be inventive, and make the game more fun for everyone by playing up the sudden, unexpected tricks you character can employ. For example, a {@spell fireball} transformed to require a Strength save might become a sphere of burning rock that shatters and slams into its target. A {@spell charm person} that requires a Constitution save might take the form of a vaporous narcotic that alters the target's mood.": "虽然法术秘密功能提供了更多的通用性，但在牌桌上它的效果可能很难被其他玩家发现。如果你扮演的是一个法师，花点时间描述一下你是如何改变你的法术的。想一想你的角色特别自豪的标志性变化。要有创造性，通过发挥你的角色可以采用的突然的、意想不到的技巧，使游戏对每个人来说都更加有趣。例如，一个需要力量救赎的（%0%）转变可能会变成一个燃烧的岩石球体，粉碎并撞向它的目标。一个需要体能救赎的（1%）可能会变成一种蒸汽麻醉剂，改变目标的情绪。",
