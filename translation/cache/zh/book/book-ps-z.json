	"Dungeons & Dragons and Magic: The Gathering are two different games, but that doesn't mean their multiverses can't meet": "龙与地下城》和《魔法：集会》是两个不同的游戏，但这并不意味着它们的多元世界不能相遇",
	"From the beginning, Magic's plane of Zendikar was conceived as an \"adventure world\" where parties of explorers delve into ancient ruins in search of wonders and treasures, fighting the monsters they encounter on the way. Many of the plane's creative roots lie in D&D, so it should be no surprise that The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar feels a lot like a D&D campaign setting book. It's littered with adventure hooks and story seeds, and lacks only the specific rules references you'd need to adapt Zendikar's races, monsters, and adventures to a tabletop D&D campaign. And it's all surrounded by amazing fantasy art that holds boundless inspiration in itself.": "从一开始，《魔法》的赞迪卡位面就被设想为一个 \"冒险世界\"，探险者们深入古代遗迹寻找奇迹和宝藏，与途中遇到的怪物战斗。这个平面的许多创意根源在于D&D，所以《魔法的艺术：集会-Zendikar》感觉很像D&D的战役设定书也就不足为奇。它充斥着冒险钩子和故事种子，只缺少具体的规则参考，你需要将赞迪卡的种族、怪物和冒险改编成桌面上的D&D活动。而这一切都被惊人的奇幻艺术所包围，本身就蕴含着无穷的灵感。",
	"You can think of Plane Shift: Zendikar as a sort of supplement to The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar, designed to help you take the world detail and story seeds contained in that book and turn them into an exciting D&D campaign. The easiest way to approach a D&D campaign set on Zendikar is to use the rules that D&D provides mostly as written: A druid on Zendikar might call on green mana and cast spells like giant growth, but she's still just a druid in the D&D rules (perhaps casting giant insect).": "你可以把Plane Shift: Zendikar是《魔法的艺术：集会-Zendikar》的一种补充，旨在帮助你利用该书中的世界细节和故事种子，将其转化为激动人心的D&D活动。以赞迪卡为背景的D&D活动最简单的方法是使用D&D提供的规则，大部分是书面的。赞迪卡上的德鲁伊可能会召唤绿色法力，并施展巨人生长之类的法术，但在D&D规则中她仍然只是一个德鲁伊（也许会施展巨型昆虫）。",
	"Plane Shift: Zendikar was made using the fifth edition of the D&D rules that you can find here": "空间转移。Zendikar是使用第五版的D&D规则制作的，你可以在这里找到。",
	"D&D is a flexible rules system designed to model any kind of fantasy world. The D&D magic system doesn't involve five colors of mana or a ramping-up to your most powerful spells, but the goal isn't to mirror the experience of playing Magic in your roleplaying game. The point is to experience the worlds of Magic in a new way, through the lens of the D&D rules. All you really need is races for the characters, monsters for them to face, and some ideas to build a campaign.": "D&D是一个灵活的规则系统，旨在模拟任何种类的幻想世界。D&D的魔法系统不涉及五种颜色的法力，也不涉及提升到最强大的法术，但目的不是要在你的角色扮演游戏中反映玩魔法的经验。重点是通过D&D规则的视角，以一种新的方式体验魔法世界。你真正需要的是角色的种族，他们要面对的怪物，以及建立一个活动的一些想法。",
	"Finally, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar will help you create a D&D campaign in Zendikar, but you don't actually need the book to make use of this material—you can also refer to the abundance of lore about Zendikar found on {@link magicthegathering.com}.": "最后，《魔法的艺术：集会-赞迪卡》将帮助你在赞迪卡创建一个D&D活动，但你实际上并不需要这本书来利用这些材料--你也可以参考在{@link magicthegathering.com}上发现的大量关于赞迪卡的传说。",
	"Zendikar is a dangerous world of lethal risks and priceless rewards. From the perspective of its inhabitants, it is a hostile place that seems to be actively trying to kill any creature that has the audacity to live there. The danger is unrelenting. Precarious terrain, cunning predators, and natural disasters on a massive scale all present a constant challenge to survival—as do the unpredictable ripples of change that wash through the plane, known to its people as the Roil. Even the mana that suffuses the land is wild and hard to tame. It feels almost alive to those who wield it, and sometimes causes the land to manifest magical effects much like spells. Zendikar is a plane of deadly peril, but the denizens of that plane grow up strong and resilient, prepared for the dangers of the only world they know.": "赞迪卡是一个充满致命风险和无价回报的危险世界。从其居民的角度来看，这是一个充满敌意的地方，似乎在积极地试图杀死任何敢于生活在那里的生物。危险是无情的。险峻的地形、狡猾的掠食者和大规模的自然灾害都对生存构成了持续的挑战--不可预测的变化涟漪也冲刷着这个星球，被人们称为 \"咆哮\"。即使是弥漫在这片土地上的法力也是野性的，难以驯服。挥舞法力的人感觉它几乎是活的，有时会使土地表现出类似法术的神奇效果。赞迪卡是一个充满致命危险的位面，但这个位面的居民在成长过程中都很坚强和有韧性，为他们唯一知道的世界的危险做好了准备。",
	"Planeswalkers—powerful mages with the ability to travel from world to world in the vast multiverse—have a larger perspective. To them, the dangers of Zendikar take on a different meaning. Ages ago, three alien beings of tremendous power were imprisoned on Zendikar in an effort to prevent them from consuming the entire multiverse, plane by plane. But the presence of these Eldrazi within the plane is like a festering infection within a living body. Zendikar isn't trying to exterminate all the creatures that inhabit the plane—it's been trying in vain to destroy the Eldrazi. Its inhabitants just happen to get in the way.": "行者--强大的法师，有能力在广阔的多元宇宙中从一个世界穿越到另一个世界--有一个更大的视角。对他们来说，赞迪卡的危险具有不同的意义。几百年前，三个具有巨大力量的外星生物被囚禁在赞迪卡，以防止它们逐个平面地吞噬整个多元宇宙。但这些埃尔德拉兹在平面内的存在就像活体中的溃烂感染。赞迪卡并不是要消灭所有居住在这个位面的生物--它一直在试图消灭埃尔德拉兹，但却徒劳无功。它的居民只是碰巧挡住了去路。",
	"After centuries of being trapped in their magical prison, the Eldrazi are once again free. The other dangers of Zendikar pale in comparison to the rampaging of the three titans and the numberless broods they spawn. Civilization on Zendikar, always fragile and tentative, now teeters on the brink of destruction, and the plane itself seems threatened with extinction.": "在被困在他们的魔法监狱里几个世纪之后，艾尔拉兹人再次获得了自由。赞迪卡的其他危险与三巨头的肆虐以及他们所产生的无数小群相比，显得微不足道。赞迪卡上的文明，总是脆弱和试探性的，现在却在毁灭的边缘徘徊，而这个星球本身似乎也面临着灭绝的威胁。",
	"Zendikar is a world rife with adventure opportunities. Bold heroes, covetous treasure hunters, and sages seeking long-forgotten lore can all find numerous ruins to explore, mysteries to uncover, and villains and monsters to slay. Expeditionary houses, academic institutions, wealthy merchants, and retired adventurers all sponsor missions of exploration and discovery. Caravans need guards to protect them from bandits, predators, and the Roil. At the same time, the schemes of villains—from the underhanded vampire sage Anowon to the monstrous demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis—draw would-be heroes in like moths to the flame.": "赞迪卡是一个充斥着冒险机会的世界。大胆的英雄，贪婪的寻宝者，以及寻求被遗忘的传说的圣人，都可以找到无数的遗迹来探索，揭开神秘的面纱，以及杀死恶人和怪物。远征队、学术机构、富有的商人和退休的冒险家都赞助探索和发现的任务。商队需要护卫来保护他们不受强盗、掠夺者和咆哮者的伤害。同时，反派的阴谋--从阴险的吸血鬼圣人阿诺文到畸形的恶魔行者奥布-尼克斯利斯--像飞蛾扑火一样吸引着未来的英雄们。",
	"Zendikar is littered with ancient sites ripe for exploration. Before the rise of the Eldrazi, expeditions to such sites were largely motivated by curiosity, the hunt for wealth or fame, or quests for magical power. Since the Eldrazi broke free of their prison, though, brave explorers have delved into these ruins in hopes of learning more about the threat they face—and how to stop it.": "赞迪卡到处都是适合探索的古代遗址。在埃尔德拉兹崛起之前，对这些遗址的探险主要是出于好奇心、对财富或名声的追寻、或对魔法力量的追求。然而，自从埃尔德拉兹挣脱牢笼后，勇敢的探险家们纷纷深入这些遗迹，希望能更多地了解他们所面临的威胁，以及如何阻止它。",
	"Player characters in a Zendikar campaign might find ruins dating from any era of that plane's history: before the arrival of the Eldrazi, the period when the Eldrazi first arrived (while the Planeswalkers worked to trap them), or the relatively peaceful time afterward.": "Zendikar战役中的玩家角色可能会发现该位面历史上任何时代的遗迹：在埃尔德拉兹到来之前，埃尔德拉兹首次到来的时期（而行者们则致力于困住他们），或者之后相对和平的时期。",
	"Before the Eldrazi ever came to Zendikar, it was not an especially remarkable world. It had powerful mana and boasted mighty civilizations of humans (on all seven continents), kor (primarily in Ondu and Akoum), elves (primarily in Murasa and Bala Ged), and merfolk (primarily in Tazeem, Guul Draz, and Sejiri). Ruins from this era naturally suggest no knowledge of the Eldrazi or the three gods inspired by the Eldrazi titans. These civilizations had their own gods, unrecognizable to contemporary eyes. In modern times, before the rise of the Eldrazi, these civilizations were often mistakenly identified as \"Eldrazi,\" giving rise to a number of misconceptions about the nature of those alien creatures.": "在Eldrazi来到Zendikar之前，它并不是一个特别出色的世界。它有强大的法力，并拥有强大的人类文明（在所有七个大陆上）、科尔文明（主要在昂都和阿库姆）、精灵文明（主要在穆拉萨和巴拉格德）和人鱼文明（主要在塔泽姆、古尔-德拉兹和塞吉里）。这个时代的遗迹自然表明，人们对埃尔德拉兹或由埃尔德拉兹泰坦激发的三个神灵并不了解。这些文明有他们自己的神，在当代人眼中是无法辨认的。在现代，在Eldrazi崛起之前，这些文明经常被误认为是 \"Eldrazi\"，从而引起了对这些外来生物性质的一些误解。",
	"The time before the Eldrazi was an age of powerful magic. Ruins from this era are often warded by magical traps, but they offer commensurate rewards in the form of magic items and other magical effects (such as healing fountains). They are often haunted by spirits, shades, and wraiths, and lingering magical effects make them attractive homes for demons. Magical constructs and golems can also be found in such ruins (though not constructs made from hedrons), often standing guard over treasure vaults. Of course, some ruins have been exposed to the elements and claimed as lairs by natural animals or goblins. Monetary treasure in the ruins of Zendikar is often in the form of gems or precious art objects, but they also hold ancient coins of strange provenance, including electrum and platinum.": "埃尔德拉兹之前的时代是一个强大魔法的时代。这个时代的遗迹常常被魔法陷阱所阻挡，但它们也提供了相应的奖励，如魔法物品和其他魔法效果（如治疗用的喷泉）。它们经常被鬼魂、阴影和巫师所困扰，挥之不去的魔法效果使它们成为恶魔们的理想家园。在这样的废墟中也可以发现魔法构造物和巨兽（尽管不是由赫龙制成的构造物），它们常常在宝库上站岗。当然，有些废墟已经暴露在大自然中，被自然界的动物或妖精宣称为巢穴。赞迪卡废墟中的货币宝藏通常是以宝石或珍贵艺术品的形式出现，但它们也拥有出处奇怪的古币，包括电子货币和白金。",
	"It is possible that living descendants of these ancient civilizations still inhabit particularly remote ruins. Such inhabitants might be monstrously degenerated from their original forms—kuo-toa with only the vaguest resemblance to their merfolk ancestors, or tieflings or yuan-ti descended from human cultures that polluted their bloodlines with dark magic.": "有可能这些古代文明的活着的后裔仍然居住在特别偏远的废墟中。这些居民可能是由他们的原始形态退化而来的怪物--与他们的人鱼祖先只有最模糊的相似之处的Kuo-toa，或是由人类文化中被黑暗魔法污染了血统的Tieflings或yuan-ti的后代。",
	"Sites from this era include the following:": "这个时代的遗址包括以下内容。",
	"Ior Ruin (Akoum)": "伊尔废墟（阿库姆）",
	"Singing City (Murasa)": "唱歌的城市(Murasa)",

	"When Ugin, Sorin, and Nahiri trapped the Eldrazi on Zendikar, the resulting chaos and devastation ultimately led to the downfall of the plane's ancient civilizations. Before that fall, though, powerful nations mustered mighty armies and great magic to fight the Eldrazi spawn that swarmed over the world. They harnessed existing magic as well as the power of Nahiri's hedrons to aid their efforts, and magical technology from this era is now highly sought after with the threat of the Eldrazi renewed. Magical weapons, often incorporating patterns that resemble the engravings on the hedrons, are often found in the ruins of this age. Likewise, scrolls and tomes containing knowledge of the Eldrazi and spells useful for binding or destroying them can still be found in ancient libraries of the Eldrazi era.": "当乌金、索林和纳希里将埃尔德拉兹困在赞迪卡时，由此产生的混乱和破坏最终导致了这个星球古老文明的衰落。不过在堕落之前，强大的国家集结了强大的军队和强大的魔法来对抗蜂拥而至的埃尔德拉兹精灵。他们利用现有的魔法以及纳希里的神龙的力量来帮助他们的努力，而这个时代的魔法技术现在随着埃尔德拉兹的威胁再次出现而备受追捧。在这个时代的废墟中，经常可以发现神奇的武器，这些武器上的图案通常与龙骨上的雕刻相类似。同样地，在埃尔德拉兹时代的古老图书馆中，仍然可以找到包含埃尔德拉兹知识和捆绑或摧毁埃尔德拉兹的咒语的卷轴和书册。",
	"Temples from this era depict some of the old gods, but the worship of angels also began in this period. Some churches were raised around godlike images of Ugin (and, to a lesser extent, Sorin and Nahiri).": "这个时代的寺庙描绘了一些古老的神灵，但对天使的崇拜也开始于这个时期。一些教堂围绕着乌金（以及在较小的程度上，索林和纳希里）的神像而建立。",
	"This era boasted the creation of sites such as these:": "这个时代以创建这样的网站为荣。",
	"Eye of Ugin (Akoum)": "乌金之眼（阿库姆）",

	"Crypt of Agadeem (Ondu)": "阿加迪姆的墓穴（翁都）。",
	"Emeria, the Sky Ruin (Tazeem)": "埃默里亚，天空的废墟 (塔泽姆)",
	"Once the Eldrazi vanished from Zendikar and Nahiri entered her stasis in the Eye of Ugin, the face of the plane changed forever. The Roil destroyed many settlements, and the kor began their nomadic lifestyle. Over time, the true nature of the Eldrazi horror was forgotten, and artistic representations of the titans as the gods of the merfolk and kor appeared in temples. Among the kor, these images were sometimes accompanied by statues of Nahiri, the \"prophet of Talib\" who taught her people the stoneforge arts.": "一旦埃尔德拉兹从赞迪卡消失，纳希里进入她在乌金之眼中的停滞状态，这个星球的面貌就永远改变了。咆哮摧毁了许多定居点，科尔人开始了他们的游牧生活。随着时间的推移，埃尔德拉兹恐怖的真正本质被遗忘了，泰坦作为人鱼和科尔的神的艺术表现出现在寺庙中。在科尔人中，这些图像有时伴随着纳希里的雕像，纳希里是 \"塔里布的先知\"，他教会了她的人民石器铸造术。",
	"Post-Eldrazi sites include the following:": "后Eldrazi网站包括以下内容。",
	"The Living Spire (Murasa)": "活生生的尖塔 (Murasa)",

	"Hagra Cistern (Guul Draz)": "哈格拉蓄水池 (Guul Draz)",
	"Helix of Zof (Guul Draz)": "佐夫螺旋 (Guul Draz)",
	"For the most part, there's no need to craft new monsters out of whole cloth to reflect the creatures of Zendikar. The D&D Monster Manual is full of creatures that have obvious equivalents on Zendikar. That plane's loam lion is just a kind of lion, for example. There are also plenty of close equivalents. An ankheg from the Monster Manual is a fine way to represent a caustic crawler, and similar examples abound. The goal of this section is to guide your choices of such equivalents. The Eldrazi are an exception—they're such an important part of the story of Zendikar that they deserve a little more attention.": "在大多数情况下，没有必要为了反映赞迪卡的生物而全盘制作新的怪兽。D&D怪物手册中充满了在赞迪卡星球上有明显对应物的生物。例如，那个平面的黄土狮只是狮子的一种。也有很多近似的等价物。怪物手册中的安克赫格是代表苛责爬行者的好方法，类似的例子比比皆是。本节的目的是指导你对这些等价物的选择。埃尔德拉兹是个例外--他们是赞迪卡故事的重要组成部分，值得多加注意。"
