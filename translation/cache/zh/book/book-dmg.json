	"It's good to be the dungeon master! Not only do you get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but you also get to create the world in which these stories live. Whether you're running a D&D game already or you think it's something you want to try, this book is for you.": "做地下城主是件好事！你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事的世界。你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍、怪物和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事所处的世界。无论你是已经在经营D&D游戏，还是认为这是一个你想尝试的东西，这本书都是为你准备的。",
	"The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} assumes that you know the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying game. If you haven't played before, the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set is a great starting point for new players and DMs.": "{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}假设你知道如何玩D&D桌面角色扮演游戏的基本知识。如果你以前没有玩过，《龙与地下城》入门套装是新玩家和DM的一个很好的起点。",
	"This book has two important companions: the Player's Handbook, which contains the rules your players need to create characters and the rules you need to run the game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to use monsters to populate your D&D world.": "本书有两个重要的伙伴：《玩家手册》和《怪物手册》，前者包含玩家创建角色所需的规则和你运行游戏所需的规则，后者包含可随时使用的怪物以填充你的D&D世界。",
	"The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the other players to explore, and also creates and runs adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single game session. Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung together, these adventures form an ongoing {@b campaign.} A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.": "地牢管理员（DM）是D&D游戏背后的创造性力量。管理员为其他玩家创造了一个可以探索的世界，同时也创造和运行驱动故事的冒险。一个冒险通常取决于任务的成功完成，可以短至一个游戏会话。较长的冒险可能会使玩家陷入巨大的冲突，需要多个游戏会话来解决。当这些冒险串联在一起时，就形成了一个持续的（%0%）D&D活动可以包括几十个冒险，并持续数月或数年。",
	"A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other players' characters (the {@b adventurers}) to discover. As a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what's happening around them, improvising when the adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them.": "地牢管理员可以戴上许多帽子。作为活动的设计者，DM通过放置怪物、陷阱和宝物来创造冒险，让其他玩家的角色（%0%）去发现。作为一个讲故事的人，DM帮助其他玩家想象他们周围发生的事情，当冒险者做一些事情或去一些意想不到的地方时，他就会即兴发挥。作为一个演员，DM扮演怪物和配角的角色，为他们注入活力。而作为裁判员，DM解释规则，决定何时遵守规则，何时改变规则。",
	"Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It helps to remember that Dungeons & Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use published ones. You can also lean on the other players to help you with rules mastery and world-building.": "发明、写作、讲故事、即兴创作、表演、裁判--每个DM处理这些角色的方式都不一样，你可能会比其他人更喜欢一些。记住 \"龙与地下城 \"是一种爱好，做管理员应该是有趣的。专注于你喜欢的方面，淡化其他方面。例如，如果你不喜欢创造你自己的冒险，你可以使用已出版的冒险。你也可以依靠其他玩家来帮助你掌握规则和构建世界。",
	"The D&D rules help you and the other players have a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players coming back for more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session is concluded.": "D&D规则帮助你和其他玩家度过一段美好的时光，但规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏的进行。也就是说，你的目标不是屠杀冒险者，而是创造一个围绕着他们的行动和决定的活动世界，并让你的玩家不断地回来找寻更多的东西 如果你运气好的话，你的战役事件在最后的游戏环节结束后还会在玩家的记忆中久久回荡。",
	"This book is organized in three parts. The first part helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to run. The second part helps you create the adventures-the stories-that will compose the campaign and keep the players entertained from one game session to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of your campaign.": "本书分为三部分。第一部分帮助你决定你想开展什么样的活动。第二部分帮助你创造冒险--故事--这些故事将构成竞选活动，使玩家从一个游戏环节到另一个游戏环节都能得到乐趣。最后一部分帮助你决定游戏规则，并修改它们以适应你的活动风格。",
	"Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for the D&D game, you make that world your own over the course of a campaign.": "每个管理人都是他或她自己活动世界的创造者。无论你是发明了一个世界，还是从最喜欢的电影或小说中改编了一个世界，或者使用已出版的D&D游戏设定，你都会在活动过程中把这个世界变成你自己的。",
	"The world where you set your campaign is one of countless worlds that make up the D&D {@b multiverse}, a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen. Even if you're using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players' actions.": "你设定竞选活动的世界是构成D&D{@b multiverse}的无数世界之一，是一系列冒险发生的星球和世界。即使你使用的是一个既定的世界，比如被遗忘的领域，你的活动也是发生在一种官方设定的镜像宇宙中，被遗忘的领域的小说、游戏产品和数字游戏都被认为是发生在这里。这个世界是你的，你可以根据自己的需要来改变，你可以在探索玩家行为的后果时对其进行修改。",
	"Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart from it.": "你的世界不仅仅是一个冒险的背景。就像中土世界、维斯特洛和其他无数的幻想世界一样，它是一个你可以逃避并见证奇妙故事展开的地方。一个设计良好、运行良好的世界似乎围绕着冒险者流动，使他们感到自己是某些东西的一部分，而不是与它分离。",
	"Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world. When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should encounter the same {@b nonplayer characters} (NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of change-one that has nothing to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they'll notice-makes the players feel as though their characters are part of a living world that changes and grows along with them.": "一致性是一个可信的虚构世界的关键。当冒险家们回到镇上购买补给品时，他们应该会遇到之前遇到的那些（%0%）（NPC）。很快，他们就会知道酒吧老板的名字，而他或她也会记住他们的名字。一旦你达到了这种程度的一致性，你就可以提供一个偶尔的变化。如果冒险者回来在马厩里买更多的马，他们可能会发现经营这个地方的人回到了山那边的大城市，现在他的侄女在经营家族生意。这种变化--与冒险者没有直接关系，但他们会注意到--使玩家感到他们的角色是一个活生生的世界的一部分，这个世界与他们一起变化和成长。",
	"Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information presented in the {@i Player's Handbook} to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.": "本书的第一部分是关于发明你的世界。第1章问你想运行什么类型的游戏，并帮助你确定关于你的世界和其总体冲突的一些重要细节。第2章帮助你把你的世界放在多元宇宙的大背景下，在{@i Player's Handbook}中介绍的信息的基础上扩展，讨论存在平面和诸神，以及你如何把它们放在一起以满足你的活动的需要。",
	"Whether you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.": "无论你是自己写冒险故事还是使用已出版的冒险故事，都需要投入准备时间，而不是在游戏桌前花费的时间。你需要抽出一些空闲时间来锻炼你的创造力，因为你要发明引人注目的情节，创造新的NPC，制作遭遇战，并想出巧妙的方法来预示即将发生的故事。",
	"Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the players invested in your campaign.": "本书的第二部分致力于帮助你创建和运行伟大的冒险。第3章介绍了D&D冒险的基本要素，第4章帮助你创建令人难忘的NPC。第5章介绍了在地下城、荒野和其他地方进行冒险的指南和建议，第6章涉及冒险之间的时间。第7章是关于宝藏、魔法物品和特殊奖励的内容，这些都有助于让玩家投入到你的活动中。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons isn't a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on the referee role.": "龙与地下城并不是一场头对头的比赛，但它需要一个公正而又参与游戏的人，以保证桌子上的每个人都按规则行事。作为创造游戏世界和发生在其中的冒险的玩家，管理员自然适合担任裁判员的角色。",
	"As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is successful or not, in some cases asking the player to make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a player wants his or her character to take a swing at an orc, you say, \"Make an attack roll\" while looking up the orc's Armor Class.": "作为裁判员，DM在规则和玩家之间充当调解人。玩家告诉管理员他或她想做什么，而管理员则决定是否成功，在某些情况下，要求玩家进行掷骰子来决定是否成功。例如，如果玩家想让他或她的角色向一个兽人挥拳，你就说：\"做一个攻击卷\"，同时查一下兽人的装甲等级。",
	"The rules don't account for every possible situation that might arise during a typical D&D session. For example, a player might want his or her character to hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. How you determine the outcome of this action is up to you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, while mentally setting the {@b Difficulty Class} (DC) at 15. If the Strength check is successful, you then determine how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You might decide that it deals {@dice 1d4} fire damage and imposes disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player do it), and the game continues.": "这些规则并没有考虑到典型的D&D会议中可能出现的每一种情况。例如，玩家可能想让他或她的角色把一个装满热煤的火炉扔到怪物的脸上。如何决定这一行动的结果由你决定。你可以告诉玩家进行力量检查，同时在心理上将（%0%）（DC）设定为15。如果力量检查成功，你就会决定满脸的热煤对怪物的影响。你可以决定它造成{@dice 1d4}的火焰伤害，并对怪物的攻击卷轴施加不利因素，直到它的下一回合结束。你掷出伤害模子（或让玩家掷出），然后游戏继续。",
	"Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. If a player tells you, \"I want to run up and attack the orc,\" but the character doesn't have enough movement to reach the orc, you say, \"It's too far away to move up and still attack. What would you like to do instead?\" The player takes the information and comes up with a different plan.": "有时调解规则意味着设定限制。如果一个玩家告诉你，\"我想跑上去攻击那个兽人\"，但是角色没有足够的移动能力去接触那个兽人，你就说，\"它太远了，无法移动，而且还能攻击。你想怎么做呢？\" 玩家接受了这些信息，想出了一个不同的计划。",
	"To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don't have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook, but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to find the proper reference.": "要做裁判，你需要了解这些规则。你不必记住这本书或玩家手册，但你应该对它们的内容有一个清晰的概念，这样，当有情况需要裁决时，你就知道在哪里可以找到适当的参考。",
	"The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also includes options appropriate for certain play styles and campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.": "玩家手册》包含了你玩游戏所需的主要规则。本书第三部分提供了丰富的信息，帮助你在各种情况下对规则进行裁决。第8章介绍了使用攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力的建议。它还包括适合某些游戏风格和活动的选项，包括使用微型模型的指南、处理追逐场景的系统和疯狂规则。如果你喜欢创造自己的东西，比如新的怪物、种族和角色背景，第9章会告诉你如何做。这一章还包含了针对不寻常情况或玩法的可选规则，如在奇幻环境中使用枪支。",
	"The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer the campaign through their characters' actions, your role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world you've created, and to let their characters do awesome things.": "D&D游戏的成功取决于你在游戏桌上招待其他玩家的能力。他们的作用是创造角色（活动的主角），为他们注入生命，并通过他们的角色行动来帮助引导活动，而你的作用是让玩家（和你自己）感兴趣并沉浸在你创造的世界中，并让他们的角色做一些了不起的事情。",
	"Knowing what your players enjoy most about the D&D game helps you create and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of the following activities each player in your group enjoys the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping them engaged.": "了解你的玩家在D&D游戏中最喜欢什么，有助于你创建和运行他们会喜欢并记住的冒险。一旦你知道你的小组中的每个玩家最喜欢以下哪种活动，你就可以定制尽可能满足玩家喜好的冒险，从而保持他们的参与。",
	"Players who enjoy acting like getting into character and speaking in their characters' voices. Roleplayers at heart, they enjoy social interactions with NPCs, monsters, and their fellow party members.": "喜欢演戏的玩家，比如进入角色，用角色的声音说话。他们是内心深处的角色扮演者，喜欢与NPC、怪物和他们的同伴进行社交互动。",

	"This book, the {@i Player's Handbook}, and the {@i Monster Manual} present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.": "本书、{@i Player's Handbook}和{@i Monster Manual}提出了D&D世界如何运作的默认假设。在D&D的既定设定中，被遗忘的王国（Forgotten Realms）、灰鹰（Greyhawk）、龙之谷（Dragonlance）和秘境（Mystara）并没有偏离这些假设的范围。黑暗太阳、Eberron、Ravenloft、Spelljammer和Planescape等设定则进一步偏离了这一基线。当你创造你自己的世界时，你要决定你想让你的世界落在什么位置。",

	"The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.": "神是真实存在的，体现了各种信仰，每个神都声称对世界的某个方面有统治权，如战争、森林或海洋。众神通过向其追随者授予神圣的魔法，并发送征兆和预兆来引导他们，从而对世界施加影响。一个神的追随者作为该神在这个世界上的代理人。代理人寻求推进该神的理想并击败其对手。虽然有些人可能拒绝尊重神灵，但没有人能够否认他们的存在。",
	"Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They've heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they've been there themselves.": "野生地区比比皆是。大大小小的城邦、邦联和王国点缀着这片土地，但在它们的边界之外，荒野拥挤不堪。人们对自己居住的地区非常了解。他们从商人和旅行者那里听说过其他地方的故事，但很少有人知道山外或大森林深处有什么，除非他们亲自去过那里。",
	"Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.": "帝国兴衰，很少有地方没有被帝国的宏伟或衰败所触动。战争、时间和自然力量最终夺走了凡人的世界，留下了丰富的冒险和神秘的地方。古代文明和他们的知识在传说、魔法物品和他们的废墟中幸存下来。混乱和邪恶往往伴随着一个帝国的崩溃。",
	"Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the world's fate.": "有权势的人努力在这个世界上留下自己的印记，而志同道合的人组成的派别可以改变历史的进程。派别包括由有魅力的先知领导的宗教，由持久的王朝统治的王国，以及寻求掌握失传已久的魔法的阴暗社会。这些派别的影响力随着他们之间的权力竞争而消长。一些人寻求保护世界，迎来一个黄金时代。其他人则努力实现邪恶的目的，寻求用铁拳统治世界。还有一些人寻求从实用到深奥的目标，如积累物质财富或复活死去的神。无论他们的目标是什么，这些派别都不可避免地发生碰撞，产生冲突，从而引导世界的命运。",
	"Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical abilities.": "魔法从业者的数量相对较少，但他们到处都留下了他们技艺的证据。这些魔法可以是无害的、普通的，如治疗伤口的药水，也可以是更罕见的、令人印象深刻的东西，如浮空塔或守卫城市大门的石雕。在文明的领域之外，还有由魔法陷阱守护的魔法物品库，以及由魔法创造的怪物、被魔法诅咒的怪物或被赋予魔法能力的怪物居住的魔法建造的地牢。",
	"In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have done. Ask yourself, \"What if the standard assumptions weren't true in my world?\"": "在创建你的活动世界时，从核心假设开始，并考虑你的设定会如何改变它们，这是有帮助的。本章的后续章节将讨论每个要素，并详细介绍如何用神灵、派别等来充实你的世界。上面勾勒的假设并不是刻在石头上的。它们激发了令人兴奋的、充满冒险的D&D世界，但它们并不是唯一能够做到这一点的一套假设。你可以通过改变这些核心假设中的一个或多个来建立一个有趣的活动概念，就像成熟的D&D世界所做的那样。问问自己，\"如果标准的假设在我的世界里不是真的呢？\"",
	"What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world's history?": "如果魔法是罕见的、危险的，甚至冒险者也只能有限地或根本无法获得它，那该怎么办？如果你的活动设定在我们自己世界的历史版本中呢？",
	"What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? The adventurers might be champions of the first great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting.": "如果你的世界是新的，而角色是一长串英雄中的第一个呢？冒险家们可能是第一个伟大帝国的冠军，比如被遗忘的领域中的尼瑟尔和科曼托帝国。",
	"What if the world is completely charted and mapped, right down to the \"Here there be dragons\" notations? What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is commonplace.": "如果世界完全被绘制成地图，甚至包括 \"这里有龙 \"的标记，那会怎样？如果伟大的帝国覆盖了大片的乡村，它们之间有明确的边界，那会怎样？Eberron设定中的五国曾经是一个大帝国的一部分，在其城市之间进行魔法辅助的旅行是很常见的。",
	"What if monsters are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people's daily lives.": "如果怪兽是罕见的、可怕的呢？在《雷文洛夫特》的设定中，可怕的领地由畸形的统治者统治着。民众永远生活在对这些黑暗统治者及其邪恶爪牙的恐惧之中，但其他怪物却很少困扰人们的日常生活。",
	"What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city to another.": "如果每个城镇都被一个强大的巫师所统治呢？如果魔法物品商店很常见呢？Eberron的设定使魔法的使用成为一种日常现象，因为神奇的飞船和火车将旅行者从一个大城市带到另一个城市。",
	"What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the characters can challenge them and seize their power? Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.": "如果诸神定期在地球上行走呢？如果人物可以挑战他们并夺取他们的权力呢？或者，如果诸神很遥远，甚至天使也从不与凡人接触呢？在黑暗太阳的设定中，诸神非常遥远--也许是不存在的--而神职人员的魔法则依赖于元素的力量。",
	"Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your game, including the gods of established D&D worlds and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you please. See \"A Sample Pantheon\" in this section for an example. As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate domains with deities in any way you choose.": "玩家手册》的附录B介绍了一些供你在游戏中使用的万神殿（不是由单一教义或哲学统一的松散的神灵组合），包括既定的D&D世界的神灵和幻想历史中的万神殿。你可以在你的活动中采用这些万神殿中的一个，也可以根据你的意愿从中挑选神灵和想法。请参阅本节中的 \"万神殿样本\"，了解一个例子。就游戏规则而言，如果你的世界有成百上千的神灵，或者只有一个教堂专门供奉一个神，这并不重要。在规则方面，牧师选择领域，而不是神灵，所以你的世界可以以任何你选择的方式将领域与神灵联系起来。",
	"Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe. People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or destruction. Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war fought nobly and in the cause of justice.": "大多数D&D世界都有一个松散的众神殿。众多的神灵统治着存在的各个方面，在管理宇宙事务时，他们相互合作或相互竞争。人们聚集在公共神殿中崇拜生命和智慧之神，或者在隐秘的地方聚会，敬仰欺骗或破坏之神。万神殿中的每个神灵都有一个组合，并负责推进该组合。在灰鹰的设定中，Heironeous是一位英勇之神，他召唤牧师和圣骑士为他服务，鼓励他们在社会上传播光荣的战争、骑士精神和正义的理想。即使在他与他的兄弟--战争和暴政之神海克斯托（Hextor）的永恒战争中，Heironeous也在宣传他自己的组合：为了正义而高尚地进行战争。",
	"People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting.": "大多数D&D世界的人们都是多神论者，他们尊敬自己的神灵，也承认其他文化的万神殿。个人向不同的神灵致敬，而不考虑他们的取向。在被遗忘的领域，一个人可能会在出海前祭拜Umberlee，在收获季节参加庆祝Chauntea的集体宴会，并在打猎前向Malar祈祷。",
	"Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true divine power.": "有些人感到被召唤去为某一特定的神灵服务，并称该神为守护神。特别虔诚的人通过建立神龛或帮助圣地的工作人员成为牧师。更罕见的是，那些感受到这种召唤的人成为牧师或圣骑士，被赋予真正的神力的责任。",
	"Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere.": "祠堂和庙宇是社区宗教仪式和节日的聚集点。这些地方的祭司讲述神的故事，传授他们的守护神的道德观，提供建议和祝福，举行宗教仪式，并在他们的神灵所喜爱的活动中提供培训。城市和大城镇可以有几座寺庙，专门供奉对社区很重要的个别神灵，而较小的定居点可能有一座神龛，专门供奉当地人崇敬的任何神灵。",
	"To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god and the god of time.": "为了迅速为你的世界建立一个万神殿，为神职人员可用的八个领域各创建一个神。死亡、知识、生命、光明、自然、暴风雨、诡计和战争。你可以为这些神灵发明名字和个性，或者从其他神殿借用神灵。这种方法为你提供了一个小型万神殿，涵盖了存在的最重要方面，而且很容易推断出每个神灵控制的其他生活领域。例如，知识之神也可能是魔法和预言的守护神，而光明之神可能是太阳神和时间之神。",
	"The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition {@i Player's Handbook (2008)}. The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deities table.": "黎明之战的万神殿是一个例子，它是由大部分预先存在的元素组成的万神殿，以适应特定活动的需要。这是第四版中的默认万神殿（%0%）。该万神殿在 \"黎明之战神祗表 \"中进行了总结。",
	"This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny.": "这个万神殿吸纳了几个非人类的神灵，并将他们确立为普遍的神灵。这些神包括巴哈姆特（Bahamut）、科瑞隆（Corellon）、格鲁姆什（Gruumsh）、洛特（Lolth）、莫拉丁（Moradin）、塞哈宁（Sehanine）和提亚马特（Tiamat）。人类将莫拉丁和科雷隆作为他们各自组合的神灵来崇拜，而不是作为种族神灵。万神殿还包括作为统治和暴政之神的大恶魔阿斯莫德。",
	"Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's Hel and Greyhawk's Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog.": "有几位神灵来自其他万神殿，有时还为神灵取了新的名字。班恩来自被遗忘的领域。灰鹰（Greyhawk）的科德（Kord）、佩罗（Pelor）、塔里兹顿（Tharizdun）和维克纳（Vecna）。希腊万神殿的雅典娜（改名为Erathis）和泰切（改名为Avandra），尽管两者都被改变了。Set（改名为Zehir）来自埃及的万神殿。乌鸦女王类似于北欧万神殿的赫尔和灰鹰城的韦亚斯。这就留下了三个从头开始创造的神。伊翁、梅罗拉和托罗格。",

	"In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.": "与松散的万神殿相反，严密的万神殿专注于一个单一的宗教，其教义和法令包括一小群神灵。严密万神殿的追随者可能会偏爱其中一个成员的神灵，但他们尊重所有的神灵，并在适当的时候用祭品和祈祷向他们致敬。",
	"The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all members of the pantheon.": "严密万神殿的关键特征是其崇拜者接受一个包括所有神灵的单一精神或教条。严密万神殿的神灵作为一个整体来保护和引导他们的追随者。你可以把严密万神殿想象成类似于一个家庭。一个或两个领导万神殿的神灵作为家长人物，其他神灵作为崇拜万神殿的文化的重要方面的赞助人。一座寺庙就会向万神殿的所有成员致敬。",
	"Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship.": "大多数严密的万神殿都有一个或多个反常的神--其崇拜不被整个万神殿的祭司所认可的神。这些通常是邪恶的神灵和万神殿的敌人，如希腊泰坦。这些神灵有自己的崇拜，吸引着社会上的弃儿和恶棍来崇拜他们。",
	"These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples of the tight pantheon.": "这些教派类似于神秘教派，其成员严格献身于他们的单一神灵，尽管即使是反常教派的成员也会在严格的万神殿中进行口头服务。",
	"The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them with the pantheon's enemies.": "北欧的神灵是一个紧密的万神殿的例子。奥丁是万神殿的领袖和父亲形象。雷神、泰尔和芙蕾雅等神灵体现了北欧文化的重要方面。同时，洛基和他的信徒潜伏在暗处，有时帮助其他神灵，有时与万神殿的敌人一起对抗他们。",
	"A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned with the initiate's relationship with the divine.": "神秘邪教是一种基于入教仪式的秘密宗教组织，在这种仪式中，入教者被神秘地认同于一个神或少数几个相关的神。神秘邪教是强烈的个人化的，关注入门者与神的关系。",
	"Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon.": "有时，神秘崇拜是万神殿内的一种崇拜类型。它承认万神殿的神话和仪式，但把自己的神话和仪式作为主要内容。例如，一个秘密的僧侣团体可能会将自己沉浸在与一个属于广泛崇拜的万神殿的神的神秘关系中。",
	"A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities—gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.": "神秘崇拜强调其神的历史，在其入教仪式中象征性地重现了这一历史。神秘崇拜的基础神话通常很简单，通常涉及到一个神的死亡和复活，或一个前往冥界的旅程和返回。神秘崇拜通常崇尚太阳和月亮神以及农业神，这些神的组合反映了自然界的周期。",
	"The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps in order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also experiences new meaning in life.": "该邪教的入教仪式遵循其基础神话的模式。新人追寻神的脚步，以分享神的最终命运。在垂死的神和崛起的神的情况下，入会者的象征性死亡代表了对旧生活的死亡和重生到一个转变的存在的想法。入门者出生在一个新的生活中，留在凡人的世界里，但感觉被提升到一个更高的境界。入门者被许诺死后在神的领域中占有一席之地，但同时也体验到生活的新意义。",
	"The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, depending on their influence there.": "多元宇宙的神灵通常根据其宇宙力量进行分类。有些神灵在多个世界受到崇拜，在每个世界都有不同的等级，这取决于他们在那里的影响力。",
	"{@b Greater deities} are beyond mortal understanding. They can't be summoned, and they are almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself.": "{@b Greater deities}是凡人无法理解的。他们不能被召唤，而且他们几乎总是不直接参与凡人的事务。在非常罕见的情况下，他们会显现出类似于小神的化身，但杀死大神的化身对神本身没有影响。",
	"{@b Lesser deities} are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can be encountered by mortals.": "{@b Lesser deities}都体现在各个位面的某个地方。一些较小的神灵生活在物质界，如被遗忘的领域中的独角兽女神露露和萨瓦金人所敬仰的泰坦鲨鱼神塞科拉。其他人则生活在外部星球上，如深渊中的洛尔思。凡人可以遇到这样的神祗。",
	"{@b Quasi-deities} have a divine origin, but they don't hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: demigods, titans, and vestiges.": "{@b Quasi-deities}有神圣的起源，但他们不听或不回答祈祷，不授予牧师法术，或控制凡人生活的各个方面。他们仍然是非常强大的生命，理论上，如果他们积累了足够的崇拜者，他们可以升为神。准神分为三个子类别：半神、泰坦和遗迹。",
	"{@i Demigods} are born from the union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities.": "{@i Demigods}是由一个神灵和一个凡人的结合而生。他们有一些神性属性，但他们的凡人父母身份使他们成为最弱的准神。",
	"{@i Titans} are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will or substance.": "{@i Titans}是神祗的神圣创造物。他们可能是从两个神灵的结合中诞生的，在一个神圣的锻造厂制造的，从一个神灵的血液中诞生的，或者通过神圣的意志或物质带来的其他方式。",
	"{@i Vestiges} are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their latent power.": "{@i Vestiges}是那些几乎失去了所有崇拜者的神灵，从凡人的角度来看，他们被认为已经死亡。神秘的仪式有时可以与这些生命接触，汲取他们的潜在力量。",
	"Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they don't, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.": "一神教只敬重一个神，在某些情况下，否认任何其他神的存在。如果你在你的战役中引入了一神教，你需要决定其他神是否存在。即使它们不存在，其他宗教也可以与一神教并存。如果这些宗教有具有法术能力的牧师，他们的法术可能是由唯一的真神、不是神的较小的精神（可能包括强大的反常者、天人、妖怪、魔人或元素），或者仅仅是由他们的信仰提供的。",
	"The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to the same god.": "一神教的神灵有广泛的组合，被描绘成万物的创造者，控制着一切，关注着生存的每一个方面。因此，这种神的崇拜者无论在生活的哪个方面需要神的帮助，都要向同一个神祈祷和献祭。无论是行军打仗，还是出发旅行，或者希望赢得某人的感情，崇拜者都向同一个神祈祷。",
	"Some monotheistic religions describe different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to differentiate clerics who choose different domains.": "一些一神教描述了他们神灵的不同方面。一个单一的神在不同的方面出现，如创造者和毁灭者，该神的神职人员专注于一个方面或另一个方面，在此基础上决定他们的领域权限，甚至可能是他们的排列。崇拜毁灭者的神职人员选择暴风雨或战争领域，而崇拜创造者的神职人员则选择生命或自然领域。在一些一神教中，教士们将自己分成不同的宗教团体，以区分选择不同领域的教士。",
	"A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good-beneficial, desirable, or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.": "二元论宗教认为世界是两个截然相反的神灵或神性力量之间的冲突舞台。大多数情况下，对立的力量是善与恶，或代表这些力量的对立神灵。在一些万神殿中，法律和混乱的力量或神灵是二元体系中的基本对立面。生命与死亡、光明与黑暗、物质与精神、身体与心灵、健康与疾病、纯洁与污秽、正能量与负能量--D&D宇宙充满了两极对立，可以作为二元论宗教的基础。无论二元论以何种方式表达，这对二元论的一半通常被认为是好的--有益的、可取的或神圣的，而另一半则被认为是坏的，如果不是明确的邪恶。如果一个宗教的基本冲突被表述为物质和精神的对立，那么该宗教的信徒就认为两者中的一个（通常是物质）是邪恶的，另一个（精神）是好的，因此寻求通过禁欲主义和沉思将他们的精神从这个物质世界及其邪恶中解放出来。",
	"Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound together in creative tension.": "罕见的二元论系统认为，两种对立的力量必须保持平衡，总是相互拉开距离，但在创造性的张力中保持结合。",
	"In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory.": "在一个由善与恶之间的永恒冲突所定义的宇宙论中，凡人被期望选边站。大多数信奉二元论宗教的人都崇拜被认定为善的神灵或力量。善神的崇拜者相信自己有神的力量来保护他们不受恶神的奴役。因为这种宗教中的邪神通常是一切不利于生存的根源，所以只有变态和堕落的人才会崇拜这个神。怪兽和恶魔为其服务，某些秘密的邪教也是如此。二元论宗教的神话通常预测善神将在世界末日之战中取得胜利，但邪恶势力认为这场战斗的结果并不是预先确定的，并努力促进他们的神的胜利。",
	"Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity.": "二元系统中的神灵保持着大量的投资组合。存在的所有方面都反映了二元论的斗争，因此，所有事物都可能落在冲突的一方或另一方。农业、仁慈、天空、医药和诗歌属于善神的组合，而饥荒、仇恨、疾病和战争则属于恶神。",
	"Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not veneration.": "万物有灵论是一种信仰，认为自然界的每一部分都有灵。在万物有灵论的世界观中，一切都有灵，从最宏伟的山峰到最低矮的岩石，从巨大的海洋到潺潺的小溪，从太阳和月亮到战士的祖先之剑。所有这些物体，以及居住在它们身上的精神，都是有生命的，尽管有些比其他物体更有意识，更警觉，更聪明。最强大的精神甚至可能被视为神灵。所有这些都是值得尊重的，如果不是崇敬的话。",
	"Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other spirits as well.": "万物有灵论者通常不会向一个神灵效忠，而向其他神灵效忠。相反，他们在不同的时间向不同的神灵祈祷和献祭，以适应情况的需要。一个虔诚的人物可能会每天向祖先的神灵和房子的神灵祈祷和献祭，定期向重要的神灵如七福神请愿，偶尔向地点的神灵如森林的神灵献上香火，以及向许多其他神灵零星祈祷。",
	"An animistic religion is very tolerant. Most spirits don't care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and respect for the spirits they already venerate.": "一个万物有灵的宗教是非常宽容的。大多数神灵并不关心一个角色也向谁提供祭品，只要他们得到应有的祭品和尊重。当新的宗教在万物有灵论的土地上传播时，这些宗教通常会赢得信徒，但不是皈依者。人们将新的精神和神灵纳入他们的祈祷中，而不会取代旧的精神和神灵。沉思者和学者们采用复杂的哲学体系和实践，而不改变他们对已经崇敬的神灵的信仰和尊重。",
	"Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for that cleric.": "万物有灵论的功能是一个大型的紧密的万神殿。万物有灵教的教士为整个万神殿服务，因此可以选择任何领域，代表该教士最喜欢的精神。",
	"Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather than a specific deity.": "并非所有的神力都需要来自神灵。在一些活动中，信徒们对他们关于宇宙的想法持有足够的信念，他们从这种信念中获得了神奇的力量。在其他战役中，非个人的自然或魔法力量取代了神灵，将力量授予与之相适应的凡人。就像德鲁伊和游侠可以从自然之力而不是特定的自然神灵那里获得法术能力一样，一些牧师将自己奉献给理想而不是神灵。圣骑士可能服务于一种正义和骑士精神的哲学，而不是一个特定的神灵。",
	"Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate goal of some philosophies.": "力量和哲学不受崇拜；它们不是能听到并回应祈祷或接受祭品的生命。对一种哲学或一种力量的奉献并不一定与对神灵的服务相排斥。一个人可以献身于善的哲学，并向各种善的神灵提供崇拜，或者崇尚自然的力量，同时也向自然之神致敬，他们可能被视为一种非个人力量的个人表现。在一个包括具有可证明力量的神灵（通过他们的神职人员）的世界里，一种哲学否认神灵的存在是不寻常的，尽管一种常见的哲学信念指出，神灵比他们让凡人相信的更像凡人。根据这种哲学，神灵并非真正不朽（只是非常长寿），凡人可以达到神性。事实上，提升为神是一些哲学的最终目标。",
	"The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power on that person.": "哲学的力量源于凡人对它的信仰。只有一个人相信的哲学并不足以赋予这个人神奇的力量。",
	"When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own array of gods.": "谈到神灵，人类表现出的信仰和制度远比其他种族广泛。在许多D&D设定中，兽人、精灵、矮人、地精和其他人类都有严格的神殿。预计兽人将崇拜格鲁姆什或少数几个附属神灵中的一个。相比之下，人类拥护的神灵种类多得惊人。每个人类文化都可能有自己的神灵阵列。",
	"In most D&D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the prophet's followers might turn against one another and found several competing religions.": "在大多数D&D设定中，没有一个神可以声称创造了人类。因此，人类建立机构的倾向性也延伸到了宗教。一个有魅力的先知可以让整个王国的人崇拜一个新的神。随着先知的死亡，该宗教可能会消亡，或者先知的追随者们可能会反目成仇，成立几个相互竞争的宗教。",
	"In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to replace him.": "相比之下，矮人社会的宗教是固定的。被遗忘的王国的矮人将莫拉丁视为他们的创造者。虽然个别矮人可能会追随其他神灵，但作为一种文化，矮人对莫拉丁和他领导的万神殿是有承诺的。他的教义和魔法在矮人文化中根深蒂固，要想取代他，就必须进行一场大灾难。",
	"With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new race appeared, created by a god within the past few years? A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution. With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled.": "考虑到这一点，考虑诸神在你的世界中的作用以及他们与不同人种的关系。每个种族都有一个创造者之神吗？该神如何塑造该种族的文化？其他民族是否没有这种神的联系，可以自由地按自己的意愿进行崇拜？一个种族是否已经背叛了创造它的神？是否出现了一个新的种族，在过去几年内由一个神创造？一个神灵也可能与一个王国、贵族阶层或其他文化机构有联系。随着皇帝的死亡，新的统治者可能是由早期保护帝国的神灵发出的神兆来选择的。在这样的土地上，对其他神灵的崇拜可能被禁止或被严格控制。",
	"Finally, consider the difference between gods who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god or another?": "最后，考虑与特定人形种族相联系的神和拥有更多不同追随者的神之间的区别。拥有自己万神殿的种族在你的世界中是否享有特权，他们的神在他们的事务中发挥着积极作用？其他种族是否被诸神忽视，或者这些种族是否是能够使权力的天平向一个或另一个神倾斜的决定性因素？",
	"When creating the world where your campaign takes place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the characters into new territory. Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 7 offers more information about creating and mapping wilderness areas.": "当创建你的活动发生的世界时，你会想要一张地图。你可以采取两种方法中的一种：自上而下或自下而上。有些DM喜欢从头开始，在战役开始时通过一张显示整个大陆的地图来创建世界的大画面，然后再放大到较小的区域。其他DM喜欢反其道而行之，从一个小的战役区域开始，以省或王国为单位绘制地图，然后随着冒险将人物带入新的领域而放大。无论你采取哪种方法，六边形都能很好地绘制户外环境，在这种环境中，旅行可以向任何方向进行，计算距离可能很重要。一张每英寸5个六角的六角纸是大多数地图的理想选择。为你的地图使用一个最适合你想要的详细程度的比例。第七章提供了更多关于创建和绘制荒野地区的信息。",
	"For the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area that can be covered in one day's travel in any direction from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a campaign's starting area (see \"Creating a Campaign,\" later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather than days.": "对于你的世界中最详细的区域，使用省的比例尺，每个六角代表1英里。在这种比例尺下，一张整页的地图所代表的区域，在假设地形清晰的情况下，从地图中心的任何方向出发，一天的行程都可以覆盖。因此，省的比例尺对于绘制战役的起始区（见本章后面的 \"创建战役\"）或任何你希望以小时而不是以天为单位跟踪冒险者行动的地点来说是很有用的。",
	"The ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terrain types.": "这种规模的地区的地面覆盖将包括一种主要地形类型的广泛延伸，并被其他孤立的地形类型打破。",
	"A settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the arable land within a mile or two.": "在这种规模的地图上，一个定居地区可能有一个城镇和8至12个村庄或农庄。一个比较荒凉的地区可能只有一个村庄，或者根本就没有定居点。你还可以指出每个城市或城镇周围的农田被清理的范围。在全省范围的地图上，这将显示为围绕每个城镇或村庄的几个六分之一宽的地带。即使是小村庄也会在一两英里内耕种大部分的可耕地。",
	"On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. That's plenty of room for adventuring.": "在王国规模的地图上，每个六角代表6英里。这种比例尺的地图涵盖了一个很大的区域，大约是大不列颠的大小或加利福尼亚的一半大小。这为冒险活动提供了足够的空间。",
	"The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple coastlines. Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as you see fit.": "以这种比例绘制地区地图的第一步是勾勒出该地区的海岸线和任何主要水体。该地区是内陆地区还是沿海地区？沿海地区可能包括离岸的岛屿，而内陆地区可能包括内陆海或主要湖泊。另外，该地区可能由一个大岛，或一个有多条海岸线的地峡或半岛组成。接下来，勾画出任何主要的山脉。山麓是山区和低地之间的过渡，宽阔的丘陵可能会点缀该地区。这就为地图的其余部分留下了相对平坦的地形：草原、森林、沼泽，等等。按你认为合适的方式放置这些元素。",
	"Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn't require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.": "绘制出流经该地区的任何河流的路线。河流诞生于山区或降雨量大的内陆地区，蜿蜒流向最近的主要水体，不需要河流跨越高海拔。当河流变大并向湖泊或海洋移动时，支流会加入河流。",
	"Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily have eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.": "最后，放置该地区的主要城镇。在这种规模下，你不需要担心小城镇和村庄，也不需要担心绘制每条农田带。即便如此，这么大的一个定居地区可能很容易就有八到十二个城市或城镇要放在地图上。",
	"For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of adventurers day by day.": "对于绘制整个大陆的地图，使用的比例尺是1个六边形代表60英里。在这种比例尺下，你只能看到海岸线的形状、最大的山脉、主要河流、巨大的湖泊和政治边界。这种比例尺的地图最适合于展示多个王国规模的地图是如何结合在一起的，而不是逐日追踪冒险者的行动。",
	"The same process you use for mapping a region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of kingdoms.": "你在绘制王国规模的地区地图时使用的程序也适用于绘制整个大陆的地图。一个大陆可能有8到12个值得在地图上占有一席之地的大型城市，很可能是主要的贸易中心和王国的首都。",
	"Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the opposite ends of the region you're detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and create interesting areas around it.": "无论你从哪种比例开始，都很容易放大或缩小你的地图。在大陆比例尺上，1个六边形代表与10个王国比例尺相同的区域。在大陆地图上相距3个六边形（180英里）的两个城市，在王国地图上则相距30个六边形，它们可能是你所描述的地区的两端。在王国比例尺上，1个六边形等于6个省比例尺的六边形，因此很容易将省比例尺地图所覆盖的区域放到王国比例尺地图的中心，并在其周围创建有趣的区域。",
	"The places where people live-bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among miles of farmland-help define the nature of civilization in your world. A single settlement—a home base for your adventurers-is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement in your world:": "人们居住的地方--喧嚣的城市、繁荣的城镇和依偎在数英里农田中的小村庄--有助于确定你的世界中文明的性质。一个单一的定居点--你的冒险者的大本营--是一个开始活动和开始你的世界建设的好地方。当你在你的世界中创建任何定居点时，请考虑以下问题。",

	"A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail you put into it.

	"A settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief description. Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, add a dash of flavor (\"The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this town\"), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters return to the same settlement, start adding these local features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop as the need arises.": "定居点可以作为人物停下来休息和购买物资的地方。一个这样的定居点只需要一个简单的描述。包括定居点的名字，决定它有多大，加上一点味道（\"当地制革厂的气味从未从这个镇上散去\"），然后让冒险家们继续他们的生意。人物过夜的旅店的历史，他们购买物资的店主的举止--你可以添加这种程度的细节，但你不必这样做。如果人物回到同一个定居点，就开始添加这些当地的特征，这样它就开始有点像一个大本营了，尽管是临时的。随着需求的出现，让定居点发展起来。",
	"A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the characters go out into the wider world.": "定居点为冒险者提供了一个在冒险之间生活、训练和休整的地方。整个活动可以以一个特定的城镇或城市为中心。这样的聚居地是一个发射台，角色们从这里出发，进入更广阔的世界。",

	"To make a home base come alive, you'll need to invest some time fleshing out details, but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit about mentors, family members, and other important people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters (NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe where and how their characters spend their time—a favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.": "要想让大本营变得生动，你需要投入一些时间来充实细节，但玩家可以帮助你完成这项工作。请他们告诉你一些关于导师、家庭成员和他们角色生活中其他重要人物的情况。你可以自由地补充和修改他们提供的信息，但你要从对角色很重要的非玩家角色（NPCs）的坚实基础开始。让玩家描述他们的角色在哪里以及如何度过他们的时间--也许是最喜欢的小酒馆、图书馆或寺庙。",
	"Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for the party's business. Think about the people who run the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.": "以这些NPC和地点为起点，充实定居点的人物阵容。详细说明其领导层，包括执法部门（在本章后面讨论）。包括可以提供信息的人物，如圣人、占卜师、图书管理员和观察力强的流浪者。牧师可以提供法术和信息。记下那些可能经常与冒险者打交道的商人，也许他们会为了聚会的生意相互竞争。想一想那些经营冒险者最喜欢的酒馆的人。然后再加上几张野牌：一个阴暗的商人、一个疯狂的预言家、一个退休的雇佣兵、一个醉醺醺的耙子，或者其他任何为你的活动增添冒险和阴谋的人。",

That key element suggests a wealth of sensory details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of mystery and lurking danger.": "也许一个城市是围绕运河而建的，就像现实世界中的威尼斯。这个关键因素暗示了大量的感官细节：五颜六色的船只漂浮在泥泞的水面上的景象，拍打波浪的声音，也许还有贡多拉的歌声，鱼和废物污染水的气味，潮湿的感觉。或者，这个城市大部分时间都笼罩在雾中，而你描述了冷雾的卷轴从每一个缝隙中伸入，马蹄在鹅卵石上发出的闷响，寒冷的空气中弥漫着雨的味道，以及一种神秘感和潜伏的危险。",
	"The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your campaign world.": "一个定居点的气候和地形，它的起源和居民，它的政府和政治地位，以及它的商业重要性，都对它的整体氛围有影响。依偎在丛林边缘的城市与位于沙漠边缘的城市有着非常不同的感觉。精灵和矮人的城市呈现出一种独特的美感，与人类建造的城市形成鲜明的对比，清晰可辨。在一个由暴君统治的城市中，士兵们在街上巡逻以平息任何异议，而一个培养早期民主制度的城市可能会拥有一个露天市场，在那里哲学思想可以像农产品一样自由交易。这些因素的所有可能的组合可以激发你的战役世界的定居点的无尽变化。",
	"In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, power and authority are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving human bandits.": "在大多数D&D世界中常见的封建社会中，权力和权威都集中在城镇和城市。贵族们对他们所居住的定居点和周围的土地拥有权力。他们向民众征税，用于公共建筑项目，支付士兵的工资，并支持自己的舒适生活（尽管贵族通常拥有相当多的世袭财富）。作为交换，他们承诺保护他们的公民免受威胁，如兽人掠夺者、哥布林军队和游荡的人类土匪。",
	"Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already hold the respect of their fellow citizens.": "贵族们任命官员作为他们在村庄的代理人，负责监督税收，并在争端和刑事审判中担任法官。这些执法官、治安官或法警都是他们所管辖的村庄的平民，他们被选中担任这些职务是因为他们已经得到了同胞的尊重。",
	"Within towns and cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the middle class.": "在城镇中，领主与较小的贵族（通常是他们自己的亲属）分享权力和行政责任，也与中产阶级的代表，如商人和工匠分享。一位贵族出身的市长被任命为镇或市议会的领导，并履行与村长在村庄中履行的相同的行政职能。议会由中产阶级选出的代表组成。",
	"Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary authority of the nobility.": "只有愚蠢的贵族才会无视议会的意愿，因为中产阶级的经济实力对一个城镇的繁荣往往比贵族的世袭权力更重要。",
	"The larger a settlement, the more likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual—a wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or an individual with magical power.": "一个定居点越大，其他个人或组织就越有可能在那里拥有重要的权力。即使在一个村子里，一个受欢迎的人--一个聪明的长者或一个受人欢迎的农民--可以比指定的村长有更大的影响力，一个聪明的村长会避免与这样的人为敌。在城镇，同样的权力可能掌握在一个著名的寺庙、一个独立于议会的行会或一个拥有魔法力量的人手中。",
	"A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under its control.": "一个定居点很少单独存在。一个特定的城镇或城市可能是一个神权城邦或一个由商人委员会管理的繁荣的自由城市。更有可能的是，它是一个封建王国的一部分，一个官僚帝国，或者一个由铁腕暴君统治的偏远地区。考虑你的定居点如何融入你的世界或地区的大局--谁统治着它的统治者，还有哪些其他的定居点可能在它的控制之下。",

The coins of the old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs (electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still used in trade among elves.": "相反，久违的、传说中的土地和伟大的魔法中心的硬币则受到尊敬，尽管那些找到它们的人明智地将它们卖给收藏家，而不是仅仅在市场上消费。科曼瑟尔（Cormanthyr）古老的精灵宫廷的硬币特别有名：thalvers（铜）、bedoars（银）、thammarchs（电子）、shilmaers（金）和ruendils（白金）。这些钱币精美，数量众多，有时还用于精灵之间的贸易。",
	"Large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for.

This might make communication (and diplomacy) between two kingdoms significantly more difficult.": "在一些世界里，地区差异可能比种族差异更重要。也许生活在一个王国的所有矮人、精灵和人类都说一种共同的语言，而这种语言与邻近王国的语言完全不同。这可能会使两个王国之间的沟通（和外交）变得非常困难。",
	"Widely used languages might have ancient versions, or there might be completely different ancient tongues that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions and tomes that characters encounter.": "广泛使用的语言可能有古老的版本，或者冒险者在墓穴和废墟中发现的完全不同的古代语言。这种语言可以为角色遇到的铭文和古籍增加神秘的元素。",
	"You might invent additional secret languages, besides Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain organizations or political affiliations to communicate. You could even decide that each alignment has its own language, which might be more of an argot used primarily to discuss philosophical concepts.": "除了德鲁伊语和盗贼语之外，你还可以发明更多的秘密语言，让某些组织或政治派别的成员能够交流。你甚至可以决定每一种结盟都有自己的语言，这可能更像是一种主要用于讨论哲学概念的论调。",
	"In a region where one race has subjugated another, the language of the conquerors can become a mark of social status. Similarly, reading and writing might be restricted by law to the upper classes of a society.": "在一个种族征服了另一个种族的地区，征服者的语言可能成为社会地位的标志。同样，阅读和写作可能被法律限制在一个社会的上层阶级中。",
	"Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and colleges are important forces in the social order of any civilization. Their influence might stretch across multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can play an important part in the lives of player characters, becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like individual nonplayer characters. When characters join these organizations, they become part of something larger than themselves, which can give their adventures a context in the wider world.": "在任何文明的社会秩序中，寺庙、行会、教团、秘密社团和学院都是重要的力量。他们的影响力可能会延伸到多个城镇和城市，无论是否有类似的广泛的政治权力。组织可以在玩家角色的生活中发挥重要作用，成为他们的赞助人、盟友或敌人，就像个别非玩家角色一样。当角色加入这些组织时，他们就成了比自己更大的东西的一部分，这可以使他们的冒险在更广阔的世界中获得背景。",
	"At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game progresses, though, background ties often become less important.": "在活动开始时，背景是将冒险者与你的世界联系起来的一个好方法。不过，随着游戏的进展，背景联系往往变得不那么重要。",
	"Factions and organizations aimed at player characters are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected to your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, villainous organizations create an ongoing sense of menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes.": "以玩家角色为目标的派别和组织是让更高级别的冒险者与你的世界保持联系的一种方式，它提供了与关键NPC的联系和超越个人利益的明确议程。同样地，反派组织创造了一种持续的威胁感，超过了单独的敌人的威胁。",
	"Having different characters tied to different factions can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as long as those factions have similar goals and don't work in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have competing interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals.": "让不同的角色与不同的派别联系在一起，可以在游戏桌上创造出有趣的局面，只要这些派别有类似的目标，而不是一直在相互对立的情况下工作。代表不同派别的冒险者在追求相同目标的同时，可能会有相互竞争的利益或优先事项。",
	"Adventurer organizations are also a great source of special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. Increased standing in an organization has value in and of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits such as access to an organization's information, equipment, magic, and other resources.": "冒险者组织也是经验值和宝藏之外的特殊奖励的重要来源。在一个组织中地位的提高本身就有价值，而且还可能带来具体的好处，比如获得一个组织的信息、设备、魔法和其他资源。",
	"Factions and organizations that you create for your campaign should grow out of the stories that are important to the world. Create organizations that your players will want to interact with, whether as allies, members, or enemies.": "你为你的活动创建的派别和组织应该从对这个世界很重要的故事中发展出来。创建玩家愿意与之互动的组织，无论是作为盟友、成员还是敌人。",
	"As a starting point, decide what role you want an organization to play in the world. What is it all about? What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do its members do? Answering these questions should give you a good sense of the organization's personality. From there, think about typical members. How might people describe them? What are the typical members' classes and alignments? What personality traits do they tend to share?": "作为一个起点，决定你希望一个组织在世界上扮演什么角色。它的目的是什么？它的目标是什么？谁创立了它，为什么？其成员是做什么的？回答了这些问题，你就能很好地了解该组织的个性。从那里，想想典型的成员。人们会如何描述他们？典型成员的阶级和联盟是什么？他们有哪些共同的个性特征？",
	"Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization is a way of summing up the work you've done so far. A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a very different personality from one that uses a winged viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as you've defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: \"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.\" The Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a group of politically allied cities in the North calling themselves the Lords' Alliance: \"Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our security.\" These are sophisticated people involved in a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on stability than on fairness and equality.": "为组织选择一个标志和座右铭是对你到目前为止所做工作的一种总结。一个使用雄鹿作为标志的派别可能与使用带翅膀的毒蛇的派别有着非常不同的个性。对于座右铭，不仅要选择一个信息，还要选择适合你所定义的组织的语气和风格。考虑一下哈珀斯的座右铭。\"打倒暴政。公平和平等属于所有人\"。哈珀人有一个关于自由和繁荣的直截了当的信息。与之相对应的是北方一群自称 \"领主联盟 \"的政治联盟城市的箴言。\"必须无偏见地终止对家园的威胁。优势是我们的安全。\" 这些是参与微妙的政治联盟的成熟人士，他们更强调稳定而不是公平和平等。",
	"Finally, think about the ways that player characters might come into contact with the organization. Who are the important members-not just the leaders, but the agents in the field that the adventurers might encounter? Where are they active, and where do they have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What rewards can they gain?": "最后，考虑一下玩家角色可能与该组织接触的方式。谁是重要的成员--不仅仅是领导人，还有冒险者可能遇到的实地代理人？他们在哪里活动，他们在哪里有总部或据点？如果冒险者真的加入，他们可能被派去执行什么样的任务？他们能获得什么奖励？",
	"The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or otherwise.": "哈珀斯是一个分散的施法者和间谍网络，他们倡导平等，暗中反对滥用权力，无论是魔法还是其他方面。",
	"The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, although they interact and share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don't seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.": "该组织已经崛起，被打碎，又重新崛起了好几次。它的寿命和复原力主要归功于其分散的、草根的、秘密的性质，以及其不同成员的自主性。哈珀斯在整个被遗忘的领域都有小型的细胞和孤独的特工，尽管他们不时地根据需要相互交流和分享信息。哈珀人的意识形态是高尚的，其成员以他们的聪明才智和廉洁自律为荣。哈珀人不追求权力或荣耀，只追求所有人的公平和平等待遇。",
	"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.": "打倒暴政。公平和平等，人人有份。",
	"The Harpers' beliefs can be summarized as follows:": "哈珀人的信念可以概括为以下几点。",
	"One can never have too much information or arcane knowledge.": "一个人永远不可能有太多的信息或神秘的知识。",
	"Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of magic in particular must be closely monitored.": "太多的权力会导致腐败，尤其是对魔法的滥用必须受到密切监控。",
	"No one should be powerless.": "没有人应该是无能为力的。",
	"Gather information throughout Faerun, discern the political dynamics within each region, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.": "在整个Faerun收集信息，了解每个地区的政治动态，并通过秘密手段促进公平和平等。作为最后的手段，公开行动。挫败暴君和任何变得过于强大的领袖、政府或团体。援助弱者、穷人和被压迫者。",
	"Typical Harper quests include securing an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a region, gathering information on a powerful individual or organization, and determining the true intentions of an ambitious political figure or evil spellcaster.": "典型的哈珀任务包括确保一件会破坏一个地区权力平衡的文物，收集关于一个强大的个人或组织的信息，以及确定一个野心勃勃的政治人物或邪恶施法者的真实意图。",
	"The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and making everyone dependent on it.": "真塔林（Zhentarim）（又称黑网）是一个不择手段的影子网络，它试图在整个被遗忘的王国中扩大其影响力和权力。黑网的公众形象看起来相对温和。它提供最好和最便宜的商品和服务，包括合法的和非法的，从而摧毁了它的竞争对手，使每个人都依赖它。",
	"A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black Network for resources and security. However, members are granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises \"the best of the best,\" although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its individual members.": "镇塔林的成员认为自己是一个非常大的家族的成员，并依靠黑色网络获得资源和安全。然而，成员被授予自主权，可以追求自己的利益，并获得一定程度的个人财富和影响力。作为一个整体，Zhentarim承诺 \"最好中的最好\"，尽管事实上该组织对传播自己的宣传和影响更感兴趣，而不是投资于其个人成员的改善。",
	"Join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer.": "加入我们的行列，就会繁荣。反对我们就会受苦。",
	"The Zhentarim's beliefs can be summarized as follows:": "镇塔林的信仰可以概括为以下几点。",

	"You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than what you deserve to be.": "你是你自己命运的主人。永远不要低于你应得的地位。",
	"Everything and everyone has a price.": "每件事和每个人都有一个价格。",
	"Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby dominate Faerun.": "积累财富、权力和影响力，从而主宰法伦。",

	"Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer's standing within a particular faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.": "声望是一个可选的规则，你可以用来追踪一个冒险者在特定派别或组织中的地位。声望是一个数值，从0开始，然后随着人物在特定组织中获得的好感和声誉而增加。你可以把好处与角色的声望联系起来，包括组织内的等级和头衔，以及获得资源的机会。",
	"A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.": "玩家为他或她的角色所加入的每个组织分别追踪名声。例如，一个冒险家可能在一个派别中拥有5个声望，在另一个派别中拥有20个声望，这是基于角色在活动过程中与每个组织的互动。",
	"A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.": "角色通过完成为组织利益服务或直接涉及该组织的任务或使命来获得声望。当角色完成这些任务或使命时，你会酌情授予名望，通常是在你授予经验值的同时。",
	"Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.": "完成该组织特别指定的任务，或直接有利于该组织的任务，角色的声望反而会增加2。",
	"For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.": "例如，与高贵的高塔骑士团有联系的角色完成了一个任务，他们把一个城镇从蓝龙的暴政中解放出来。相反，如果杀龙是骑士团的高级成员交给冒险者的任务，完成这个任务反而会使每个角色的声望增加2，表明冒险者是有效的盟友。",
	"Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.": "同时，队伍中的流氓可能从龙的囤积物中掠夺了一箱稀有的毒药，并把它卖给了一个暗地里是Zhentarim特工的围栏。你可能会让这个流氓在Zhentarim内部的声望增加2，因为这个行动直接增加了该组织的权力和财富，尽管这个任务不是由Zhentarim的代理人指派的。",
	"The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.": "在一个组织内提高声望的好处可能包括等级和权威，组织成员的友好态度，以及其他津贴。",
	"Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.": "角色可以随着他们的声望增加而获得晋升。你可以建立一定的声望门槛，作为提升等级的先决条件（虽然不一定是唯一的先决条件），如派别等级表中所示。例如，一个角色可能在加入领主联盟后，在该组织中获得了1个声望，获得了斗篷的称号。随着人物在该组织中的声望增加，他或她可能有资格进一步提高等级。",
	"You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.": "你可以增加等级的先决条件。例如，一个隶属于领主联盟的角色可能至少要达到5级才能成为刺刀手，至少要达到10级才能成为战神，至少要达到15级才能成为狮王。",
	"You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.": "你可以将这些声望的阈值设置为任何适合你的游戏的数字，为你的活动中的组织创造适当的等级和称号。",

	"As a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character's renown—or perhaps because of it.": "随着一个角色在一个组织中的声望的增长，该组织的成员越来越有可能听说过这个角色。你可以设置阈值，在这个阈值上，一个组织的成员对这个角色的默认态度变得冷漠或友好。例如，翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）--一个致力于保护自然秩序的派别--的成员可能对那些在该组织中没有培养出至少3个声望的角色不太友好，只有当一个角色在翡翠飞地中获得10个声望时才会默认为友好。这些阈值只适用于一个组织的大多数成员的默认态度，而且这种态度不是自动的。NPC派系的成员可能会不喜欢一个冒险者，尽管这个角色有声望，或者也许是因为这个声望。",
	"Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, \"Creating Nonplayer Characters\"), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.": "在一个组织中获得一个等级会带来某些好处，由你来定义。一个低等级的角色可能会获得一个可靠的联系人和冒险线索，一个安全屋，或者一个愿意为冒险装备提供折扣的商人。一个中级角色可能会获得一个追随者（见第4章，\"创建非玩家角色\"），获得药水和卷轴，有能力叫人帮忙，或在危险的任务中得到支援。一个高等级的角色可能能够召集一支小型军队，保管一个稀有的魔法物品，获得一个有用的施法者，或者给低等级的成员分配特殊任务。",
	"You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, \"Between Adventures.\"": "你可以让角色在冒险之间的停顿时间里建立关系，并在组织中获得声誉。有关停工期活动的更多信息，请参见第6章 \"冒险之间\"。",
	"Disagreements with members of an organization aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character's renown within an organization can never drop below 0.": "与一个组织的成员发生分歧并不足以导致在该组织内失去声望。然而，对组织或其成员犯下的严重罪行会导致在该组织内丧失声望和等级。损失的程度取决于违规行为，由你来决定。一个角色在一个组织中的声望永远不能低于0。",
	"With a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in the world.": "只要稍加改动，名望系统也可以作为衡量一个角色与诸神联系的标准。对于诸神在世界中发挥积极作用的活动，这是一个很好的选择。",
	"Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.": "使用这种方法，你根据你的战役中的特定神性人物来追踪名声。每个角色都可以选择一个具有目标、教义和禁忌的守护神或万神殿。他或她所获得的任何荣誉都被称为虔诚度。一个角色如果尊敬他或她的神，履行他们的命令，并尊重他们的禁忌，就会获得虔诚度。一个角色如果与这些神灵作对，侮辱他们，玷污他们的庙宇，并破坏他们的目标，就会失去虔诚。",
	"The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of thunder.": "诸神赐予那些证明自己虔诚的人以恩惠。每获得一个等级的虔诚，角色就可以每天祈求一次神的恩惠。这种恩惠通常以牧师法术的形式出现，如祝福。这种恩惠通常伴随着神的恩惠者的标志；例如，献给雷神的角色可能会收到一个伴随着雷声的咒语。",
	"A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" for such supernatural gifts).": "高水平的虔诚也可以使角色获得更持久的利益，以祝福或符咒的形式（关于这种超自然的礼物，见第七章，\"宝藏\"）。",
	"In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of those who wield it.": "在大多数D&D世界中，魔法是自然的，但仍然是神奇的，有时是可怕的。各地的人们都知道魔法，而且大多数人在他们生活的某个阶段都看到了魔法的证据。它渗透到宇宙中，并通过传奇英雄的古老财产、堕落帝国的神秘废墟、被神灵触动的人、天生具有超自然力量的生物以及研究多元宇宙秘密的个人而移动。历史和炉边故事中充满了那些挥舞它的人的功绩。",
	"What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether they know characters who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic used for generations and speak in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the order's members can profit from selling their services.": "普通人对魔法的了解取决于他们居住的地方以及他们是否认识练习魔法的人物。一个与世隔绝的小村庄的居民可能几代人都没有见过真正的魔法，他们会低声谈论住在附近树林里的老隐士的奇怪力量。在《被遗忘的领域》中的水底城，法师和保护者的守望团是一个巫师公会。这些奥术师希望使巫术更容易获得，因此该组织的成员可以通过出售他们的服务而获利。",
	"Some D&D settings have more magic in them than others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic.": "有些D&D环境中的魔法比其他的多。在阿塔斯，黑暗太阳背景下的严酷世界，奥术是一种令人讨厌的做法，会耗尽世界的生命。Athas的大部分魔法都掌握在邪恶者手中。相反，在Eberron的世界里，魔法就像其他商品一样普遍。商行向任何有能力的人出售魔法物品和服务。人们买票乘坐由元素魔法推动的飞艇和火车。",
	"Consider these questions when fitting magic into your world:": "在将魔法融入你的世界时，请考虑这些问题。",
	"Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magic is rare?": "有些魔术是常见的吗？有些是社会不能接受的？哪些魔法是罕见的？",
	"How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are those who can cast high-level spells?": "每个法术类别的成员有多不寻常？能够施展高级法术的人有多普遍？",
	"How rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from everyday to exotic?": "魔法物品、魔法地点和具有超自然力量的生物有多稀有？这些东西在多大程度上会从日常用品变成异国情调？",
	"How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use magic and protect themselves from it?": "当局是如何监管和使用魔法的？普通人如何使用魔法并保护自己免受其害？",
	"The answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For example, if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and use the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky situations.": "一些问题的答案暗示了其他问题的答案。例如，如果低级法术的施法者很常见，就像在Eberron那样，那么当局和普通人就更有可能获得并使用这种法术的结果。购买普通的魔法不仅是可能的，而且价格也较低。人们更有可能牢记知名的魔法，并对其进行保护，尤其是在危险的情况下。",
	"Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects are rare, with protections against magic being the exception.": "一些文明地区可能限制或禁止使用魔法。没有许可证或官方许可，施法可能是被禁止的。在这样的地方，魔法物品和持续的魔法效果都很罕见，对魔法的保护是个例外。",
	"Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact a law restricting that type of magic.": "有些地方可能禁止特定的法术。施放任何用于偷窃或诈骗的法术都可能是一种犯罪，比如那些赋予隐形或产生幻觉的法术。魅惑或支配他人的法术很容易被取缔，因为它们剥夺了主体的自由意志。由于明显的原因，破坏性的法术也同样被禁止。一个地方的统治者可能对某种特定的效果或咒语有恐惧症（比如变形效果，如果他或她害怕被人冒充），并制定法律限制这种类型的魔法。",
	"The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's up to you to determine what those schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the existence of magic-using organizations in the world—bardic colleges and druid circles-which are up to you to flesh out.": "游戏规则中提到了魔法流派（咒语、幻术、死灵等等），但这些流派在你的世界中意味着什么，则由你来决定。同样地，一些等级选项表明世界上存在使用魔法的组织--吟游诗人学院和德鲁伊圈子--这些都是由你来充实的。",
	"You could decide that no formal structures like these exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player character learns from a single mentor and never meets another character of the same class, in which case wizards would learn their school specialization without any formal training.": "你可以决定在你的世界中不存在这样的正式结构。巫师（以及吟游诗人和德鲁伊）可能非常罕见，以至于玩家角色只向一个导师学习，而从未遇到过其他同等级的角色，在这种情况下，巫师会在没有任何正式训练的情况下学习他们的学校专业。",
	"However, if magic is more common, academies can be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome reputation.": "然而，如果魔法比较普遍，学院可以成为魔法学校的体现。这些机构有自己的等级制度、传统、法规和程序。例如，死灵法师马特罗斯（Materros）可能是塔尔扎德（Thar-Zad）死灵法师公会的兄弟。作为他在其等级制度中的崇高地位的标志，他被允许穿上大师的红色和绿色长袍。当然，当他穿上这些袍子时，他的职业很容易被那些知道阴谋论的人识别出来。这种识别可能是一种好处，也可能是一种麻烦，因为塔尔扎德的Cabal有一个可怕的声誉。",
	"If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player character necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of Mac-Fuirmidh.": "如果你走这条路，你可以把魔法学校、吟游诗人学院和德鲁伊圈子当作组织，使用本章前面介绍的组织准则。一个玩家角色的死灵法师可能会在塔尔扎德的卡巴尔中培养声望，而一个吟游诗人则在麦克-弗尔米德学院中寻求增加声望。",
	"The presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry into a city, they're guarded by military and magical protection.": "主要城市中永久性传送圈的存在有助于巩固其在奇幻世界经济中的重要地位。诸如平面转移、传送和传送圈等法术都与这些传送圈有关，这些传送圈存在于寺庙、学院、奥术组织的总部和重要的市政地点。然而，由于每个传送圈都是进入城市的可能途径，所以它们受到军事和魔法的保护。",
	"As you design a fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles it might contain and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers commonly return to their home base by means of a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for plot developments in your campaign. What do the adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an argument between two feuding priests at the temple? Adventure ensues!": "当你设计一个奇幻城市时，考虑一下它可能包含的传送圈，以及冒险者可能知道的传送圈。如果冒险者通常通过一个传送圈回到他们的基地，那么就用这个传送圈作为你的活动中情节发展的一个钩子。如果冒险家们到达一个传送圈，发现所有熟悉的守卫都失效了，守卫躺在血泊中，他们会怎么做？如果他们的到来打断了神庙里两个不和的祭司之间的争执，又该怎么办？冒险接踵而至!",
	"When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that plane and returning it to its body.": "当一个生物死亡时，它的灵魂会离开它的身体，离开物质界，穿越星界，并去居住在该生物的神灵所在的位面。如果该生物没有崇拜某个神灵，它的灵魂就会离开到与它的排列组合相对应的平面。让人起死回生意味着从那个位面取回灵魂并将其送回身体。",
	"Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using raise dead or resurrection to restore the slain character to life.": "敌人可以采取措施，使角色更难起死回生。保留尸体可以防止他人使用起死回生或复活术来恢复被杀角色的生命。",
	"A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him and then capturing him once he is alive again.": "如果一个灵魂不希望被复活，它就不能被复活。灵魂知道试图让它复活的角色的名字、排列方式和守护神（如果有的话），并可能以此为由拒绝返回。例如，如果光荣的骑士Sturm Brightblade被杀，Takhisis（恶龙之神）的女祭司抓住了他的身体，Sturm可能不希望被她从死亡中复活。她想让他复活的任何尝试都会自动失败。如果邪恶教士想让斯图姆复活来审问他，她需要找到一些方法来欺骗他的灵魂，比如欺骗一个好教士让他复活，然后在他再次活着的时候抓住他。",
	"The world you create is the stage for the adventures you set in it. You don't have to give more thought to it than that. You can run adventures in an episodic format, with the characters as the only common element, and also weave themes throughout those adventures to build a greater saga of the characters' achievements in the world.": "你创造的世界是你在其中设置的冒险的舞台。你不需要考虑得更多。你可以以剧情的形式进行冒险，把人物作为唯一的共同元素，也可以把主题贯穿于这些冒险中，为人物在这个世界上的成就建立一个更大的传奇。",
	"Planning an entire campaign might seem like a daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every detail right from the start. You can start with the basics, running a few adventures, and think about larger plot lines you want to explore as the campaign progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail as you wish.": "规划整个活动似乎是一项艰巨的任务，但你不必从一开始就规划出每个细节。你可以从最基本的开始，进行一些冒险，并考虑随着活动的进行，你想探索的更大的情节线。你可以根据自己的意愿自由地增加或减少细节。",
	"The start of a campaign resembles the start of an adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, show the players that adventure awaits, and grab their attention right away. Give the players enough information to make them want to come back week after week to see how the story plays out.": "活动的开始类似于冒险的开始。你要迅速进入行动，让玩家看到冒险在等着他们，并立即抓住他们的注意力。给予玩家足够的信息，使他们愿意周而复始地回来看故事的发展。",
	"When you first start building your campaign, start small. The characters need to know only about the city, town, or village where they start the game, and perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant spiders, and you should note these things. But at the start of the game, the local area is enough to get the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to create that local area:": "当你第一次开始建立你的活动时，从小处着手。角色们只需要知道他们开始游戏的城市、城镇或村庄，也许还有附近的地牢。你可能会决定男爵与附近的公国开战，或者远处的森林里爬满了伊特帽和巨型蜘蛛，你应该注意这些事情。但在游戏开始时，当地的区域就足以让战役开始了。按照这些步骤来创建这个本地区域。",
	"See the \"Settlements\" section earlier in this chapter for guidance on building this settlement. A small town or village at the edge of the wilderness serves as a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use a larger town or city if you want a campaign with urban adventuring.": "请参阅本章前面的 \"定居点 \"一节，以获得关于建立这种定居点的指导。在大多数D&D活动中，位于荒野边缘的小城镇或村庄是一个很好的大本营。如果你想在活动中进行城市冒险，就使用一个较大的城镇或城市。",
	"See \"Mapping the Campaign\" earlier in this chapter for guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1 hex = 1 mile) with the home base near the center. Fill in the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 miles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to four dungeons or similar adventure locales. An area that size is likely to have one to three additional settlements as well as the home base, so give thought to them as well.": "请参阅本章前面的 \"绘制战役地图 \"以获得指导。以省为单位绘制地图（1六角=1英里），大本营靠近中心。在大本营的一天行程内--大约25至30英里--填上该地区。用两到四个地牢或类似的冒险地点来填满它。这么大的一个区域，除了大本营之外，可能还有一到三个额外的定居点，所以也要考虑到它们。",
	"A single dungeon makes a good first adventure for most campaigns. See chapter 3, \"Creating Adventures,\" for guidance.": "对于大多数战役来说，单一的地牢是一个很好的第一次冒险。请参阅第3章，\"创建冒险\"，以获得指导。",
	"A home base provides a common starting location for the characters. This starting point might be the village where they grew up or a city that attracted them from points beyond. Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing them into the midst of the adventure.": "大本营为人物提供了一个共同的起始地点。这个起点可能是他们长大的村庄，或者是一个吸引他们的城市。或者他们在邪恶的男爵城堡的地牢里开始活动，在那里他们因为各种原因（合法的或其他的）被关起来，把他们扔到冒险的中间。",
	"For each of these steps, give the locations only as much detail as they need. You don't need to identify every building in a village or label every street in a large city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon, you'll need the details of this first adventure site, but you don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and consider whom the characters are most likely to interact with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize how this area fits into the theme and story you have in mind for your campaign. Then start working on your first adventure!": "对于这些步骤中的每一步，只需提供他们需要的细节。你不需要确定一个村庄的每一栋建筑，也不需要给大城市的每一条街道贴上标签。如果人物从男爵的地牢开始，你就需要这第一个冒险地点的细节，但你不必说出所有男爵的骑士。画出一张简单的地图，考虑一下周围的区域，并考虑人物在活动初期最可能与谁互动。最重要的是，想象一下这个地区如何与你心目中的活动主题和故事相适应。然后开始着手准备你的第一次冒险",
	"As you start to develop your campaign, you'll need to fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, compile essential information into a campaign handout. Such a handout typically includes the following material:": "当你开始发展你的活动时，你需要让玩家们了解基本情况。为了便于分发，将基本信息汇编成活动手册。这种讲义通常包括以下材料。",
	"Any restrictions or new options for character creation, such as new or prohibited races.": "创建角色的任何限制或新选项，如新的或禁止的种族。",
	"Any information in the backstory of your campaign that the characters would know about. If you have a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this information could include seeds hinting at that focus.": "在你的活动的背景故事中，人物会知道的任何信息。如果你对运动有一个主题或方向的想法，这些信息可以包括暗示这一重点的种子。",
	"Basic information about the area where the characters are starting, such as the name of the town, important locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble that's brewing.": "关于人物开始工作的地区的基本信息，例如城镇的名称、城镇内和周围的重要地点、他们所知道的著名NPC，也许还有指向正在酝酿的麻烦的传言。",
	"Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of creative energy that produces twenty pages of great background material, save it for your adventures. Let the players uncover the details gradually in play.": "这个讲义要简短而有针对性。两页是一个合理的上限。即使你的创意能量迸发，产生了20页的伟大背景材料，也要把它留给你的冒险。让玩家在游戏中逐渐发现这些细节。",
	"Once you've identified what your campaign is about, let the players help tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is their opportunity to tie their characters' history and background to the campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of each character's background tie into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has the hermit character learned? What is the status of the noble character's family? What is the folk hero's destiny?": "一旦你确定了你的活动是关于什么的，就让玩家通过决定他们的角色如何参与来帮助讲述这个故事。这是他们将自己角色的历史和背景与活动联系起来的机会，也是你确定每个角色的背景的各种元素如何与活动的故事联系起来的机会。例如，隐士角色学到了什么秘密？贵族角色的家庭地位如何？民间英雄的命运是什么？",
	"Some players might have trouble coming up with ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about their characters:": "有些玩家可能很难想出主意--不是每个人都有同样的创造力。你可以用几个关于他们角色的问题来帮助刺激他们的创造力。",
	"Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who's your family? What's your current occupation?": "你是土生土长的本地人吗？如果是的话，你的家人是谁？你目前的职业是什么？",
	"Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to this area?": "你是最近才来的吗？你从哪里来？你为什么来到这个地区？",
	"Are you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are they friends or enemies?": "你是否与任何参与启动活动的组织或人员有联系？他们是朋友还是敌人？",
	"Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into that story.": "听取玩家的想法，如果可以的话，就答应他们。即使你想让所有的角色都在起始镇上长大，如果玩家的故事有足够的说服力，也可以考虑允许一个新来的或移植的角色。建议改变一个角色的故事，使其更适合你的世界，或者将你的活动的第一条线编入该故事。",
	"Backgrounds are designed to root player characters in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great way to introduce players to the special features of your world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, organizations, and historical events from your campaign are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant priest background (or modify the acolyte background) to reflect these qualities. It could include musical instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves receiving hospitality from the faithful.": "背景的设计是为了让玩家角色扎根于这个世界，而创造新的背景是向玩家介绍你的世界特色的一个好方法。与特定的文化、组织和历史事件有联系的背景是非常重要的。也许某个宗教的牧师在虔诚的民众的支持下以乞丐的身份生活，唱着他们神灵的故事来娱乐和启迪信徒。你可以创建一个修行者牧师背景（或修改圣徒背景）来反映这些品质。它可以包括对乐器的精通，其特点可能涉及接受信徒的款待。",
	"Guidelines for creating a new background are provided in chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop.\"": "第9章 \"地下城主工作室 \"中提供了创建新背景的指南。",
	"Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the chapters of history.": "奇幻世界历史上的重大事件往往是巨大的动荡：让正义力量与邪恶力量进行史诗般的对抗的战争，让整个文明遭到破坏的自然灾害，庞大军队或额外星球群的入侵，对世界领导人的暗杀。这些震撼世界的事件为历史的篇章命名。",
	"In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, middle, and end is inertia. Like many television shows and comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those other mediums, so can players-the actors and writers of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story meanders too long without a change in tone, when the same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and predictable, and when the world doesn't change around the characters and in response to their actions.": "在D&D游戏中，这类事件提供了可以点燃和维持活动的火花。没有固定的开头、中间和结尾的连载故事最常见的陷阱是惯性。就像许多电视节目和漫画书系列一样，D&D活动有可能在乐趣消失很久之后重蹈覆辙。就像演员或编剧在其他媒介中渐行渐远一样，玩家--D&D游戏的演员和编剧也会如此。当故事蜿蜒过久而没有语气变化时，当相同的反派和类似的冒险变得令人厌烦和可预测时，当世界没有围绕人物和对他们的行为作出反应而变化时，游戏就会停滞不前。",
	"World-shaking events force conflict. They set new events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes change the world by altering the tone of the setting in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your world in big, bold print. Change-especially change that occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions of the characters lack significance. When the world becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up.": "震惊世界的事件迫使人们发生冲突。它们使新的事件和权力集团开始运作。它们的结果以一种有意义的方式改变了环境的基调，从而改变了世界。它们用大而粗的字体记录了你的世界的故事。变化--特别是由于人物的行动而发生的变化--使故事不断发展。如果变化是不可察觉的，人物的行动就缺乏意义。当世界变得可靠时，是时候让事情发生变化了。",
	"World-shaking events can happen at any time in a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end of a story.": "震撼世界的事件可以发生在战役或故事弧的任何时候，但最大的事件自然是发生在故事的开头、中间和结尾。",
	"That placement reflects the structure of dramatic stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into action. The characters take action to resolve their problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by the way the characters changed it for good or ill.": "这一安排反映了戏剧性故事的结构。在一个故事的开头，发生了一些事情，动摇了主人公的世界，刺激他们采取行动。人物采取行动解决他们的问题，但其他力量反对他们。当他们朝着自己的目标达到一个重要的里程碑时，一场重大冲突打乱了人物的计划，再次动摇了他们的世界；失败似乎迫在眉睫。在故事的结尾，他们或成功或失败，世界因人物改变世界的方式而再次动摇，无论好坏。",
	"At the beginning of a D&D campaign, world-shaking events create instant adventure hooks and affect the characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse-rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the characters' actions.": "在D&D战役的开始阶段，震撼世界的事件创造了即时的冒险钩子，并直接影响到人物的生活。在中期，当人物的命运发生逆转时，它们会成为伟大的转折点--失败后上升或胜利后下降。在战役接近尾声时，这些事件会成为具有深远影响的出色的高潮情节。它们甚至可以在故事结束后发生，作为人物行动的结果。",
	"In constructing a narrative, beware of \"false action,\" or action for its own sake. False action doesn't move a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but do little more than inconvenience the characters and eventually bore the audience with their repetition and dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters together one after another with little impact on the characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events become ordinary.": "在构建叙事时，要注意 \"虚假的行动\"，或为了行动而行动。虚假的行动不能推动故事的发展，不能吸引人物，也不能使他们改变。许多动作片都有假动作的问题，其中追车、枪战和爆炸比比皆是，但除了给角色带来不便外，最终会因为重复和缺乏有意义的赌注而使观众感到厌烦。一些D&D活动也落入了同样的陷阱，把跨越世界的灾难一个接一个地串起来，但对人物和世界的影响却很小。因此，每当行动暂停时，重新安排世界秩序可能不符合DM的最佳利益，以免震惊世界的事件变得平凡。",
	"As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the beginning, one near the middle, and one near the end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every significant event shakes someone's world, after all, no matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected and terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller territories, but unless your story demands it, save the large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most important moments of your campaign.": "一般来说，一场战役最多可以维持三个大规模的、震惊世界的事件：一个在开始，一个在中间，一个在结束。如果你愿意的话，可以使用尽可能多的小规模事件来扰乱城镇、村庄、部落、封地、公国、省等有界的微观世界。毕竟，每个重大事件都会撼动某人的世界，无论这个世界有多小。让出乎意料的可怕事件经常困扰着世界上较小的领土，但除非你的故事需要它，否则请将大规模的跨越地图的事件留给你的活动中最大、最重要的时刻。",
	"You can use this section for ideas and inspiration to expand on world-shaking events already occurring (or soon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can roll on the tables below to randomly generate an event to inspire your imagination.

	"Earthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood-disasters on a grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago Fire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time the disaster leaves only ruins-buried under ash like Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis.": "地震、饥荒、火灾、瘟疫、洪水--这些大规模的灾难可以毫无征兆地消灭整个文明。自然（或魔法）灾难会重新绘制地图，破坏经济，改变世界。有时，幸存者会在废墟上重建。例如，芝加哥大火提供了一个按照现代计划重建城市的机会。大多数时候，灾难只留下废墟--像庞贝那样埋在灰烬之下，或者像亚特兰蒂斯那样沉入海浪之下。",

	"With two exceptions, the disasters on the table resemble those that affect our own world. Think of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear incidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron campaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile wasteland and ending the Last War.": "除了两个例外，桌子上的灾难与影响我们自己世界的灾难相似。把平面扭曲和魔法出错想象成核事故；它们是不自然地改变土地和人民的大事件。例如，在Eberron战役设定中，一场魔法灾难将整个国家夷为平地，将其变成一片充满敌意的荒地，并结束了最后的战争。",
	"Divine judgment is something else entirely. This disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure.": "神圣的审判则完全是另一回事。这种灾难采取任何你想要的形式，但它总是一个巨大的、大胆的、不含糊的神灵不悦的标志。",
	"You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew.": "你可能决定将一个城镇、地区或国家从你的世界地图上抹去。一场灾难蹂躏了这片土地，有效地消除了角色们曾经熟悉的地方。",

On the other hand, an assault might be the first step of an invasion.": "入侵是最常见的震惊世界的事件之一，当一个团体强行接管另一个团体时，通常是通过军事力量，但也可以通过渗透和占领。攻击与入侵的不同之处在于，攻击部队不一定对占领或夺取政权感兴趣。另一方面，袭击可能是入侵的第一步。",
	"Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or invasion stands out because its repercussions change the characters' world, and its effects echo long after the initial attack or takeover.": "无论规模大小，震撼世界的攻击或入侵都会脱颖而出，因为它的反响改变了人物的世界，其影响在最初的攻击或接管后还会长期存在。",

	"The scale of a revolution need not involve the common masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small as a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods.": "革命的规模不需要涉及普通群众反对贵族。一场革命可以小到一个商人公会反抗其领导层，或者一个寺庙推翻其神职人员以支持一个新的信条。森林之灵可能会试图推翻附近城市的文明力量，这些文明力量砍伐树木作为木材。另外，其规模可以是戏剧性的，如人类起来推翻诸神。",

If the old order remains in power, describe one way that its leaders punish the revolutionaries.": "说明旧秩序下台后所付出的代价。在下一个政权中，前权力集团中是否有人继续掌权？如果旧秩序继续执政，请描述其领导人惩罚革命者的一种方式。",

If they discover a new mineral with magical properties, map a new land that's eminently suitable for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with the power to wreak devastation on your world, they are likely to set major events in motion. This gives the players the opportunity to see exactly how much influence their actions have on your world.": "当你的活动中的冒险者是发现者的时候，一个发现就特别令人印象深刻。如果他们发现了一种具有神奇特性的新矿物，绘制了一块非常适合殖民的新土地，或者发现了一种具有对你的世界造成破坏的古老武器，他们就有可能启动重大事件。这让玩家有机会看到他们的行为对你的世界到底有多大的影响。",

Other holy days are important only to people particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are observed by priests, who perform private rites and sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by the faithful of a specific temple.": "某些圣日是公民活动，在有神庙的城镇中，每个公民都会遵守。收获节通常是大规模的庆祝活动。其他圣日只对那些对某一神灵特别虔诚的人很重要。还有一些圣日是由祭司纪念的，他们在特定的日子或一天中的特定时间在他们的寺庙里进行私人仪式和祭祀。还有一些圣日是地方性的，由某一特定寺庙的信众来纪念。",
	"Give some thought to how priests and common folk celebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a pew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship foreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or burn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens bring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and demonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a god's bounty.": "对牧师和普通人如何庆祝圣日进行一些思考。进入寺庙，坐在座椅上，听着布道，是大多数幻想中的宗教所不具备的崇拜模式。更常见的是，庆祝者向他们的神灵献上祭品。信徒们把动物带到寺庙里宰杀，或烧香作为祭品。最富有的公民会带来最大的动物，以炫耀他们的财富并证明他们的虔诚。人们在祖先的坟墓前倾倒酒水。他们在黑暗的神殿中通宵守夜，或享受庆祝神灵恩赐的华丽盛宴。",
	"Holy days provide the majority of the special celebrations in most calendars, but local or national festivals account for many others. The birthday of a monarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, craft festivals, market days, and similar events all provide excuses for local celebrations.": "在大多数日历中，圣日提供了大部分特殊的庆祝活动，但地方或国家节日则占了许多其他节日。君主的生日、战争的伟大胜利纪念日、手工艺节、集市日以及类似的活动都为地方庆祝活动提供了借口。",
	"Since your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane medieval society, add in a few events of an obviously magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every year, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a long-forgotten nomadic tribe.": "由于你的设定是一个幻想世界，而不是一个平凡的中世纪社会，所以要加入一些明显具有魔法性质的事件。例如，也许在每年的冬至日，某座山上会出现一座幽灵般的城堡，或者每三个满月都会让狼人充满特别强烈的嗜血欲望。另外，每个月的第十三夜可能标志着一个早已被遗忘的游牧部落的幽灵般的游荡。",
	"Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and you can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a particular effect.": "非同寻常的事件，如彗星的接近或月食，都是很好的冒险元素，你可以把它们放在你的日历上，只要你想。你的日历可以告诉你什么时候有月圆的月食，但你总是可以为了特定的效果而伪造日期。",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of Harptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented it. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of thirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months and mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, is inserted into the calendar after Midsummer every four years, much like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar.": "被遗忘的世界使用哈普托斯日历，以发明该日历的已故巫师的名字命名。每年365天分为12个月，每个月30天，与现实世界的公历中的月份大致对应。每个月又分为三个工作日。在各月之间有五个特殊节日，标志着季节的变化。另一个特殊的节日，Shieldmeet，每四年在仲夏节后插入日历中，很像现代公历的闰年。",

	"A campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of its beginning and middle, but you don't have to take a campaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. Wrap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its natural conclusion. Make sure you allow space and time near the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal goals. Their own stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters' individual goals will be fulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the very end.": "一场战役的结局应该把开头和中间的所有线索串联起来，但你不必把一场战役一直进行到第20关才算满意。只要你的故事达到了自然的结论，就可以结束这个活动。确保你在战役结束前留出空间和时间，让角色完成任何个人目标。他们自己的故事需要以一种令人满意的方式结束，就像竞选故事一样。理想情况下，一些角色的个人目标将通过最后的冒险的最终目标得到实现。给有未完成目标的角色一个机会，让他们在最后之前完成这些目标。",
	"Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players, using their previous characters' actions as the basis of legends gives them immediate investment in the new setting. Let the new characters experience how the world has changed because of their old characters. In the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists. They shouldn't have to share the spotlight with the heroes of days gone by.": "一旦活动结束，新的活动就可以开始了。如果你打算为同一批玩家开展新的战役，用他们以前的角色的行为作为传说的基础，让他们立即投入到新的环境中。让新角色体验一下这个世界是如何因为他们的旧角色而改变的。不过，归根结底，新的活动是一个新的故事，有新的主角。他们不应该与过去的英雄们分享聚光灯。",
	"By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) and creating the key events that launch your campaign, you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you have to decide how you want to run your campaign.": "通过建立一个新的世界（或采用一个现有的世界）和创建启动你的运动的关键事件，你确定了你的运动是关于什么。接下来，你必须决定你要如何开展你的活动。",
	"What's the right way to run a campaign? That depends on your play style and the motivations of your players. Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of game you want to run. Describe to the players how you envision the game experience and let them give you input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork early, so your players can make informed choices and help you maintain the type of game you want to run. Consider the following two exaggerated examples of play style.": "什么是开展活动的正确方式？这取决于你的游戏风格和你的玩家的动机。考虑你的玩家的口味、你作为DM的优势、表格规则（在第三部分讨论）以及你想运行的游戏类型。向玩家描述你所设想的游戏体验，让他们给你提供意见。游戏也是他们的。尽早打好基础，这样你的玩家就能做出明智的选择，并帮助你保持你想运行的游戏类型。请考虑以下两个夸张的游戏风格的例子。",
	"The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is straightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The players spend relatively little time developing personas for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations or discussing anything other than the immediate dangers of the dungeon.": "冒险家们踢开地牢的门，与怪物搏斗，抢夺财宝。这种游戏风格是直接的、有趣的、令人兴奋的和面向行动的。玩家很少花时间为自己的角色塑造形象，在非战斗情况下进行角色扮演，或者讨论除了地牢中的直接危险之外的其他事情。",
	"In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town. Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers back into the action as quickly as possible. Character motivation need be no more developed than a desire to kill monsters and acquire treasure.": "在这样的游戏中，冒险者面对的是明显邪恶的怪物和对手，偶尔也会遇到明显善良和有帮助的NPC。不要指望冒险家们为如何处理俘虏而苦恼，或者争论入侵和消灭一个虫族巢穴是对还是错。不要跟踪金钱或在城里花费的时间。一旦他们完成了一项任务，就尽快让冒险家们回到行动中去。角色的动机不需要比杀死怪物和获得宝藏的愿望更多。",
	"Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so only after both the characters and the lords have come to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game session might pass without a single attack roll.": "水底世界受到了政治动荡的威胁。冒险家们必须说服城市的秘密统治者--假面领主解决他们的分歧，但只有在人物和领主都接受了他们不同的观点和议程之后才能做到这一点。这种游戏风格是深刻、复杂和具有挑战性的。重点不是战斗，而是谈判、政治操纵和角色互动。整个游戏过程中，可能没有一次攻击卷。",
	"In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. Expect long digressions from each player about what his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do so.) A character will sometimes take actions against the player's better judgment, because \"that's what the character would do.\" Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back seat to character development. Ability check modifiers and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in part 3 of this book.": "在这种风格的游戏中，NPC和冒险者一样复杂和丰富的细节，尽管重点在于动机和个性，而不是游戏统计。希望每个玩家都能对他或她的角色所做的事情以及为什么要这样做进行长篇大论。去寺庙向牧师请教可以是与兽人作战一样重要的遭遇。(除非冒险者有动机，否则不要指望他们会去打兽人）。角色有时会采取违背玩家更好判断的行动，因为 \"那是角色会做的事\"。由于战斗不是重点，游戏规则在角色发展中处于次要地位。能力检查修改器和技能熟练度优先于战斗奖励。根据本书第三部分的建议，可以随意改变或忽略规则，以适应玩家的角色扮演需要。",
	"The style of play in most campaigns falls between these two extremes. There's plenty of action, but the campaign offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between characters as well. Players develop their characters' motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated with, or just talked to.": "大多数战役的游戏风格介于这两个极端之间。这里有大量的行动，但战役也提供了一个持续的故事情节和人物之间的互动。玩家发展他们的角色的动机，并乐于在战斗中证明他们的技能。为了保持平衡，要提供角色扮演的遭遇和战斗遭遇的混合物。即使是在地牢中，你也可以提供一些不是用来战斗的NPC，而是用来帮助他们，与他们谈判，或者只是与他们交谈。",
	"Think about your preferred style of play by considering these questions:": "通过考虑这些问题，思考你喜欢的游戏风格。",
	"Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or are you more focused on making the game seem like an action movie?": "你是喜欢现实主义和狡猾的后果，还是更注重让游戏看起来像一部动作电影？",
	"Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines or modern thinking?": "你想让游戏保持一种中世纪的幻想感，还是想探索另一种时间线或现代思维？",
	"Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor your goal?": "你是想保持严肃的语气，还是以幽默为目标？",
	"Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted or intense?": "即使你是认真的，行动是轻松的还是激烈的？",
	"Is bold action key, or do the players need to be thoughtful and cautious?": "大胆的行动是关键，还是玩家需要深思熟虑，小心翼翼？",
	"Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you prefer improvising on the spot?": "你喜欢提前做好周密的计划，还是喜欢在现场即兴发挥？",
	"Is the game full of varied D&D elements, or does it center on a theme such as horror?": "游戏是充满了各种D&D元素，还是以一个主题为中心，比如说恐怖？",
	"Is the game for all ages, or does it involve mature themes?": "该游戏是否适合所有年龄段的人，或者是否涉及成熟的主题？",
	"Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and helping the downtrodden?": "你是否对道德模糊性感到满意，比如允许人物探索目的是否能证明手段的正确性？或者你更喜欢直截了当的英雄主义原则，如正义、牺牲和帮助被压迫者？",
	"Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from place to place, exploring the environment, and learning about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or disabling traps can all be part of exploration.": "活动的大部分内容是冒险者从一个地方到另一个地方，探索环境，了解奇幻世界。这种探索可以在任何环境中进行，包括广阔的荒野、迷宫般的地牢、暗黑世界的阴暗通道、城市中拥挤的街道以及海洋中起伏的水域。确定绕过障碍物的方法、寻找隐藏的物体、调查地牢的奇怪特征、破译线索、解决谜题、绕过或解除陷阱都可以是探索的一部分。",
	"Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the players' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon corridors for secret doors.": "有时，探索是游戏的一个附带部分。例如，你可能会通过告诉玩家他们在路上花了三天的时间来掩盖一个不重要的旅程，然后再继续前进到下一个兴趣点。其他时候，探索是重点，是描述世界或故事中奇妙部分的一个机会，可以增加玩家的沉浸感。同样，如果你的玩家喜欢解开谜题，找到绕过障碍物的方法，并在地下城的走廊里寻找秘密的门，你就应该考虑加强探索。",
	"Part of your campaign style has to do with naming characters. It's a good idea to establish some ground rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, especially when he's identical to Bob I, who was killed by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach to names, that's fine. If the group would rather take the characters and their names a little more seriously, urge Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name.": "你的活动风格的一部分与角色的命名有关。在新的战役开始时与你的玩家建立一些基本规则是个好主意。在一个由Sithis、Travok、Anastrianna和Kairon组成的团体中，名为Bob II的人类战士很引人注目，尤其是当他与被哥布林杀死的Bob I相同时。如果每个人都对名字采取轻松的态度，这很好。如果大家宁愿把人物和他们的名字看得更严肃一点，就敦促鲍勃的玩家想出一个更合适的名字。",
	"Player character names should match each other in flavor or concept, and they should also match the flavor of your campaign world-so should the nonplayer characters' names and place names you create. Travok and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for Lord Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy wizard named Ray.": "玩家角色的名字应该在风味或概念上相互匹配，它们也应该与你的战役世界的风味相匹配--你创造的非玩家角色的名字和地名也应该如此。Travok和Kairon不想为Cupcake勋爵做任务，不想访问Gumdrop岛，也不想打倒一个叫Ray的疯狂巫师。",
	"The backbone of a campaign is a connected series of adventures, but you can connect them in two different ways. In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring theme (or themes). The adventures might feature returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure of the campaign.": "活动的主干是一系列相连的冒险，但你可以用两种不同的方式来连接它们。在一个持续的战役中，相连的冒险有一个更大的目的或一个反复出现的主题（或多个主题）的感觉。这些冒险可能以回归的恶棍、大阴谋或一个最终在活动的每个冒险背后的单一主谋为特征。",
	"A continuing campaign designed with a theme and a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the actions they take during one adventure matter in the next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and memorable story.": "一个以主题和故事梗概为基础设计的持续活动，可以让人感觉像一部伟大的奇幻史诗。玩家可以获得满足感，知道他们在一次冒险中采取的行动在下一次冒险中很重要。策划和运行这样的活动对管理员的要求很高，但回报是一个伟大而令人难忘的故事。",
	"An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television show where each week's episode is a self-contained story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers venturing into the unknown and facing a string of unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create adventures-or buy published ones-and drop them into your campaign without worrying about how they fit with the adventures that came before and follow after.": "相比之下，剧情式活动就像一个电视节目，每周的剧集都是一个自成一体的故事，并不涉及任何总体情节。它可能建立在一个解释其性质的前提上：玩家角色是雇佣的冒险家，或者是进入未知世界的探险家，面临一连串不相关的危险。他们甚至可能是考古学家，冒险进入一个又一个古代遗迹寻找文物。像这样的剧情游戏可以让你创造冒险，或者购买已出版的冒险，并将它们放入你的活动中，而不必担心它们与之前和之后的冒险如何配合。",
	"A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the fundamental elements of human experience that the story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work of literature, but it can still draw on common themes that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider these examples:": "活动中的主题，如同文学作品中的主题，表达了故事的深层含义，以及故事所探讨的人类经验的基本要素。你的活动不一定要成为一部文学作品，但它仍然可以借鉴常见的主题，使其故事具有独特的风味。考虑一下这些例子。",
	"A campaign about confronting the inevitability of mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or expressed through the death of loved ones.": "一场关于面对死亡的不可避免性的运动，无论是体现在不死的怪物身上，还是通过亲人的死亡来表达。",
	"A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own kind as well.": "一个围绕着阴险邪恶的活动，无论是黑暗的神，还是像元始天尊这样的畸形种族，或是远离凡间的未知领域的生物。当英雄们面对这种邪恶时，他们也必须面对自己同类的自私、冷酷的倾向。",
	"A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the world, but also the beast within-the rage and fury that lies in their own hearts.": "这场战役的特点是麻烦的英雄们不仅要面对世界上兽性生物的野蛮，还要面对内心的野兽--隐藏在他们自己心中的怒火和狂暴。",
	"A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering the world.": "这是一场探索对权力和统治永不满足的渴求的运动，无论是九层地狱的主人还是一心想征服世界的人形统治者都体现了这一点。",
	"With a theme such as \"confrontation with mortality,\" you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't necessarily connected by a common villain. One adventure might feature the dead bursting from their graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid confronting its own demise. The adventurers might help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the adventurers might even become a ghost!": "有了 \"与死亡对抗 \"这样的主题，你就可以设计出一系列广泛的冒险，而这些冒险并不一定由一个共同的恶棍来连接。一个冒险的特点可能是死人从坟墓里冲出来，威胁着整个城镇。在下一个冒险中，一个疯狂的巫师创造了一个肉体傀儡，以努力使他失去的爱情复活。一个坏蛋可能为了避免面对自己的死亡而不惜采取极端的手段来实现永生。冒险家们可能会帮助一个鬼魂接受死亡并继续前进，或者其中一个冒险家甚至可能成为一个鬼魂!",
	"Mixing things up once in a while allows your players to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl—especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger plot in the campaign. If most of your adventures are dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run horror adventures week after week, try using a villain who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign, though players usually provide it themselves.": "偶尔混合一下，可以让你的玩家享受各种冒险的乐趣。即使是一个主题紧密的活动，也可以时不时地偏离一下。如果你的活动主要涉及阴谋、神秘和角色扮演，你的玩家可能会喜欢偶尔在地牢里爬一爬--特别是如果这个切入点被发现与活动中的大情节有关。如果你的大部分冒险都是地牢探险，那就用一个紧张的城市之谜来转移注意力，最终引导玩家在废弃的建筑或塔中进行地牢爬行。如果你周而复始地进行恐怖冒险，可以尝试使用一个原来很普通，甚至可能很愚蠢的反派。在几乎所有的D&D活动中，喜剧都是一个很好的变化，尽管玩家通常会自己提供。",
	"As characters grow in power, their ability to change the world around them grows with them. It helps to think ahead when creating your campaign to account for this change. As the characters make a greater impact on the world, they face greater danger whether they want to or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot against them, while friendly ones court their favor in hopes of striking a useful alliance.": "随着角色力量的增长，他们改变周围世界的能力也会随之增长。在创建活动时，提前考虑到这种变化是有帮助的。随着人物对世界产生更大的影响，无论他们是否愿意，他们都会面临更大的危险。强大的派别将他们视为威胁，并策划反对他们，而友好的派别则向他们示好，希望能达成有用的联盟。",
	"The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. As the characters resolve one event, a new danger arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat in response to the characters' actions. Events need to grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and drama as the characters become increasingly powerful.": "游戏的层级代表了为战役引入新的震惊世界的事件的理想里程碑。当人物解决一个事件时，新的危险就会出现，或者之前的麻烦会因为人物的行动而转化为新的威胁。事件的规模和范围需要不断扩大，随着人物变得越来越强大，赌注和戏剧性也在增加。",
	"This approach also allows you to break your design work down into smaller pieces. Create material such as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at a time. You only need to worry about the details of the next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing much work.": "这种方法也允许你把设计工作分成小块。一次为一个层级创建材料，如冒险、NPC、地图等等。你只需要在人物接近下一层的时候担心下一层的细节问题。更妙的是，当活动因玩家的选择而出现意想不到的转折时，你就不必担心重做很多工作了。",
	"Characters in this tier are still learning the range of class features that define them, including their choice of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are heroes, set apart from the common people by natural characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater destiny that lies before them.": "这个层次的角色仍在学习定义他们的一系列等级特征，包括他们对专业的选择。但是，即使是一级角色也是英雄，通过自然特征、学习的技能和摆在他们面前的更大的命运的暗示而与普通人区分开来。",
	"At the start of their careers, characters use 1st- and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The magic items they find include common consumable items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in a single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an adventure.": "在他们的职业生涯开始时，角色使用一级和二级法术，并挥舞着世俗的装备。他们找到的魔法物品包括普通的消耗品（药水和卷轴）和极少数不常见的永久性物品。他们的魔法可以在一次遭遇战中产生很大的影响，但它不会改变冒险的进程。",
	"The fate of a village might hang on the success or failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're better off avoiding a fight.": "一个村庄的命运可能取决于低级别的冒险者的成败，他们把自己的生命托付给刚起步的能力。这些角色在危险的地形上航行，探索闹鬼的地窖，他们可能会与野蛮的兽人、凶猛的狼、巨大的蜘蛛、邪恶的崇拜者、嗜血的食尸鬼和雇佣的暴徒战斗。如果他们面对的是一条年轻的龙，他们最好避免战斗。",
	"By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have mastered the basics of their class features, though they continue to improve throughout these levels. They have found their place in the world and have begun to involve themselves in the dangers that surround them.": "当他们达到这个等级时，冒险者已经掌握了他们等级特征的基本知识，尽管他们在这些等级中继续提高。他们已经找到了自己在这个世界上的位置，并开始参与到他们周围的危险中。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage large numbers of foes with {@spell fireball} and {@spell lightning bolt} spells, and even breathe underwater. They master 5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such as {@spell teleportation circle}, {@spell scrying}, {@spell flame strike}, {@spell legend lore}, and {@spell raise dead} can have a significant impact on their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which will serve them for the rest of their careers.": "专职的施法者在本层开始时学习第三级法术。突然间，人物可以飞行，用{@spell fireball}和{@spell lightning bolt}的法术伤害大量的敌人，甚至可以在水中呼吸。在本层结束时，他们掌握了五级法术，诸如{@spell teleportation circle}、{@spell scrying}、{@spell flame strike}、{@spell legend lore}和{@spell raise dead}等法术可以对他们的冒险产生重大影响。他们也开始获得更多的永久性魔法物品（不常见的和稀有的），这将为他们的职业生涯的其余部分服务。",
	"The fate of a region might depend on the adventures that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a young dragon that has established a lair but not yet extended its reach far into the surrounding territory.": "一个地区的命运可能取决于5到10级的人物所进行的冒险。这些冒险者冒险进入可怕的荒野和古老的遗迹，在那里他们面对野蛮的巨人、凶猛的水蛇、无畏的巨兽、邪恶的元神、阴险的魔鬼、嗜血的恶魔、狡猾的心灵传播者和乌鸦刺客。他们可能有机会打败一条年轻的龙，这条龙已经建立了一个巢穴，但还没有把它的触角延伸到周围的领土。",
	"By 11th level, characters are shining examples of courage and determination-true paragons in the world, set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge.": "到了第11级，人物是勇气和决心的光辉典范--世界上真正的典范，与众不同。在这个等级，冒险家们比低级别的冒险家们要多才多艺，他们通常可以找到合适的工具来应对特定的挑战。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells at 11th level, including spells that completely change the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, flashy spells are significant in combat-{@spell disintegrate}, {@spell blade barrier}, and {@spell heal}, for example-but behind-the-scenes spells such as {@spell word of recall}, {@spell find the path}, {@spell contingency}, {@spell teleport}, and {@spell true seeing} alter the way players approach their adventures. Each spell level after that point introduces new effects with an equally large impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities.": "专门的法术师在11级时可以获得6级法术，包括完全改变冒险者与世界互动方式的法术。他们的大而华丽的法术在战斗中很重要--例如{@spell disintegrate}、{@spell blade barrier}和{@spell heal}，但幕后的法术，如{@spell word of recall}、{@spell find the path}、{@spell contingency}、{@spell teleport}和{@spell true seeing}，则改变了玩家的冒险方式。这之后的每一个法术等级都会引入新的效果，影响同样巨大。冒险者们找到了罕见的魔法物品（和非常罕见的），赋予了类似的强大能力。",
	"The fate of a nation or even the world depends on momentous quests that such characters undertake. Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon that has established a lair and a significant presence in the world.": "一个国家甚至世界的命运取决于这些人物所承担的重大任务。冒险家们探索未知的地区，深入被遗忘已久的地牢，在那里他们要面对可怕的下层世界的主谋，狡猾的罗刹和持有者，以及饥饿的紫色蠕虫。他们可能会遇到，甚至打败一个强大的成年龙，它在这个世界上建立了一个巢穴和一个重要的存在。",
	"At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of their adventures to the manner in which they spend their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices or students of their own. They broker peace between nations or lead them into war. And their formidable reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes.": "在这个级别，冒险家们以各种方式在这个世界上留下自己的印记，从他们冒险的结果到他们花掉自己辛苦得来的财宝和利用自己当之无愧的声誉的方式。这个级别的人物在当地统治者授予他们的土地上建造堡垒。他们建立了行会、寺庙或武道会。他们收学徒或自己的学生。他们在国家之间斡旋和平，或将他们带入战争。他们强大的声誉吸引了非常强大的敌人的注意。",
	"By 17th level, characters have super heroic capabilities, and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of power-or such terrible dangers.": "到了17级，人物就有了超级英雄的能力，他们的事迹和冒险都是传说中的东西。普通人很难梦想到这样的力量高度--或者这样的可怕危险。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 9th-level spells such as {@spell wish}, {@spell gate}, {@spell storm of vengeance}, and {@spell astral projection}.

	"Adventures at these levels have far-reaching consequences, possibly determining the fate of millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they fight savage balor demons, titans, archdevils, lich archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose waking threatens existence itself.": "这些级别的冒险具有深远的影响，可能会决定物质世界甚至其他地方数百万人的命运。角色们穿越另一个世界的领域，探索半位面和其他星球外的地方，在那里他们与野蛮的巴罗尔恶魔、泰坦、大恶魔、巫师大法师，甚至是众神的化身战斗。他们遇到的龙是具有巨大力量的巫妖，它们的沉睡会给王国带来麻烦，它们的醒来会威胁到存在本身。",
	"Characters who reach 20th level have attained the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are recorded in the annals of history and recounted by bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid might become one with the land, transforming into a nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties that revere the memory of their honored ancestors from generation to generation, create masterpieces of epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the adventurers' principles and dreams alive.": "达到20级的角色已经达到了凡人成就的顶峰。他们的事迹被记录在历史长河中，被吟游诗人传颂了几个世纪。他们最终的命运也会实现。牧师可能会被带入天堂，作为神的右手。一个术士可以成为其他术士的守护者。也许一个巫师解开了不朽（或不死）的秘密，并花了数年时间探索多元宇宙的最远端。德鲁伊可能会与土地融为一体，变成某个特定地方的自然之灵或野生的某个方面。其他角色可以建立宗族或王朝，一代又一代地尊崇他们尊贵的祖先的记忆，创造史诗文学的杰作，被传唱和复述数千年，或者建立公会或命令，使冒险者的原则和梦想得以延续。",
	"Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the end of the campaign. These powerful characters might be called on to undertake grand adventures on the cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their capabilities can continue to evolve.

Chapter 7 details epic boons you can use as rewards for these characters to maintain a sense of progress.": "达到这一点并不一定决定了活动的结束。这些强大的角色可能会被要求在宇宙舞台上进行盛大的冒险。而作为这些冒险的结果，他们的能力可以继续发展。角色在这时不会再获得更多的等级，但他们仍然可以以有意义的方式前进，并继续执行响彻整个多元宇宙的史诗般的事迹。第7章详细介绍了你可以用来作为这些角色的奖励的史诗恩赐，以保持一种进步感。",
	"Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of the character classes and impatient for more significant adventures might welcome the idea of starting a campaign with characters above 1st level.

Your choice can have a impact on the flavor of your campaign.": "龙与地下城是一种幻想游戏，但这个广泛的类别包含了很多种类。小说和电影中存在许多不同口味的幻想。你想要一个受H.P.洛夫克拉夫特或克拉克-阿什顿-史密斯作品启发的恐怖活动吗？或者你设想一个由肌肉发达的野蛮人和灵活的盗贼组成的世界，沿着罗伯特-E-霍华德和弗里茨-莱伯的经典剑与魔法书的路线？你的选择会对你的活动的味道产生影响。",
	"Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline: a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an adventuring life. The adventurers are the \"heroes\" of the campaign, but they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to destroy monsters or villains.": "英雄式幻想是D&D规则所假定的基线。玩家手册》描述了这一基线：众多的类人种族与人类在奇幻世界中共存。冒险者用神奇的力量来对抗他们所面临的可怕威胁。这些角色通常来自于普通的背景，但有些东西促使他们进入冒险生活。冒险者是活动中的 \"英雄\"，但他们可能不是真正的英雄，而是出于自私的原因追求这种生活。技术和社会是基于中世纪的规范，尽管文化不一定是欧洲的。活动往往围绕着深入古代地牢寻找宝藏或努力消灭怪物或恶棍而展开。",
	"This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the authors listed in appendix E of the Player's Handbook.": "这种体裁在奇幻小说中也很常见。大多数以被遗忘的领域为背景的小说最好被描述为英雄式的幻想，追随《玩家手册》附录E中所列的许多作者的脚步。",

Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in search of the fabled City of Golden Masks.": "一个面目狰狞的大块头战士在自己的祭坛上将蛇神的大祭司开膛破肚。一个大笑的流氓在肮脏的酒馆里把不义之财花在廉价的酒上。艰苦的冒险家们冒险进入未开发的丛林，寻找传说中的金面具之城。",
	"A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find a dark, gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where the protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-interest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy setting, those who wield magic often symbolize the decadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards are the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are therefore rare and often dangerous.": "剑与魔法的战役模仿了一些奇幻小说的经典作品，这一传统可以追溯到游戏的根源。在这里，你会发现一个由邪恶的巫师和颓废的城市组成的黑暗、狡猾的世界，在这里，主角们更多的是受贪婪和自我利益的驱使，而不是利他主义的美德。斗士、流氓和野蛮人角色往往比巫师、牧师或圣骑士更常见。在这样的纸浆奇幻设定中，那些挥舞着魔法的人往往象征着文明的堕落和腐败，而魔法师是这些设定中的典型恶棍。因此，魔法物品很罕见，而且往往很危险。",
	"Certain Dungeons & Dragons novels follow in the footsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world of Athas (as featured in numerous Dark Sun novels and game products), with its heroic gladiators and tyrannical sorcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre.": "某些《龙与地下城》小说追随了经典剑与魔法小说的脚步。阿塔斯世界（如众多黑暗太阳小说和游戏产品中的特色），其英雄的角斗士和暴虐的巫师国王，完全属于这一类型。",

	"An epic-fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil as a prominent element of the game, with the adventurers more or less squarely on the side of good. These characters are heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing incredible dangers without blinking. Characters might struggle with moral quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration between devout knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve.": "史诗般的奇幻活动强调善与恶之间的冲突是游戏的一个突出元素，而冒险者或多或少地站在善的一方。这些角色是最佳意义上的英雄，他们被比自私的利益或野心更高的目的所驱使，面对难以置信的危险不眨眼。角色可能会在道德困境中挣扎，与自己内心的邪恶倾向以及威胁世界的邪恶斗争。而这些战役的故事往往包括浪漫的元素：十字星恋人之间的悲剧，甚至超越死亡的激情，以及虔诚的骑士和他们所服务的君主和贵族之间的贞洁崇拜。",

	"A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and stories of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh to Cu Chulainn. Adventurers attempt mighty feats of legend, aided or hindered by the gods or their agents—and they might have divine blood themselves. The monsters and villains they face probably have a similar origin. The minotaur in the dungeon isn't just another bull-headed humanoid, but {@i the} Minotaur-misbegotten offspring of a philandering god. Adventures might lead the heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the gods in search of a gift or favor.": "一个神话般的奇幻活动借鉴了古代神话和传说的主题和故事，从吉尔伽美什到库丘林。冒险家们在神灵或他们的代理人的帮助或阻碍下，试图完成传说中的伟大壮举，而他们自己可能也有神灵的血统。他们所面对的怪物和恶棍可能也有类似的起源。地牢里的牛头人并不是另一个牛头人，而是{@i the}牛头人--一个花心的神所生的后代。冒险可能会引导英雄们通过一系列的考验，到诸神的领域去寻找一种礼物或恩惠。",

	"If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline of supernatural horror. The most important element of such a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules.

	"The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic campaign. The characters typically spend more time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's hidden chambers.": "海盗和火枪手的冒险故事为动态战役提供了机会。这些角色通常在城市、皇室法庭和航海船只上花费更多的时间，而不是在地牢探险中，这使得互动技能变得非常重要（尽管没有达到纯阴谋活动的程度）。然而，英雄们可能会在经典的地牢中结束，比如在宫殿下面的风暴下水道中寻找邪恶公爵的密室。",

The characters carry out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the enemy's flank to reach a demonic commander. In other situations, the party supports the larger army by holding a strategic location until reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts before they can report, or cutting off supply lines. Information gathering and diplomatic missions can supplement the more combat-oriented adventures.": "幻想世界中的战争充满了冒险的机会。战争活动一般不关注部队运动的具体细节，而是关注那些扭转战局的英雄们。角色们执行特定的任务：夺取赋予亡灵军队力量的魔法标准，收集援军以打破围困，或者从敌人的侧翼切入以接触恶魔的指挥官。在其他情况下，该党派通过守住一个战略要地，直到援军到达，在敌人的侦察兵报告之前杀死他们，或切断供应线来支持大军。信息收集和外交任务可以补充更加注重战斗的冒险。",

	"A campaign that draws on elements of Asian martial-arts movies is a perfect match for D&D. Players can define the appearance of their characters and gear however they like for the campaign, and spells need only minor flavor changes so that they better reflect such a setting. For example, when the characters use spells or special abilities that teleport them short distances, they actually make high-flying acrobatic leaps. Ability checks to climb don't involve careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points. Flavorful descriptions of actions in the game don't change the nuts and bolts of the rules, but they make all the difference in the feel of a campaign.": "一个借鉴了亚洲武侠电影元素的战役与D&D是完美匹配的。玩家可以在活动中随意定义他们的角色和装备的外观，而法术只需要做一些细微的味道改变，以便更好地反映这样的背景。例如，当角色使用法术或特殊能力将其短距离传送时，他们实际上是在进行高空杂技跳跃。攀爬的能力检查不需要小心翼翼地寻找支撑点，而是让角色在墙上或树与树之间弹跳。战士们通过打击压力点来击晕对手。对游戏中的行动进行有趣的描述并不改变规则的具体内容，但它们会使活动的感觉完全不同。",
	"Similarly, a class doesn't need new rules to reflect a cultural influence; a new name can do the trick. A traditional Chinese wuxia hero might be a paladin who has a sword called the Oath of Vengeance, while a Japanese samurai might be a paladin with a particular Oath of Devotion (bushido) that includes fealty to a lord (daimyo) among its tenets. A ninja is a monk who pursues the Way of Shadow. Whether called a wu jen, a tsukai, or a swami, a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock character works just fine in a game inspired by medieval Asian cultures.": "同样，一个等级不需要新的规则来反映文化的影响；一个新的名字就可以做到这一点。一个传统的中国武侠英雄可能是一个拥有一把名为 \"复仇之誓 \"的剑的圣骑士，而一个日本武士可能是一个拥有特殊的 \"奉献之誓\"（bushido）的圣骑士，其信条中包括对领主（大名）的忠诚。忍者是一个追求影子之道的僧侣。不管是叫武将，TSUKAI，还是Swami，一个魔法师，巫师，或术士角色在一个由中世纪亚洲文化激发的游戏中都是很好的。",

	"The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth's Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped to his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon belonging to Greyhawk's god of justice, found its way to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1985. Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms has been said to make occasional appearances in the kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood—where he is sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth and Krynn (homeworld of the Dragonlance saga).": "著名的圣骑士Murlynd来自Oerth世界（如格雷霍克小说和游戏产品中的特色），他穿着地球旧西部的传统服装，腰上绑着一对六连发手枪。圣库斯伯特之矛是属于灰鹰的正义之神的神圣武器，于1985年进入伦敦的维多利亚和阿尔伯特博物馆。在Oerth壁垒峰的某个地方，据说躺着一艘太空船的残骸，船上有奇怪的外星生命体和奇怪的技术物品。据说《被遗忘的领域》中著名的巫师艾尔明斯特偶尔会出现在加拿大作家艾德-格林伍德的厨房里--在那里他有时会和来自Oerth和Krynn世界（《龙之谷》传奇的故乡）的巫师们一起出现。",
	"Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" provides tools for exploring those possibilities.": "在D&D的根基中深藏着科幻小说和科学幻想的元素，而你的活动也可以借鉴这些来源。你可以让你的角色通过魔镜飞向刘易斯-卡罗尔的仙境，让他们登上一艘在星际间旅行的飞船，或者将你的活动设定在一个激光枪和魔法导弹并存的遥远未来世界。这种可能性是无限的。第9章，\"地下城主的工作室 \"提供了探索这些可能性的工具。",
	"When Adventurers reach higher levels their path extends to other dimensions of reality: the planes of existence that form the multiverse. The characters might be called on to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of the River Oceanus. They can hoist a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard or face the chaos of Limbo to contact a wizened githzerai sage.": "当冒险者达到更高的级别时，他们的道路会延伸到现实的其他维度：构成多元宇宙的存在平面。角色们可能会被要求从深渊的恐怖深处拯救朋友，或者在海神河的闪亮水域中航行。他们可以与Ysgard的友好巨人一起举起酒杯，也可以面对Limbo的混乱，与一个聪明的githzerai圣人联系。",
	"Planes of existence define the extremes of strange and often dangerous environments. The most bizarre locations present settings undreamed of in the natural world. Planar adventures offer unprecedented dangers and wonders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid fire, or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.": "存在的平面定义了奇怪和往往危险的环境的极端。最诡异的地点呈现出自然界中做梦也想不到的环境。平面冒险提供了前所未有的危险和奇迹。冒险者走在由固体火焰组成的街道上，或在战场上测试他们的能力，在那里，每一个黎明都会有死去的人复活。",
	"The various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but dimensions formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles.": "各种存在的平面是神话和神秘的领域。它们不是简单的其他世界，而是由精神和元素原则形成和支配的维度。",
	"The Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and thought. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, and deities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, isn't merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a physical location.": "外层世界是精神和思想的领域。它们是天人、魔人和神灵存在的领域。例如，极乐世界不仅仅是一个善良生物居住的地方，甚至不仅仅是善良生物的灵魂死后去的地方。它是善的层面，是邪恶无法滋生的精神境界。它既是一种存在和思想的状态，也是一个物理位置。",
	"The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane's entire substance is suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion, transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of fire's dominion.": "内层平面体现了空气、地球、火和水的物理本质和元素性质。例如，火的元素界体现了火的本质。该平面的整个物质都充满了火的基本性质：能量、激情、转化和毁灭。即使是实心黄铜或玄武岩的物体也似乎在与火焰共舞，这是火的统治的活力的一种可见和可触及的表现。",
	"In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures.": "在这种情况下，物质界是所有这些哲学和元素力量在凡人生命和物质的混乱存在中碰撞的纽带。D&D的世界存在于物质界中，使其成为大多数战役和冒险的起点。",
	"The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.": "多元宇宙的其余部分是相对于物质界而定义的。",

	"{@b The Material Plane and Its Echoes.} The Feywild and the Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane.": "{@b The Material Plane and Its Echoes.}精灵世界和阴影地带是物质世界的反射。",
	"{@b The Transitive Planes.} The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane to another.": "{@b The Transitive Planes.} 虚空界和星界大多是没有特征的平面，主要作为从一个平面到另一个平面的通道。",
	"{@b The Inner Planes.} The four Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them, are the Inner Planes.": "{@b The Inner Planes.} 四个元素位面（空气、地球、火和水），加上环绕它们的元素混沌，就是内层位面。",
	"{@b The Outer Planes.} Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference between them.": "{@b The Outer Planes.}十六个外层平面对应于八个非中立的排列和它们之间的哲学差异的深浅。",
	"{@b The Positive and Negative Planes.} These two planes enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and death that underlie the rest of existence in the multiverse.": "{@b The Positive and Negative Planes.}这两个平面包围着宇宙学的其他部分，提供了生命和死亡的原始力量，是多元宇宙中其他存在的基础。",
	"As described in the {@i Player's Handbook}, the assumed D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth's myths, or created by your own imagination.": "如{@i Player's Handbook}所述，假定的D&D宇宙学包括二十多个平面。对于你的活动，你可以决定包括哪些平面，这些平面的灵感来自于标准平面，来自于地球的神话，或者由你自己的想象力创造。",
	"At minimum, most D&D campaigns require these elements:": "至少，大多数D&D活动都需要这些要素。",
	"A plane of origin for fiends": "恶魔的起源平面",
	"A plane of origin for celestials": "一个天体的起源平面",
	"A plane of origin for elementals": "元素的起源平面",
	"A place for deities, which might include any or all of the previous three": "一个供奉神灵的地方，可能包括前三者中的任何一个或全部",
	"The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the first three": "凡人死后灵魂的去处，可能包括前三者中的任何一个或全部。",
	"A way of getting from one plane to another": "从一个飞机到另一个飞机的方式",
	"A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function": "让使用星界和虚空界的法术和怪物发挥作用的方法。",
	"Once you've decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient theoretical construct based on the philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance they give to law and good.": "一旦你决定了你想在战役中使用的平面，把它们放到一个连贯的宇宙学中是一个可选的步骤。由于从一个位面到另一个位面的主要旅行方式，即使是使用跨位面，也是通过神奇的传送门将各位面连接在一起，因此不同位面之间的确切关系在很大程度上是一个理论问题。多元宇宙中的任何生命都无法像我们看书中的图表一样，俯视并看到各平面的排列。没有凡人可以证实天山是否夹在拜托邦和阿卡迪亚之间，但这是一个方便的理论构造，它基于三个星球之间的哲学阴影以及它们对法律和善的相对重要性。",
	"Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you can create or adapt whatever model works best for the planes you want to use in your game.": "圣人已经构建了一些这样的理论模型，以使杂乱无章的星球，特别是外部星球有意义。最常见的三个模型是大轮盘、世界树和世界轴，但你可以为你想在游戏中使用的星球创建或改编任何最有效的模型。",
	"Each of the planes described in this chapter has at least one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When you design your own planes, it's a good idea to stick to that model. Create one simple trait that players notice, that doesn't create too much complication at the gaming table, and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics.": "本章所描述的每一架飞机都对在那里冒险的旅行者至少有一个重要影响。当你设计自己的飞机时，最好是坚持这个模式。创造一个简单的特征，让玩家注意到，在游戏桌上不会产生太多复杂的东西，而且容易记住。试着反映这个地方的哲学和情绪，而不仅仅是它的物理特征。",
	"The default cosmological arrangement presented in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking them all.": "在《玩家手册》中，默认的宇宙学安排将各个星球想象成一组同心轮，物质界和它的回声位于中心。内层位面在物质位面周围形成一个轮子，被空灵位面所笼罩。然后，外层世界形成另一个轮子，围绕着这个轮子，并在其后面（或上面或下面），根据排列方式排列，由外域将它们全部连接起来。",
	"This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's not the only possible explanation of the river's course.": "这种安排使冥河在下层世界中的流动方式变得合理，它像绳子上的珠子一样连接着阿克伦、九层地狱、地府、哈迪斯、卡塞里、深渊和潘德文。但这并不是对河道的唯一可能解释。",
	"A different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or figuratively.": "一个不同的平面安排设想他们位于一棵伟大的宇宙之树的根和枝之间，从字面上或比喻上来说。",
	"For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard and Midgard.": "例如，北欧的宇宙学以世界树Yggdrasil为中心。世界树的三根触及三个境界。阿斯加德（包括瓦尔哈拉、瓦纳海姆、阿尔夫海姆和其他地区的外部世界）、米德加德（物质世界）和尼弗尔海姆（阴间）。Bifrost，即彩虹桥，是连接阿斯加德和米德加德的独特过渡平面。",
	"Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish creatures.": "同样地，关于被遗忘领域的神灵所居住的位面的一个设想是，一些天体位面位于世界树的树枝上，而恶魔位面则由一条血河连接。中立位面与它们分开。这些平面主要是一个或多个神灵的领域，尽管它们也是天人和恶魔生物的家园。",
	"In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos.": "在这种宇宙观中，物质界和它的回声站在两个对立的境界之间。星界（或星海）漂浮在它们之上，拥有任何数量的神域（外星界）。物质界下面是元素混沌，这是一个单一的、无差别的元素界，所有的元素都在这里发生冲突。元素混沌的底部是深渊，就像宇宙结构中被撕裂的一个洞。",
	"As you build your own cosmology, consider the following alternatives.": "当你建立自己的宇宙观时，请考虑以下替代方案。",
	"This simple cosmology covers the bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, where evil deities and fiends live.": "这个简单的宇宙论涵盖了最基本的内容：一个物质界；过渡界；一个单一的元素混沌；一个上天，善的神灵和天人居住的地方；以及冥界，邪恶的神灵和魔鬼居住的地方。",
	"In this cosmology, countless planes clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each other more or less at random.": "在这个宇宙论中，无数的平面像肥皂泡一样聚集在一起，或多或少随机地相互交错。",
	"All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of Eberron uses this cosmological model.": "所有的内部和外部星球都围绕着物质界运行，随着它们的靠近和远离，对世界产生或多或少的影响。Eberron世界采用了这种宇宙学模型。",
	"In this cosmology, every plane is a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna.": "在这个宇宙论中，每一个平面都是无限道路上的一个站点。每个平面都与其他两个平面相邻，但相邻平面之间没有必要的内聚力；一个旅行者可以从天山的山坡走到地府的山坡。",
	"In the Greek cosmology, Mount Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes reside there.": "在希腊的宇宙观中，奥林匹斯山矗立在世界的中心（物质界），其山峰非常高，实际上是另一个存在的平面。奥林匹斯，众神的家园。除哈迪斯外，所有希腊诸神都在奥林匹斯山内有自己的领地。在以其统治者命名的哈迪斯，凡人的灵魂作为无实体的影子徘徊，直到最终消逝于无形。塔尔塔罗斯（Tartarus）位于哈迪斯的下方，那里是泰坦巨人被囚禁在无尽的黑暗中。而在物质世界已知世界的西边，是受祝福的极乐世界。伟大英雄的灵魂居住在那里。",
	"The Egyptian cosmology is defined by the daily path of the sun-across the sky of the Material Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, and then beneath the world through the nightmarish Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages of its journey.": "埃及的宇宙观是由太阳的日常轨迹定义的--穿过物质界的天空，下到西方公平的供奉场，在那里正义者的灵魂生活在永恒的奖赏中，然后在世界的下方通过噩梦般的十二小时的夜晚。太阳驳船本身就是一个很小的外部世界，尽管它在其旅程的不同阶段存在于星界和其他外部世界中。",
	"In this model, there are no other planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the world, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium.": "在这个模型中，没有其他存在的平面，但物质平面包括像无底的深渊、闪亮的天山、奇怪的麦加努斯城、阿克伦堡垒等地方。所有的位面都是世界上的地点，可以通过普通的旅行方式到达--尽管需要付出非凡的努力，例如，渡海前往极乐世界的祝福岛屿。",
	"In this model, the Material Plane has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane and can be reached through thin places where the worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or by four cities that each represent a different aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called Tir na nug, and the cosmologies of some religions inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World.": "在这个模型中，物质界有一个孪生界，填补了所有其他界的作用。和精灵世界一样，它覆盖在物质界之上，可以通过世界特别接近的稀薄地方到达：通过洞穴，通过远航渡海，或者在偏远森林的仙女环中。它有黑暗、邪恶的区域（恶魔和邪神的家园），神圣的岛屿（天人和受祝福的死亡之灵的家园），以及元素狂暴的境界。这个异世界有时由一个永恒的城市监管，或由四个城市监管，每个城市都代表现实的不同方面。凯尔特人的宇宙观有一个另一个世界，叫做Tir na nug，一些受亚洲神话启发的宗教的宇宙观也有一个类似的精神世界。",
	"When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, they undertake a legendary journey that might force them to face supernatural guardians and undergo various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and whether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a spell to carry them.": "当冒险者前往其他存在的星球时，他们会进行一次传奇之旅，可能会迫使他们面对超自然的守护者并经历各种磨难。这段旅程的性质和沿途的考验部分取决于旅行的方式，以及冒险者是否找到了魔法门或使用法术来运送他们。",
	"[Raistlin's] eyes studied the Portal, studied every detail intently-although it was not really necessary. He had seen it myriad times in dreams both sleeping and waking. The spells to open it were simple, nothing elaborate or complex.": "[雷斯林的眼睛研究着传送门，仔细地研究每一个细节--尽管这并不是真的需要。他在睡觉和醒来的梦中都见过它无数次。打开它的法术很简单，没有什么复杂的东西。",
	"Each of the five dragon heads surrounding and guarding the Portal must be propitiated with the correct phrase. Each must be spoken to in the proper order. But, once that was done and the White Robed Cleric had exhorted Paladine to intercede and hold the Portal open, they would enter. It would close behind them.": "围绕和守卫门户的五个龙首都必须用正确的话语来祭祀。必须按照适当的顺序对每个人说话。但是，一旦完成了这些，而且白袍教士劝说帕拉丁进行调解并保持门户开放，他们就会进入。它将在他们身后关闭。",
	"And he would face his greatest challenge.": "他将面临他最大的挑战。",
	"\"Portal\" is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear window or a fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as stepping through the doorway. Other portals are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).": "\"传送门 \"是一个固定的星际连接的总称，它将一个平面上的特定位置与另一个平面上的特定位置连接起来。有些传送门的功能就像门洞一样，出现在一个清晰的窗口或一个被雾气笼罩的通道上，星际旅行就像跨过门洞一样简单。其他的传送门是一些地点--一圈站立的石头、高耸的塔楼、帆船，甚至是整个城镇--它们同时存在于多个平面，或者从一个平面闪烁到另一个。有些是漩涡，将一个元素位面与物质位面的一个非常相似的位置连接起来，比如火山的中心（通往火位面）或海洋深处（通往水位面）。",
	"Passing through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel from the Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of the time, though, a portal presents an adventure in itself.": "穿过一个平面传送门，可以说是从物质界到另一个平面的理想地点的最简单方法。不过，大多数时候，传送门本身就是一种冒险。",
	"First, the adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want to go. Most portals exist in distant locations, and a portal's location often has thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal to the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a mountain peak.": "首先，冒险者们必须找到一个能通往他们想去的地方的传送门。大多数传送门都存在于遥远的地方，一个传送门的位置往往与它所通往的平面有主题上的相似性。例如，通往天国的天山的传送门可能位于一座山峰上。",
	"Second, portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that undesirable people don't pass through. Depending on the portal's destination, \"undesirable people\" might include evil characters, good characters, cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal creature. A portal's guardian is typically a powerful magical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal's destination plane.": "第二，传送门通常有守护者，负责确保不受欢迎的人不会通过。根据传送门的目的地，\"不受欢迎的人 \"可能包括邪恶人物、善良人物、懦夫、小偷、任何穿着长袍的人，或任何凡人生物。传送门的守护者通常是一个强大的魔法生物，如精灵、斯芬克斯、泰坦或传送门目的地位面的本地人。",
	"Finally, most portals don't stand open all the time, but open only in particular situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can have any conceivable requirement, but the following are the most common:": "最后，大多数门户不是一直开放的，而是只在特定情况下或满足某种要求时才开放。一个门户网站可以有任何可以想象的要求，但以下是最常见的。",
	"The portal functions only at particular times: during a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the stars are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon, or for an hour, or for {@dice 1d4 + 1} rounds.": "这个传送门只在特定的时间发挥作用：在物质界的满月期间，或每十天一次，或当星星处于特定位置时。一旦打开，这样的传送门就会在有限的时间内保持开放，比如满月后的三天，或一小时，或{@dice 1d4 + 1}轮。",
	"The portal functions only if a particular condition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast in its vicinity.": "传送门只有在满足某个特定条件时才会发挥作用。一个有条件的传送门会在晴朗的夜晚打开，或在下雨时打开，或在其附近被施以某种咒语时打开。",
	"A random portal functions for a random period, then shuts down for a similarly random duration. Typically, such a portal allows {@dice 1d6 + 6} travelers to pass through, then shuts down for {@dice 1d6} days.": "一个随机的传送门在一个随机的时期内运作，然后在一个类似的随机时间内关闭。通常情况下，这样的入口允许{@dice 1d6 + 6}的旅客通过，然后关闭{@dice 1d6}天。",
	"The portal functions only if a particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the word must be spoken as a character passes through the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window, or similar opening). Other portals open when the command word is spoken and remain open for a short time.": "只有在说出一个特定的命令词时，传送门才会发挥作用。有时必须在角色通过传送门（否则就是一个普通的门口、窗户或类似的开口）时说出这个词。其他的传送门在命令词被说出来时就会打开，并在短时间内保持开放。",
	"The portal functions if the traveler is holding a particular object; the item acts much like a key to a door. This key item can be a common object or a particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keyed portals.": "如果旅行者持有一个特定的物品，门户就会发挥作用；该物品的作用很像一扇门的钥匙。这把钥匙可以是一个普通的物品，也可以是为该门户创造的特殊钥匙。外域之上的西格尔城被称为门之城，因为它有大量这样的物品钥匙的传送门。",
	"Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can draw characters into further adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries for command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit the portal.": "学习和满足一个门户的要求可以吸引角色进入进一步的冒险，因为他们要追寻一个关键的物品，在古老的图书馆中寻找命令词，或者咨询圣人以寻找访问门户的正确时间。",
	"Sarya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. The mythal thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya ignored the mythal stone's change and pressed on, finishing her gate spell with skill and confidence.": "萨利娅举起双手，开始宣读一个非常强大的咒语，这是她所知道的最危险的咒语之一，这个咒语的目的是要突破平面之间的障碍，创造一个进入另一个存在领域的魔法桥梁。咒语颤动着回应，这个古老装置的无形脉冲呈现出一种新的和不同的音符。萨利娅没有理会神话石的变化，继续前进，以熟练和自信的方式完成了她的大门咒语。",
	"\"The gate is open!\" she cried. \"Malkizid, come forth!\"": "\"门开了！\"她喊道。\"马尔基兹德，出来吧！\"",
	"Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson lightning. Then, through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his infernal plane into the mythal chamber.": "在萨利娅面前，一个巨大的金色魔法环或圈从空中凝聚起来。通过它，她瞥见了Malkizid的领域，一个由枯萎的沙漠、风吹的裂缝和被深红色闪电撕裂的黑色、愤怒的天空组成的地狱荒原。然后，通过大门，大恶魔马尔基兹德出现了。随着一个平稳的步骤，他从他的地狱平面进入了神话室。",
	"A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. {@i Plane shift} and {@i gate} can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the {@i astral projection} spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the Outer Planes.": "一些法术允许直接或间接进入其他存在的位面。{@i Plane shift}和{@i gate}可以直接将冒险者传送到任何其他位面，并有不同程度的精确度。虚空之力（Etherealness）允许冒险者进入虚空界。而{@i astral projection}的法术可以让冒险者将自己投射到星界，并从那里前往外星界。",
	"The plane shift spell has two important limitations. The first is the material component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork must be made of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), but even the act of researching the correct specifications can lead to adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into the depths of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is required to get there.": "平面转移咒语有两个重要的限制。首先是材料部分：一根分叉的小金属棒（像音叉一样）被调整到所需的平面目的地。咒语需要适当的共鸣频率来锁定正确的位置，而且叉子必须由适当的材料（有时是复杂的合金）制成，以正确集中咒语的魔力。制作叉子很贵（至少250金币），但即使是研究正确规格的行为也会导致冒险。毕竟，没有多少人自愿进入卡塞里的深处，所以很少有人知道需要什么样的音叉才能到达那里。",
	"Second, the spell doesn't send the caster to a specific location unless he or she has specialized information. The sigil sequence of a teleportation circle located on another plane allows the caster to travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come by than the specifications of the required tuning fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a planar quest.": "第二，除非施法者有专门的信息，否则这个咒语不会把施法者送到一个特定的地点。位于另一平面的传送圈的符号序列允许施法者直接前往该传送圈，但这种知识比所需音叉的规格更难得到。否则，该咒语会将施法者传送到所需地点附近的一个地方。无论冒险者到达哪里，他们很可能仍然需要进行一次旅行来到达平面探索的目标。",
	"The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific point on another plane of existence. The spell provides a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of the guardians and trials that would normally fill such a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to negate any obstacles that wait at the destination.": "闸门咒语打开了一个与另一个存在平面上的特定点相连的门户。这个法术提供了一条通往一个平面目的地的捷径，绕过了许多通常会充满这种旅程的守护者和考验。但这个9级法术除了最强大的角色外，其他的人都无法企及，而且它对否定在目的地等待的任何障碍毫无作用。",
	"The {@spell gate} spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a portal from opening within its dominion.": "{@spell gate}的咒语很强大，但不是无懈可击的。神灵、恶魔领主或其他强大的实体可以阻止这样的入口在其统治范围内打开。",
	"Halisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn't perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like pieces of string rolled between a child's fingertips. She glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet and all around her.": "哈里斯特拉睁开眼睛，发现自己在一片无尽的银海中漂流。柔和的灰色云朵在远处缓缓移动，而奇怪的黑暗条纹在天空中猛烈地扭动着，固定在她无法感知的遥远的尽头，它们的中间部分愤怒地旋转着，就像在孩子的指尖间滚动的线段。她往下看，想知道是什么支撑着她，除了她脚下和周围更多奇怪的珍珠色天空，她什么也没看到。",
	"She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself mesmerized by the simple act of respiration.": "她突然吸了一口气，对这一景象感到惊讶，并感到她的肺里充满了比空气更甜的东西，也许还有点固体，但她没有被这东西堵住嘴或淹死，而是似乎完全适应了它。当她发现自己被简单的呼吸行为迷住时，一种电流般的快感在她的四肢百骸中奔腾。",
	"The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools—magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, spinning coins.": "星界是思想和梦境的领域，游客在这里作为无实体的灵魂旅行，以到达外星界。它是一个巨大的银色海洋，上下都一样，有白色和灰色的漩涡，在光的微尘中划过，像遥远的星星。星海的大部分地区是一片广阔无垠的空地。游客们偶尔会偶然发现一具死去的神的石化尸体或其他大块的岩石在银色的虚空中永远漂流。更常见的是彩池--神奇的彩光池，像光芒四射、旋转的硬币一样闪烁着。",
	"Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so their children can grow to maturity.": "星界的生物不会衰老，也不会遭受饥饿或干渴。出于这个原因，生活在星界的人类（如吉特安基）在其他星球上建立了前哨站，通常是物质世界，这样他们的孩子就可以成长为成熟的人。",
	"A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature's walking speed (in feet) is equal to 3 × its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will.": "在星界的旅行者可以通过简单的思考移动，但距离没有什么意义。不过在战斗中，一个生物的行走速度（以英尺为单位）等于3×它的智力得分。一个生物越聪明，它就越容易通过意志行为控制自己的移动。",
	"Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the {@spell astral projection} spell involves projecting one's consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream.": "通过{@spell astral projection}法术在星界旅行涉及到将自己的意识投射到那里，通常是为了寻找一个通往外星界的通道来访问。由于外星界既是精神存在的状态，也是物理存在的地方，这允许一个角色在外星界显现，就像他或她在那里实际旅行过一样，但只是在梦中。",
	"A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than seek out a portal or use a more direct spell.": "一个角色的死亡--无论是在星界还是在目的界--都不会造成实际伤害。只有在星界时切断角色的银线（或在物质界上他或她无助的肉体死亡）才会导致角色的真正死亡。因此，高水平的人物有时会通过星界投影的方式前往外部世界，而不是寻找传送门或使用更直接的咒语。",
	"Only a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the most common being a psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the rare portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord.": "只有少数东西可以切断旅行者的银线，最常见的是通灵之风（如下所述）。Githyanki的传奇银剑也有这种能力。一个人物如果身体旅行到星界（通过平面转换法术或直接通往那里的罕见门户之一），就没有银线。",

	"Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses the plane.": "传说中，孩子们被精灵生物绑架并被带到了精灵世界，多年后才回到父母身边，却一天也没变老，也没有关于绑架者和他们所处领域的记忆。同样地，从仙境游历归来的冒险者们常常惊恐地发现，时间在仙境的流动是不同的，而且他们对这次访问的记忆也是模糊的。你可以使用这些可选的规则来反映弥漫在这个平面上的奇怪魔法。",
	"A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's lost memories.": "离开仙境的生物必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎。翡冷翠的生物会自动成功，任何具有翡冷翠血统特征的生物，如精灵，也是如此。救赎失败的生物不会记得它在Feywild度过的时间。如果救赎成功，该生物的记忆将保持完整，但有些模糊不清。任何可以结束诅咒的法术都可以恢复该生物失去的记忆。",
	"While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.": "虽然时间在翡冷翠似乎是正常流逝的，但人物可能在那里呆了一天，在离开飞机时发现多元宇宙的其他地方经过的时间或少或多。",
	"Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A {@spell wish} spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a {@spell geas} spell and complete a quest after the {@spell wish} spell is cast.": "每当一个生物或一群生物在该平面上呆了至少1天后离开仙界，你可以选择一个最适合你的活动的时间变化，如果有的话，或者在仙界时间扭曲表上滚动。一个（%0%）的法术可以用来消除对最多十个生物的影响。一些强大的费伊人有能力实现这样的愿望，如果受益人同意接受{@spell geas}法术并在{@spell wish}法术施放后完成任务，他们可能会这样做。",

	"Riven stood in the uppermost room of the central tower of his citadel-a fortress of shadows and dark stone carved in relief into the sheer face of a jagged peak.... The starless black vault of the plane's sky hung over a landscape of gray and black, where lived the dark simulacra of actual things. Shadows and wraiths and specters and ghosts and other undead hung in the air around the citadel, or prowled the foothills and plains near it, so numerous their glowing eyes looked like swarms of fireflies. He felt the darkness in everything he could see, felt it as an extension of himself, and the feeling made him too big by half.": "瑞文站在他的堡垒中央塔楼的最上层房间里--一座由阴影和黑石组成的堡垒，被浮雕在锯齿状的山峰上....。飞机的无星黑穹笼罩着灰色和黑色的景观，那里生活着实际事物的黑暗模拟。阴影、幽灵、鬼魂和其他亡灵在城堡周围的空气中徘徊，或者在城堡附近的山麓和平原上游荡，它们的发光眼睛看起来就像成群的萤火虫。他感觉到他所看到的一切的黑暗，感觉到它是自己的延伸，而这种感觉使他变得太过庞大。",
	"The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars. The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane.": "阴影地带，也被称为 \"阴影地带\"，是一个由黑色、灰色和白色组成的维度，在这里，其他大部分颜色都已经从一切事物中被剥离。这是一个憎恨光明的黑暗之地，那里的天空是一个既没有太阳也没有星星的黑色穹顶。阴影地带与物质界的重叠方式与精灵世界的重叠方式基本相同。除了无色的地貌，它看起来与物质界相似。",
	"Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped—distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.": "物质世界的地标在暗影星域是可以识别的，但它们是物质世界存在的扭曲和变形的反映。在物质世界中，一座山峰矗立在那里，影子地平线上的相应特征是一个参差不齐的岩石露头，类似于一个头骨，一堆瓦砾，或者可能是一个曾经伟大的城堡的摇摇欲坠的遗址。阴影城的森林是黑暗和扭曲的，它的树枝伸向旅行者的斗篷，它的树根盘绕和弯曲，绊倒那些经过的人。",

	"Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss.": "与 \"飞越 \"相似，\"影子穿越 \"是指物质世界和影子世界之间的面纱非常薄，生物可以从一个世界走到另一个世界的地方。尘土飞扬的墓室角落里的一抹阴影可能是一个阴影交叉点，就像一个开放的坟墓一样。影子交叉点在阴暗的地方形成，那里有灵魂或死亡的臭味萦绕，比如战场、墓地和坟墓。它们只在黑暗中显现，一旦感受到光的亲吻就会关闭。",
	"In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the Dark Powers created these domains as prisons these \"darklords,\" and through cruelty or carelessness trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well.": "在Shadowfell的偏远角落，很容易到达由可怕的邪恶的诅咒生物所统治的恐怖半平面。其中最著名的是巴罗维亚山谷，它被雷文洛夫特城堡高耸的塔尖所俯瞰，由第一个吸血鬼斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇伯爵统治。被称为 \"黑暗势力 \"的阴影地带的生物创造了这些领域，作为 \"黑暗领主 \"的监狱，并通过残忍或粗心将无辜的凡人也困在这些领域。",

	"If a character is already suffering a despair effect and fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that character.": "如果一个角色已经受到了绝望的影响，并且拯救动作失败，那么新的绝望效果就会取代旧的效果。在完成长时间的休息后，一个角色可以尝试用DC15智慧救赎来克服绝望。(DC比较高，因为一旦绝望占据上风，就很难摆脱它。) 拯救成功后，该角色的绝望效果结束。",

	"The city of Neverwinter in the world of the Forgotten Realms has a dark reflection on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to the skin.": "在《被遗忘的王国》世界中的永夜城对影子城有一个黑暗的反映：永夜城。永夜城是一座由破裂的石头建筑和腐烂的木头房屋组成的城市。它的道路大部分是由被踩踏的墓穴尘土构成的，少数鹅卵石铺成的街道缺少足够的石头，以至于看起来有麻点。天空是尸灰色的，微风吹来，寒冷而潮湿，给皮肤带来寒意。",

Here and there within the {@b Swamp of Oblivion} (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink down into it.": "水界和土界之间的边界地区是一片可怕的沼泽地，在那里，扭曲的参天大树和茂密的刺鼻藤蔓从浓密的淤泥和粘液中生长出来。在{@b Swamp of Oblivion}(也被称为渗水平面)内的各个地方，停滞的湖泊和池塘里长满了杂草丛和可怕的蚊子群。这里为数不多的定居点由悬挂在淤泥上的木质结构组成。大多数是建在树木之间的平台上，但也有一些是建在深入淤泥的高跷上。沼泽的泥土下没有坚实的土地，所以建在杆子上的房子最终会沉入泥土中。",
	"It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century.

At its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame of desire.": "火代表活力、激情和变化。在最坏的情况下，它是残酷和肆意破坏的，就像伊夫里特人经常做的那样，但在最好的情况下，火反映了灵感的光芒、同情心的温暖和欲望的火焰。",
	"A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the darker hours.": "一个炽热的太阳悬挂在火平面上方金色天空的天顶上，以24小时为周期不断升温和减弱。它的范围从中午的白热到午夜的深红，所以火界最黑暗的时间显示出深红色的黄昏。中午时分，光线几乎刺眼。黄铜城（见下文）的大部分业务都是在较暗的时段进行的。",

	"The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see \"Extreme Heat\" in chapter 5, \"Adventure Environments\").

If it's possible to buy magic items at all, the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any item for sale, though the price might well be more than gold.

	"The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given time, it can erode all in its path.": "水的本性是流动，不像疾风或跳跃的火焰，而是平稳的、稳定的。它是潮汐的节奏，是生命的甘露，是哀伤的苦泪，是同情和治愈的香膏。只要有时间，它就能侵蚀其路径上的一切。",

	"Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elves born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they look and behave like normal elves.": "Arborea是许多精灵和精灵神灵的家园。在这个平面上出生的精灵具有天人合一的类型，内心狂野，随时准备与邪恶战斗。除此之外，他们的外表和行为都与普通精灵一样。",
	"Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A {@i dispel evil and good} spell removes this effect from the creature.": "记录访客在Arborea上花费的天数。当来访者离开时，它必须对DC值为5的 \"魅力 \"进行拯救，在飞机上每呆一天加1。如果拯救失败，该生物就会受到渴望返回Arborea的折磨。只要效果持续，该生物就会在能力检查中处于劣势。在每次长期休息结束时，该生物可以重复拯救动作，如果成功则结束该效果。一个{@i dispel evil and good}的法术会从该生物身上移除这个效果。",
	"Ysgard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep fjords, and windswept battlefields, with summers that are long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold and unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of volcanic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous as to hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to test their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also against giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that thunder across Ysgard's vast terrain.": "Ysgard是一个崎岖不平的王国，有高耸的山脉、深邃的峡湾和风吹日晒的战场，夏天漫长而炎热，冬天则是邪恶的寒冷和无情的。它的大陆漂浮在火山岩的海洋之上，下面是巨大的冰冷洞穴，可以容纳整个巨人、人类、矮人、侏儒和其他生物的王国。英雄们来到Ysgard，不仅是为了测试他们的能力，也是为了对抗巨人、龙和其他在Ysgard的广阔地形上打雷的可怕生物。",
	"Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.": "Ysgard是被杀的英雄们的家园，他们在荣耀的战场上展开永恒的战斗。任何生物，除了构筑物或亡灵之外，如果在Ysgard上被攻击或咒语杀死，都会在第二天的黎明恢复生命。该生物的所有命中率都得到了恢复，而且它在死前遭受的所有状况和痛苦都被消除。",
	"Limbo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of impermanent matter and energy. Stone melts into water that freezes into metal, then turns into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes-bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a nightmarish riot.": "Limbo是一个纯粹的混沌平面，是由无常的物质和能量组成的沸腾汤。石头融化成水，水冻结成金属，然后变成钻石，钻石燃烧起来变成烟，变成雪，在一个无尽的、不可预测的变化过程中不断地变化。更为普通的景观碎片--森林、草地、废墟城堡，甚至潺潺的溪流--在无序中飘荡。整个平面是一场噩梦般的骚乱。",
	"Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float in place. A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired direction of travel.": "Limbo没有重力，所以访问这个平面的生物会漂浮在原地。一个生物可以在任何方向上以其行走速度移动，只需想到想要的旅行方向。",
	"Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own invention within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for years. A simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less than a minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire monasteries with their minds.": "Limbo符合居住在其中的生物的意愿。非常有纪律和强大的头脑可以在这个平面内创造出他们自己发明的整个岛屿，有时可以将这些地方维持多年。然而，像鱼这样头脑简单的生物，在它周围的水袋冻结、消失或变成玻璃之前，可能只有不到一分钟的时间。斯拉迪人生活在这里，在这种混乱中游泳，什么也不创造，而吉斯泽拉僧侣则用他们的思想建造整个寺院。",
	"As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.": "作为一个动作，在Limbo上的生物可以做一个智力测验，在精神上移动一个它能看到的30英尺范围内的平面物体。判定值取决于物体的大小。小的DC为5，小的DC为10，中的DC为15，大的DC为20，巨大或更大的DC为25。检验成功后，该生物会将物体移动5英尺，每超过DC一点就会增加1英尺。",
	"A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.": "一个生物也可以用一个行动来进行智力测验，以改变一个没有被穿戴或携带的非魔法物品。同样的距离规则也适用，DC是基于物体的大小。微型的DC为10，小型的DC为15，中型的DC为20，大型或更大的DC为25。如果成功，该生物会将该物体变成另一个相同大小的非生物形态，例如将一块巨石变成一个火球。",
	"Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.": "最后，一个生物可以使用一个动作来进行智力测验，以稳定以该生物为中心的球形区域。判定值取决于球体的半径。对于一个10英尺半径的球体来说，基础DC是5；半径每增加10英尺，DC就增加5。如果检定成功，该生物可以在24小时内防止该区域被飞机改变，或者直到该生物再次使用这个能力。",
	"Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment.": "潘德蒙是一个疯狂的平面，是一个巨大的岩石群，上面布满了由呼啸的风雕刻的隧道。这里寒冷、嘈杂、黑暗，没有自然光。风会迅速熄灭非魔法性的明火，如火把和营火。它还使对话只能通过大喊大叫来实现，即使如此也只能在10英尺的范围内进行。生物在任何依赖听觉的能力检查中都处于劣势。这个星球上的大多数居民都是被放逐到这个星球上的生物，他们中的许多人已经被连绵不绝的风逼疯了，或者被迫躲在风势减弱的地方，直到他们听起来像遥远的折磨的哭声。",
	"A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}. A creature that reaches six levels of {@condition exhaustion} while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \"Running the Game.\" Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's {@condition exhaustion} level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.": "在呼啸的风中每过一小时，来访者必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物将获得一个（%0%）的等级。在这个平面上达到六级（%1%）的生物并不会死亡。相反，该生物会获得一种随机形式的无限期疯狂，如第8章 \"运行游戏 \"中所述。完成长时间的休息并不会降低生物的（%2%）等级，除非该生物能够以某种方式逃离疯狂的风。",
	"The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms.": "深渊体现了所有反常的、可怕的和混乱的东西。它几乎无穷无尽的层次螺旋式下降，形成更多骇人的形式。",
	"Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corroded state.": "深渊的每一层都拥有自己可怕的环境。虽然没有两层是相同的，但它们都是严酷和荒凉的。每一层也反映了深渊的熵的性质。事实上，人们在飞机上看到或接触到的大部分东西似乎都处于腐烂、崩溃或腐蚀的状态。",
	"A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.": "在深渊中完成长期休息的非邪恶访客必须做一个DC 10的魅力拯救动作。如果失败，该生物会被腐蚀。参照深渊腐蚀表来决定这种腐蚀的效果。你可以用你自己创造的不同的腐蚀效果来代替。",

A dispel evil and good spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.": "在完成长期休息后，被腐蚀的生物可以做一个DC 15的魅力救赎动作。拯救成功后，腐蚀效果结束。驱散邪恶和善良的咒语或任何可以消除诅咒的魔法也会结束这个效果。",
	"If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within {@dice 1d4+2} days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell on the creature restores its original alignment.": "如果被腐化的生物在{@dice 1d4+2}天内没有离开这个星球，它的方向会变成混乱的邪恶。对该生物施展{@spell dispel evil and good}的法术，可以恢复其原来的排列。",
	"{@bold Treachery.} The character gains the following flaw: \"I can only achieve my goals by making sure that my companions don't achieve theirs.\"": "{@bold Treachery.} 该人物获得以下缺陷：\"我只有通过确保我的同伴不能实现他们的目标，才能实现我的目标。\"",

	"Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without descending into madness.": "德摩根在深渊中的一层是一个巨大的野蛮和疯狂的荒野，被称为 \"大嘴\"，在那里，即使是强大的恶魔也会因为恐惧而发疯。反映了德摩根的双重本性，大嘴由一个巨大的原始大陆组成，覆盖着茂密的丛林，周围是看似无尽的海洋和盐水滩。恶魔王子从两座蛇形塔中统治他的层级，这两座塔从浑浊的海中浮现出来。每座塔的顶部都有一个巨大的带獠牙的头骨。这些尖塔构成了阿比斯姆的堡垒，很少有生物能在这里冒险而不陷入疯狂。",
	"If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.": "如果奥库斯得逞，所有的星球都会像他的死界塔纳托斯一样，所有的生物都会在他的控制下成为亡灵。在黑色的天空下，塔纳托斯是一片荒凉的山脉、贫瘠的荒野、破败的城市和扭曲的黑色树木的森林。坟墓、陵墓、墓碑和石棺遍布整个景观。亡灵蜂拥而至，从它们的墓穴和坟墓中冲出来，撕碎任何愚蠢到在这里旅行的生物。奥克斯（Orcus）在一个被称为 \"Everlost \"的巨大宫殿中统治着塔纳托斯，该宫殿由黑曜石和骨头制成。这座宫殿坐落在一片被称为 \"遗忘的尽头 \"的荒原上，周围是挖在狭窄山谷的陡峭斜坡上的坟墓和埋葬地，形成了一个层层叠叠的尸骨城。",
	"Lolth's layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.": "Lolth层是一个巨大的网络，由厚厚的、神奇的网状物组成，形成通道和茧状的房间。在整个网络中，建筑、结构、船只和其他物体就像被蜘蛛的圈套套住一样。洛尔思之网的性质在整个位面创造了随机的门户，将这些物体从半位面和物质位面的世界中吸引过来，这些都是蜘蛛女王的计划。洛尔思的仆人们还在网中建造了地牢，将洛尔思讨厌的敌人困在纵横交错的网状石头走廊中并加以猎杀。",

By Graz'zt's command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity.

	"The layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms-places without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with an ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls that are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or the fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes.

Planar travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a piece of every deal through special provisions that are added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells.": "第二层的名字来自于它目前的领主，迪斯派特。这位大公是个操纵者和欺骗者，他是个魔鬼般的帅哥，只有小角、尾巴和左蹄能将他与人类区分开来。他的深红色宝座矗立在迪斯铁城的中心，这是一个狰狞的大都市，是九层地狱中最大的城市。行星旅行者来到这里与魔鬼密谋，并与夜叉、拉克萨斯、妖精、琥珀和其他恶魔达成交易。迪斯派特通过在他的九层地狱上签订的合同中加入特殊条款，从每笔交易中分得一杯羹。",
	"Dispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil schemes in the Material Plane.": "迪斯派特是阿斯莫德最忠诚、最机智的附庸之一，多元宇宙中很少有生命能超越他。他比大多数魔鬼更痴迷于与凡人达成交易以换取他们的灵魂，他的使者不知疲倦地在物质世界中促进邪恶的计划。",
	"The third layer of the Nine Hells is a stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great city of Minauros for which the layer is named.": "九层地狱的第三层是一个臭气熏天的沼泽。酸性雨水从这一层的棕色天空中溢出，厚厚的浮渣覆盖着腐烂的表面，阴暗处的大坑等待着吞噬不小心的流浪者。独眼巨人的城市从沼泽中升起，包括米瑙罗斯的大城市，该层也因此而得名。",
	"The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is one of the few archdevils who will trade favors for gold instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him in a deal.": "粘稠的城墙耸立在数百英尺高的空中，保护着被淹没的玛门大厅。米瑙罗斯的大公像一条巨大的蛇，上身和头部是一个没有毛发的有角的人形。玛门的贪婪是个传奇，他是少数几个会用黄金而不是灵魂来换取恩惠的大恶魔之一。他的巢穴里堆满了那些试图在交易中胜过他的人留下的财宝，但都失败了。",
	"Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted center piece of a gigantic, hellish fountain.": "第四层的菲勒盖索斯（Phlegethos）是一片火热的土地，熔化的岩浆海酝酿着热风、窒息的烟雾和火成灰的飓风。在菲勒盖索斯最大的火山的充满火焰的破火山口内，耸立着阿普里莫赫，一座由黑曜石和黑玻璃铸造的堡垒城市。熔化的熔岩河从外墙倾泻而下，这座城市就像一个巨大的、地狱般的喷泉的中心雕塑。",
	"Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter. Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the blackest heart in the Nine Hells. The alliance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their mutual survival hinges on it.": "阿布里莫克是两个大恶魔的权力所在地，他们共同统治着弗莱盖索斯。贝利亚大公和贝利亚的女儿菲尔娜大公。贝利亚是一个英俊的、身材强壮的魔鬼，他散发着文明的气息，即使他的话语中带有威胁的暗流。他的女儿是一个雕塑般的魔鬼，她的美貌包裹着九层地狱中最黑暗的心。贝利亚和菲尔纳的联盟是牢不可破的，因为他们都知道他们的共同生存取决于此。",
	"The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea surrounds the layer, and its gloomy sky crackles with lightning.": "九层地狱的第五层是一个冰冷的境界，里面燃烧着寒冷的火焰。一片冰冻的海洋围绕着这一层，阴暗的天空中闪烁着闪电。",
	"Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. He rules this layer all the same, communicating telepathically with his followers and servants, both in the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.": "莱维斯托斯大公曾经背叛了阿斯莫德，现在被包裹在冥府的冰层深处作为惩罚。他同样统治着这一层，与他的追随者和仆人进行心灵感应，无论是在九层地狱还是在物质位面。",
	"Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose.": "斯蒂吉亚也是其前任统治者的所在地，蛇形大魔鬼吉里昂，他被阿斯莫德解雇，以便让被囚禁的莱维斯特斯重新获得统治权。格里昂的堕落在地狱法庭内引发了许多辩论。没有人确定阿斯莫德是否有一些秘密的原因来解雇大恶魔，或者他是否为了某些更大的目的而测试格瑞恩的忠诚度。",
	"Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves carved into the mountainside.": "Malbolge，第六层，已经超过了许多统治者，其中包括女巫Malagard和大恶魔Moloch。马拉加德失宠了，被阿斯莫德一怒之下打倒了，而她的前任，摩洛赫，仍然作为一个小恶魔徘徊在第六层的某个地方，谋求重新获得阿斯莫德的青睐。Malbolge是一个似乎没有尽头的斜坡，就像一座不可能的大山的两侧。该层的一部分不时地断裂，形成致命的、震耳欲聋的石头雪崩。马尔博格的居民生活在摇摇欲坠的堡垒和刻在山腰的巨大洞穴中。",
	"Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and torments those who displease her.": "马尔博格的现任大公夫人是阿斯莫德的女儿，格拉西亚。她的小角、皮质的翅膀和分叉的尾巴类似于一个肉体。她从父亲那里继承了她的残忍和对黑暗计划的热爱。作为她在马尔博格山坡上的住所的城堡是由破裂的柱子和扶壁支撑的，这些柱子和扶壁很结实，但似乎处于崩溃的边缘。宫殿下面是一个迷宫，两边都是牢房和刑讯室，格拉西亚在那里禁锢和折磨那些令她不满的人。",
	"The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.": "第七层，马拉多米尼，是被废墟覆盖的荒地。死亡的城市形成了荒凉的城市景观，在它们之间有空旷的采石场、摇摇欲坠的道路、矿渣堆、空荡荡的堡垒空壳，以及成群的饥饿苍蝇。",
	"The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some suspect that the Archduke of Nessus still respects the worthiness of this fallen adversary.": "马拉多米尼的大公是巴勒泽布尔，苍蝇之主。巴尔泽布尔是一个臃肿的恶魔，下半身像一只巨大的鼻涕虫，他的形态是阿斯莫德施加给他的，作为对其忠诚度动摇的惩罚。巴尔泽布尔是一个悲惨而堕落的怪物，他长期以来一直在密谋篡夺阿斯莫德，但每次都失败了。他带着一个诅咒，导致任何与他达成的交易都会导致灾难的发生。阿斯莫德偶尔会因为其他大公无法理解的原因而对巴尔泽布尔示好，尽管有人怀疑内瑟斯大公仍然尊重这个堕落的对手的价值。",
	"Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.": "卡尼亚是九层地狱的第八层，是一个冰冷的地狱景象，其冰雪风暴可以撕裂肉体和骨头。嵌入冰层的城市为卡尼亚的统治者--聪明而狡猾的大魔鬼梅菲斯特--的客人和囚犯提供庇护。",
	"Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy and ally, and the Archduke of Nessus appears to trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered.": "梅菲斯特居住在梅菲斯特的冰雪城堡中，他在那里策划着夺取巴托尔王座并征服各个星球。他是阿斯莫德最大的敌人和盟友，内瑟斯大公似乎相信梅菲斯特提供的建议。",
	"Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so both wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship.": "梅菲斯特知道，除非他的对手出现严重的误判，否则他不可能废黜阿斯莫德，因此两人都在等待，看什么情况下会让他们彼此反目。梅菲斯特也是格拉西亚的某种教父，使双方的关系更加复杂。",
	"Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as do other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any creatures not worthy of his personal attention. His instincts are as razor sharp as Cania's frigid winds, and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever deceived or thwarted him.": "梅菲斯特是一个高大醒目的魔鬼，有着令人印象深刻的犄角和冷酷的举止。他和其他大恶魔一样，从事灵魂交易，但他很少把时间给任何不值得他亲自关注的生物。他的直觉就像卡尼亚的寒风一样锐利，据说只有阿斯莫德曾经欺骗或挫败过他。",
	"The lowest layer of the Nine Hells, Nessus is a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison their diabolical legions and plot the conquest of the multiverse. At the center of the layer stands a vast rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his infernal court.": "内苏斯是九层地狱的最底层，是一个由黑暗坑道组成的领域，其墙壁上设置有堡垒。在那里，忠于阿斯莫德的坑魔将军们驻扎着他们邪恶的军团，策划着对多元宇宙的征服。在这一层的中心，矗立着一个未知深度的巨大裂缝，从那里升起了伟大的玛尔希姆城堡--阿斯莫德和他的地狱法庭的家。",
	"Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors.": "马尔希姆类似于一个巨大的中空石笋。这座城堡也是阿斯莫德锁住的灵魂的监狱，用于保存。说服他释放这些灵魂，哪怕是一个，也要付出高昂的代价，据传内瑟斯大公过去曾因为这样的恩惠而要求整个王国。",
	"Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage.": "阿斯莫德最常出现的样子是一个英俊的、有胡子的人形，额头上有小角突出，有一双刺眼的红眼睛，穿着流动的长袍。他也可以化身为其他形式，而且很少看到他不拿着红宝石尖的权杖。阿斯莫德是最狡猾和最有修养的大恶魔。他所代表的终极邪恶只有在他愿意的情况下才能看到，或者当他忘记了自己并陷入愤怒的时候。",
	"Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, and legions assembled by other warmongering gods.": "Acheron有四层，每层都由漂浮在空气中的巨大铁立方体组成。有时这些立方体会发生碰撞。过去碰撞的回声在整个平面上徘徊，与军队碰撞的声音混合在一起。这就是阿克伦的本质：纷争和战争，因为阵亡士兵的灵魂加入到无休止的战斗中，与致力于格鲁姆什的兽人、忠于马格鲁比耶的地精以及其他好战的神灵组建的军团对抗。",
	"Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points.": "Acheron奖励一个伤害其他生物的生物，给该生物灌输继续战斗的力量。在Acheron上，当一个生物将一个敌对的生物降低到0点命中率时，它就会获得相当于其最大命中率一半的临时命中率。",
	"On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all interlocked and turning according to their measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on those who spend time here.": "在麦金努斯，法律体现在一个由钟表齿轮组成的领域，所有的齿轮都是环环相扣，按照它们的尺度转动。这些齿轮似乎都在进行着巨大的计算，以至于没有任何神灵能够理解其目的。麦格努斯体现了绝对的秩序，在这里呆过的人都能感受到它的影响。",
	"Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a godlike being called Primus.": "莫德隆是麦哲诺斯的主要居民。这个星球也是摩德隆人的创造者的家：一个被称为普利姆斯的神一样的存在。",
	"While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals {@dice 1d10+5} damage always deals 10 damage on Mechanus.": "在Mechanus上，生物总是使用攻击和法术的平均伤害结果。例如，通常造成{@dice 1d10+5}伤害的攻击在机械体上总是造成10伤害。",
	"At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.": "在这个平面上的每次长休结束时，非合法中立的访客必须做一个DC 10的智慧救赎动作。拯救失败后，该生物的排列组合将变为合法的中性。在麦格纳斯以外的位面呆上一天后，该生物的排列方式会恢复正常。对该生物施展驱除邪恶和善的法术也会恢复其原来的排列。",
	"Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing intrudes on harmony.": "阿卡迪亚欣欣向荣，果园里的树木整齐划一，溪流笔直，田地井然有序，道路完美无缺，城市也以几何学上的悦目形状布局。山脉没有被侵蚀的痕迹。阿卡迪亚的一切都朝着共同的利益和无缺陷的存在形式而努力。在这里，纯洁是永恒的，没有什么能侵入和谐。",
	"Night and day are determined by an orb that floats above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night across the entire plane.": "白天和黑夜是由漂浮在阿卡迪亚最高峰上的一个球体决定的。球体的一半散发着阳光，带来了白天；另一半散发着月光，带来了星夜。球体不停地均匀旋转，将白天和黑夜散布在整个平面上。",
	"The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of weather that king or queen controls.": "阿卡迪亚的天气由四个结盟的半神管理，称为风暴之王：云王、风后、闪电王和雨后。每个人都住在一个城堡里，周围都是该国王或女王控制的天气类型。",
	"Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane have the celestial type and are always brave and kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like normal dwarves.": "在阿卡迪亚美丽的山脉下隐藏着无数的矮人王国，它们经受住了千年的考验。在这个平面上出生的矮人具有天人合一的类型，他们总是勇敢而心地善良，但除此之外，他们的外表和行为都与普通矮人一样。",
	"While on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison.": "在这个平面上，生物不能被惊吓或毒害，他们对疾病和毒药免疫。",
	"A variety of realms exist between or beyond the other planes.": "在其他星球之间或之外存在着各种境界。",
	"The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. It is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical balance-simultaneously concordant and in opposition. The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, and shallow rivers.": "外域是介于外层平面之间的平面。它是一个中立的位面，包含了所有事物的一部分，并将所有方面保持在一个矛盾的平衡中--同时是和谐的，也是对立的。该位面拥有不同的地形，有草原、山脉和浅水河流。",
	"The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, since the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.": "外域是圆形的，像一个大圆盘。事实上，那些将外域星球设想为一个轮子的人指出外域作为证据，称它是各星球的一个缩影。这种说法可能是循环的，因为外域的安排首先激发了大轮子的想法。",
	"Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while sharing a fine bottle of wine.": "在圆环的外缘，均匀分布着门镇：16个定居点，每个都围绕着通往外星的一个门户而建。每个城镇都有其门户所在位面的许多特征。平面使者经常在这些城镇相遇，所以看到奇怪的配对并不罕见，比如一个天人和一个恶魔在酒馆里争论，同时分享一瓶好酒。",
	"Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed campaign can be set there without the need for planar travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes come to being like a world on the Material Plane.": "鉴于你可以在外域骑着马从天堂到地狱，一个以平面为主题的活动可以在那里进行，而不需要进行平面旅行。外域是外行星中最接近物质界的世界的地方。",

	"At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that rises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad structures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve up over their heads and-most disconcerting of all-the far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.": "在外域的中心，就像一个大轮子的轴，是尖塔--一座高耸入云的针形山。在这座山的狭长山峰之上，漂浮着环形城市西格尔，其无数的建筑都建在环形的内缘。站在Sigil街道上的生物可以看到城市在他们头顶上的曲线，最令人不安的是，城市的远方就在头顶。这座繁华的平面大都市被称为 \"门之城\"，拥有无数通往其他平面和世界的门户。",
	"Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and information come here from across the planes. The city sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, particularly the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all kinds are bought and sold here.": "西格尔是一个商人的天堂。货物、商品和信息从各个位面来到这里。这座城市维持着关于各位面信息的活跃交易，尤其是特定传送门操作所需的命令语或物品。各种各样的传送门钥匙在这里被买卖。",
	"The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if they do, they aren't telling.": "这座城市是高深莫测的痛苦女士的领地，她和众神一样古老，其目的甚至连她的城市的圣人都不知道。Sigil是她的监狱吗？她是多元宇宙的堕落创造者吗？没有人知道。或者，如果他们知道，他们也不会说。",
	"Demiplanes are extra dimensional spaces that come into being by a variety of means and boast their own physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.": "半位面是通过各种方式产生的超维空间，拥有自己的物理规律。有些是通过法术创造的。其他的则是自然存在的，就像从多元宇宙的其他部分捏出来的现实的褶皱。理论上，平面转换法术可以将旅行者带到一个半位面，但音叉所需的适当频率是非常难以获得的。假设施法者知道半位面的情况，大门法术就比较可靠。",
	"A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, a {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion} spell creates a demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.": "一个半位面可以小到一个房间，也可以大到包含整个王国。例如，一个{@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}的法术创造了一个由门厅和多个相邻房间组成的半位面，而巴罗维亚的土地（在Ravenloft的设定中）完全存在于一个半位面中，由其吸血鬼领主Strahd von Zarovich支配。当一个半位面与物质世界或其他位面相连时，进入它就像穿过一个传送门或穿过一堵雾墙那么简单。",
	"The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.": "远界是在已知的多元宇宙之外。事实上，它可能是一个完全独立的宇宙，有自己的物理和魔法规律。当来自远界的游离能量泄漏到另一个位面时，物质就会被扭曲成异样的形状，违背了可理解的几何学和生物学原理。畸形人，如噬心者和持心者，要么来自这个位面，要么被其奇怪的影响所塑造。",
	"The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles, and horror.": "居住在远界本身的实体太过陌生，正常人的心智无法毫无压力地接受。泰坦尼克号的生物在那里的虚无中游动，难以启齿的东西向那些敢于倾听的人低声诉说可怕的真相。对于凡人来说，对远方世界的了解是一场克服物质、空间和理智界限的思想斗争。一些术士通过与那里的实体结成契约来拥抱这种斗争。任何见过远界的人都会嘀咕眼睛、触手和恐怖。",
	"The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal's location-even its home world-is long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic that mutates the area around them.": "远界没有众所周知的传送门，或者至少没有仍然可行的。古老的精灵曾经在一座名为火暴峰的山中打开了通往远界的巨大传送门，但他们的文明在血腥的恐怖中瓦解了，传送门的位置--甚至它的母体世界--也早已被遗忘。失落的传送门可能仍然存在，被一种外星魔法标记，使其周围的区域发生变异。",

An evil demigod, Iuz, rules a nightmarish realm in the north, threatening all civilization.": "在{@b Oerth}（灰鹰设定的剑与魔法世界）上，像比格比和莫登凯恩这样的英雄是被贪婪或野心所驱使。被称为弗拉纳斯的地区的中心是灰鹰的自由城，一个充满了恶棍和大法师的城市，充满了冒险。一个邪恶的半神，伊兹，在北方统治着一个噩梦般的领域，威胁着所有文明。",
	"On {@b Krynn} (the epic-fantasy world of the Dragonlance setting), the return of the gods is overshadowed by the rise of the evil dragon queen Takhisis and her dragons and dragon armies, which plunge the continent of Ansalon into war.": "在{@b Krynn}（《龙之谷》设定的史诗奇幻世界），诸神的回归被邪恶的龙后塔克西丝和她的龙及龙族军队的崛起所掩盖，使安萨隆大陆陷入战争。",
	"On {@b Athas} (the sword-and-sorcery world of the Dark Sun setting), a drop of water can be worth more than a human life. The gods have abandoned this desert world, where powerful sorcerer-kings rule as tyrants, and metal is a scarce and precious commodity.": "在{@b Athas}（黑暗太阳背景下的剑与魔法世界），一滴水的价值可能超过一条人命。诸神已经抛弃了这个沙漠世界，强大的巫师国王作为暴君统治着这里，金属是一种稀缺的珍贵商品。",
	"On {@b Eberron} (the heroic-fantasy world of the Eberron setting), a terrible war has ended, giving rise to a cold war fueled by political intrigue. On the continent of Khorvaire, magic is commonplace, dragonmarked houses rival kingdoms in power, and elemental vehicles make travel to the far corners of the world possible.": "在{@b Eberron}（Eberron设定的英雄幻想世界），一场可怕的战争已经结束，产生了一场由政治阴谋推动的冷战。在Khorvaire大陆上，魔法是很普遍的，有龙纹的房子在力量上与王国相抗衡，元素交通工具使旅行到世界的遥远角落成为可能。",
	"On {@b Aebrynis} (the heroic-fantasy world of the Birthright setting), scions born from divine bloodlines carve up the continent of Cerilia. Monarchs, prelates, guildmasters, and great wizards balance the demands of rulership against the threat of horrible abominations born from the blood of an evil god.": "在{@b Aebrynis}（《生而为人》设定的英雄幻想世界），由神圣血统诞生的子孙们瓜分了塞里利亚大陆。君主、牧师、公会会长和伟大的巫师们在统治的要求与邪恶之神的血统所产生的可怕憎恶的威胁之间取得平衡。",
	"On {@b Mystara} (a heroic-fantasy world born out of the earliest editions of the D&D game), diverse cultures, savage monsters, and warring empires collide. The world is further shaped by the meddling of the Immortals-former adventurers raised to nearly divine status.": "在{@b Mystara}（一个诞生于D&D游戏最早版本的英雄幻想世界），不同的文化、野蛮的怪物和交战的帝国相互碰撞。这个世界被不朽者的干涉进一步塑造，不朽者是被提升到近乎神的地位的前冒险者。",
	"Creating adventures is one of the greatest rewards of being a Dungeon Master. It's a way to express yourself, designing fantastic locations and encounters with monsters, traps, puzzles, and conflicts. When you design an adventure, you call the shots. You do things exactly the way you want to.": "创造冒险是作为地下城管理员的最大奖励之一。它是一种表达自己的方式，设计奇妙的地点和怪物、陷阱、谜题和冲突的遭遇。当你设计一个冒险时，你可以发号施令。你完全按照你想要的方式来做事情。",
	"Fundamentally, adventures are stories. An adventure shares many of the features of a novel, a movie, an issue of a comic, or an episode of a TV show. Comic series and serialized TV dramas are particularly good comparisons, because of the way individual adventures are limited in scope but blend together to create a larger narrative. If an adventure is a single issue or episode, a campaign is the series as a whole.": "从根本上说，冒险是故事。一个冒险故事与一部小说、一部电影、一期漫画或一集电视节目有许多共同的特点。漫画系列和连续剧是特别好的比较，因为单个冒险的范围是有限的，但融合在一起创造一个更大的叙事。如果说冒险是一个单独的问题或情节，那么活动就是整个系列。",
	"Whether you're creating your own adventures or using published adventures, you'll find advice in this chapter to help you create a fun and memorable experience for your players.": "无论你是创建自己的冒险还是使用已出版的冒险，你都会在本章中找到建议，帮助你为你的玩家创造一个有趣和难忘的经验。",
	"Creating an adventure involves blending scenes of exploration, social interaction, and combat into a unified whole that meets the needs of your players and your campaign. But it's more than that. The basic elements of good storytelling should guide you throughout this process, so your players experience the adventure as a story and not a disjointed series of encounters.": "创造一个冒险涉及到将探索、社会互动和战斗的场景融合成一个统一的整体，以满足玩家和活动的需要。但它不仅仅是这样。在这个过程中，好的讲故事的基本要素应该指导你，这样你的玩家就会把冒险当作一个故事来体验，而不是一系列不连贯的遭遇战。",
	"The best adventures have several things in common.": "最好的冒险有几个共同点。",
	"An adventure needs a threat worthy of the heroes' attention. The threat might be a single villain or monster, a villain with lackeys, an assortment of monsters, or an evil organization. Whatever their nature, the antagonists should have goals that the heroes can uncover and thwart.": "一个冒险需要一个值得英雄们注意的威胁。这个威胁可能是一个单一的恶棍或怪物，一个有走狗的恶棍，一个各种各样的怪物，或者一个邪恶组织。无论他们的性质如何，敌对者应该有英雄们可以发现和挫败的目标。",
	"It might seem stereotypical to build an adventure around dragons, orcs, and insane wizards in towers, but these are staples of fantasy storytelling. It might also seem trite to begin an adventure in a tavern, but that's an idea that remains true to D&D. Familiar story elements are fine, as long as you and the players occasionally put a spin on them. For example, the mysterious figure who presents adventurers with a quest on behalf of the king might be the king in disguise. The crazy wizard in the tower might be a projected illusion created by a band of greedy gnome thieves to guard their loot.": "围绕龙、兽人和塔中的疯狂巫师展开冒险可能显得有些刻板，但这些都是奇幻故事的主干内容。在小酒馆里开始冒险也可能显得老套，但这是忠实于D&D的一个想法。熟悉的故事元素是可以的，只要你和玩家偶尔给它们加点料。例如，代表国王向冒险者提出任务的神秘人物可能是伪装成国王的人。塔里的疯狂巫师可能是一群贪婪的地精小偷为了保护他们的战利品而制造的投影幻象。",
	"An adventure is about the here and now. A little bit of history might be needed to set the story in motion, and the adventurers might discover interesting lore of the past in the course of the adventure. In general, let the world's history be evident in the present situation. Instead of dealing with what happened in the past, an adventure should focus on describing the present situation, what the bad guys are up to, and how the adventurers become involved in the story.": "冒险是关于此时此刻的。可能需要一点历史来启动故事，冒险者可能会在冒险的过程中发现过去的有趣传说。一般来说，让世界的历史在现在的情况下显露出来。与其处理过去发生的事情，冒险应该着重描述现在的情况，坏人在做什么，以及冒险者如何参与到故事中。",
	"An adventure should allow the adventurers' actions and decisions to matter. Though it might resemble a novel or a TV episode, an adventure needs to allow for more than one outcome. Otherwise, players can feel as if they've been railroaded-set onto a course that has only one destination, no matter how hard they try to change it. For example, if a major villain shows up before the end of the adventure, the adventure should allow for the possibility that the heroes might defeat that villain.": "冒险应该让冒险者的行动和决定变得重要。虽然它可能类似于小说或电视情节，但冒险需要允许有不止一个结果。否则，玩家就会觉得他们好像被安排在一条只有一个目的地的路线上，无论他们如何努力改变它。例如，如果一个大反派在冒险结束前出现，冒险应该允许英雄们有可能打败这个反派。",
	"As outlined in the book's introduction, players come to the gaming table with different expectations. An adventure needs to account for the different players and characters in your group, drawing them into the story as effectively as possible.": "正如本书介绍中所述，玩家带着不同的期望来到游戏桌前。一场冒险需要考虑到你的团队中不同的玩家和角色，尽可能有效地把他们吸引到故事中。",
	"As a starting point, think about your adventure in terms of the three basic types of activity in the game: exploration, social interaction, and combat. If your adventure includes a balance of all three, it's likely to appeal to all types of players.": "作为一个起点，从游戏中的三种基本活动类型来考虑你的冒险：探索、社会互动和战斗。如果你的冒险包括这三种活动的平衡，它就有可能吸引所有类型的玩家。",
	"An adventure you create for your home campaign doesn't have to appeal to every abstract player type—only to the players sitting down at your own table. If you don't have any players who like fighting above all else, then don't feel you have to provide a maximum amount of combat to keep the adventure moving.": "你为你的家庭活动创造的冒险不一定要吸引每一个抽象的玩家类型，只需要吸引坐在你自己桌子上的玩家。如果你没有任何喜欢战斗的玩家，那么就不要觉得你必须提供最大数量的战斗来保持冒险的进展。",
	"Look for opportunities to surprise and delight your players. For example, the exploration of a ruined castle on a hill might lead to the discovery of a dragon's tomb hidden underneath. A trek through the wilderness might lead to the discovery of a tower that appears only on nights of the full moon. Players remember such locations.": "寻找机会让你的玩家感到惊讶和高兴。例如，探索山上的废墟城堡可能会导致发现隐藏在下面的龙的坟墓。在荒野中跋涉，可能会发现一座只在月圆之夜出现的塔。玩家们会记住这样的地点。",
	"Too many surprises can be off-putting to players, but adding the occasional twist gets players to adjust their tactics and think creatively. For example, you could spruce up a goblin lair by including goblin sappers with kegs of oil strapped to their backs. An attack on a villain's estate might be complicated by the unexpected arrival of a special guest.": "太多的惊喜会让玩家感到厌烦，但偶尔增加一些转折会让玩家调整他们的战术并进行创造性的思考。例如，你可以在地精的巢穴中加入背上绑着油桶的地精工兵，从而使其变得更加漂亮。对一个恶棍的庄园的攻击可能会因为一个特殊客人的意外到来而变得复杂。",
	"When preparing for possible combat encounters, think about odd pairings of monsters, such as a hobgoblin warlord and his pet manticore, or will-o'-wisps in league with a young black dragon. Have surprise reinforcements show up, or give the monsters unusual tactics. Throw in the occasional red herring, deception, and plot twist to keep players on their toes, but try not to go overboard. Sometimes a simple, straightforward encounter with an orc guard is just as fun for your players.": "在准备可能的战斗遭遇时，要考虑怪物的奇特组合，比如妖精战神和他的宠物尾兽，或者将才与年轻的黑龙结盟。让增援部队出其不意地出现，或者让怪物们采取不寻常的战术。偶尔抛出一些红色诱饵、欺骗和情节转折，让玩家保持警惕，但尽量不要过分。有时，与兽人守卫的简单、直接的遭遇对你的玩家来说也同样有趣。",
	"A good adventure needs thoughtfully constructed maps. Wilderness areas sprinkled with interesting landmarks and other features are better than vast expanses of unchanging terrain. Dungeons that have branching corridors and similar decision points give players the opportunity to choose which direction their characters should go. Presenting the characters with options allows the players to make choices that keep the adventure unpredictable.": "一场好的冒险需要精心构建的地图。洒满有趣地标和其他特征的荒野地区比大片不变的地形要好。有分支走廊和类似决定点的地下城让玩家有机会选择他们的角色应该去哪个方向。为角色提供选择，可以让玩家做出选择，从而保持冒险的不可预测性。",
	"If drawing maps isn't your strong suit, the Internet is a great place to look for adventure maps that have been made freely available for use, as well as floor plans of real-world buildings and images that can inspire your mapmaking. You can also use software to help put your maps together.": "如果绘制地图不是你的强项，那么互联网是一个很好的地方，可以寻找已经免费提供使用的冒险地图，以及现实世界建筑的平面图和可以激发你绘制地图灵感的图像。你还可以使用软件来帮助你拼凑地图。",
	"Published adventures are available for purchase if you have neither the time nor the inclination to write an adventure of your own, or if you want a change of pace.": "如果你既没有时间也没有兴趣写你自己的冒险，或者你想改变节奏，可以购买已出版的冒险。",
	"A published adventure includes a pregenerated scenario with the maps, NPCs, monsters, and treasures you need to run it. An example of a published adventure appears in the D&D Starter Set.": "已出版的冒险包括一个预先生成的场景，以及你运行它所需的地图、NPC、怪物和宝物。一个已出版的冒险的例子出现在《D&D入门套装》中。",
	"You can make adjustments to a published adventure so that it better suits your campaign and appeals to your players. For example, you can replace the villain of an adventure with one the players have already encountered in your campaign, or add something to the background of the adventure so that it involves your players' characters in ways that the adventure's designer never could have imagined.": "你可以对已出版的冒险故事进行调整，使其更适合你的活动并吸引你的玩家。例如，你可以用玩家在你的活动中已经遇到过的反派来代替冒险的反派，或者在冒险的背景中增加一些内容，使玩家的角色以冒险设计者从未想象过的方式参与进来。",
	"A published adventure can't account for every action the characters might take. The nice thing about published adventures is that they allow you to focus your game preparation time on highlighting plot developments in your campaign that the adventure can't address.": "出版的冒险故事不可能考虑到人物可能采取的每一个行动。出版的冒险故事的好处是，它们允许你把游戏准备时间集中在突出冒险故事无法解决的情节发展上。",
	"Published adventures also provide inspiration. You might not use an adventure as written, but it might spur ideas, or you can pull out one part of it and repurpose that part for your needs. For example, you might use a map of a temple but repopulate it with monsters of your choice, or you might use a chase sequence as a model for a pursuit scene in your campaign.": "已发表的冒险也提供了灵感。你可能不会照本宣科地使用一个冒险，但它可能会激发你的想法，或者你可以抽出其中的一部分，并根据你的需要重新使用该部分。例如，你可以使用一个寺庙的地图，但用你选择的怪物重新填充它，或者你可以使用一个追逐序列作为你的活动中追逐场景的模型。",
	"Like every story, a typical adventure has a beginning, a middle, and an end.": "像每一个故事一样，典型的冒险有一个开始，一个中间，和一个结束。",
	"An adventure starts with a hook to get the players interested. A good adventure hook piques the interest of the players and provides a compelling reason for their characters to become involved in the adventure. Maybe the adventurers stumble onto something they're not meant to see, monsters attack them on the road, an assassin makes an attempt on their lives, or a dragon shows up at the city gates. Adventure hooks such as these can instantly draw players into your story.": "一场冒险从一个钩子开始，以引起玩家的兴趣。一个好的冒险钩子能激起玩家的兴趣，为他们的角色参与冒险提供一个令人信服的理由。也许冒险者偶然发现了他们不应该看到的东西，怪物在路上攻击他们，刺客企图刺杀他们，或者一条龙出现在城门口。诸如此类的冒险钩子可以立即吸引玩家进入你的故事。",
	"The beginning of a good adventure should be exciting and focused. You want the players to go home looking forward to the next session, so give them a clear sense of where the story is headed, as well as something to look forward to.": "一个好的冒险的开始应该是令人兴奋和集中的。你希望玩家回家后能期待下一次会议，所以要让他们清楚地知道故事的走向，以及一些值得期待的事情。",
	"The middle of an adventure is where the bulk of the story unfolds. With each new challenge, the adventurers make important choices that have a clear effect on the conclusion of the adventure.": "冒险的中间阶段是故事的大部分展开的地方。在每一个新的挑战中，冒险者都会做出重要的选择，对冒险的结论有明显的影响。",
	"Over the course of the adventure, the characters might discover secrets that reveal new goals or change their original goal. Their understanding of what's going on around them might change. Maybe rumors of treasure were a trick to lure them into a death trap. Perhaps the so-called spy in the queen's court is actually a scheme concocted by the monarch herself to seize even more power.": "在冒险的过程中，人物可能会发现一些秘密，揭示新的目标或改变他们原来的目标。他们对周围发生的事情的理解可能会改变。也许关于宝藏的传闻是一个诱使他们进入死亡陷阱的诡计。也许女王宫中的所谓间谍实际上是君主自己炮制的一个计划，目的是为了夺取更多的权力。",
	"At the same time the adventurers are working to thwart their adversaries, those adversaries are trying to carry out their nefarious plans. Such enemies might also work to hide their deeds, mislead potential adversaries, or confront problems directly, perhaps by trying to kill meddlers.": "在冒险家们努力挫败对手的同时，这些对手也在努力实施他们的邪恶计划。这些敌人也可能努力隐藏他们的行为，误导潜在的对手，或者直接面对问题，也许是试图杀死插手者。",
	"Remember that the characters are the heroes of the story. Never let them become mere spectators, watching as events unfold around them that they can't influence.": "记住，人物是故事的主人公。千万不要让他们成为单纯的旁观者，看着周围发生的他们无法影响的事件。",
	"The ending encompasses the climax-the scene or encounter in which the tension building throughout the adventure reaches its peak. A strong climax should have the players on edge, with the fate of the characters and much more hanging in the balance. The outcome, which hinges on the characters' actions and decisions, should never be a forgone conclusion.": "结局包含了高潮--在整个冒险过程中，紧张的气氛达到了顶峰的场景或遭遇。一个强有力的高潮应该让玩家感到紧张，人物的命运以及更多的事情都悬而未决。结果取决于人物的行动和决定，不应该是一个注定的结论。",
	"An ending needn't tie everything up in a neat bow. Story threads can be left hanging, waiting to be resolved in a later adventure. A little bit of unfinished business is an easy way to transition from one adventure to the next.": "结局不需要把一切都打成一个整齐的蝴蝶结。故事的线索可以悬空，等待在以后的冒险中解决。一点点未完成的事情是一个从一个冒险过渡到下一个冒险的简单方法。",
	"An adventure can be location-based or event-based, as discussed in the sections that follow.": "冒险可以是基于地点的，也可以是基于事件的，这一点在后面的章节中讨论。",
	"Adventures set in crumbling dungeons and remote wilderness locations are the cornerstone of countless campaigns. Many of the greatest D&D adventures of all time are location-based.": "以破败的地牢和偏远的荒野为背景的冒险是无数次活动的基石。有史以来许多最伟大的D&D冒险都是基于地点的。",
	"Creating a location-based adventure can be broken down into a number of steps. Each step provides tables from which you can select the basic elements of your adventure. Alternatively, roll on the tables and see how the random results inspire you. You can mix up the order of the steps.": "创建一个基于位置的冒险可以分成几个步骤。每个步骤都提供了表格，你可以从中选择你的冒险的基本要素。另外，也可以在表格上滚动，看看随机的结果对你有什么启发。你可以混合这些步骤的顺序。",
	"The Dungeon Goals table provides common goals that drive or lure adventurers into dungeons. The Wilderness Goals table provides similar inspiration for an adventure focused on outdoor exploration. The Other Goals table suggests location-based adventures that don't fit neatly into the first two categories.": "地牢目标表提供了驱动或引诱冒险者进入地牢的共同目标。荒野目标表为专注于户外探索的冒险提供了类似的灵感。其他目标表提供了不适合前两类的基于地点的冒险。",

	"The adventurers race to the site where the villain is bringing a master plan to its conclusion, arriving just as that plan is about to be completed.": "冒险家们争先恐后地赶往恶棍正在完成一个总体计划的地方，在计划即将完成时到达。",
	"The villain and two or three lieutenants perform separate rites in a large room. The adventurers must disrupt all the rites at the same time.": "恶棍和两三个副手在一个大房间里分别举行仪式。冒险家们必须在同一时间破坏所有的仪式。",
	"An ally betrays the adventurers as they're about to achieve their goal. (Use this climax carefully, and don't overuse it.)": "一个盟友在冒险者即将实现他们的目标时背叛了他们。(谨慎使用这个高潮，不要过度使用）。",
	"A portal opens to another plane of existence. Creatures on the other side spill out, forcing the adventurers to close the portal and deal with the villain at the same time.": "一个通往另一个存在平面的传送门打开了。另一边的生物喷涌而出，迫使冒险家们在关闭传送门的同时，也要对付恶棍。",
	"Traps, hazards, or animated objects turn against the adventurers while the main villain attacks.": "陷阱、危险或动画物体在主要反派攻击时对冒险者不利。",

	"The adventurers must discover the main villain's secret weakness before they can hope to defeat that villain.": "冒险家们必须发现主要反派的秘密弱点，才有希望打败该反派。",
	"After you've created the location and the overall story of the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters that make up that adventure. In a location-based adventure, most encounters are keyed to specific locations on a map. For each room or wilderness area on the adventure map, your key describes what's in that area: its physical features, as well as any encounter that plays out there. The adventure key turns a simple sketch of numbered areas on graph paper into encounters designed to entertain and intrigue your players.": "在你创建了冒险的地点和整体故事之后，现在是时候计划一下构成该冒险的遭遇了。在基于地点的冒险中，大多数遭遇都是以地图上的特定地点为关键的。对于冒险地图上的每个房间或荒野地区，你的钥匙描述了该地区的情况：它的物理特征，以及在那里发生的任何遭遇。冒险钥匙将图画纸上编号区域的简单草图变成了旨在娱乐和吸引玩家的遭遇。",
	"See \"Creating Encounters\" later in this chapter for guidance on crafting individual encounters.": "参见本章后面的 \"创建奇遇\"，以获得关于制作个别奇遇的指导。",
	"In an event-based adventure, the focus is on what the characters and villains do and what happens as a result. The question of where those things happen is of secondary importance.": "在基于事件的冒险中，重点是人物和反派做了什么，以及因此而发生了什么。这些事情在哪里发生的问题是次要的。",
	"Building an event-based adventure is more work than building a location-based one, but the process can be simplified by following a number of straightforward steps. Several steps include tables from which you can choose adventure elements or roll randomly for inspiration. As with location-based adventures, you don't necessarily have to follow these steps in order.": "建立一个基于事件的冒险比建立一个基于地点的冒险更费事，但通过遵循一些简单的步骤可以简化这个过程。有几个步骤包括表格，你可以从中选择冒险元素或随机滚动以获得灵感。和基于地点的冒险一样，你不一定要按顺序进行这些步骤。",
	"Putting care into creating your villain will pay off later, since the villain plays such a pivotal role in advancing the story. Use the Adventure Villains table in the previous section to get started, and use the information in chapter 4 to help flesh out the villain.": "认真创造你的反派将在以后得到回报，因为反派在推动故事发展中起着如此关键的作用。使用上一节中的 \"冒险恶棍 \"表来开始，并使用第四章中的信息来帮助充实恶棍的形象。",
	"For example, your villain might be an undead creature seeking to avenge a past imprisonment or injury. An interesting aspect of an undead villain is that this past injury might have occurred centuries ago, inspiring revenge against the descendants of those that harmed it. Imagine a vampire imprisoned by the members of a religious order of knights, and who now seeks revenge against the current members of that order.": "例如，你的反派可能是一个寻求为过去的监禁或伤害复仇的不死生物。亡灵反派的一个有趣方面是，这种过去的伤害可能发生在几个世纪以前，激发了对伤害它的人的后代的报复。想象一下，一个被一个宗教骑士团成员囚禁的吸血鬼，现在寻求对该骑士团的现任成员进行报复。",
	"Once you have a villain, it's time to determine what steps the villain takes to achieve its goals. Create a timeline showing what the villain does and when, assuming no interference from the adventurers.": "一旦你有了一个反派，就该确定反派采取什么步骤来实现其目标。假设没有冒险者的干扰，建立一个时间表，显示小人在什么时候做什么。",
	"Building on the previous example, you might decide that your vampire villain murders several knights. By slipping past locked doors in gaseous form, the vampire is able to make the deaths appear natural at first, but it soon becomes clear that a depraved killer is behind the murders.": "在前一个例子的基础上，你可以决定你的吸血鬼反派谋杀了几个骑士。通过以气体形式溜过上锁的门，吸血鬼一开始能够使死亡显得很自然，但很快就会发现，一个堕落的杀手在谋杀背后。",
	"If you need additional inspiration, consider a few different options for how the villain's actions unfold over the course of the adventure.": "如果你需要额外的灵感，可以考虑在冒险过程中反派的行动如何展开的几个不同选项。",
	"Big event": "大事件",
	"Crime spree": "疯狂犯罪",
	"Growing corruption": "日益严重的腐败",
	"One and done": "一蹴而就",
	"Serial crimes": "连环犯罪",
	"Step by step": "一步一步来",
	"The villain's plans come to fruition during a festival, an astrological event, a holy (or unholy) rite, a royal wedding, the birth of a child, or some similar fixed time. The villain's activities up to that point are geared toward preparation for this event.": "小人的计划在一个节日、一个占星事件、一个神圣（或不神圣）的仪式、一个皇家婚礼、一个孩子的出生，或一些类似的固定时间内得到实现。小人到那时的活动都是为了准备这一事件。",
	"The villain commits acts that become bolder and more heinous over time. A killer might start out by targeting the destitute in the city slums before moving up to a massacre in the marketplace, increasing the horror and the body count each time.": "恶棍的行为随着时间的推移变得更加大胆，更加令人发指。凶手可能一开始就针对城市贫民窟中的穷人，然后转而在市场上进行大屠杀，每次都会增加恐怖程度和尸体数量。",
	"As time passes, the villain's power and influence grow, affecting more victims across a larger area. This might take the form of armies conquering new territory, an evil cult recruiting new members, or a spreading plague. A pretender to the throne might attempt to secure the support of the kingdom's nobility in the days or weeks leading up to a coup, or a guild leader could corrupt the members of a town council or bribe officers of the watch.": "随着时间的推移，恶棍的力量和影响越来越大，在更大的范围内影响更多的受害者。这可能表现为军队征服新的领土，邪教组织招募新成员，或者瘟疫蔓延。一个王位冒名顶替者可能会在政变前的几天或几周内试图获得王国贵族的支持，或者一个行会领袖可能会腐蚀镇议会的成员或贿赂守卫的官员。",
	"The villain commits a single crime and then tries to avoid the consequences. Instead of an ongoing plan to commit more crimes, the villain's goal is to lie low or flee the scene.": "恶棍犯了一次罪，然后试图逃避后果。恶棍的目标不是持续计划犯下更多的罪行，而是低调行事或逃离现场。",
	"The villain commits crimes one after the other, but these acts are repetitive in nature, rather than escalating to greater heights of depravity. The trick to catching such a villain lies in determining the pattern underlying the crimes. Though serial killers are a common example of this type of villain, your villain could be a serial arsonist favoring a certain type of building, a magical sickness that affects spellcasters who cast a specific spell, a thief that targets a certain kind of merchant, or a doppelganger kidnapping and impersonating one noble after another.": "恶棍接二连三地犯罪，但这些行为在本质上是重复的，而不是升级到更高的堕落程度。捕捉这种反派的诀窍在于确定犯罪的基本模式。虽然连环杀手是这种类型的反派的一个常见例子，但你的反派可能是一个喜欢某种类型建筑的连环纵火犯，一种影响施展特定法术的施法者的魔法疾病，一个针对某种商人的小偷，或者一个绑架和冒充一个又一个贵族的二重身。",
	"In pursuit of its goal, the villain carries out a specific set of actions in a particular sequence. A wizard might steal the items needed to create a phylactery and become a lich, or a cultist might kidnap the priests of seven good-aligned gods as a sacrifice. Alternatively, the villain could be following a trail to find the object of its revenge, killing one victim after another while moving ever closer to the real target.": "为了追求自己的目标，反派按照特定的顺序进行了一系列的行动。一个巫师可能会偷取制造法器所需的物品，然后成为一个巫师，或者一个邪教组织可能会绑架七个善神的祭司作为祭品。或者，反派可能会沿着一条线索找到它的复仇对象，杀死一个又一个受害者，同时不断接近真正的目标。",
	"You can use the Event-Based Goals table to set the party's goal. A goal can also suggest ways in which the adventurers become caught up in the villain's plans, and what exactly they must do to foil those plans.": "你可以使用基于事件的目标表来设定聚会的目标。一个目标也可以建议冒险者如何陷入恶棍的计划中，以及他们必须做什么来挫败这些计划。",
	"Bring the villain to justice.": "将恶棍绳之以法。",
	"Clear the name of an innocent NPC.": "清除一个无辜的NPC的名字。",
	"Protect or hide an NPC.": "保护或隐藏一个NPC。",
	"Protect an object.": "保护一个对象。",
	"Discover the nature and origin of a strange phenomenon that might be the villain's doing.": "发现一个可能是小人所为的奇怪现象的性质和来源。",
	"Find a wanted fugitive.": "找到一个被通缉的逃犯。",
	"Overthrow a tyrant.": "推翻一个暴君。",
	"Uncover a conspiracy to overthrow a ruler.": "揭开一个推翻统治者的阴谋。",
	"Negotiate peace between enemy nations or feuding families.": "在敌对国家或敌对家庭之间进行和平谈判。",
	"Secure aid from a ruler or council.": "获得统治者或议会的援助。",
	"Help a villain find redemption.": "帮助一个恶棍找到救赎。",
	"Parley with a villain.": "与一个小人进行对话。",
	"Smuggle weapons to rebel forces.": "向反叛部队偷运武器。",
	"Stop a band of smugglers.": "阻止一伙偷渡者。",
	"Gather intelligence on an enemy force.": "收集敌方部队的情报。",
	"Win a tournament.": "赢得一场比赛。",
	"Determine the villain's identity.": "确定反派的身份。",
	"Locate a stolen item.": "找出被盗物品。",
	"Make sure a wedding goes off without a hitch.": "确保婚礼顺利进行。",
	"For example, you roll a 10 on the table, indicating that the party's goal is to secure aid from a ruler or council. You decide to connect that to the leadership of the order targeted by your vampire villain. Maybe the order's leaders have a chest of jewels stolen from the vampire centuries ago, and the characters can use the chest as bait to trap the villain.": "例如，你在桌子上掷出一个10，表示该党的目标是确保从一个统治者或议会那里获得援助。你决定将其与你的吸血鬼反派所针对的组织的领导层联系起来。也许这个组织的领导人有一箱几百年前从吸血鬼那里偷来的珠宝，而角色们可以用这箱珠宝作为诱饵来困住这个恶棍。",
	"Many event-based adventures require a well-detailed cast of NPCs. Some of these NPCs fall neatly into the categories of allies and patrons, but most are likely to be characters or creatures whose attitudes toward the adventurers remain undecided until the adventurers interact with them. (See chapter 4 for more information on creating NPCs.)": "许多基于事件的冒险需要一个详细的NPC队伍。这些NPC有的属于盟友和赞助人的范畴，但大多数可能是角色或生物，他们对冒险者的态度在冒险者与他们互动之前是不确定的。(关于创建NPC的更多信息，见第4章）。",
	"The elements of the adventure you've determined so far should provide a clear idea of what supporting characters you need to create, as well as how much detail you need to generate for each one. NPCs unlikely to become involved in combat don't need full combat statistics, for example, just as characters heavily involved in negotiation could have ideals, bonds, and flaws. If it's helpful, roll on the Adventure Allies or Adventure Patrons tables (in the \"Location-Based Adventures\" section, earlier in this chapter).": "到目前为止，你所确定的冒险元素应该提供一个清晰的概念，即你需要创造什么样的辅助角色，以及你需要为每个角色生成多少细节。例如，不太可能参与战斗的NPC不需要完整的战斗统计数据，就像大量参与谈判的角色可以有理想、纽带和缺陷一样。如果有帮助的话，可以在 \"冒险盟友 \"或 \"冒险赞助人 \"表中进行滚动（在本章前面的 \"基于地点的冒险 \"部分）。",
	"As the adventurers pursue their goals and foil the villain's plans, how does the villain respond? Does it lash out in violence or send dire warnings? Does it look for simple solutions to its problems or create more complicated schemes to route around interference?": "当冒险家们追求他们的目标并挫败反派的计划时，反派是如何回应的？它是采取暴力手段还是发出可怕的警告？它是寻找简单的解决方案，还是创造更复杂的计划来绕过干扰？",
	"Look over the villain's actions that you outlined instep 2. For each event arising from those actions, think about how the adventurers are likely to react. If they can prevent an action or hamper its success, what effect does that have on the villain's overall plan? What can the villain do to compensate?": "看看你在步骤2中概述的反派的行动。对于这些行动所引起的每一个事件，想想冒险家们可能会有什么反应。如果他们能阻止一个行动或阻碍其成功，这对反派的整体计划有什么影响？小人可以做什么来弥补？",
	"One way to track a villain's reactions is by using a flowchart. This might grow out of the timeline that describes the villain's plans, outlining how the villain gets back on track after the adventurers thwart its plans. Or the flowchart could be separate from the timeline, showing the various actions the adventurers might take and the villain's response to those actions.": "跟踪反派反应的一种方法是使用流程图。这可以从描述反派计划的时间线中发展出来，概述反派在冒险家挫败其计划后如何回到正轨。流程图也可以与时间线分开，显示冒险者可能采取的各种行动以及反派对这些行动的反应。",
	"Since locations aren't the focus of the adventure, they can be simpler and smaller than a dungeon complex or an expanse of wilderness. They might be specific locations in a city, or even individual rooms in locations where combat is likely to break out or significant exploration is needed, such as a throne room, a guild headquarters, a vampire's crumbling manor, or a knights' chapter house.": "由于地点不是冒险的重点，它们可以比地牢综合体或广阔的荒野更简单、更小。它们可能是城市中的特定地点，甚至是有可能爆发战斗或需要大量探索的地点中的单个房间，如王室、行会总部、吸血鬼的破败庄园或骑士的分会所。",
	"The Adventure Introduction table in the \"Location-Based Adventures\" section offers fun possibilities for hooking the characters into the events of your adventure, including dreams, hauntings, and a simple plea for help. The Adventure Climax table in that same section includes adventure endings that work just as well for event-based adventures.": "在 \"基于地点的冒险 \"部分的冒险介绍表提供了有趣的可能性，可以将角色吸引到你的冒险事件中，包括梦境、鬼魂和简单的求助。同一节中的 \"冒险高潮 \"表包括冒险结局，对基于事件的冒险同样有效。",
	"For example, the Adventure Introduction table helps you decide that an ally the adventurers care about needs their help. Perhaps the NPC is a knight who believes that a vampire is trying to kill him, or a friend or relative hoping to find the knight's murderer. This NPC brings the vampire's crimes to the characters' attention.": "例如，冒险介绍表帮助你决定冒险者关心的盟友需要他们的帮助。也许这个NPC是一个相信有吸血鬼要杀他的骑士，或者是一个希望找到骑士的凶手的朋友或亲戚。这个NPC让人物注意到吸血鬼的罪行。",
	"Looking over the Adventure Climax table, you might decide to have the adventurers bait the vampire with a chest of jewels stolen from its lair. As an added twist, you decide that the vampire's true goal is to retrieve a necklace among the jewels. The necklace is set with nine gems, and with these gems the vampire can open a gate to the Nine Hells. Should the vampire succeed, the adventurers will have a more pressing threat to deal with, as a powerful devil steps through the gate and honors some ancient pact it made with the vampire.": "看一下冒险高潮表，你可能会决定让冒险者用一箱从吸血鬼巢穴里偷出来的珠宝来引诱它。作为一个额外的转折，你决定吸血鬼的真正目标是取回珠宝中的一条项链。项链上镶嵌着九颗宝石，有了这些宝石，吸血鬼可以打开通往九层地狱的大门。如果吸血鬼成功了，冒险家们将有一个更紧迫的威胁要对付，因为一个强大的魔鬼穿过大门，履行它与吸血鬼达成的一些古老的协议。",
	"After you've created the overall story of the adventure, it's time to plan out the encounters on which the events of that adventure will hang. In an event-based adventure, encounters occur when the villain's agenda intersects the path of the characters. You can't always anticipate exactly when or where that will happen, but you can create a list of possible encounters that the adventurers might experience. This can take the form of general descriptions of the villain's forces, details of its lieutenants and minions, as well as encounters tied to the key locations of the adventure.": "在你创造了冒险的整体故事之后，是时候计划出冒险中的事件所依赖的遭遇了。在基于事件的冒险中，当反派的议程与角色的路径相交时，就会发生遭遇战。你不可能总是准确地预料到何时何地会发生这种情况，但是你可以建立一个冒险者可能会遇到的遭遇的清单。这可以采取的形式包括对反派势力的一般描述、其副手和爪牙的细节，以及与冒险的关键地点有关的遭遇。",
	"A mystery is a form of event-based adventure that usually focuses on the adventurers' efforts to solve a crime, usually a robbery or murder. Unlike the writer of a mystery novel, a Dungeon Master can't always predict what the characters will do in a mystery adventure.": "悬疑小说是一种基于事件的冒险形式，通常侧重于冒险者解决犯罪问题的努力，通常是抢劫或谋杀。与推理小说的作者不同，地下城管理员不可能总是预测角色在推理冒险中会做什么。",
	"A villain whose actions are \"crime spree,\" \"one and done,\" or \"serial crimes\" might inspire you to craft a mystery adventure around that villain's crimes. Similarly, if the adventurers' goals include determining the villain's identity, that might be part of a mystery.": "一个反派的行为是 \"疯狂犯罪\"、\"一劳永逸 \"或 \"连环犯罪\"，这可能会激发你围绕这个反派的罪行来设计一个神秘的冒险。同样地，如果冒险者的目标包括确定反派的身份，这可能是一个神秘故事的一部分。",
	"To build a mystery adventure, follow the steps for creating any event-based adventure. Then consider three additional elements for the adventure: the victim, the suspects, and the clues.": "要建立一个神秘的冒险，请遵循创建任何基于事件的冒险的步骤。然后考虑冒险的另外三个要素：受害者、嫌疑人和线索。",
	"Think about the victim's relationship to the villain. Though you can create a strong scenario with no such relationship, part of what makes a mystery exciting is the discovery of the twisted connections between NPCs and how those connections led to the crime. A random killing might be just as mysterious, but it lacks that emotional connection.": "思考一下受害者与恶棍的关系。尽管你可以在没有这种关系的情况下创造一个强大的场景，但使一个神秘事件令人兴奋的部分原因是发现NPC之间扭曲的联系以及这些联系是如何导致犯罪的。随机杀人可能同样神秘，但它缺乏那种情感联系。",
	"Also look for a connection between the victim and one or more of the adventurers. One surefire way to draw adventurers into a mystery-including making them suspects-is to make the victim someone with whom the characters are acquainted.": "还要寻找受害者和一个或多个冒险家之间的联系。吸引冒险者进入谜团--包括让他们成为嫌疑人--的一个万无一失的方法是让受害者成为角色们所熟悉的人。",
	"Your cast of characters should include an assortment of other NPCs who didn't commit the crime, but who had the motive, the means, or the opportunity to do so. Suspects might be obvious or could come to light during the investigation. One technique often used in detective fiction is to create a closed circle of suspects-a finite number of individuals whose circumstances make them the only possible suspects.": "你的角色阵容应该包括各种各样的其他NPC，他们没有犯罪，但却有犯罪的动机、手段或机会。嫌疑人可能是显而易见的，也可能是在调查过程中发现的。侦探小说中经常使用的一种技巧是建立一个封闭的嫌疑人圈子--一个有限数量的人，他们的情况使他们成为唯一可能的嫌疑人。",
	"One tip for keeping the players and the adventurers guessing as to the identity of the villain is to ensure that more than one suspect has a secret. When questioned by the adventurers, a suspect might appear nervous or attempt to lie, despite being innocent of the crime. A secret business deal, an illicit affair, a dark past, or an uncontrolled vice are flaws that make suspects more interesting than NPCs with nothing to hide.": "让玩家和冒险者猜测恶棍身份的一个建议是，确保不止一个嫌疑人有秘密。当冒险者询问时，嫌疑人可能会显得紧张或试图撒谎，尽管他是无辜的。秘密的商业交易、不正当的外遇、黑暗的过去或者不受控制的恶习，这些都是使嫌疑人比没有任何隐藏的NPC更有趣的缺陷。",
	"Clues point to the identity of the villain. Some clues are verbal, including the statements of the suspects and witnesses that help the adventurers develop a picture of what happened. Other clues are physical, such as an unfinished message written in the victim's blood, a piece of jewelry left behind by the villain, or a weapon found hidden in a suspect's room.": "线索指向了恶棍的身份。有些线索是口头的，包括犯罪嫌疑人和目击者的陈述，帮助冒险者了解发生的情况。其他的线索是实物，例如用受害者的血写成的未完成的信息，恶棍留下的一件珠宝，或者在嫌疑人的房间里发现的一件武器。",
	"A clue should connect a suspect to the crime, typically by shedding light on the suspect's motive, means, or opportunity. Some clues connect the wrong suspect to the crime, leading the adventurers in the wrong direction. Eventually, they must find other clues pointing in a different direction, or come across evidence that absolves the suspect.": "线索应将嫌疑人与犯罪联系起来，通常是通过揭示嫌疑人的动机、手段或机会。有些线索将嫌疑人与犯罪联系起来，将冒险者引向错误的方向。最终，他们必须找到指向不同方向的其他线索，或者遇到能证明嫌疑人无罪的证据。",
	"It's better to populate your adventure with too many clues than too few. If the adventurers solve the mystery too quickly, you might feel some disappointment but the players will feel a sense of accomplishment. If the mystery is too hard, though, the players will become frustrated. Since you have to account for the possibility that the adventurers will overlook some clues, use redundant clues to ensure that the players have the knowledge needed to catch the villain.": "在你的冒险中填充太多的线索比太少好。如果冒险者太快解开了谜团，你可能会感到有些失望，但玩家会有一种成就感。但是，如果谜题太难，玩家就会感到沮丧。由于你必须考虑到冒险者会忽略一些线索的可能性，所以要使用多余的线索，以确保玩家拥有抓住恶棍所需的知识。",
	"Intrigue adventures are event-based adventures that revolve around power struggles. Intrigues are common in the courts of the nobility, but power struggles can play out just as easily in merchants' guilds, crime syndicates, and temple hierarchies.": "阴谋冒险是基于事件的冒险，围绕权力斗争展开。阴谋在贵族的法庭上很常见，但权力斗争在商人协会、犯罪集团和神庙等级制度中也同样容易发生。",
	"Rather than dark events and villainous plots, an intrigue adventure typically revolves around the exchange of favors, the rise and fall of individuals in power and influence, and the honeyed words of diplomacy. A prince's efforts to be named heir to the throne, a courtier's ambition to sit at the queen's right hand, and a merchant's desire to open a trade route through enemy lands are the stuff of intrigue.": "阴谋冒险通常不是围绕着黑暗事件和恶棍情节，而是围绕着恩惠的交换、个人权力和影响力的兴衰以及外交上的蜜语。王子为成为王位继承人所做的努力，朝臣为坐在女王的右手边所做的野心，以及商人为打开一条穿越敌国的贸易路线所做的努力，都是阴谋的内容。",
	"Like all adventures, an intrigue adventure works only if the players and their characters are invested in the outcome. If no one cares who the king's chamberlain is or who has logging rights in the elven woods, throwing the characters into an adventure centered on those issues will fall flat. However, if having the ear of the king's chamberlain means the characters can use royal soldiers to help them defend their own stronghold on the borderlands, players will be invested in the scenario.": "像所有的冒险一样，只有当玩家和他们的角色对结果感兴趣的时候，阴谋冒险才会奏效。如果没有人关心谁是国王的内侍，或者谁拥有精灵森林的伐木权，那么把角色扔到以这些问题为中心的冒险中就会落空。但是，如果拥有国王内侍的耳朵意味着角色可以利用皇家士兵来帮助他们保卫自己在边境地区的据点，那么玩家就会对这个场景有所投入。",
	"Adventurers usually become embroiled in intrigue when they need a favor from a powerful creature and have to perform a favor in exchange, or when the plots of powerful NPCs get in the way of the characters achieving their goals. Some of the event-based goals discussed earlier in this section lend themselves to intrigue adventures. For example, if the adventurers must uncover a conspiracy, negotiate a peace treaty, or secure aid from a ruler or council, you might be looking at an intrigue adventure.": "当冒险者需要一个强大的生物的帮助，并且必须执行一个人情作为交换时，或者当强大的NPC的阴谋妨碍了角色实现他们的目标时，冒险者通常会被卷入阴谋之中。本节前面讨论的一些基于事件的目标适合于阴谋冒险。例如，如果冒险者必须揭开一个阴谋，就和平条约进行谈判，或者从统治者或议会那里获得援助，你可能会看到一个阴谋冒险。",
	"The process of creating an intrigue adventure is similar to creating any other event-based adventure, with two main differences: how villains are handled and how the characters can gain influence.": "创建阴谋冒险的过程与创建任何其他基于事件的冒险相似，有两个主要的区别：如何处理反派以及角色如何获得影响力。",
	"Some intrigue adventures are driven by the actions of a single villain, such as a noble plotting the assassination of a monarch. However, an intrigue adventure can have multiple villains or no villain at all.": "有些阴谋冒险是由一个反派的行动所驱动的，比如一个贵族策划暗杀一个君主。然而，一个阴谋冒险可以有多个反派或根本没有反派。",
	"Some intrigue adventures revolve around the exchange of favors in the absence of a villain. For this type of adventure, skip steps 1 and 2 of the event-based adventure creation process (the villain and the villain's actions) and move straight to the adventurers' goals in step 3. Figure out why the adventurers become involved in the intrigue, then spend the bulk of your time creating the NPCs they interact with.": "有些阴谋冒险是在没有反派的情况下围绕着交换恩惠展开的。对于这种类型的冒险，跳过基于事件的冒险创建过程的第1和第2步（反派和反派的行动），直接进入第3步的冒险者的目标。想清楚为什么冒险者会卷入阴谋，然后把大部分时间花在创造与他们互动的NPC上。",
	"Some intrigue adventures feature a whole cast of villains, each with its own goals, motivations, and methods. The adventurers might be drawn into the struggle of a court full of nobles vying for the throne in the wake of the king's sudden death, or could find themselves negotiating the end to a deadly turf war among thieves' guilds. In this scenario, you'll spend a lot of time on steps 1 and 2, developing each of the major NPCs as a distinct villain with an agenda. In step 5, you'll need to develop each villain's reactions to the potential setbacks they face during the adventure.": "有些阴谋冒险的特点是有一大群反派，每个人都有自己的目标、动机和方法。冒险家们可能会被卷入国王突然死亡后满朝贵族争夺王位的斗争中，也可能发现自己正在为结束盗贼行会之间致命的地盘战争而进行谈判。在这种情况下，你会在第1和第2步上花很多时间，把每个主要的NPC都发展成一个有议程的独特的反派。在第5步，你需要发展每个反派对他们在冒险过程中面临的潜在挫折的反应。",
	"However, you don't need to put equal effort into detailing the reactions of every villain, since many will likely echo each other or cancel each other out. Whenever the adventurers foil one villain's plans, it might let another villain's schemes move forward, advancing the adventure whether the foiled villain reacts or not.": "然而，你不需要花同样的精力来详细描述每个反派的反应，因为许多反派可能会相互呼应或相互抵消。每当冒险者挫败一个反派的计划时，可能会让另一个反派的计划向前推进，无论被挫败的反派是否有反应，都会推动冒险的发展。",
	"Depending on the scenario, you might want to track the party's influence with different NPCs or factions, or even track influence separately for each character.": "根据不同的场景，你可能想追踪党对不同的NPC或派别的影响，甚至为每个角色单独追踪影响。",
	"One way to handle influence is to treat it like inspiration. A character gains influence in a certain situation only if you grant it, and bringing influence into play requires spending it. Characters can gain influence by doing favors for NPCs, advancing the cause of an organization, or demonstrating their power and heroism, at your discretion. As with inspiration, a character can choose to spend influence to gain advantage on a roll relevant to that influence.": "处理影响力的一种方法是把它当作灵感。一个角色只有在你授予它的情况下才能获得影响力，而将影响力带入游戏需要花费它。角色可以通过为NPC提供帮助、推动某个组织的事业或展示他们的力量和英雄主义来获得影响力，这由你决定。与灵感一样，角色可以选择花费影响力来获得与该影响力相关的卷轴上的优势。",
	"Another way to handle influence is to treat it like renown (see chapter 1), allowing characters to gain renown at court and within various key factions.": "另一种处理影响力的方法是把它当作声望（见第一章），允许角色在宫廷和各个关键派别中获得声望。",
	"You can base an entire adventure on a framing event or use such an event to grab the players' interest. The Framing Events table presents several ideas, or you can use it to inspire your own framing event.": "你可以把整个冒险建立在一个框架事件上，或者用这样一个事件来吸引玩家的兴趣。框架事件表提出了几个想法，或者你可以用它来激发你自己的框架事件。",
	"Anniversary of a monarch's reign": "君主统治的周年纪念日",
	"Anniversary of an important event": "一个重要事件的周年纪念",
	"Arena event": "竞技场活动",
	"Arrival of a caravan or ship": "大篷车或船舶的到来",

	"For example, if the overall story of your adventure involves a quest to deliver a priceless relic to a remote monastery, each encounter along the way is an opportunity to introduce a smaller objective that moves the quest forward. Encounters during the trip might see the adventurers accosted by enemies determined to steal the relic, or by monsters that are constantly threatening the monastery.": "例如，如果你的冒险故事涉及一个将无价的文物送到一个偏远的修道院的任务，那么沿途的每一次遭遇都是一个机会，可以引入一个较小的目标来推动任务的进展。在旅途中的遭遇可能会看到冒险者被决心偷取遗物的敌人袭击，或者被不断威胁着修道院的怪物袭击。",
	"Some players create their own objectives, which is to be expected and encouraged. It is, after all, as much the players' campaign as yours. For example, a character might try to bribe enemies rather than fight them, or chase after a fleeing enemy to see where it goes.": "一些玩家创造了他们自己的目标，这是值得期待和鼓励的。毕竟，这和你的活动一样，都是玩家的活动。例如，一个角色可能试图贿赂敌人，而不是与他们战斗，或者追赶一个逃跑的敌人，看看他去哪里。",
	"Players who ignore objectives will have to deal with the consequences, which is another important facet of encounter design.": "忽视目标的玩家将不得不处理后果，这是遭遇设计的另一个重要方面。",
	"The following objectives can be used as foundations for encounters. Although these objectives focus on a single encounter during an adventure, using the same objective in multiple encounters allows you to combine those encounters into a larger obstacle or problem the adventurers must overcome.": "以下目标可以作为遭遇战的基础。虽然这些目标集中在冒险过程中的一次遭遇，但在多次遭遇中使用相同的目标，可以将这些遭遇组合成一个更大的障碍或问题，让冒险者必须克服。",
	"The characters must convince two opposing groups (or their leaders) to end the conflict that embroils them. As a complication, the characters might have enemies on one or both of the opposing sides, or some other group or individual might be instigating the conflict to further its own ends.": "人物必须说服两个对立的团体（或他们的领导人），以结束使他们卷入的冲突。作为一种复杂的情况，人物可能在一个或两个对立面有敌人，或者其他一些团体或个人可能在煽动冲突以达到自己的目的。",
	"The characters must act as bodyguards or protect some object in their custody. As a complication, the NPC under the party's protection might be cursed, diseased, prone to panic attacks, too young or too old to fight, or apt to risk the lives of the adventurers through dubious decisions. The object the adventurers have sworn to protect might be sentient, cursed, or difficult to transport.": "角色们必须充当保镖或保护他们所保管的某些物品。作为一种复杂的情况，受保护的NPC可能是被诅咒的、有病的、容易恐慌的、太年轻或太老而不能战斗的，或者容易因为可疑的决定而危及冒险者的生命。冒险者们发誓要保护的物品可能是有生命的，被诅咒的，或者难以运输的。",
	"The adventurers must gain possession of a specific object in the area of the encounter, preferably before combat finishes. As a complication, enemies might desire the object as much as the adventurers do, forcing both parties to fight for it.": "冒险家们必须在遭遇战的区域内获得一个特定物体的所有权，最好是在战斗结束之前。作为一种复杂的情况，敌人可能会像冒险家一样渴望得到该物品，从而迫使双方为它而战。",
	"The adventurers must pass through a dangerous area. This objective is similar to retrieving an object insofar as reaching the exit is a higher priority than killing opponents in the area. A time limit adds a complication, as does a decision point that might lead characters astray. Other complications include traps, hazards, and monsters.": "冒险家们必须通过一个危险的区域。这个目标类似于取回物品，因为到达出口比杀死该地区的对手更优先。时间限制增加了复杂性，而可能导致角色误入歧途的决策点也增加了复杂性。其他复杂因素包括陷阱、危险和怪物。",
	"The adventurers need to move through the encounter area without making their enemies aware of their presence. Complications might ensue if they are detected.": "冒险家们需要在不引起敌人注意的情况下通过遭遇区。如果他们被发现，可能会有麻烦。",
	"The plots of evil cult leaders, malevolent warlocks, and powerful fiends often involve rituals that must be foiled. Characters engaged in stopping a ritual must typically fight their way through evil minions before attempting to disrupt the ritual's powerful magic. As a complication, the ritual might be close to completion when the characters arrive, imposing a time limit. Depending on the ritual, its completion might have immediate consequences as well.": "邪恶的邪教领袖、恶毒的术士和强大的恶魔的阴谋往往涉及必须挫败的仪式。参与阻止仪式的人物通常必须在试图破坏仪式的强大魔法之前，与邪恶的爪牙斗智斗勇。作为一种复杂的情况，当人物到达时，仪式可能已经接近完成，这就给他们带来了时间限制。根据仪式的情况，仪式的完成可能也会带来直接的后果。",
	"The villain is surrounded by minions powerful enough to kill the adventurers. The characters can flee and hope to confront the villain another day, or they can try to fight their way through the minions to take out their target. As a complication, the minions might be innocent creatures under the villain's control. Killing the villain means breaking that control, but the adventurers must endure the minions' attacks until they do.": "恶棍周围有足够强大的爪牙，可以杀死冒险者。角色们可以逃跑，并希望改日再与恶棍对峙，或者他们可以尝试穿过爪牙，干掉他们的目标。作为一种复杂的情况，这些爪牙可能是被小人控制的无辜生物。杀死小人意味着打破这种控制，但冒险者必须忍受小人的攻击，直到他们做到。",
	"When creating a combat encounter, let your imagination run wild and build something your players will enjoy. Once you have the details figured out, use this section to adjust the difficulty of the encounter.": "在创建战斗奇遇时，让你的想象力发挥到极致，建立一些你的玩家会喜欢的东西。一旦你想好了细节，就用这一部分来调整遭遇战的难度。",
	"There are four categories of encounter difficulty.": "遭遇的难度有四类。",
	"An easy encounter doesn't tax the characters' resources or put them in serious peril. They might lose a few hit points, but victory is pretty much guaranteed.": "一个简单的遭遇不会对人物的资源造成负担，也不会使他们处于严重的危险之中。他们可能会失去一些命中率，但胜利基本上是有保障的。",
	"A medium encounter usually has one or two scary moments for the players, but the characters should emerge victorious with no casualties. One or more of them might need to use healing resources.": "一个中等规模的遭遇战通常会有一到两个让玩家害怕的时刻，但是角色们应该在没有伤亡的情况下取得胜利。他们中的一个或多个可能需要使用治疗资源。",
	"A hard encounter could go badly for the adventurers. Weaker characters might get taken out of the fight, and there's a slim chance that one or more characters might die.": "一场艰难的遭遇战可能会对冒险者产生不利影响。较弱的角色可能会被排除在战斗之外，而且有一个或多个角色可能会死亡。",
	"A deadly encounter could be lethal for one or more player characters. Survival often requires good tactics and quick thinking, and the party risks defeat.": "一个致命的遭遇对一个或多个玩家角色来说可能是致命的。生存往往需要良好的战术和快速的思维，而党有失败的风险。",
	"When putting together an encounter or adventure, especially at lower levels, exercise caution when using monsters whose challenge rating is higher than the party's average level. Such a creature might deal enough damage with a single action to take out adventurers of a lower level. For example, an ogre has a challenge rating of 2, but it can kill a 1st-level wizard with a single blow.": "在组织一场遭遇战或冒险时，特别是在较低的级别，当使用挑战等级高于队伍平均水平的怪物时要谨慎。这样的怪物可能用一个动作就能造成足够的伤害，以消灭低级别的冒险者。例如，一个食人魔的挑战等级是2，但它可以一击杀死一个1级的巫师。",
	"In addition, some monsters have features that might be difficult or impossible for lower-level characters to overcome. For example, a rakshasa has a challenge rating of 13 and is immune to spells of 6th level and lower. Spellcasters of 12th level or lower have no spells higher than 6th level, meaning that they won't be able to affect the rakshasa with their magic, putting the adventurers at a serious disadvantage. Such an encounter would be significantly tougher for the party than the monster's challenge rating might suggest.": "此外，有些怪物的特征对于低级别的角色来说可能很难或不可能克服。例如，罗刹的挑战等级为13，对6级及以下的法术免疫。12级或以下的法术师没有高于6级的法术，这意味着他们无法用他们的魔法影响罗刹，使冒险者处于严重的劣势。这样的遭遇将比怪物的挑战等级所显示的要难得多。",
	"Use the following method to gauge the difficulty of any combat encounter.": "使用以下方法来衡量任何战斗遭遇的难度。",
	"First, determine the experience point (XP) thresholds for each character in the party. The XP Thresholds by Character Level table below has four XP thresholds for each character level, one for each category of encounter difficulty. Use a character's level to determine his or her XP thresholds.": "首先，确定聚会中每个角色的经验值（XP）阈值。下面的 \"按角色等级划分的XP阈值 \"表为每个角色等级设置了四个XP阈值，每个类别的遭遇难度都有一个。使用一个角色的等级来确定他或她的XP阈值。",
	"Repeat this process for every character in the party.": "对党内的每个角色都重复这一过程。",
	"For each category of encounter difficulty, add up the characters' XP thresholds. This determines the party's XP threshold. You'll end up with four totals, one for each category of encounter difficulty.": "对于每一类遭遇战的难度，将角色的XP阈值加起来。这就决定了整个团队的XP阈值。你最终会得到四个总数，每一类遭遇难度都有一个。",
	"For example, if your party includes three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character, the party's totaled XP thresholds would be as follows:": "例如，如果你的队伍包括三个三级角色和一个二级角色，队伍的总XP阈值将如下。",
	"275 XP (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)": "275 xp (75 + 75 + 75 + 50)",
	"550 XP (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)": "550 xp (150 + 150 + 150 + 100)",
	"825 XP (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)": "825 xp (225 + 225 + 225 + 150)",
	"1,400 XP (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)": "1,400 xp (400 + 400 + 400 + 200)",
	"Record the totals, because you can use them for every encounter in your adventure.": "记录总数，因为你可以在你的冒险中的每个遭遇中使用它们。",
	"Add up the XP for all of the monsters in the encounter. Every monster has an XP value in its stat block.": "将遭遇战中所有怪物的XP值加起来。每个怪物在其状态块中都有一个XP值。",
	"If the encounter includes more than one monster, apply a multiplier to the monsters' total XP. The more monsters there are, the more attack rolls you're making against the characters in a given round, and the more dangerous the encounter becomes. To correctly gauge an encounter's difficulty, multiply the total XP of all the monsters in the encounter by the value given in the Encounter Multipliers table.": "如果遭遇战包括一个以上的怪物，则对这些怪物的总XP值适用一个倍数。怪物越多，你在某一回合中对角色进行的攻击卷就越多，遭遇战也就越危险。为了正确衡量一个遭遇战的难度，将遭遇战中所有怪物的总XP值乘以遭遇战乘数表中给出的数值。",
	"For example, if an encounter includes four monsters worth a total of 500 XP, you would multiply the total XP of the monsters by 2, for an adjusted value of 1,000 XP.": "例如，如果一个遭遇包括四个总价值500XP的怪物，你将把这些怪物的总XP乘以2，调整后的价值为1000XP。",
	"This adjusted value is not what the monsters are worth in terms of XP; the adjusted value's only purpose is to help you accurately assess the encounter's difficulty.": "这个调整值并不是怪物的XP值；调整值的唯一目的是帮助你准确评估遭遇战的难度。",
	"When making this calculation, don't count any monsters whose challenge rating is significantly below the average challenge rating of the other monsters in the group unless you think the weak monsters significantly contribute to the difficulty of the encounter.": "在进行这一计算时，不要计算挑战等级明显低于该组其他怪物平均挑战等级的任何怪物，除非你认为这些弱小的怪物对遭遇战的难度有很大贡献。",
	"15 or more": "15个或更多",
	"Compare the monsters' adjusted XP value to the party's XP thresholds. The threshold that equals the adjusted XP value determines the encounter's difficulty. If there's no match, use the closest threshold that is lower than the adjusted XP value.": "将怪物的调整后XP值与本方的XP阈值进行比较。等于调整后XP值的阈值决定了遭遇战的难度。如果没有匹配，就使用比调整后的XP值低的最接近的阈值。",
	"For example, an encounter with one bugbear and three hobgoblins has an adjusted XP value of 1,000, making it a hard encounter for a party of three 3rd-level characters and one 2nd-level character (which has a hard encounter threshold of 825 XP and a deadly encounter threshold of 1,400 XP).": "例如，一个有一只虫子和三只妖精的遭遇，其调整后的XP值为1,000，这使得它对于一个由三个三级角色和一个二级角色组成的队伍来说是一个艰难的遭遇（它的艰难遭遇阈值为825XP，致命的遭遇阈值为1,400XP）。",
	"The preceding guidelines assume that you have a party consisting of three to five adventurers.": "前面的准则假设你有一个由三到五个冒险者组成的队伍。",
	"If the party contains fewer than three characters, apply the next highest multiplier on the Encounter Multipliers table. For example, apply a multiplier of 1.5 when the characters fight a single monster, and a multiplier of 5 for groups of fifteen or more monsters.": "如果队伍中的人物少于三个，则采用遭遇战乘数表上的次高乘数。例如，当人物与单个怪物战斗时，应用1.5的乘数，而对于15个或更多的怪物群，应用5的乘数。",
	"If the party contains six or more characters, use the next lowest multiplier on the table. Use a multiplier of 0.5 for a single monster.": "如果队伍中包含六个或更多的角色，则使用表格中下一个最低的乘数。对单个怪物使用0.5的乘数。",
	"Sometimes an encounter features multiple enemies that the party doesn't face all at once. For example, monsters might come at the party in waves.": "有时，一个遭遇战的特点是有多个敌人，而当事人并不是一次就能面对的。例如，怪物可能会一波接一波地冲向队伍。",
	"For such encounters, treat each discrete part or wave as a separate encounter for the purpose of determining its difficulty.": "对于这类遭遇战，为了确定其难度，要把每个离散的部分或波段作为一个单独的遭遇战。",
	"A party can't benefit from a short rest between parts of a multipart encounter, so they won't be able to spend Hit Dice to regain hit points or recover any abilities that require a short rest to regain. As a rule, if the adjusted XP value for the monsters in a multipart encounter is higher than one-third of the party's expected XP total for the adventuring day (see \"The Adventuring Day,\" below), the encounter is going to be tougher than the sum of its parts.": "队伍不能从多部分遭遇战的各部分之间的短暂休息中获益，所以他们将不能花费命中率来恢复命中率，也不能恢复任何需要短暂休息才能恢复的能力。作为一条规则，如果多部分遭遇战中的怪物的调整XP值高于队伍在冒险日的预期XP总量的三分之一（见下文 \"冒险日\"），那么这个遭遇战就会比其各部分的总和更艰难。",
	"You can build an encounter if you know its desired difficulty. The party's XP thresholds give you an XP budget that you can spend on monsters to build easy, medium, hard, and deadly encounters. Just remember that groups of monsters eat up more of that budget than their base XP values would indicate (see step 4).": "如果你知道它的理想难度，你就可以建造一个遭遇战。队伍的XP阈值给了你一个XP预算，你可以把它花在怪物身上，以建立简单、中等、困难和致命的遭遇。请记住，成群的怪物会比它们的基本XP值占用更多的预算（见步骤4）。",
	"For example, using the party from step 2, you can build a medium encounter by making sure that the adjusted XP value of the monsters is at least 550 XP (the party's threshold for a medium encounter) and no more than 825 XP (the party's threshold for a hard encounter). A single monster of challenge rating 3 (such as a manticore or owlbear) is worth 700 XP, so that's one possibility. If you want a pair of monsters, each one will count for 1.5 times its base XP value. A pair of dire wolves (worth 200 XP each) have an adjusted XP value of 600, making them a medium encounter for the party as well.": "例如，使用步骤2中的队伍，你可以建立一个中等遭遇战，确保怪物的调整XP值至少为550XP（队伍的中等遭遇战门槛），不超过825XP（队伍的困难遭遇战门槛）。一个挑战等级为3的单一怪物（如尾兽或猫头鹰）价值700XP，所以这是一种可能性。如果你想要一对怪物，每一个都将计入其基本XP值的1.5倍。一对地狼（每只价值200XP）的调整后XP值为600，这使它们也成为一方的中等遭遇。",
	"To assist with this approach, appendix B presents a list of all monsters in the Monster Manual organized by challenge rating.": "为了协助这种方法，附录B列出了《怪物手册》中所有怪物的清单，按挑战等级排列。",
	"Assuming typical adventuring conditions and average luck, most adventuring parties can handle about six to eight medium or hard encounters in a day. If the adventure has more easy encounters, the adventurers can get through more. If it has more deadly encounters, they can handle fewer.": "假设有典型的冒险条件和平均的运气，大多数冒险队伍在一天内可以处理大约六到八个中等或困难的遭遇。如果冒险有更多简单的遭遇，冒险者就可以通过更多。如果它有更多致命的遭遇，他们可以处理得更少。",
	"In the same way you figure out the difficulty of an encounter, you can use the XP values of monsters and other opponents in an adventure as a guideline for how far the party is likely to progress.": "就像你计算遭遇战的难度一样，你可以用冒险中的怪物和其他对手的XP值作为指引，来判断队伍可能取得多大的进展。",
	"For each character in the party, use the Adventuring Day XP table to estimate how much XP that character is expected to earn in a day. Add together the values of all party members to get a total for the party's adventuring day. This provides a rough estimate of the adjusted XP value for encounters the party can handle before the characters will need to take a long rest.": "对于聚会中的每个角色，使用冒险日XP表来估计该角色在一天内预计会获得多少XP。将所有党员的数值相加，得到党的冒险日的总数。这提供了一个粗略的估计，即在人物需要长期休息之前，队伍可以处理的调整后的XP值。",
	"In general, over the course of a full adventuring day, the party will likely need to take two short rests, about one-third and two-thirds of the way through the day.": "一般来说，在一个完整的冒险日过程中，队伍很可能需要进行两次短暂的休息，大约在一天的三分之一和三分之二的时间里。",
	"An encounter can be made easier or harder based on the choice of location and the situation. Increase the difficulty of the encounter by one step (from easy to medium, for example) if the characters have a drawback that their enemies don't. Reduce the difficulty by one step if the characters have a benefit that their enemies don't. Any additional benefit or drawback pushes the encounter one step in the appropriate direction. If the characters have both a benefit and a drawback, the two cancel each other out. Situational drawbacks include the following:": "一个遭遇战可以根据地点的选择和情况的不同而变得更容易或更难。如果角色有敌人没有的缺点，就将遭遇战的难度提高一步（例如从简单到中等）。如果角色有他们的敌人没有的好处，那么难度就会降低一步。任何额外的好处或缺点都会将遭遇战向适当的方向推进一步。如果人物既有好处又有缺点，那么这两者就会相互抵消。情况下的缺点包括以下几种。",
	"The whole party is surprised, and the enemy isn't.": "全党都很惊讶，而敌人却没有。",
	"The enemy has cover, and the party doesn't.": "敌人有掩护，而本方没有。",
	"The characters are unable to see the enemy.": "人物无法看到敌人。",
	"The characters are taking damage every round from some environmental effect or magical source, and the enemy isn't.": "角色每回合都会受到来自某种环境效应或魔法来源的伤害，而敌人却没有。",
	"The characters are hanging from a rope, in the midst of scaling a sheer wall or cliff, stuck to the floor, or otherwise in a situation that greatly hinders their mobility or makes them sitting ducks.": "人物被吊在绳子上，在攀登峭壁或悬崖的过程中，被卡在地板上，或处于极大阻碍他们行动的情况下，或使他们成为活靶子。",
	"Situational benefits are similar to drawbacks except that they benefit the characters instead of the enemy.": "形势利益与缺点类似，只是它们对人物而不是对敌人有利。",
	"The following features can add more fun and suspense to a combat encounter:": "以下特点可以为战斗中的遭遇战增加更多的乐趣和悬念。",

	"Terrain features that provide a change of elevation, such as pits, stacks of empty crates, ledges, and balconies": "提供海拔变化的地形特征，如坑、空箱子堆、壁架和阳台等。",
	"Features that either inspire or force characters and their enemies to move around, such as chandeliers, kegs of gunpowder or oil, and whirling blade traps": "激发或迫使人物及其敌人移动的特征，如吊灯、火药桶或油桶，以及旋转的刀片陷阱。",
	"Enemies in hard-to-reach locations or defensive positions, so that characters who normally attack at range are forced to move around the battlefield": "处于难以到达的位置或防御位置的敌人，因此，通常在范围内攻击的角色被迫在战场上移动",
	"Different types of monsters working together": "不同类型的怪物一起工作",
	"As characters explore a wilderness area or dungeon complex, they are bound to encounter the unexpected. Random encounters are a way to deliver the unexpected. They are usually presented in the form of a table. When a random encounter occurs, you roll a die and consult the table to determine what the party encounters.": "当角色探索荒野地区或地下城综合体时，他们一定会遇到意外情况。随机遭遇是提供意外情况的一种方式。它们通常以表格的形式呈现。当随机遭遇发生时，你要掷骰子并参考表格，以确定党派遇到的情况。",
	"Some players and DMs view random encounters in an adventure as time-wasters, yet well-designed random encounters can serve a variety of useful purposes:": "一些玩家和管理员认为冒险中的随机遭遇是浪费时间的，然而精心设计的随机遭遇可以起到各种有用的作用。",
	"Adventurers don't tend to dawdle if the threat of random encounters is hanging over their heads. Wanting to avoid wandering monsters creates a strong incentive to look for a safe place to rest. (Rolling dice behind the DM screen can often accomplish this even without an actual encounter.)": "如果随机遭遇的威胁笼罩在他们的头上，冒险者就不会倾向于磨蹭了。想要避开游荡的怪物，就会产生强烈的动机去寻找一个安全的地方休息。(即使没有实际的遭遇，在DM屏幕后面掷骰子也常常能达到这个目的）。",
	"The appearance of thematically linked creatures as random encounters helps to create a consistent tone and atmosphere for an adventure. For example, an encounter table filled with bats, wraiths, giant spiders, and zombies creates a sense of horror, and tells the adventurers to prepare for battle with even more powerful creatures of the night.": "以随机遭遇的方式出现与主题相关的生物，有助于为冒险创造一致的基调和氛围。例如，一个充满蝙蝠、巫师、巨型蜘蛛和僵尸的遭遇表创造了一种恐怖感，并告诉冒险者要准备与更强大的夜行生物作战。",
	"Random encounters can drain the party's hit points and spell slots, leaving the adventurers feeling underpowered and vulnerable. This creates tension, as players are forced to make decisions based on the fact that their characters aren't at full strength.": "随机遭遇会耗尽队伍的命中率和法术槽，使冒险者感到力量不足和脆弱。这就造成了紧张，因为玩家被迫根据他们的角色没有全力以赴的事实做出决定。",
	"Some random encounters can benefit the characters instead of hindering or harming them. Helpful creatures or NPCs might provide the adventurers with useful information or assistance when they need it most.": "一些随机的遭遇可以使角色受益，而不是阻碍或伤害他们。有帮助的生物或NPC可能会在冒险者最需要的时候为他们提供有用的信息或帮助。",
	"Random encounters can reveal details about your world. They can foreshadow danger or provide hints that will help the adventurers prepare for the encounters to come.": "随机遭遇可以揭示关于你的世界的细节。它们可以预示危险或提供暗示，帮助冒险者为即将到来的遭遇做好准备。",
	"Random encounters can remind the players of the major themes of the campaign. For example, if your campaign features an ongoing war between two nations, you might design random encounter tables to reinforce the ever-present nature of the conflict. In friendly territory, your tables might include bedraggled troops returning from battle, refugees fleeing invading forces, heavily guarded caravans full of weapons, and lone messengers on horseback riding for the front lines. While characters are in hostile territory, the tables might include battlefields littered with the recently slain, armies of evil humanoids on the march, and improvised gibbets holding the bodies of deserters who tried to flee the conflict.": "随机遭遇可以提醒玩家活动的主要主题。例如，如果你的战役的特点是两个国家之间正在进行的战争，你可以设计随机遭遇表来加强冲突的永恒性质。在友好的领土上，你的表格可能包括从战场上回来的衣衫褴褛的军队、逃离入侵部队的难民、满载武器的戒备森严的商队，以及骑着马前往前线的孤独的信使。当人物处于敌对地区时，桌子上可能会出现战场上到处都是最近被杀的人、正在行军的邪恶人形生物大军，以及临时搭建的存放着试图逃离冲突的逃兵尸体的壁垒。",
	"Random encounters should never be tiresome to you or your players. You don't want the players to feel as if they aren't making progress because another random encounter brings their progress to a halt whenever they try to move forward. Likewise, you don't want to spend time distracted by random encounters that add nothing to the adventure narrative or that interfere with the overall pace you're trying to set.": "随机遭遇不应该让你和你的玩家感到厌烦。你不希望玩家觉得他们没有取得进展，因为每当他们试图前进时，另一个随机遭遇就会使他们的进展停顿下来。同样地，你也不希望花时间被那些对冒险叙事毫无帮助的随机遭遇所干扰，或者干扰你试图设定的整体节奏。",
	"Not every DM likes to use random encounters. You might find that they distract from your game or are otherwise causing more trouble than you want. If random encounters don't work for you, don't use them.": "不是每个DM都喜欢使用随机相遇。你可能会发现它们分散了你的游戏的注意力，或者在其他方面造成了比你想要的更多的麻烦。如果随机相遇对你不适用，就不要使用它们。",
	"Because you want random encounters to build on the intended narrative of a game session, not compete with it, you should choose the placement of those encounters carefully. Think about a random encounter under any of the following circumstances:": "因为你想让随机遭遇建立在游戏会话的预期叙事上，而不是与之竞争，所以你应该仔细选择这些遭遇的位置。想一想在以下任何一种情况下的随机遭遇。",
	"The players are getting off track and slowing down the game.": "球员们正在偏离轨道，拖慢了比赛。",
	"The characters stop for a short or long rest.": "角色们停下来进行短暂或长时间的休息。",
	"The characters are undertaking a long, uneventful journey.": "这些人物正在进行一场漫长而不平凡的旅行。",
	"The characters draw attention to themselves when they should be keeping a low profile.": "这些人物在应该保持低调的时候却引起了人们的注意。",
	"You decide when a random encounter happens, or you roll. Consider checking for a random encounter once every hour, once every 4 to 8 hours, or once during the day and once during a long rest-whatever makes the most sense based on how active the area is.": "你决定什么时候发生随机遭遇，或者你来滚。可以考虑每小时检查一次随机遭遇，每4到8小时检查一次，或者在白天和长期休息时各检查一次--根据该地区的活跃程度，以最合理的方式为准。",
	"If you roll, do so with a {@dice d20}. If the result is 18 or higher, a random encounter occurs. You then roll on an appropriate random encounter table to determine what the adventurers meet, re-rolling if the die result doesn't make sense given the circumstances.": "如果你掷骰子，就用{@dice d20}来做。如果结果是18或更高，就会发生一个随机遭遇战。然后你在适当的随机遭遇表上滚动，以确定冒险者遇到了什么，如果在这种情况下，骰子的结果没有意义，就重新滚动。",
	"Random encounter tables might be provided as part of the adventure you're running, or you can use the information in this chapter to build your own. Creating your own tables is the best way to reinforce the themes and flavor of your home campaign.": "随机遭遇表可能作为你正在进行的冒险的一部分提供，或者你可以使用本章的信息来建立你自己的。创建你自己的表格是加强你的家庭活动的主题和风味的最好方法。",
	"Not every run-in with another creature counts as a random encounter. Encounter tables don't usually include rabbits hopping through the undergrowth, harmless rats scurrying through dungeon halls, or average citizens walking through the streets of a city. Random encounter tables present obstacles and events that advance the plot, foreshadow important elements or themes of the adventure, and provide fun distractions.": "并非每一次与其他生物的碰面都算作是随机遭遇。遭遇表通常不包括兔子在树丛中跳跃，无害的老鼠在地牢大厅里乱窜，或者普通市民在城市的街道上行走。随机遭遇表提出的障碍和事件可以推动情节发展，预示着冒险的重要元素或主题，并提供有趣的分心。",
	"Creating your own random encounter tables is straightforward. Determine what sort of encounters might occur in a given dungeon area, figure out the likelihood of a particular encounter occurring, then arrange the results. An \"encounter\" in this case could be a single monster or NPC, a group of monsters or NPCs, a random event (such as an earth tremor or a parade), or a random discovery (such as a charred corpse or a message scrawled on a wall).": "创建你自己的随机遭遇表是很简单的。确定在一个给定的地下城区域可能会发生什么样的遭遇，计算出一个特定的遭遇发生的可能性，然后安排结果。在这种情况下，\"遭遇 \"可以是一个单一的怪物或NPC，一群怪物或NPC，一个随机事件（比如地震或游行），或者一个随机发现（比如一具烧焦的尸体或墙上涂写的信息）。",
	"Once you've established a location through which the adventurers are likely to pass, be it a wilderness area or dungeon complex, make a list of creatures that might be found wandering there. If you're not sure which creatures to include, appendix B has lists of monsters organized by terrain type.": "一旦你确定了冒险者可能会经过的地点，无论是荒野地区还是地牢建筑群，就把可能在那里游荡的生物列出来。如果你不确定要包括哪些生物，附录B有按地形类型排列的怪物清单。",
	"For a sylvan woodland, you might create a table that includes centaurs, faerie dragons, pixies, sprites, dryads, satyrs, blink dogs, elks, owlbears, treants, giant owls, and a unicorn. If elves inhabit the forest, the table might also include elf druids and elf scouts. Perhaps gnolls are threatening the woods, so adding gnolls and hyenas to the table would be a fun surprise for players. Another fun surprise would be a wandering predator, such as a displacer beast that likes to hunt blink dogs.": "对于一个森林地带，你可以创建一个包括半人马、精灵龙、小精灵、干尸、萨提尔、眨眼狗、麋鹿、猫头鹰、树人、巨鸮和独角兽的表格。如果精灵居住在森林里，桌子上可能还包括精灵德鲁伊和精灵侦察兵。也许地精正在威胁着森林，所以在桌子上加入地精和鬣狗，对玩家来说是一个有趣的惊喜。另一个有趣的惊喜是游荡的掠食者，比如喜欢猎杀眨眼狗的流离兽。",
	"The table could also use a few random encounters of a less monstrous nature, such as a grove of burned trees (the handiwork of the gnolls), an ivy-covered elven statue, and a plant with glowing berries that turn creatures invisible when ingested.": "这张桌子还可以使用一些不那么可怕的随机遭遇，比如一片被烧毁的树林（地精的杰作），一个被常春藤覆盖的精灵雕像，以及一种植物，其发光的浆果可以让生物在摄入后隐形。",
	"When choosing monsters for a random encounter table, try to imagine why the monsters would be encountered outside their lairs. What is each monster up to? Is it on patrol? Hunting for food? Searching for something? Also consider whether a creature is moving stealthily as it travels through the area.": "在为随机遭遇表选择怪物时，试着想象为什么会在它们的巢穴之外遇到这些怪物。每个怪物都在做什么？它是在巡逻吗？猎取食物？在寻找什么？还要考虑一个怪物在穿越这个地区时是否在隐蔽地移动。",
	"As with planned encounters, random encounters are more interesting when they happen in memorable locations. Outdoors the adventurers might be crossing a forest clearing when they encounter a unicorn or be pushing through a dense section of forest when they come across a nest of spiders. Crossing a desert, characters might discover an oasis haunted by wights or a rocky outcropping on which a blue dragon perches.": "和计划中的遭遇一样，随机遭遇如果发生在令人难忘的地点，就会更加有趣。在户外，冒险者可能会在穿过一片森林空地时遇到一只独角兽，或者在穿过一片茂密的森林时遇到一窝蜘蛛。在穿越沙漠时，人物可能会发现一个被巫师困扰的绿洲，或者发现一个蓝龙栖息的岩层。",
	"A random encounter table can be created in a number of ways, ranging from simple (roll {@dice 1d6} for one of six possible encounters) to complicated (roll percentile dice, modify for time of day, and cross-index the modified number with the dungeon level). The sample encounter table presented here uses a range of 2 to 20 (nineteen entries total), generated using {@dice 1d12 + 1d8}. The probability curve ensures that encounters appearing in the middle of the table are more likely to occur than encounters placed at the beginning or end of the table. A roll of 2 or 20 is rare (about a {@chance 1} chance of either), while each of the rolls from 9 to 13 occurs a little over 8 percent of the time.": "随机遭遇表可以用多种方式创建，从简单的（从六个可能的遭遇中掷出{@dice 1d6}）到复杂的（掷百分数骰子，根据一天中的时间进行修改，并将修改后的数字与地牢等级交叉索引）。这里介绍的奇遇示例表使用了2到20的范围（共19个条目），使用（%1%）生成。概率曲线确保出现在表格中间的遭遇比放在表格开头或结尾的遭遇更有可能发生。掷出2或20是很罕见的（大约有{@chance 1}的概率），而从9到13的每一次掷出都有8%多一点的时间。",
	"The Sylvan Forest Encounters table is an example of a random encounter table that implements the ideas mentioned above. Creature names in bold refer to stat blocks that appear in the {@i Monster Manual}.": "希尔凡森林遭遇战表是一个实现上述想法的随机遭遇战表的例子。黑体字的生物名称指的是出现在（%0%）的状态块。",
	"A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check find {@creature gnoll} tracks.

	"An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero.": "一座覆盖着常春藤的精灵神灵或英雄的雕像。",
	"{@dice 2d4} {@creature scout||scouts} (elves). One {@creature scout} carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in {@dice 1d4} minutes. New arrivals other than {@creature gnoll||gnolls}, {@creature hyena||hyenas}, {@creature owlbear||owlbears}, and {@creature displacer beast||displacer beasts} are friendly toward the {@creature scout||scouts}.": "{@dice 2d4} {@creature scout||scouts}（精灵）。一个{@creature scout}携带一个号角，可以用它的行动来吹它。如果号角在森林内被吹响，则在此表上再次滚动。如果结果显示有怪物遭遇，则指定的一个或多个怪物会在{@dice 1d4}分钟内到达。除了{@creature gnoll||gnolls}、{@creature hyena||hyenas}、{@creature owlbear||owlbears}和{@creature displacer beast||displacer beasts}以外的新来者对{@creature scout||scouts}是友好的。",
	"A magical plant with {@dice 2d4} glowing berries. A creature that ingests a berry becomes {@condition invisible} for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell.

Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by.": "1 {@creature treant}. 如果队伍中包括一个或多个精灵，或有一个可见的精灵生物陪伴，则（%1%）为友好。如果人物携带明火，（%2%）是敌对的。否则，它是无动于衷的，不会在人物经过时宣布自己的存在。",
	"Random encounters need not be level-appropriate challenges for the adventurers, but it's considered bad form to slaughter a party using a random encounter, since most players consider this ending to be an unsatisfying one.": "随机遭遇不一定是适合冒险者的等级挑战，但用随机遭遇来屠杀一个队伍被认为是不好的做法，因为大多数玩家认为这种结局是不满意的。",
	"Not all random encounters with monsters need to be resolved through combat. A 1st-level party of adventurers could have a random encounter with a young dragon circling above a forest canopy in search of a quick meal, but the characters should have the option to hide or bargain for their lives if the dragon spots them. Similarly, the party might encounter a stone giant roaming the hills, but it might have no intention of harming anyone. In fact, it might shy away from the party because of its reclusive nature. The giant might attack only characters who annoy it.": "并非所有随机遇到的怪物都需要通过战斗来解决。一级冒险者队伍可能会随机遇到一只在森林树冠上盘旋寻找快餐的幼龙，但如果幼龙发现了他们，角色们应该有选择地躲起来或者为自己的生命讨价还价。同样地，玩家可能会遇到一个在山上游荡的石巨人，但它可能无意伤害任何人。事实上，它可能会因为自己的隐蔽性而对队伍敬而远之。巨人可能只攻击那些惹恼它的人物。",
	"A nonplayer character is any character controlled by the Dungeon Master. NPCs can be enemies or allies, regular folk or named monsters.

	"Named monsters that play a significant role in an adventure deserve the same attention you would give to a humanoid NPC, with mannerisms as well as ideals, bonds, flaws, and secrets. If a beholder mastermind is behind the criminal activities in a city, don't rely solely on the entry in the Monster Manual to describe the creature's appearance and personality. Take the time to give it a bit of background, a distinctive quirk of appearance, and especially an ideal, a bond, and a flaw.": "在冒险中扮演重要角色的命名怪物应该得到你对一个人形NPC的同样关注，他们的举止以及理想、羁绊、缺陷和秘密。如果一个城市的犯罪活动背后有一个看守人的主谋，不要仅仅依靠《怪物手册》中的条目来描述这个生物的外表和个性。花点时间给它一点背景，一个独特的古怪的外表，特别是一个理想、一个纽带和一个缺陷。",
	"As an example, consider the Xanathar, a beholder that runs extensive criminal operations in the city of Waterdeep. The Xanathar's spherical body is covered in leathery flesh with a texture similar to cobblestones. Its eyestalks are jointed like the legs of an insect, and some of the stalks have magic rings on them. The Xanathar's speech is slow and deliberate, and it prefers to turn its central eye away from creatures it speaks to. Like all beholders, it sees other creatures as inferiors, though it understands the usefulness of its humanoid minions.": "举个例子，考虑一下Xanathar，一个在Waterdeep市经营大量犯罪活动的beholder。Xanathar的球形身体覆盖着皮革般的肉体，质地类似于鹅卵石。它的眼柄像昆虫的腿一样有关节，有些眼柄上有魔法环。Xanathar的言语缓慢而慎重，它喜欢把中央的眼睛从与它说话的生物身上移开。像所有的观察者一样，它把其他生物看成是下等人，尽管它了解其人形奴仆的用处。",
	"The Xanathar uses the sewers beneath Waterdeep to access virtually any location within or under the city.": "萨纳塔人利用沃特迪普地下的下水道，几乎可以进入城市内部或地下的任何地点。",
	"The Xanathar's ideal is greed. It craves powerful magic items and surrounds itself with gold, platinum, and precious gems. Its bond is to its lair-an elaborate cavern complex carved out between the twisting sewers of Waterdeep, which it inherited from its predecessors and cherishes above all else. Its flaw is a weakness for exotic pleasures: finely prepared foods, scented oils, and rare spices and herbs.": "Xanathar的理想是贪婪。它渴望强大的魔法物品，用黄金、铂金和珍贵的宝石包围自己。它的纽带是它的巢穴--在沃特迪普曲折的下水道之间开辟出的一个精致的洞穴建筑群，它从它的前辈那里继承了这个巢穴，并把它看得高于一切。它的缺点是对异国情调的享受情有独钟：精致的食物、芳香的油、稀有的香料和草药。",
	"Establishing this information allows you to play the Xanathar as more than an ordinary beholder. The complexities of the creature's characterization create more memorable interaction and interesting story possibilities.": "建立这些信息可以使你在扮演Xanathar的时候不只是一个普通的看客。这个生物特征的复杂性创造了更多令人难忘的互动和有趣的故事可能性。",
	"When you give an NPC game statistics, you have three main options: giving the NPC only the few statistics it needs, give the NPC a monster stat block, or give the NPC a class and levels. The latter two options require a bit of explanation.": "当你给一个NPC游戏统计时，你有三个主要的选择：只给NPC它需要的几个统计，给NPC一个怪物统计块，或者给NPC一个等级和级别。后两个选项需要解释一下。",
	"Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains statistics for many generic NPCs that you can customize as you see fit, and chapter 9 of this book offers guidelines on adjusting their statistics and creating a new stat block.": "怪物手册》的附录B包含了许多通用NPC的统计数据，你可以根据自己的需要进行定制，本书的第9章提供了调整它们的统计数据和创建新的统计块的指南。",
	"You can create an NPC just as you would a player character, using the rules in the {@i Player's Handbook}. You can even use a character sheet to keep track of the NPC's vital information.": "你可以像创建玩家角色一样创建一个NPC，使用{@i Player's Handbook}中的规则。你甚至可以用一个角色表来记录NPC的重要信息。",
	"In addition to the class options in the Player's Handbook, two additional class options are available for evil player characters and NPCs: the Death domain for clerics and the oathbreaker for paladins.": "除了《玩家手册》中的等级选项外，还有两个额外的等级选项可供邪恶玩家角色和NPC使用：牧师的死亡领域和圣骑士的破誓者。",
	"Both options are detailed at the end of this chapter.": "这两个选项在本章末尾都有详细说明。",
	"Most NPCs don't need an exhaustive list of equipment. An enemy meant to be faced in combat requires weapons and armor, plus any treasure the NPC carries (including magic items that might be used against the adventurers).": "大多数NPC不需要一个详尽的装备清单。一个要在战斗中面对的敌人需要武器和盔甲，加上NPC携带的任何宝物（包括可能用来对付冒险者的魔法物品）。",
	"An NPC built for combat needs a challenge rating. Use the rules in chapter 9 to determine the NPC's challenge rating, just as you would for a monster you designed.": "一个为战斗而建造的NPC需要一个挑战等级。使用第9章的规则来确定NPC的挑战等级，就像你设计的怪物一样。",
	"NPCs might join the adventuring party because they want a share of the loot and are willing to accept an equal share of the risk, or they might follow the adventurers because of a bond of loyalty, gratitude, or love. Such NPCs are controlled by you, or you can transfer control to the players. Even if a player controls an NPC, it's up to you to make sure the NPC is portrayed as a character in his or her own right, not just as a servant that the players can manipulate for their own benefit.": "NPC可能因为想要分得战利品并愿意接受同等的风险而加入冒险队伍，也可能因为忠诚、感激或爱的纽带而跟随冒险者。这样的NPC是由你控制的，或者你可以把控制权转移给玩家。即使玩家控制了一个NPC，你也要确保把这个NPC描绘成他或她自己的角色，而不仅仅是玩家为了自己的利益可以操纵的仆人。",
	"Any NPC that accompanies the adventurers acts as a party member and earns a full share of experience points. When determining the difficulty of a combat encounter (see chapter 3), make sure to include all NPC party members.": "任何陪伴冒险者的NPC都作为一个党员，并获得全部的经验值。在确定战斗遭遇的难度时（见第三章），要确保包括所有NPC党员。",
	"Your campaign might allow player characters to take on lower-level NPCs as followers. For example, a paladin might have a 1st-level paladin as a squire, a wizard might accept a 2nd-level wizard as an apprentice, a cleric might choose (or be assigned) a 3rd-level cleric as an acolyte, and a bard might take on a 4th-level bard as an understudy.": "你的活动可能允许玩家角色接受低级别的NPC作为追随者。例如，一个圣骑士可能有一个一级圣骑士作为侍从，一个巫师可能接受一个二级巫师作为学徒，一个牧师可能选择（或被指派）一个三级牧师作为追随者，一个吟游诗人可能接受一个四级吟游诗人作为替身。",
	"One advantage of allowing lower-level characters to join the party is that players have backup characters if their main characters take time off, retire, or die. One disadvantage is that you and your players have more party members to account for.": "允许低级别的角色加入派对的一个好处是，如果他们的主要角色休假、退休或死亡，玩家就有后备角色。一个缺点是，你和你的玩家有更多的党员需要考虑。",
	"Since lower-level NPC party members receive equal party shares of XP, they will gain levels more quickly than the adventurers (the benefit of studying under such experienced masters), and might eventually catch up to them. It also means the adventurers' advancement is slowed somewhat, as they must share their XP with an NPC shouldering only part of the adventuring burden.": "由于低级别的NPC党员获得了平等的党内XP份额，他们会比冒险者更快地获得等级（在这种经验丰富的大师手下学习的好处），并可能最终追上他们。这也意味着冒险者的进步会有所减慢，因为他们必须与只承担部分冒险任务的NPC分享他们的XP。",
	"Powerful monsters that are an appropriate challenge for higher-level characters can deal enough damage to instantly kill or incapacitate a low-level follower. The adventurers should expect to spend effort and resources protecting lower-level NPC party members and to provide healing when this protection fails.": "对高等级角色来说是一个适当的挑战的强大怪物可以造成足够的伤害，使低等级随从立即死亡或丧失能力。冒险家们应该花费精力和资源来保护低级别的NPC党员，并在这种保护失败时提供治疗服务。",
	"If you don't have enough players to form a full party, you can use NPCs to fill out the ranks. These NPCs should be the same level as the lowest-level adventurer in the party and built (either by you or your players) using the character creation and advancement rules in the Player's Handbook. It's easiest on you if you let the players create and run these supporting characters.": "如果你没有足够的玩家来组成一个完整的队伍，你可以用NPC来充实队伍。这些NPC应该与队伍中最低级别的冒险者同级，并使用《玩家手册》中的角色创建和升级规则建立（由你或你的玩家建立）。如果你让玩家创建和管理这些辅助人物，对你来说是最容易的。",
	"Encourage players to roleplay supporting characters as true to the NPCs' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws as possible, so that they don't come across as automatons. If you don't feel that an NPC is being portrayed well, you can take control of the NPC, give it to another player, or simply have the NPC leave the party.": "鼓励玩家在扮演配角时，尽可能真实地反映NPC的个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷，这样他们就不会被认为是自动的。如果你觉得某个NPC的形象不好，你可以控制这个NPC，把它交给其他玩家，或者干脆让这个NPC离开聚会。",
	"NPC supporting characters are easier to play if you limit their class options. Good candidates for supporting characters include a cleric with the Life domain, a fighter with the Champion archetype, a rogue with the Thief archetype, and a wizard specializing in Evocation.": "如果你限制他们的等级选择，NPC辅助角色就更容易发挥。辅助角色的良好候选者包括拥有生命领域的牧师、拥有冠军原型的战士、拥有盗贼原型的游荡者，以及擅长唤醒的巫师。",
	"Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those he or she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon or betray the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life debt to the characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be role played or represented by this rule.": "忠诚是一个可选的规则，你可以用它来决定一个NPC党员会在多大程度上保护或协助党的其他成员（甚至是那些他或她并不特别喜欢的成员）。一个被虐待或被忽视的NPC党员很可能会放弃或背叛党，而一个对角色欠下终身债务或与他们有共同目标的NPC则可能为他们战斗到死。忠诚可以通过这个规则来扮演或表现。",
	"An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes—perhaps a character dies or leaves the group—adjust the NPC's loyalty score accordingly.": "一个NPC的忠诚度是以0到20的数值来衡量的。NPC的最大忠诚度等于党内所有冒险者中最高的魅力值，而它的起始忠诚度是这个数字的一半。如果最高的魅力值发生了变化--也许是一个角色死亡或离开了团队--那么就相应地调整NPC的忠诚度得分。",
	"Keep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player's control).": "秘密跟踪NPC的忠诚度分数，这样玩家就不会确定某个NPC党员是忠诚还是不忠诚（即使该NPC目前在玩家的控制之下）。",
	"An NPC's loyalty score increases by {@dice 1d4} if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by {@dice 1d4} if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC's loyalty score can never be raised above its maximum.": "如果其他党员帮助NPC实现与之相关的目标，那么NPC的忠诚度分数会增加（%0%）。同样地，如果NPC受到特别好的对待（例如，得到一件魔法武器作为礼物）或被其他党员救出，NPC的忠诚度分数会增加（%1%）。一个NPC的忠诚度分数永远不能超过其最大值。",
	"When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce the NPC's loyalty score by {@dice 1d4}. Reduce the NPC's loyalty score by {@dice 2d4} if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.": "当其他党员的行为与NPC的排列组合或纽带背道而驰时，减少NPC的忠诚度分数（%0%）。如果该角色被其他党员滥用、误导、或纯粹出于自私的原因而受到危害，则减少该NPC的忠诚度分数（%1%）。",
	"An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.": "忠诚度分数下降到0的NPC不再对党忠诚，并可能与他们分道扬镳。忠诚度的分数永远不能低于0。",
	"An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.": "忠诚度为10分或更高的NPC会冒着生命危险来帮助党内成员。如果NPC的忠诚度分数在1到10之间，它的忠诚度是脆弱的。一个忠诚度下降到0的NPC不再为党的最佳利益而行动。不忠诚的NPC要么离开党派（攻击试图干预的角色），要么秘密地工作，使党派垮台。",
	"Contacts are NPCs with close ties to one or more of the player characters. They don't go on adventures, but they can provide information, rumors, supplies, or professional advice, either for free or at a cost. Some of the backgrounds in the {@i Player's Handbook} suggest creating nonplayer characters contacts for beginning adventurers, and characters are likely to secure more helpful contacts over the course of their adventuring careers.": "联系人是与一个或多个玩家角色有密切联系的NPC。他们不参加冒险，但他们可以免费或有偿地提供信息、传言、物资或专业建议。{@i Player's Handbook}中的一些背景建议为初学的冒险者建立非玩家角色的联系人，而角色在冒险生涯中可能会获得更多有帮助的联系人。",
	"A name and a few choice details are all you need for casual contacts, but take the time to flesh out a recurring contact, especially one who might become an ally or enemy at some point. At the very least, give some thought to a contact's goals and how those goals are likely to come into play.": "一个名字和一些选择的细节是你所需要的，但要花时间来充实一个经常性的联系人，特别是一个可能在某些时候成为盟友或敌人的人。至少，要考虑一下联系人的目标，以及这些目标可能会如何发挥作用。",
	"A patron is a contact who employs the adventurers, providing help or rewards as well as quests and adventure hooks. Most of the time, a patron has a vested interest in the adventurers' success and doesn't need to be persuaded to help them. A patron might be a retired adventurer who seeks younger heroes to deal with rising threats, or a mayor who knows that the town guard can't handle a dragon demanding tribute.": "赞助人是雇用冒险者的联系人，提供帮助或奖励以及任务和冒险钩。大多数时候，赞助人对冒险者的成功有既得利益，不需要被说服来帮助他们。赞助人可能是一位退休的冒险家，他寻求年轻的英雄来应对不断上升的威胁，或者是一位市长，他知道镇上的卫队无法对付要求进贡的龙。",
	"A sheriff becomes a patron by offering a bounty for kobold raiders terrorizing the local countryside, as does a noble who wants an abandoned estate cleared of monsters.": "一位警长为恐吓当地农村的哥布林突袭者提供赏金，从而成为一名赞助人，而一位贵族也希望将一个废弃的庄园中的怪物清理干净。",
	"Adventurers can pay NPCs to provide services in a variety of circumstances. Information on hirelings appears in chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" of the {@i Player's Handbook}.": "冒险家们可以在各种情况下向NPC付费，让他们提供服务。关于雇佣兵的信息出现在{@i Player's Handbook}的第五章 \"装备 \"中。",
	"Hireling NPCs rarely become important in an adventure, and most require little development. When adventurers hire a coach to carry them across town or need a letter delivered, the driver or messenger is a hireling, and the adventurers might never even converse with that NPC or learn his or her name. A ship captain carrying the adventurers across the sea is also a hireling, but such a character has the potential to turn into an ally, a patron, or even an enemy as the adventure unfolds.": "雇佣的NPC很少在冒险中变得重要，而且大多数不需要什么发展。当冒险者雇用马车载他们过镇或需要送信时，司机或信使就是一个雇工，而冒险者甚至可能从未与这个NPC交谈过或知道他或她的名字。载着冒险者过海的船长也是一个雇工，但这样的角色有可能随着冒险的展开而变成一个盟友、一个赞助人，甚至是一个敌人。",
	"When the adventurers hire an NPC for long-term work, add the cost of that NPC's services to the characters' lifestyle expenses. See the \"Additional Expenses\" section of chapter 6, \"Between Adventures,\" for more information.": "当冒险者雇用一个NPC进行长期工作时，将该NPC的服务费用加入到人物的生活费用中。更多信息请参见第6章 \"冒险之间 \"中的 \"额外费用 \"部分。",
	"Extras are the characters and creatures in the background that the main characters rarely, if ever, interact with.": "临时演员是背景中的人物和生物，主角们很少（如果有的话）与之互动。",
	"Extras might be elevated to more important roles by virtue of adventurers singling them out. For instance, a player might be hooked by a passing reference you make to a street urchin and try to strike up a conversation with the youngster. Suddenly, an extra on whom you placed no importance becomes a central figure in an improvised roleplaying scene.": "额外的人可能会因为冒险者的挑剔而被提升为更重要的角色。例如，一个玩家可能被你提到的一个街头流浪汉所吸引，并试图与这个年轻人进行交谈。突然间，一个你不重视的临时演员变成了一个即兴角色扮演场景中的核心人物。",
	"Whenever extras are present, be prepared to come up with names and mannerisms on the fly. In a pinch, you can plunder the race-specific character names found in chapter 2, \"Races,\" of the {@i Player's Handbook}.": "每当有临时演员出现时，要准备好临时想出名字和举止。在紧要关头，你可以掠夺《%0%》第二章 \"种族 \"中的特定种族的角色名称。",
	"By their actions, villains provide job security for heroes. Chapter 3 helps you determine suitable villains for your adventures, while this section helps you flesh out their evil schemes, methods, and weaknesses. Let the tables that follow inspire you.": "通过他们的行动，反派为英雄们提供了工作保障。第三章帮助你为你的冒险确定合适的反派，而本节则帮助你充实他们的邪恶计划、方法和弱点。让后面的表格来启发你。",

A wilderness trek across the Desert of Desolation or a harrowing journey into the jungles of the Isle of Dread can be an exciting adventure in its own right.

	"For example, orcs that dwell in the mines of a ruined dwarf citadel might skirmish constantly against the hobgoblins that hold the citadel's upper tiers. Mind flayers that have established a colony in the lowest levels of the mines could manipulate and dominate key hobgoblins in an attempt to wipe out the orcs. And all the while, a hidden cell of drow scouts watches and plots to slay the mind flayers, then enslave whatever creatures are left.": "例如，居住在废墟矮人城堡的矿井中的兽人可能会不断地与占据城堡上层的哥布林发生冲突。在矿井的最底层建立了一个殖民地的心灵传播者可以操纵和支配关键的哥布林，试图消灭兽人。与此同时，一个由鸦人侦察员组成的秘密小组正在观察和策划，以杀死思想絮乱者，然后奴役剩下的任何生物。",
	"It's easy to think of a dungeon as a collection of encounters, with the adventurers kicking down door after door and killing whatever lies beyond. But the ebb and flow of power between groups in a dungeon provides plenty of opportunities for more subtle interaction. Dungeon denizens are used to striking unlikely alliances, and adventurers are a wild card that canny monsters seek to exploit.": "我们很容易把地下城想成是一个遭遇战的集合，冒险者们踢开一扇又一扇门，杀死门外的任何东西。但是，地牢中群体之间力量的起伏为更微妙的互动提供了大量的机会。地下城居民习惯于结成不可能的联盟，而冒险者则是狡猾的怪物们试图利用的一张野生牌。",
	"Intelligent creatures in a dungeon have goals, whether as simple as short-term survival or as ambitious as claiming the entire dungeon as the first step in founding an empire. Such creatures might approach adventurers with an offer of alliance, hoping to prevent the characters from laying waste to their lair and to secure aid against their enemies. Bring the NPC leaders of such groups to life as described in chapter 4, fleshing out their personalities, goals, and ideals. Then use those elements to shape a response to the arrival of adventurers in their territory.": "地牢中的智能生物都有自己的目标，无论是简单的短期生存，还是雄心勃勃地要求占领整个地牢作为建立帝国的第一步。这类生物可能会向冒险者提出结盟的建议，希望能阻止角色对其巢穴的破坏，并获得对其敌人的援助。按照第4章的描述，让这些团体的NPC领导人活起来，充实他们的个性、目标和理想。然后用这些元素来塑造对冒险家到达其领土的反应。",
	"An inhabited dungeon has its own ecosystem. The creatures that live there need to eat, drink, breathe, and sleep, just as creatures in the wilderness do. Predators need to be able to seek prey, and intelligent creatures search for lairs offering the best combination of air, food, water, and security. Keep these factors in mind when designing a dungeon you want the players to believe in. If a dungeon doesn't have some internal logic to it, adventurers will find it difficult to make reasonable decisions within that environment.": "一个有人居住的地牢有自己的生态系统。生活在那里的生物需要吃、喝、呼吸和睡眠，就像在野外的生物一样。掠食者需要能够寻找猎物，而聪明的生物则要寻找提供空气、食物、水和安全的最佳组合的巢穴。在设计一个你希望玩家相信的地牢时，请牢记这些因素。如果一个地牢没有一些内在的逻辑，冒险者会发现很难在这个环境中做出合理的决定。",
	"For example, characters who find a pool of fresh water in a dungeon might make the logical assumption that many of the creatures inhabiting the dungeon come to that spot to drink. The adventurers might set an ambush at the pool. Likewise, locked doors-or even doors that require hands to open-can restrict the movement of some creatures. If all the doors in a dungeon are closed, the players might wonder how the carrion crawlers or stirges they repeatedly encounter manage to survive.": "例如，在地牢中发现一池清水的角色可能会做出合乎逻辑的假设，即居住在地牢中的许多生物都会到这个地方来喝水。冒险家们可能会在水池边设下埋伏。同样地，上了锁的门--甚至是需要用手才能打开的门--也会限制一些生物的行动。如果地牢里所有的门都关着，玩家可能会想，他们反复遇到的腐尸爬行者或搅屎棍是如何生存的。",
	"You might be inclined to increase the encounter difficulty as the adventurers descend deeper into the dungeon, as a way to keep the dungeon challenging as the characters gain levels or to ratchet up the tension. However, this approach can turn the dungeon into a grind. A better approach is to include encounters of varying difficulty throughout. The contrast between easy and hard encounters, as well as simple and complex encounters, encourages characters to vary their tactics and keeps the encounters from seeming too similar.": "你可能会倾向于在冒险者深入地下城的过程中增加遭遇的难度，以此来保持地下城在角色获得等级时的挑战性，或者增加紧张感。然而，这种方法会使地下城变成一种磨练。一个更好的方法是在整个过程中包括不同难度的遭遇。简单和困难的遭遇，以及简单和复杂的遭遇之间的对比，鼓励角色改变他们的战术，使遭遇看起来不会太相似。",
	"Every dungeon needs a map showing its layout. The dungeon's location, creator, purpose, history, and inhabitants should give you a starting point for designing your dungeon map. If you need further inspiration, you can find maps that have been made freely available for use on the Internet, or even use a map of a real-world location. Alternatively, you can borrow a map from a published adventure or randomly generate a dungeon complex using the tables presented in appendix A.": "每个地牢都需要一张显示其布局的地图。地牢的位置、创建者、目的、历史和居民应该为你设计地牢地图提供一个起点。如果你需要更多的灵感，你可以在互联网上找到可以免费使用的地图，甚至可以使用真实世界的地图。另外，你也可以从已出版的冒险故事中借用一张地图，或者使用附录A中的表格随机生成一个地下城综合体。",

	"The adventurers' goal often lies as far from the dungeon entrance as possible, forcing characters to delve deeper underground or push farther into the heart of the complex.": "冒险者的目标往往离地牢的入口越远越好，迫使人物深入地下或向复杂的中心地带推进。",
	"A dungeon is most easily mapped on graph paper, with each square on the paper representing an area of 10 feet by 10 feet. (If you play with miniatures on a grid, you might prefer a scale where each square represents 5 feet, or you can subdivide your 10-foot grid into a 5-foot grid when you draw your maps for combat.) When you draw your map, keep the following points in mind:": "地牢最容易在图画纸上绘制，纸上的每个方格代表10英尺乘10英尺的区域。（如果你在网格上玩微缩模型，你可能更喜欢每个方格代表5英尺的比例，或者你可以在绘制战斗地图时将10英尺的网格细分为5英尺的网格）。当你绘制地图时，请牢记以下几点。",
	"Asymmetrical rooms and map layouts make a dungeon less predictable.": "不对称的房间和地图布局使地牢的可预测性降低。",
	"Think in three dimensions. Stairs, ramps, platforms, ledges, balconies, pits, and other changes of elevation make a dungeon more interesting and make combat encounters in those areas more challenging.": "三维思考。楼梯、坡道、平台、壁架、阳台、坑和其他海拔变化使地牢更加有趣，并使这些区域的战斗遭遇更具挑战性。",
	"Give the dungeon some wear and tear. Unless you want to stress that the dungeon's builders were extraordinarily skillful, collapsed passages can be commonplace, cutting off formerly connected sections of the dungeon from each other. Past earthquakes might have opened chasms within a dungeon, splitting rooms and corridors to make interesting obstacles.": "给地牢一些磨损。除非你想强调地牢的建造者是非常有技巧的，否则坍塌的通道是很常见的，将地牢中以前相连的部分相互切断。过去的地震可能会在地牢中打开裂缝，使房间和走廊分裂，从而形成有趣的障碍。",
	"Incorporate natural features into even a constructed dungeon. An underground stream might run through the middle of a dwarven stronghold, causing variation in the shapes and sizes of rooms and necessitating features such as bridges and drains.": "在建造的地牢中也要融入自然特征。一条地下溪流可能会穿过矮人据点的中央，导致房间的形状和大小发生变化，并需要诸如桥梁和排水管等特征。",
	"Add multiple entrances and exits. Nothing gives the players a stronger sense of making real decisions than having multiple ways to enter a dungeon.": "增加多个入口和出口。没有什么比有多种方式进入地牢更能让玩家有一种做出真正决定的感觉。",
	"Add secret doors and secret rooms to reward players who take the time to search for them.": "增加秘密门和秘密房间，以奖励那些花时间寻找的玩家。",
	"If you need help creating a dungeon map from scratch, see appendix A.": "如果你需要帮助从头开始创建一个地下城地图，请参阅附录A。",
	"The atmosphere and physical characteristics of dungeons vary as widely as their origins. An old crypt might have stone walls and loose wooden doors, an odor of decay, and no light other than what adventurers bring with them. A volcanic lair might have smooth stone walls hollowed out by past eruptions, doors of magically reinforced brass, a smell of sulfur, and light provided by jets of flame in every hall and room.": "地牢的气氛和物理特征与它们的起源一样千差万别。一个古老的地窖可能有石墙和松动的木门，有腐烂的气味，除了冒险者带来的光线外没有其他光线。火山巢穴可能有被过去的火山喷发掏空的光滑石墙，有魔法加固的黄铜门，有硫磺的气味，每个大厅和房间都有火焰喷射器提供的光线。",
	"Some dungeons have walls of masonry. Others have walls of solid rock, hewn with tools to give them a rough, chiseled look, or worn smooth by the passage of water or lava. An aboveground dungeon might be made of wood or composite materials.": "有些地牢的墙壁是砖石结构的。另一些地牢的墙壁是由坚固的岩石构成的，用工具凿出的墙壁看起来很粗糙，或者被水或熔岩磨得很光滑。地上的地牢可能是由木材或复合材料制成的。",
	"Walls are sometimes adorned with murals, frescoes, bas-reliefs, and lighting fixtures such as sconces or torch brackets. A few even have secret doors built into them.": "墙壁上有时会有壁画、壁画、浮雕和照明装置，如壁灯或火炬支架等装饰。有几个甚至在里面建有秘密门。",
	"Dungeon doorways might be set within plain arches and lintels. They might be festooned with carvings of gargoyles or leering faces or engraved with sigils that reveal clues as to what lies beyond.": "地下城的门洞可能被设置在普通的拱门和门楣上。它们可能被刻上石像鬼或猥亵的面孔，或者被刻上符号，揭示出后面的线索。",
	"Dungeon doors often become stuck when not used frequently. Opening a stuck door requires a successful Strength check. Chapter 8, \"Running the Game,\" provides guidelines for setting the DC.": "地下城的门在不经常使用的情况下经常会被卡住。打开被卡住的门需要成功的力量检查。第8章，\"运行游戏\"，提供了设置DC的指南。",
	"Characters who don't have the key to a locked door can pick the lock with a successful Dexterity check (doing so requires {@item thieves' tools|phb} and proficiency in their use). They can also force the door with a successful Strength check, smash the door to pieces by dealing enough damage to it, or use a knock spell or similar magic. Chapter 8 provides guidelines for setting the DCs and assigning statistics to doors and other objects.": "没有锁着的门的钥匙的角色可以通过成功的灵巧检查来撬锁（这样做需要{@item thieves' tools|phb}和对其使用的熟练程度）。他们也可以通过成功的力量检查来强行开门，通过对门造成足够的伤害将其砸成碎片，或者使用敲门咒语或类似的魔法。第8章提供了设置DC和为门和其他物体分配统计数据的指南。",
	"A barred door is similar to a locked door, except that there's no lock to pick, and the door can be opened normally from the barred side by using an action to lift the bar from its braces.": "栅栏门与锁着的门相似，只是没有锁可以撬，可以用动作将栅栏从支架上抬起来，从有栅栏的一侧正常打开。",
	"A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff marks on the floor betray the secret door's presence.": "秘密门的制作是为了融入它周围的墙壁。有时，墙壁上微弱的裂缝或地板上的擦痕会出卖暗门的存在。",
	"Use the characters' passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores to determine whether anyone in the party notices a secret door without actively searching for it. Characters can also find a secret door by actively searching the location where the door is hidden and succeeding on a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. To set an appropriate DC for the check, see chapter 8.": "使用角色的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）分数来确定聚会中是否有人注意到了暗门，而不用主动去寻找它。角色也可以通过主动搜索门所隐藏的位置，并通过智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查来找到暗门。要为该检查设定一个合适的DC，请参见第8章。",
	"Once a secret door is detected, a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check might be required to determine how to open it if the opening mechanism isn't obvious. Set the DC according to the difficulty guidelines in chapter 8.": "一旦发现暗门，如果开启机制不明显，可能需要成功的智力检查（（%0%））来确定如何打开它。根据第8章的难度指南设定DC。",
	"If adventurers can't determine how to open a secret door, breaking it down is always an option. Treat it as a locked door made of the same material as the surrounding wall, and use the guidelines in chapter 8 to determine appropriate DCs or statistics.": "如果冒险家们不能确定如何打开一扇秘密的门，把它拆开总是一种选择。把它当作一扇与周围墙壁材质相同的锁住的门，并使用第8章中的指南来确定适当的DC或统计数据。",
	"A concealed door is a normal door that is hidden from view. A secret door is carefully crafted to blend into its surrounding surface, whereas a concealed door is most often hidden by mundane means. It might be covered by a tapestry, covered with plaster, or (in the case of a concealed trapdoor) hidden under a rug. Normally, no ability check is required to find a concealed door. A character need only look in the right place or take the right steps to reveal the door. However, you can use the characters' passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores to determine whether any of them notices tracks or signs of a tapestry or rug having been recently disturbed.": "隐蔽的门是一种隐藏起来的普通门。暗门是精心制作的，与周围的表面融为一体，而暗门则最常以世俗的方式隐藏起来。它可能被挂毯覆盖，被石膏覆盖，或者（在隐蔽的活板门的情况下）藏在地毯下面。通常情况下，找到一个隐藏的门不需要检查能力。一个角色只需要在正确的地方寻找，或者采取正确的步骤，就可以发现门。然而，你可以使用人物的被动智慧（（%0%））得分来确定他们中是否有人注意到挂毯或地毯最近被打乱的痕迹或迹象。",
	"A portcullis is a set of vertical bars made of wood or iron, reinforced with one or more horizontal bands. It blocks a passage or archway until it is raised up into the ceiling by a winch and chain. The main benefit of a portcullis is that it blocks a passage while still allowing guards to watch the area beyond and make ranged attacks or cast spells through it.": "舷窗是一套由木头或铁制成的垂直杆，用一条或多条水平带加固。它可以阻挡通道或拱门，直到用绞盘和链条将其提升到天花板。舷窗的主要好处是，它在堵住通道的同时，还能让守卫观察外面的区域，并通过它进行远程攻击或施展法术。",
	"Winching a portcullis up or down requires an action. If a character can't reach the winch (usually because it is on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis or bending its bars far enough apart to pass through them requires a successful Strength check. The DC of the check depends on the size and weight of the portcullis or the thickness of its bars. To determine an appropriate DC, see chapter 8.": "绞起舷梯需要一个动作。如果一个角色不能够到绞盘（通常是因为它在舷窗的另一边），举起舷窗或者把它的栅栏弯曲到足以通过它们，需要成功的力量检查。检验的DC取决于舷窗的大小和重量或其杆的厚度。要确定一个合适的DC，见第8章。",
	"Darkness is the default condition inside an underground complex or in the interior of aboveground ruins, but an inhabited dungeon might have light sources.": "在地下建筑群或地上废墟的内部，黑暗是默认状态，但有人居住的地牢可能有光源。",
	"In subterranean settlements, even races that have darkvision use fire for warmth, cooking, and defense. But many creatures have no need of warmth or light. Adventurers must bring their own sources of light into dusty tombs where only undead stand guard, abandoned ruins teeming with predatory monsters and oozes, and natural caverns where sightless creatures hunt.": "在地下定居点，即使是拥有黑暗视觉的种族也会用火来取暖、烹饪和防御。但许多生物不需要温暖或光线。冒险者必须带着自己的光源进入只有亡灵站岗的尘土飞扬的墓穴、充斥着掠夺性怪物和渗出物的废弃废墟，以及没有视力的生物狩猎的天然洞穴。",
	"The light of a torch or lantern helps a character see over a short distance, but other creatures can see that light source from far away. Bright light in an environment of total darkness can be visible for miles, though a clear line of sight over such a distance is rare underground. Even so, adventurers using light sources in a dungeon often attract monsters, just as dungeon features that shed light (from phosphorescent fungi to the glow of magical portals) can draw adventurers' attention.": "手电筒或灯笼的光线可以帮助人物看清短距离内的情况，但其他生物可以从很远的地方看到这个光源。在完全黑暗的环境中，明亮的光线可以在数英里外看到，尽管在地下很少有如此远的清晰视线。即便如此，在地牢中使用光源的冒险者往往会吸引怪物，就像地牢中发光的特征（从磷光真菌到魔法门的光芒）可以吸引冒险者的注意。",
	"Subterranean tunnels and aboveground ruins are often enclosed spaces with little airflow. Though it's rare for a dungeon to be sealed so tightly that adventurers have trouble breathing, the atmosphere is often stifling and oppressive. What's more, odors linger in a dungeon and can be magnified by the stillness of the atmosphere.": "地下隧道和地上遗迹通常是封闭的空间，空气流通不畅。虽然地牢很少会被封得如此严密，以至于冒险者呼吸困难，但气氛往往是令人窒息和压抑的。更重要的是，气味会在地牢中萦绕，并且会被静止的气氛所放大。",
	"A dungeon's enclosed geography helps channel sound. The groaning creak of an opening door can echo down hundreds of feet of passageway. Louder noises such as the clanging hammers of a forge or the din of battle can reverberate through an entire dungeon. Many creatures that live underground use such sounds as a way of locating prey, or go on alert at any sound of an adventuring party's intrusion.": "地牢的封闭式地理环境有助于引导声音。一扇门打开时发出的呻吟声可以在数百英尺的通道上回响。更大的声音，如锻造的铁锤声或战斗的喧嚣声可以在整个地牢中回荡。许多生活在地下的生物利用这种声音来确定猎物的位置，或者对冒险队的任何入侵声音保持警惕。",
	"The hazards described here are but a few examples of the environmental dangers found underground and in other dark places. Dungeon hazards are functionally similar to traps, which are described at the end of this chapter.": "这里描述的危险只是地下和其他黑暗地方的环境危险的几个例子。地牢中的危险在功能上与陷阱相似，本章末尾将介绍陷阱。",
	"No ability check is required to spot a hazard unless it is hidden. A hazard that resembles something benign, such as a patch of slime or mold, can be correctly identified with a successful Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 to set an appropriate DC for any check made to spot or recognize a hazard.": "除非危险是隐藏的，否则不需要检查能力来发现它。一个类似于良性事物的危险，比如一片粘液或霉菌，可以通过成功的智力（（%0%））检查来正确识别。使用第8章中的准则为任何发现或识别危险的检查设定一个适当的DC。",
	"To determine a hazard's deadliness relative to the characters, think of the hazard as a trap and compare the damage it deals with the party's level using the Damage Severity by Level table later in the chapter (the table also appears in chapter 8).": "要确定一个危险相对于角色的致命性，可将该危险视为一个陷阱，并使用本章后面的 \"按等级划分的伤害严重程度表 \"来比较它所造成的伤害（该表也出现在第八章）。",
	"See the ": "请看",
	" for more information.": " 欲了解更多信息。",
	"Between the dungeons and settlements of your campaign world lie meadows, forests, deserts, mountain ranges, oceans, and other tracts of wilderness waiting to be traversed. Bringing wilderness areas to life can be a fun part of your game, both for you and your players.": "在你的战役世界的地下城和定居点之间，有草地、森林、沙漠、山脉、海洋和其他大片的荒野，等待你去穿越。对你和你的玩家来说，让荒野地区充满生机可以成为游戏的一个有趣部分。",
	"The following two approaches work particularly well.": "以下两种方法效果特别好。",
	"Sometimes the destination is more important than the journey. If the purpose of a wilderness trek is to get the characters to where the real adventure happens, gloss over the wilderness trek without checking for encounters along the way. Just as movies use travel montages to convey long and arduous journeys in a matter of seconds, you can use a few sentences of descriptive text to paint a picture of a wilderness trek in your players' minds before moving on.": "有时，目的地比旅程更重要。如果荒野跋涉的目的是把人物带到真正的冒险发生的地方，那么就把荒野跋涉的内容一笔带过，不检查沿途的遭遇。就像电影用旅行蒙太奇在几秒钟内表达漫长而艰辛的旅程一样，你可以用几句描述性的文字在玩家的脑海中描绘出荒野跋涉的画面，然后再继续前进。",
	"Describe the journey as vividly as you like, but keep the forward momentum. \"You walk for several miles and encounter nothing of interest\" is okay, but far less evocative and memorable than, \"A light rain dampens the rolling plains as you travel north. Around midday, you break for lunch under a lonely tree. There, the rogue finds a small rock that looks like a grinning face, but otherwise you encounter nothing out of the ordinary.\" The trick is to focus on a few details that reinforce the desired mood rather than describe everything down to the last blade of grass.": "尽可能生动地描述旅程，但要保持前进的势头。\"你走了几英里，没有遇到什么有趣的事情 \"是可以的，但远不如 \"当你向北行进时，一场小雨打湿了起伏的平原 \"更令人回味和难忘。中午时分，你们在一棵孤独的树下休息吃午饭。在那里，流氓发现了一块小石头，看起来像一张笑脸，但除此之外，你没有遇到什么不寻常的事情。\" 诀窍是把重点放在加强所需情绪的几个细节上，而不是把一切都描述到最后一片草叶上。",
	"Call attention to unusual terrain features: a waterfall, a rocky outcropping that offers a breathtaking view over the tops of the surrounding trees, an area where the forest has burned or been cut down, and so on. Also describe notable smells and sounds, such as the roar of a faraway monster, the stench of burned wood, or the sweet aroma of flowers in an elven forest.": "提请注意不寻常的地形特征：一个瀑布、一个可以俯瞰周围树顶的岩石、一个森林被烧毁或被砍伐的地方，等等。还可以描述值得注意的气味和声音，如远处怪物的吼叫声、烧焦的木材的臭味，或精灵森林中花朵的甜美香气。",
	"In addition to evocative language, visual aids can help set the scene for the characters' travels. Image searches on the Internet can lead you to breathtaking landscapes (in fact, that's a good phrase to search for) both real and fantastical. As striking as real-world scenery can be, wilderness travel can be used to remind the players that their characters are in a fantasy world. Once in a while, spice up your descriptions with some truly magical element. A forest might be home to tiny dragonets instead of birds, or its trees might be festooned with giant webs or have eerie, green-glowing sap. Use these elements sparingly; landscapes that are too alien can break your players' sense of immersion in the world. A single fantastic element within an otherwise realistic and memorable landscape is enough.": "除了令人回味的语言外，视觉辅助工具可以帮助为人物的旅行设置场景。在互联网上搜索图片，可以看到令人惊叹的风景（事实上，这是一个很好的搜索短语），包括真实的和幻想的风景。与现实世界的风景一样引人注目，荒野旅行可以用来提醒玩家，他们的角色是在一个幻想的世界里。偶尔也可以用一些真正的魔法元素来为你的描述增添色彩。一座森林可能是小龙女的家，而不是鸟类的家，或者它的树木可能有巨大的网，或者有阴森的、发绿光的树液。谨慎地使用这些元素；过于陌生的景观会破坏玩家对世界的沉浸感。在一个现实的、令人难忘的景观中，有一个奇妙的元素就足够了。",
	"Use the landscape to set the mood and tone for your adventure. In one forest, close-set trees shroud all light and seem to watch the adventurers as they pass.": "利用景观来为你的冒险设定气氛和基调。在一个森林里，密密麻麻的树木遮住了所有的光线，似乎在看着冒险家们经过。",
	"In another, sunlight streams through the leaves above and flower-laden vines twine up every trunk. Signs of corruption-rotting wood, foul-smelling water, and rocks covered with slimy brown moss-can be a signal that the adventurers are drawing close to the site of evil power that is their destination or can provide clues to the nature of the threats to be found there.": "在另一个地方，阳光穿过上方的树叶，开满鲜花的藤蔓缠绕在每根树干上。腐败的迹象--腐烂的木头、发臭的水和覆盖着粘稠的棕色苔藓的岩石--可能是一个信号，表明冒险者正在接近他们的目的地--邪恶力量的所在地，或者可以提供关于在那里发现的威胁的性质的线索。",
	"Specific wilderness locations might have their own special features. For example, the Spirit Forest and the Spider haunt Woods might feature different kinds of trees, different kinds of flora and fauna, different weather, and different random encounter tables.": "特定的荒野地点可能有自己的特殊功能。例如，精神森林和蜘蛛出没的森林可能有不同种类的树木、不同种类的动植物、不同的天气和不同的随机遭遇表。",
	"Finally, a wilderness trek can be enhanced by calling attention to the weather. \"You spend the next three days crossing the swamp\" sounds less harrowing than, \"You spend the next three days trudging through knee-deep mud-the first two days and nights in the pouring rain, and then another day under the beating sun, with swarms of hungry insects feasting on your blood.\"": "最后，可以通过提醒注意天气来加强野外徒步旅行。\"你花三天时间穿越沼泽 \"听起来没有 \"你花三天时间在齐膝深的泥浆中跋涉--前两天和晚上在瓢泼大雨中，然后在烈日下再走一天，成群的饥饿昆虫在你的血液中大快朵颐 \"那么令人痛心。",
	"Sometimes the journey deserves as much time and attention as the destination. If wilderness travel features prominently in your adventure and isn't something you want to gloss over, you will need more than a descriptive overview to bring a long and harrowing journey to life; you'll need to know the party's marching order and have encounters at the ready.": "有时，旅程和目的地一样值得花时间和注意力。如果荒野旅行在你的冒险中占有突出的地位，并且不是你想敷衍了事的，那么你需要的不仅仅是描述性的概述，以使漫长而艰苦的旅程变得生动；你需要知道队伍的行进顺序，并准备好遭遇。",
	"Let your players determine the party's marching order (see the {@i Player's Handbook} for more information). Characters in the front rank are likely to be the first to notice landmarks and terrain features, as well as the ones responsible for navigating. Characters in the back rank are usually responsible for making sure that the party isn't being followed. Encourage characters in the middle ranks to do something other than blindly trudge along behind the front-rank characters. The {@i Player's Handbook} suggests activities such as mapmaking and foraging for food.": "让你的玩家决定队伍的行军顺序（更多信息见{@i Player's Handbook}）。处于前排的角色可能是第一个注意到地标和地形特征的人，也是负责导航的人。后排的角色通常负责确保队伍没有被跟踪。鼓励中层人物做一些事情，而不是盲目地跟在前层人物后面跋涉。{@i Player's Handbook}建议做一些活动，如绘制地图和觅食。",
	"Wilderness journeys typically feature a combination of planned encounters (encounters that you prepare ahead of time) and random encounters (encounters determined by rolling on a table). A planned encounter might need a map of the location where the encounter is set to occur, such as a ruin, a bridge spanning a gorge, or some other memorable location. Random encounters tend to be less location-specific. The fewer planned encounters you have, the more you'll need to rely on random encounters to keep the journey interesting. See chapter 3 for guidelines on creating your own random encounter tables and when to check for random encounters.": "荒野之旅通常有计划的遭遇（你提前准备的遭遇）和随机的遭遇（通过在桌子上滚动决定的遭遇）的组合。计划中的遭遇战可能需要一张遭遇战发生地点的地图，比如一个废墟、一座横跨峡谷的桥，或者其他一些令人难忘的地点。随机遭遇战往往没有那么多特定的地点。计划中的奇遇越少，你就越需要依靠随机奇遇来保持旅程的趣味性。关于创建你自己的随机遭遇表以及何时检查随机遭遇的准则，请参见第3章。",
	"A good way to keep wilderness encounters from becoming stale is to make sure they don't all start and end the same way. In other words, if the wilderness is your stage and your adventure is the play or movie, think of each wilderness encounter as its own scene, and try to stage each one in a slightly different way to keep your players' interest. If one encounter comes at the adventurers from the front, the next one might come at them from above or behind. If an encounter features stealthy monsters, a character tending to the party's pack animals might get the first indication that monsters are near when a pony whickers nervously. If an encounter features loud monsters, the party might have the option to hide or set an ambush. One group of monsters might attack the party on sight, and another might allow safe passage for food.": "防止荒野遭遇战变得陈旧的一个好方法是确保它们的开始和结束方式不尽相同。换句话说，如果荒野是你的舞台，而你的冒险是戏剧或电影，那么就把每一次荒野遭遇当作它自己的场景，并尝试以稍微不同的方式上演每一次，以保持玩家的兴趣。如果一个遭遇从前面向冒险者袭来，下一个就可能从上面或后面向他们袭来。如果一个遭遇的特点是隐蔽的怪物，那么照看队伍中的动物的角色可能会在小马紧张地鸣叫时得到怪物接近的第一个迹象。如果遇到的是大声喧哗的怪物，队伍可能会选择躲起来或设置埋伏。一群怪物可能会当场攻击队伍，而另一群怪物可能会允许安全通过以获取食物。",
	"Reward characters for searching while they travel by providing things for them to find. Broken statues, tracks, abandoned campsites, and other finds can add flavor to your world, foreshadow future encounters or events, or provide hooks for further adventures. A wilderness journey might take multiple sessions to play out. That said, if the wilderness journey includes long periods with no encounters, use the travel-montage approach to bridge gaps between encounters.": "奖励人物在旅行中的搜索，为他们提供寻找的东西。破碎的雕像、足迹、废弃的营地和其他发现可以为你的世界增添风味，预示着未来的遭遇或事件，或者为进一步的冒险提供钩子。一个荒野之旅可能需要多节课才能完成。也就是说，如果荒野之旅中有很长一段时间没有遭遇战，可以使用旅行蒙太奇的方法来弥补遭遇战之间的空隙。",
	"In contrast to a dungeon, an outdoor setting presents seemingly limitless options. The adventurers can move in any direction over a trackless desert or an open grassland, so how do you as the DM deal with all the possible locations and events that might make up a wilderness campaign? What if you design an encounter in a desert oasis, but the characters miss the oasis because they wander off course? How do you avoid creating a boring play session of uninterrupted slogging across a rocky wasteland?": "与地牢相比，户外环境提供了似乎是无限的选择。冒险者们可以在无路可走的沙漠或开阔的草原上向任何方向移动，那么，作为DM，你如何处理所有可能的地点和事件，这些都可能构成一个荒野活动？如果你在沙漠绿洲中设计了一个遭遇战，但角色们却因为走错了方向而错过了绿洲，怎么办？你如何避免创造一个无聊的游戏环节，不间断地在岩石荒地上艰难跋涉？",
	"One solution is to think of an outdoor setting in the same way you think about a dungeon. Even the most wide-open terrain presents clear pathways. Roads seldom run straight because they follow the contours of the land, finding the most level or otherwise easiest routes across uneven ground. Valleys and ridges channel travel in certain directions. Mountain ranges present forbidding barriers traversed only by remote passes. Even the most trackless desert reveals favored routes, where explorers and caravan drivers have discovered areas of wind-blasted rock that are easier to traverse than shifting sand.": "一个解决方案是用思考地牢的方式来思考户外环境。即使是最开阔的地形也有清晰的路径。道路很少是笔直的，因为它们遵循土地的轮廓，在不平坦的地面上寻找最平坦或其他最容易的路线。山谷和山脊将旅行引向某些方向。山脉呈现出令人望而却步的障碍，只有在遥远的通道上才能穿行。即使是最无迹可寻的沙漠，也显示出有利的路线，探险家和大篷车司机在那里发现了被风吹过的岩石区域，比移动的沙子更容易穿行。",
	"If the party veers off track, you might be able to relocate one or more of your planned encounters elsewhere on the map to ensure that the time spent preparing those encounters doesn't go to waste.": "如果队伍偏离了轨道，你也许可以把一个或多个计划中的遭遇战转移到地图上的其他地方，以确保准备这些遭遇战的时间不会被浪费。",
	"Chapter 1 discusses the basics of creating a wilderness map at three different scales to help you design your world and the starting area of your campaign. Especially when you get down to province scale (1 hex = 1 mile), think about paths of travel-roads, passes, ridges and valleys, and so on-that can guide character movement across your map.": "第一章讨论了在三种不同比例尺下创建荒野地图的基础知识，以帮助你设计你的世界和战役的起始区域。特别是当你缩小到省的规模时（1个六角星=1英里），要考虑旅行的路径--道路、通道、山脊和山谷等等--可以引导角色在地图上移动。",
	"Narrate wilderness travel at a level of detail appropriate to the map you're using. If you're tracking hour-by-hour movement on a province-scale map (1 hex = 1 mile), you can describe each hamlet the adventurers pass. At this scale, you can assume that the characters find a noteworthy location when they enter its hex unless the site is specifically hidden. The characters might not walk directly up to the front door of a ruined castle when they enter a hex, but they can find old paths, outlying ruins, and other signs of its presence in the area.": "叙述荒野旅行的详细程度要与你所使用的地图相适应。如果你在一张全省范围的地图（1个六角星=1英里）上追踪每小时的移动，你可以描述冒险者们经过的每一个小村庄。在这个比例尺上，你可以假设人物在进入一个值得注意的地点时，会发现该地点，除非该地点被特别隐藏。当人物进入一个六边形区域时，他们可能不会直接走到一座废墟城堡的门前，但他们可以找到古老的道路、外围的废墟，以及该地区存在的其他迹象。",
	"If you're tracking a journey of several days on a kingdom-scale map (1 hex = 6 miles), don't bother with details too small to appear on your map. It's enough for the players to know that on the third day of their journey, they cross a river and the land starts rising before them, and that they reach the mountain pass two days later.": "如果你要在王国规模的地图上追踪几天的旅程（1个六角星=6英里），就不要为太小的细节费心，以免在地图上出现。玩家只需知道在旅程的第三天，他们渡过了一条河，土地在他们面前开始上升，两天后他们到达了山口，这就足够了。",
	"No wilderness map is complete without a few settlements, strongholds, ruins, and other sites worthy of discovery. A dozen such locations scattered over an area roughly 50 miles across is a good start.": "没有几个定居点、据点、废墟和其他值得发现的地点，任何荒野地图都是不完整的。在一个大约50英里长的区域内散布十几个这样的地点是一个好的开始。",
	"A wilderness area approximately 50 miles across can support roughly a half-dozen monster lairs, but probably no more than one apex predator such as a dragon.": "一个大约50英里宽的荒野地区可以支持大约半打的怪物巢穴，但可能不超过一个顶级掠食者，如龙。",
	"If you expect the characters to explore a monster's lair, you'll need to find or create an appropriate map for the lair and stock the lair as you would a dungeon.": "如果你希望人物探索怪物的巢穴，你需要为巢穴找到或创建一个合适的地图，并像对待地下城一样为巢穴配备物资。",
	"In places where civilization rules or once ruled, adventurers might find monuments built to honor great leaders, gods, and cultures.

	"When you draw a map for a settlement in your game, don't worry about the placement of every building, and concentrate instead on the major features.": "当你为游戏中的定居点绘制地图时，不要担心每一个建筑的位置，而要集中精力于主要特征。",
	"For a village, sketch out the roads, including trade routes leading beyond the village and roads that connect outlying farms to the village center. Note the location of the village center. If the adventurers visit specific places in the village, mark those spots on your map.": "对于一个村庄，要勾画出道路，包括通往村外的贸易路线和连接外围农场与村中心的道路。注意村子中心的位置。如果冒险家们访问了村子里的特定地点，请在地图上标出这些地点。",
	"For towns and cities, note major roads and waterways as well as surrounding terrain. Outline the walls and mark the locations of features you know will be important: the lord's keep, significant temples, and the like. For cities, add internal walls and think about the personality of each ward. Give the wards names reflecting their personalities, which also identify the kinds of trades that dominate the neighborhood (Tannery Square, Temple Row), a geographical characteristic (Hilltop, Riverside), or a dominant site (the Lords' Quarter).": "对于城镇，注意主要道路和水路以及周围的地形。勾勒出城墙的轮廓，并标出你所知道的重要特征的位置：领主的住所、重要的寺庙等等。对于城市来说，增加内墙并考虑每个区的个性。给各区起一个反映其个性的名字，同时也要确定在该区占主导地位的行业种类（制革厂广场、圣殿街）、地理特征（山顶、河边）或主导地点（领主区）。",
	"Although they hold the promise of safety, cities and towns can be just as dangerous as the darkest dungeon. Evil hides in plain sight or in dark corners. Sewers, shadowy alleys, slums, smoke-filled taverns, dilapidated tenements, and crowded marketplaces can quickly turn into battlegrounds. On top of that, adventurers must learn to behave themselves, lest they attract unwanted attention from local authorities.": "尽管城市和城镇拥有安全的承诺，但它们可以像最黑暗的地牢一样危险。邪恶隐藏在众目睽睽之下或黑暗的角落里。下水道、阴暗的小巷、贫民窟、烟雾缭绕的酒馆、破旧的公寓和拥挤的市场都可以迅速变成战场。除此之外，冒险者必须学会表现自己，以免引起当地政府不必要的注意。",
	"That said, characters who don't go looking for trouble can take advantage of all the benefits that a settlement has to offer.": "也就是说，那些不去找麻烦的人物可以利用和解所提供的所有好处。",
	"Whether a settlement has a police force depends on its size and nature. A lawful, orderly city might have a city watch to maintain order and a trained militia to defend its walls, and a frontier town might rely on adventurers or its citizenry to apprehend criminals and fend off attackers.": "一个定居点是否有警察部队，取决于其规模和性质。一个合法的、有秩序的城市可能会有一个城市守望者来维持秩序，并有一支训练有素的民兵来保卫它的城墙，而一个边境城镇可能会依靠冒险者或其公民来逮捕罪犯和抵御袭击者。",
	"In most settlements, trials are overseen by magistrates or local lords. Some trials are argued, with the conflicting parties or their advocates presenting precedent and evidence until the judge makes a decision, with or without the aid of spells or interrogation. Others are decided with a trial by ordeal or trial by combat. If the evidence against the accused is overwhelming, a magistrate or local lord can forgo a trial and skip right to the sentencing.": "在大多数定居点，审判是由地方法官或地方领主监督的。有些审判是争论性的，由冲突各方或其辩护人提出先例和证据，直到法官作出裁决，无论是否有法术或审讯的帮助。其他审判则是通过神明审判或战斗审判来决定。如果不利于被告的证据是压倒性的，地方法官或地方领主可以放弃审判，直接跳到宣判。",
	"A settlement might have a jail to hold accused criminals awaiting trial, but few settlements have prisons to incarcerate convicted criminals. A person found guilty of a crime is usually fined, condemned to forced labor for a period of several months or years, exiled, or executed, depending on the magnitude of the crime.": "一个定居点可能有一个监狱来关押等待审判的被指控的罪犯，但很少有定居点有监狱来关押被定罪的罪犯。被认定有罪的人通常会被罚款，被判处几个月或几年的强迫劳动，被流放，或被处决，这取决于犯罪的严重程度。",
	"The Random Urban Encounters table is useful for city—and town—based adventures. Check for a random encounter at least once per day, and once at night if the characters are out and about. Reroll the result if it doesn't make sense given the time of day.": "城市随机邂逅表对基于城市和城镇的冒险很有用。每天至少检查一次随机遭遇，如果角色外出活动，则在晚上检查一次。如果在一天的时间里没有意义的话，就重掷结果。",

	"Swimming through deep water is similar to traveling at high altitudes, because of the water's pressure and cold temperature.

Swimming for an hour at a depth greater than 200 feet counts as 4 hours.": "在深水中游泳类似于在高海拔地区旅行，因为水的压力和寒冷的温度。对于没有游泳速度的生物来说，在深度超过100英尺的地方每游一小时算作2小时，以确定（%0%）。在深度超过200英尺的地方游泳一小时算作4小时。",

	"Seagoing vessels stay close to shore when they can, because navigation is easier when landmarks are visible. As long as a ship is within sight of land, there is no chance of the vessel becoming lost. Otherwise, a ship's navigator must rely on dead reckoning (tracking the direction and distance of the ship's travel) or the sun and the stars.": "海上航行的船只在可能的情况下都会靠近岸边，因为当地标清晰可见时，导航会更容易。只要船只在陆地的视线范围内，就不会有迷路的可能。否则，船舶的导航员必须依靠死记法（跟踪船舶行驶的方向和距离）或太阳和星星。",

	"A shipwreck is a plot device that can be used sparingly to great effect, particularly if you want the characters to be washed ashore on some monster-infested island or (in the case of an airship) dropped in the middle of some exotic land.

	"Even the strongest seafaring ship can founder in a storm, run aground on rocks or reefs, sink during a pirate attack, or be dragged underwater by a sea monster. A storm or hungry dragon can lay waste to an airship just as easily. A shipwreck has the potential to change the direction of a campaign. It isn't, however, a particularly good way to kill off characters or end a campaign.": "即使是最强大的航海船，也可能在风暴中倒下，在岩石或暗礁上搁浅，在海盗袭击中沉没，或被海怪拖入水下。暴风雨或饥饿的巨龙也可以轻易地毁掉一艘飞艇。一艘沉船有可能改变一场战役的方向。然而，它并不是杀死角色或结束活动的一个特别好的方法。",

A creature that serves as a flying mount must rest 1 hour for every 3 hours it flies, and it can't fly for more than 9 hours per day. Thus, characters mounted on griffons (which have a flying speed of 80 feet) can travel at 8 miles per hour, covering 72 miles over 9 hours with two 1-hour-long rests over the course of the day.

Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.": "大多数陷阱都是在生物去了某个地方或接触了陷阱创造者想要保护的东西时触发的。常见的触发因素包括踩到压板或假的地板，拉动绊线，转动门把手，以及用错钥匙开锁。魔法陷阱通常被设定为在生物进入某个区域或触及某个物体时爆炸。有些魔法陷阱（如守护咒语）有更复杂的触发条件，包括防止陷阱启动的密码。",
	"Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap's presence.": "通常情况下，陷阱的某些元素在仔细检查时是可见的。角色可能会注意到隐藏着压力板的不平整的石板，发现绊马索上的闪光，注意到墙壁上的小孔，火焰会从那里喷出，或者以其他方式发现指向陷阱存在的东西。",
	"A trap's description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check against the trap's DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using {@item thieves' tools|phb} to perform the necessary sabotage.": "陷阱的描述中规定了探测它、禁用它或两者所需的检查和DC。一个积极寻找陷阱的角色可以尝试用智慧（（%0%））检查陷阱的DC。你也可以将探测陷阱的DC与每个角色的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分进行比较，以确定队伍中是否有人顺便注意到陷阱。如果冒险者们在触发陷阱之前就发现了它，他们也许可以解除它，要么是永久性的，要么是足够长的时间来通过它。你可以要求一个角色进行智力检查（%2%），以推断出需要做什么，然后用灵巧检查（%3%）来执行必要的破坏行动。",
	"Any character can attempt an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap's description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap's description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.": "任何角色都可以尝试用智力({@skill Arcana})检查来探测或解除魔法陷阱，除了陷阱描述中提到的任何其他检查外。无论使用哪种检查，DC都是一样的。此外，驱散魔法有机会使大多数魔法陷阱失效。魔法陷阱的描述提供了你使用驱散魔法时的能力检查DC。",
	"In most cases, a trap's description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character's actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn't allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap's description to determine what happens. No trap's design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.": "在大多数情况下，一个陷阱的描述足够清楚，你可以判断一个角色的行动是找到了陷阱还是破坏了陷阱。就像许多情况一样，你不应该让掷骰子来取代聪明的游戏和良好的计划。使用你的常识，根据陷阱的描述来决定发生什么。任何陷阱的设计都不可能预测到角色可能尝试的每一种行动。",
	"You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap's presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.": "如果一个动作会清楚地显示出陷阱的存在，你应该允许角色发现陷阱而不进行能力检查。例如，如果一个角色掀开了一块隐藏着压力板的地毯，那么这个角色就发现了触发器，不需要检查。",
	"Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it's trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.": "挫败陷阱可能会更复杂一点。考虑到一个被困的宝箱。如果不先拉动箱子边上的两个把手就打开箱子，里面的装置就会向前面的人发射大量的毒针。在检查了箱子并做了一些检查后，人物仍然不确定它是否被困住了。他们没有简单地打开箱子，而是在箱子前面支起一个盾牌，用一根铁棍在远处推开箱子。在这种情况下，陷阱仍然会被触发，但冰雹般的针头会无害地射向盾牌。",
	"Traps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.": "陷阱通常被设计成可以被解除或绕过的机制。在其巢穴中或周围放置陷阱的智能怪物需要有办法在不伤害自己的情况下通过这些陷阱。这类陷阱可能有隐藏的杠杆，可以使它们的触发器失效，或者有一扇秘密的门，可以掩盖绕过陷阱的通道。",
	"The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap's description specifies what happens when it is triggered.": "陷阱的效果可以从不方便到致命，利用箭、尖刺、刀片、毒药、毒气、火焰爆炸和深坑等元素。最致命的陷阱结合了多种元素来杀死、伤害、遏制或驱赶任何不幸触发它们的生物。陷阱的描述说明了它被触发时的情况。",
	"The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap's severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.": "陷阱的攻击加成、抵抗其效果的救赎直流电、以及其造成的伤害都会因陷阱的严重程度而有所不同。请使用 \"陷阱救赎DC和攻击加成 \"表和 \"按等级划分的伤害严重程度 \"表，以了解基于三个等级的陷阱严重程度的建议。",
	"A trap intended to be a {@b setback} is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a {@b dangerous} trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A {@i deadly} trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.": "一个旨在成为{@b setback}的陷阱不太可能杀死或严重伤害指定等级的角色，而一个{@b dangerous}的陷阱可能会严重伤害（并有可能杀死）指定等级的角色。一个{@i deadly}的陷阱可能会杀死指定级别的人物。",
	"Setback": "后退",
	"Dangerous": "危险的",
	"Deadly": "致命的",
	"Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.": "复杂陷阱的工作方式与标准陷阱类似，只是一旦激活，它们每一轮都会执行一系列的行动。一个复杂的陷阱将处理陷阱的过程变成更像一场战斗的遭遇。",
	"When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap's description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.": "当一个复杂的陷阱激活时，它就会滚动主动权。陷阱的描述包括一个主动性奖励。在它的回合中，陷阱会再次激活，通常会采取一个行动。它可能会对入侵者进行连续的攻击，创造一个随时间变化的效果，或者产生一个动态的挑战。否则，这个复杂的陷阱可以被发现，并以通常的方式禁用或绕过。",
	"For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap's turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.": "例如，一个能使房间慢慢淹没的陷阱作为一个复杂的陷阱效果最好。在这个陷阱的回合中，水位会上升。几轮过后，房间就完全被淹没了。",
	"A campaign is much more than a series of adventures. It also includes the moments between them-the various distractions and side pursuits that engage the characters when they're not exploring the wilderness, plundering dungeons, and gallivanting around the multiverse on some epic quest.": "一个战役远不止一系列的冒险。它还包括它们之间的时刻--当人物不在探索荒野、掠夺地牢和在某个史诗般的任务中驰骋于多元宇宙时，他们的各种分心和副业追求。",
	"The natural pace of a campaign offers lulls between adventures, time for the characters to spend their treasure and pursue their goals. This downtime gives the characters an opportunity to sink their roots a little deeper into the world, building a personal investment in what happens to the people and places around them, which can, in turn, draw them into further adventures.": "竞选活动的自然节奏为冒险之间提供了休息时间，让角色有时间花费他们的财富和追求他们的目标。这段休息时间给了角色一个机会，让他们更深入地扎根于这个世界，对发生在他们周围的人和地方的事情进行个人投资，这反过来又能吸引他们进入进一步的冒险。",
	"Chapter 5, \"Equipment,\" of the {@i Player's Handbook} details the expenses that a character incurs for basic necessities, depending on the lifestyle the character chooses, from poverty to luxury. Chapter 8, \"Adventuring,\" of that book describes some of the downtime activities they can pursue between adventures. This chapter fills in the gaps, describing the expenses of owning property and hiring NPCs, and a variety of additional downtime activities characters can pursue. The beginning of the chapter also offers suggestions for linking adventures together and keeping track of events in your campaign.": "{@i Player's Handbook}的第5章 \"装备 \"详细介绍了角色在基本必需品方面的支出，这取决于角色选择的生活方式，从贫穷到奢华。该书的第8章 \"冒险 \"描述了他们在冒险之间可以进行的一些停工活动。本章填补了这些空白，描述了拥有财产和雇佣NPC的费用，以及角色可以进行的各种额外的闲暇活动。这一章的开头还提供了一些建议，以便将冒险联系在一起，并跟踪你的活动中的事件。",
	"A campaign in the style of an episodic television show rarely needs story links between its adventures. Each adventure features its own villains, and once the characters complete the adventure, there are typically no loose plot threads. The next adventure presents an altogether different challenge having nothing to do with the adventure that preceded it. As the characters gain experience points, they become more powerful, as do the threats they must overcome. This kind of campaign is easy to run, since it requires little effort beyond finding or creating adventures appropriate for the party's level.": "一个剧集式电视节目风格的活动很少需要在其冒险之间建立故事联系。每一次冒险都有自己的反派人物，一旦人物完成了冒险，通常就没有松散的情节线索。下一次冒险提出了一个完全不同的挑战，与之前的冒险毫无关系。随着角色获得经验值，他们变得更加强大，他们必须克服的威胁也是如此。这种活动很容易开展，因为除了寻找或创造适合队伍水平的冒险之外，几乎不需要什么努力。",
	"A campaign with a narrative lets the players feel as though their actions have far-reaching consequences. They're not just racking up experience points. A few simple modifications can help you overlay overarching elements to create a serialized campaign in which early adventures help set up later ones.": "一个有叙事性的活动让玩家感到他们的行为有深远的影响。他们不仅仅是在积攒经验值。一些简单的修改可以帮助你叠加总体性的元素，创造出一个连续的战役，其中早期的冒险帮助建立了后来的冒险。",
	"This section presents a couple of examples of overarching stories which have, over the years, fueled many classic D&D campaigns.": "本节介绍了几个总体故事的例子，多年来，这些故事为许多经典的D&D活动提供了动力。",
	"The adventurers' goal in the first example is to amass the power they need to defeat a powerful enemy that threatens the world. Their goal in the second example is to defend something they care about by destroying whatever threatens it.": "在第一个例子中，冒险者的目标是积累他们需要的力量，以击败威胁世界的强大敌人。第二个例子中，他们的目标是通过摧毁威胁他们的东西来保护他们所关心的东西。",
	"The two examples are, in effect, the same story (variations of the battle between good and evil) told in different ways.": "这两个例子实际上是以不同的方式讲述同一个故事（善恶之争的变化）。",
	"You can tie adventures together using an overarching goal that can be fulfilled only by first completing a series of related quests. For example, you could create a villain who can't be defeated until the characters explore nine dungeons in which the Nine Dread Princes reside, with each of these dungeons stocked with enough monsters and hazards to advance the adventurers two or three levels. The adventurers spend their whole careers fighting the Nine Dread Princes before finally pursuing an epic quest to destroy the princes' monstrous progenitor. As long as every dungeon is unique and interesting, your players will appreciate the tight focus of the campaign.": "你可以用一个总的目标把冒险联系在一起，而这个目标只有先完成一系列相关的任务才能实现。例如，你可以创造一个反派，在人物探索九大恐惧王子居住的九大地牢之前不能被打败，每个地牢都有足够的怪物和危险，可以让冒险者提升两到三个等级。冒险家们在与九大恐惧王子战斗的整个职业生涯中，最终都在追求消灭王子们的畸形祖先的史诗般的任务。只要每一个地牢都是独特而有趣的，你的玩家就会欣赏活动的紧凑重点。",
	"In a similar type of quest campaign, the adventurers might need to collect fragments of an artifact that are scattered in ruins across the multiverse, before reassembling the artifact and using it to defeat a cosmic threat.": "在类似的任务活动中，冒险者可能需要收集散落在多元宇宙废墟中的神器碎片，然后重新组装神器，用它来打败宇宙的威胁。",
	"You can also build a campaign around the idea that the adventurers are agents of something larger than themselves-a kingdom or secret organization, for example. Wherever their allegiance lies, the adventurers are motivated by loyalty and the goal of protecting whatever it is they serve.": "你也可以围绕这样一个想法开展活动：冒险者是比他们自己更大的东西的代理人--比如说，王国或秘密组织。无论他们效忠于谁，冒险家们都会被忠诚和保护他们所服务的目标所激励。",
	"The characters' overarching mission might be to explore and map an uncharted region, forging alliances where they can and overcoming threats they encounter along the way. Their goal might be to find the ancient capital of a fallen empire, which lies beyond the realm of a known enemy and forces them to navigate hostile territory. The characters could be pilgrims in search of a holy site or members of a secret order dedicated to defending the last bastions of civilization in an ever-declining world. Or they might be spies and assassins, striving to weaken an enemy country by targeting its evil leaders and plundering its treasures.": "人物的首要任务可能是探索和绘制一个未知的区域，在可能的情况下建立联盟，并克服沿途遇到的威胁。他们的目标可能是找到一个没落帝国的古都，它位于一个已知敌人的领域之外，迫使他们在敌对的领土上航行。这些人物可能是寻找圣地的朝圣者，或者是致力于在一个不断衰落的世界中捍卫最后的文明堡垒的秘密组织成员。或者他们可能是间谍和刺客，通过瞄准敌国的邪恶领导人和掠夺其财物来努力削弱敌国。",
	"You can make a campaign feel like one story with many chapters by planting the seeds of the next adventure before the current one is finished. This technique can naturally moves the characters along to their next goal.": "你可以通过在当前的冒险完成之前埋下下一个冒险的种子，使一个活动感觉像一个有许多章节的故事。这种技巧可以自然而然地将人物推向他们的下一个目标。",
	"If you've planted a seed well, the characters have something else to do when they finish an adventure. Perhaps a character drinks from a magic fountain in a dungeon and receives a mystifying vision that leads to the next quest. The party might find a cryptic or relic that, once its meaning or purpose is determined, points to a new destination. Perhaps an NPC warns the characters of impending danger or implores them for help.": "如果你把种子种得很好，那么人物在完成冒险时就会有其他事情可做。也许一个角色在地牢里喝了魔泉的水，得到了一个神秘的幻象，从而导致了下一个任务。队伍可能会找到一个密码或遗物，一旦它的意义或目的被确定，就会指向一个新的目的地。也许一个NPC会警告人物即将发生的危险，或者恳求他们帮助。",
	"The trick is to not distract the characters from the adventure at hand. Designing an effective hook for a future adventure requires finesse. The lure should be compelling, but not so irresistible that the players stop caring about what their characters are doing right now.": "诀窍是不要分散角色对当前冒险的注意力。为未来的冒险设计一个有效的钩子需要技巧。诱饵应该是有吸引力的，但不能让玩家无法抗拒，以至于不再关心他们的角色现在在做什么。",
	"To keep players from straying, save your best ideas for the very end of your adventures, or insert them during periods of downtime.": "为了不让玩家走神，把你最好的想法留到冒险的最后，或者在休息时间插入这些想法。",
	"Here are a few examples of ways in which an adventure seed can be revealed:": "以下是几个例子，说明冒险种子可以被揭示的方式。",
	"On a villain's corpse, the characters find evidence that the villain was working for someone else.": "在一个恶棍的尸体上，人物发现了恶棍为别人工作的证据。",
	"A captured NPC reveals the location of someone or something that might interest the characters.": "一个被俘的NPC透露了某个人或某个东西的位置，而这个人或东西可能会引起角色的兴趣。",
	"The characters are heading to a local tavern when they spot a wanted poster or a missing person poster (complete with the promise of a sizable reward).": "这些人物在前往当地一家酒馆时，发现了一张通缉令或失踪人员海报（附有可观的悬赏承诺）。",
	"Members of the local militia or city watch put out the word that a crime has been committed, and they're looking for potential witnesses and suspects.": "当地民兵或城市守望的成员放出消息说发生了犯罪，他们正在寻找潜在的证人和嫌疑人。",
	"The characters receive an anonymous letter that sheds light on a plot or impending event of which they were previously unaware.": "角色们收到一封匿名信，揭示了他们之前不知道的情节或即将发生的事件。",
	"Foreshadowing is an exercise in subtlety, involving the delicate planting of seeds for future adventures. Not all foreshadowing bears fruit, particularly if the clues are too subtle or if events conspire to take your campaign in a new direction. The goal of foreshadowing is to hint at upcoming events and new threats in your campaign without making it obvious to players that you're telling them what the future holds. Here are a few examples:": "预示是一种微妙的练习，涉及到为未来的冒险埋下微妙的种子。并非所有的预示都能结出果实，特别是如果线索过于微妙，或者如果事件阴谋将你的活动带向一个新的方向。预示的目的是在你的活动中暗示即将发生的事件和新的威胁，而不使玩家明显感觉到你在告诉他们未来会发生什么。这里有几个例子。",
	"An object worn or carried by an enemy has the symbol of a previously unknown organization engraved or written on it.": "敌人佩戴或携带的物品上刻有或写有以前未知组织的标志。",
	"A mad woman standing on a street corner spouts fragments of an ancient prophecy, while pointing a crooked finger at the characters.": "一个站在街角的疯女人吐出了一个古老预言的片段，同时用弯曲的手指指着人物。",
	"The king and queen announce the marriage of their son to the daughter of a neighboring monarch, but various factions oppose the union. Trouble is brewing.": "国王和王后宣布他们的儿子与邻国君主的女儿结婚，但各派别都反对这一结合。麻烦正在酝酿。",

	"Consistent details bring your campaign to life, and continuity helps players imagine that their characters are living in a real world. If the adventurers frequent a particular tavern, the staff, layout of the building, and decor shouldn't change much from one visit to the next. That said, changes can occur as a result of the characters' actions or of actions they learn about. When the adventurers kill a monster, it stays dead, unless someone raises it. When they remove treasure from a room, it doesn't reappear the next time they enter—assuming it hasn't been stolen from them! If they leave a door open, it should stay open until someone closes it. No one's memory is infallible, so it pays to keep records. Jot notes directly on an adventure map to keep track of open doors, disarmed traps, and the like. Events beyond the scope of a single adventure are best recorded in a notebook dedicated to your campaign.": "一致的细节使你的活动更加生动，连续性有助于玩家想象他们的角色是生活在一个真实的世界中。如果冒险者经常光顾某个酒馆，那么酒馆的员工、建筑的布局和装饰在每次光顾时不应该有太大的变化。尽管如此，由于角色的行动或他们了解到的行动，也会发生变化。当冒险者杀死一个怪物时，它就会一直死下去，除非有人把它唤醒。当他们从一个房间里拿走财宝时，在他们下次进入时，财宝就不会再出现了--前提是财宝没有被偷走！如果他们把门打开，财宝就不会再出现。如果他们留下一扇门，它应该一直开着，直到有人把它关上。没有人的记忆是无懈可击的，所以保持记录是值得的。直接在冒险地图上做笔记，以记录打开的门、解除的陷阱等等。超出一次冒险范围的事件最好记录在一个专门用于活动的笔记本上。",
	"Whether it's a physical book or an electronic file, such a record is a great way to keep your notes organized.": "无论是实体书还是电子文件，这样的记录是保持你的笔记有条理的好方法。",

	"A Treasure Hoard table helps you randomly determine the contents of a large cache of treasure, the accumulated wealth of a large group of creatures (such as an orc tribe or a hobgoblin army), the belongings of a single powerful creature that likes to hoard treasure (such as a dragon), or the reward bestowed upon a party after completing a quest for a benefactor. You can also split up a treasure hoard so that the adventurers don't find or receive it all at once.": "宝藏囤积表可以帮助你随机确定一个大型宝藏库的内容、一大群生物（比如兽人部落或妖精军队）积累的财富、一个喜欢囤积宝藏的强大生物（比如龙）的物品，或者在为恩人完成任务后赐予一方的奖励。你也可以把宝藏分割开来，这样冒险者就不会一下子找到或收到所有的宝藏。",
	"When determining the contents of a hoard belonging to one monster, use the table that corresponds to that monster's challenge rating. When rolling to determine a treasure hoard belonging to a large group of monsters, use the challenge rating of the monster that leads the group.

If the hoard is a gift from a benefactor, use the challenge rating equal to the party's average level.": "当确定属于一个怪物的囤积物的内容时，使用与该怪物的挑战等级相对应的表格。当掷骰子来确定属于一大群怪物的宝藏时，使用领导这群怪物的挑战等级。如果该宝藏不属于任何人，则使用主持地牢或巢穴的怪物的挑战等级。如果囤积物是恩人的礼物，则使用与队伍的平均等级相当的挑战等级。",
	"Every treasure hoard contains a random number of coins, as shown at the top of each table.

Even uncommon items can't be easily created. Thus, many magic items are well-preserved antiquities.": "每个魔法物品都有一个稀有度：普通、不普通、稀有、非常稀有或传奇。普通的魔法物品，如治疗药水，是最丰富的。一些传说中的物品，如Kwalish的仪器，是独一无二的。游戏假设创造最强大的物品的秘密在几个世纪前就出现了，然后由于战争、灾难和事故而逐渐丢失。即使是不常见的物品也不容易被创造出来。因此，许多魔法物品都是保存完好的古物。",
	"Rarity provides a rough measure of an item's power relative to other magic items. Each rarity corresponds to character level, as shown in the Magic Item Rarity table.

You might also allow characters to craft their own magic items, as discussed in chapters 6.": "在你的战役中，魔法物品可能足够普遍，以至于冒险者可以通过一些努力来买卖它们。魔法物品可能会在奇幻之地的集市或拍卖行出售，比如黄铜之城、Sigil的平面大都市，或者甚至在更普通的城市。魔法物品的销售可能受到高度管制，同时还有一个繁荣的黑市。工匠们可以制作供军队或冒险者使用的物品，就像他们在Eberron世界中所做的那样。你也可以允许角色制作自己的魔法物品，正如第六章所讨论的那样。",
	"Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, whereas other magic items display their magical nature conspicuously.

Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.": "{@spell identify}咒语是揭示物品属性的最快方式。另外，一个角色可以在短暂的休息中专注于一个魔法物品，同时与该物品保持身体接触。在休息结束后，角色会了解该物品的属性，以及如何使用它们。药水是个例外；稍微品尝一下就足以告诉品尝者该药水的作用。",
	"Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched in tiny letters inside it, or a feathered design might suggest that it's a {@item ring of feather falling}.": "有时，一件魔法物品带有关于其属性的线索。激活戒指的命令词可能被刻在戒指内的小字上，或者一个羽毛状的设计可能暗示它是一个（%0%）。",
	"Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. For example, if a character puts on a {@item ring of jumping}, you could say, \"Your steps feel strangely springy.\" Perhaps the character then jumps up and down to see what happens. You then say the character jumps unexpectedly high.": "穿着或试验一件物品也可以提供关于其属性的提示。例如，如果一个人物穿上了（%0%），你可以说：\"你的脚步感觉很奇怪，很有弹性\"。也许这个人物会跳起来，看看会发生什么。然后你说这个人物跳得出乎意料的高。",
	"If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the identify spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.": "如果你希望魔法物品有更大的神秘感，可以考虑取消在短暂休息期间识别魔法物品属性的能力，并要求使用识别法术、实验或两者来揭示魔法物品的作用。",
	"Some magic items require a creature to form a bond with them before their magical properties can be used. This bond is called attunement, and certain items have a prerequisite for it. If the prerequisite is to be a spellcaster, a creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or features, not using a magic item or the like. (If the class is a spellcasting class, a monster qualifies if that creature has spell slots and uses that class's spell list.)": "有些魔法物品需要生物在使用其魔法属性之前与之形成一种联系。这种结合被称为 \"调和\"（attunement），某些物品对它有一个先决条件。如果先决条件是成为一个施法者，如果一个生物能够使用它的特性或特征施放至少一个法术，而不是使用魔法物品或类似的东西，那么它就有资格。(如果该类是一个施法类，如果一个怪物有法术槽并使用该类的法术列表，那么该怪物就有资格。）",
	"Without becoming attuned to an item that requires attunement, a creature gains only its nonmagical benefits, unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic shield that requires attunement provides the benefits of a normal shield to a creature not attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.": "如果不与需要调和的物品调和，生物只能获得其非魔法的好处，除非其描述另有说明。例如，一个需要调和的魔法盾牌为没有调和的生物提供普通盾牌的好处，但没有其魔法属性。",
	"Attuning to an item requires a creature to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same short rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a weapon), meditation (for a wondrous item), or some other appropriate activity. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, the creature gains an intuitive understanding of how to activate any magical properties of the item, including any necessary command words.": "适应一个物品需要一个生物在与该物品有身体接触的情况下花一个短暂的休息时间只专注于该物品（这不能是用来学习该物品属性的同一短暂休息）。这种专注可以采取武器练习（对于武器）、冥想（对于神奇物品）或其他适当的活动。如果短暂的休息被打断了，那么调和尝试就会失败。否则，在短暂的休息结束后，该生物会对如何激活该物品的任何魔法属性，包括任何必要的命令语，有一个直观的了解。",
	"An item can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and a creature can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; the creature must end its attunement to an item first. Additionally, a creature can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, a creature can't attune to more than one ring of protection at a time.": "一个物品在同一时间只能与一个生物相适应，而一个生物在同一时间可以与不超过三个魔法物品相适应。任何试图调整第四个物品的尝试都是失败的；生物必须先结束它对一个物品的调整。此外，一个生物不能与一个以上的物品副本相适应。例如，一个生物不能同时与一个以上的保护戒指相适应。",
	"A creature's attunement to an item ends if the creature no longer satisfies the prerequisites for attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if the creature dies, or if another creature attunes to the item. A creature can also voluntarily end attunement by spending another short rest focused on the item, unless the item is cursed.": "如果一个生物不再满足调和的先决条件，如果该物品已经离开100英尺以上至少24小时，如果该生物死亡，或者如果其他生物调和该物品，则该生物对该物品的调和结束。一个生物也可以通过花费另一个短暂的休息时间专注于该物品而自愿结束调和，除非该物品被诅咒了。",
	"Some magic items bear curses that bedevil their users, sometimes long after a user has stopped using an item. A magic item's description specifies whether the item is cursed. Most methods of identifying items, including the identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse, although lore might hint at it. A curse should be a surprise to the item's user when the curse's effects are revealed.": "一些魔法物品带有诅咒，困扰着它们的使用者，有时在使用者停止使用物品后很久。一个魔法物品的描述会指明该物品是否被诅咒。大多数识别物品的方法，包括识别法术，都不能揭示这样的诅咒，尽管传说中可能会暗示它。当诅咒的效果被揭示时，对物品的使用者来说应该是个惊喜。",
	"Attunement to a cursed item can't be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with the {@spell remove curse} spell.": "对被诅咒物品的依附不能主动结束，除非首先打破诅咒，例如用{@spell remove curse}咒语。",
	"Each magic item belongs to a category: armor, potions, rings, rods, scrolls, staffs, wands, weapons, or wondrous items.": "每个魔法物品都属于一个类别：盔甲、药水、戒指、棒子、卷轴、法杖、魔杖、武器或奇妙物品。",
	"Unless an armor's description says otherwise, armor must be worn for its magic to function.": "除非盔甲的描述另有说明，否则盔甲必须穿在身上才能发挥其魔法。",
	"Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as chain mail or plate. If a magic armor doesn't specify its armor type, you may choose the type or determine it randomly.": "有些魔法盔甲规定了它们的盔甲类型，例如链甲或钢板。如果一件魔法盔甲没有说明它的盔甲类型，你可以选择它的类型或随机确定它。",
	"Different kinds of magical liquids are grouped in the category of potions: brews made from enchanted herbs, water from magical fountains or sacred springs, and oils that are applied to a creature or object. Most potions consist of one ounce of liquid.": "不同种类的魔法液体被归入药水类别：由魔法草药制成的饮料、来自魔法喷泉或圣泉的水，以及涂在生物或物体上的油。大多数药水由一盎司的液体组成。",
	"Potions are consumable magic items. Drinking a potion or administering a potion to another character requires an action. Applying an oil might take longer, as specified in its description. Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it is used up.": "药水是可消耗的魔法物品。饮用药水或给其他角色注射药水需要一个动作。涂抹油剂可能需要更长的时间，这在其描述中有所规定。一旦使用，药水会立即生效，并被用完。",
	"A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another, or pour several potions into a single container. The strange ingredients used in creating potions can result in unpredictable interactions.": "一个角色可能在喝下一种药水的同时还受到另一种药水的影响，或者将几种药水倒入一个容器。制作药水时使用的奇怪成分可能会导致不可预测的相互作用。",
	"When a character mixes two potions together, you can roll on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are combined, roll again for each subsequent potion, combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become evident.": "当一个角色把两种药水混合在一起时，你可以在药水可混性表上滚动。如果两个以上的药水混合在一起，则为每一个后续的药水再掷一次，将结果合并。除非效果是立即明显的，否则只有在效果明显时才显示出来。",

	"Both potions lose their effects.": "两种药水都会失去效果。",

	"Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can't be halved in this way.": "两种药水都能发挥作用，但其数值效果和持续时间减半。如果一个药水不能以这种方式减半，它就没有效果。",
	"Both potions work normally.": "两种药水都能正常工作。",
	"The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally.": "一种药水的数值效果和持续时间会翻倍。如果两种药水都没有任何东西可以以这种方式加倍，它们就会正常工作。",
	"Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a {@item potion of healing} might increase the drinker's hit point maximum by 4, or {@item oil of etherealness} might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as {@spell dispel magic} or {@spell remove curse}, might end this lasting effect.": "只有一种药水有效，但其效果是永久性的。选择最简单的效果来使之永久化，或者选择看起来最有趣的效果。例如，{@item potion of healing}可以使饮用者的最大命中率增加4，或者{@item oil of etherealness}可以将使用者永久地困在虚空界。根据你的判断，一个适当的法术，如（%2%）或（%3%），可以结束这种持久的效果。",
	"Magic rings offer an amazing array of powers to those lucky enough to find them. Unless a ring's description says otherwise, a ring must be worn on a finger, or a similar digit, for the ring's magic to function.": "魔戒为那些有幸找到它们的人提供了一系列惊人的力量。除非戒指的描述中另有说明，否则戒指必须戴在手指上，或类似的手指上，才能发挥戒指的魔法。",
	"A scepter or just a heavy cylinder, a magic rod is typically made of metal, wood, or bone. It's about 2 or 3 feet long, 1 inch thick, and 2 to 5 pounds.": "一个权杖或只是一个沉重的圆柱体，魔法棒通常由金属、木材或骨头制成。它大约有2或3英尺长，1英寸厚，2至5磅重。",
	"Most scrolls are spells stored in written form, while a few bear unique incantations that produce potent wards. Whatever its contents, a scroll is a roll of paper, sometimes attached to wooden rods, and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or wood.": "大多数卷轴是以书面形式储存的咒语，也有少数卷轴带有独特的咒语，能产生强大的防护作用。无论其内容如何，卷轴都是一卷纸，有时连在木棒上，通常保存在象牙、玉石、皮革、金属或木材的筒子里。",

If the spell is on your class's spell list you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.": "咒语卷轴上写着一个单一的咒语，以神秘的密码写成。如果该咒语在你的等级的咒语列表中，你可以使用一个动作来阅读该卷轴并施放其咒语，而无需提供任何物质成分。否则，该卷轴是无法理解的。",
	"If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully.

	"Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust. The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.": "一旦施法，卷轴上的文字就会褪色，而卷轴本身也会碎裂成灰。卷轴上的咒语等级决定了咒语的蓄力DC和攻击加成，以及卷轴的稀有性，如咒语卷轴表所示。",

	"A supernatural gift is a special reward granted by a being or force of great magical power. Such supernatural gifts come in two forms: blessings and charms. A blessing is usually bestowed by a god or a godlike being. A charm is typically the work of a powerful spirit, a location of ancient magic, or a creature that has legendary actions. Unlike a magic item, a supernatural gift isn't an object and doesn't require attunement. It gives a character an extraordinary ability, which can be used one or more times.": "超自然的礼物是一种由具有强大魔力的生命或力量授予的特殊奖励。这种超自然的礼物有两种形式：祝福和符咒。祝福通常是由神或神一样的存在赐予的。魅力通常是由一个强大的精神、一个古老的魔法场所或一个具有传奇色彩的生物所为。与魔法物品不同，超自然的礼物不是一个物体，也不需要调和。它赋予一个角色一种非凡的能力，可以使用一次或多次。",
	"A character might receive a blessing from a deity for doing something truly momentous-an accomplishment that catches the attention of both gods and mortals.": "一个角色可能会因为做了一件真正的大事而得到神灵的祝福--一项吸引神灵和凡人注意的成就。",
	"Killing rampaging gnolls rarely warrants such a blessing, but slaying the high priest of Tiamat as he attempts to summon the Dragon Queen might.": "杀死肆虐的地精很少能得到这样的祝福，但在提亚马特的大祭司试图召唤龙后时杀死他可能会得到祝福。",
	"A blessing is an appropriate reward for one of the following accomplishments:": "祝福是对以下成就之一的适当奖励。",
	"Restoring the most sacred shrine of a god": "恢复最神圣的神龛",
	"Foiling an earthshaking plot by the enemies of a god": "挫败一个神的敌人的震撼性阴谋",
	"Helping a god's favored servant complete a holy quest": "帮助一个神的宠儿完成神圣的任务",
	"An adventurer might also receive a blessing in advance of a perilous quest. For example, a paladin could receive one before setting out on a quest to slay a terrifying lich that is responsible for a magical plague sweeping the land.": "冒险家也可能在危险的任务之前收到祝福。例如，一个圣骑士可以在出发去杀一个可怕的巫师之前得到一个祝福，这个巫师要对席卷大地的魔法瘟疫负责。",
	"A character should receive only a blessing that is useful to him or her, and some blessings come with expectations on the part of the benefactor. A god typically gives a blessing for a particular purpose, such as recovering a holy person's remains or toppling a tyrannical empire. The god might revoke a blessing if a character fails to pursue that purpose or acts counter to it.": "一个角色应该只接受对他或她有用的祝福，有些祝福带有对施主的期望。神通常会为了一个特定的目的给予祝福，比如找回一个圣人的遗体或推翻一个暴虐的帝国。如果一个角色没有追求这个目的或者行为与之背道而驰，神可能会撤销祝福。",
	"A character retains the benefits of a blessing forever or until it is taken away by the god who granted it. Unlike a magic item, such a blessing can't be suppressed by an antimagic field or similar effect.": "一个角色会永远保留祝福的好处，或者直到它被授予它的神灵拿走。与魔法物品不同，这种祝福不能被反魔法场或类似的效果所压制。",
	"Most adventurers go their entire lives without receiving even one of these blessings. There is no limit on the number of blessings a character can receive, but it should be rare for a character to have more than one at a time. Moreover, a character can't benefit from multiple instances of a blessing at the same time. For example, a character can't benefit from two instances of the Blessing of Health at once.": "大多数冒险家终其一生都没有得到哪怕一个这样的祝福。一个角色可以接受的祝福数量没有限制，但一个角色同时拥有一个以上的祝福应该很罕见。此外，一个角色不能同时从一个祝福的多个实例中受益。例如，一个角色不能同时从两个健康祝福的实例中受益。",
	"Example blessings are provided below. The text of a blessing addresses its user. If you decide to create more blessings, consider this: a typical blessing mimics the properties of a wondrous item.": "下面提供了祝福的例子。祝福的文字是针对其使用者的。如果你决定创造更多的祝福，请考虑这一点：一个典型的祝福模仿了奇妙物品的属性。",
	"A charm is a minor supernatural gift, which can be received in a large variety of ways. For example, a wizard who finds an eldritch secret in a dead archmage's spellbook might be infused with the magic of a charm, as might a character who solves a sphinx's riddle or drinks from a magic fountain. Legendary creatures, such as ancient gold dragons and unicorns, sometimes grace their allies with charms, and some explorers find themselves bearing the magic of a charm after discovering a long-lost location that is drenched in primeval magic.": "魅力是一种小的超自然的礼物，它可以通过多种方式获得。例如，一个在死去的大法师的法术书中发现了一个超自然的秘密的巫师可能会被注入符咒的魔力，就像一个解开了狮身人面像的谜语或喝了魔力喷泉的角色一样。传说中的生物，如古老的金龙和独角兽，有时会给他们的盟友带来符咒，一些探险家在发现了一个久违的、浸透了原始魔法的地方后，发现自己身上带有符咒的魔力。",
	"Some charms can be used only once, and others can be used a specific number of times before vanishing. If a charm lets you cast a spell, you are able to do so without spending a spell slot or providing any components (verbal, somatic, or material). In any case, a charm can't be used in the area created by an antimagic field or a similar effect, and a charm's effects are susceptible to dispel magic and the like. But the charm itself can't be removed from a creature by anything short of divine intervention or the {@spell wish} spell.": "有些符咒只能使用一次，有些符咒在消失前可以使用特定次数。如果一个符咒能让你施展法术，你就能这样做，而不需要花费一个法术槽或提供任何组件（语言、体质或材料）。在任何情况下，符咒都不能在反魔法场或类似效果所形成的区域内使用，而且符咒的效果也容易受到驱散魔法等的影响。但符咒本身不能被任何东西从生物身上移除，除非是神的干预或{@spell wish}咒语。",
	"Example charms are provided below. The text of a charm addresses its user. A typical charm mimics the effects of a potion or a spell, so it is easy to create more charms of your own, if you like.": "下面提供了一些符咒的例子。咒语的文字是针对其使用者的。一个典型的符咒模仿药水或咒语的效果，所以如果你喜欢的话，很容易创造出更多自己的符咒。",
	"Sometimes the most memorable reward for adventurers is the prestige that they acquire throughout a realm. Their adventures often earn them fame and power, allies and enemies, and titles that they can pass on to their descendants. Some lords and ladies began as commoners who ventured into the dangerous places of the world and made names for themselves through their brave deeds.": "有时，对冒险者来说，最令人难忘的回报是他们在整个王国中获得的声望。他们的冒险往往为他们赢得了名声和权力、盟友和敌人，以及可以传给后人的头衔。有些领主和夫人一开始是平民，他们冒险进入世界上的危险之地，通过勇敢的行动为自己赢得了名声。",
	"This section details the most common marks of prestige that adventures might acquire during a campaign. These marks are usually gained along with treasure, but sometimes they stand on their own.": "本节详细介绍了冒险活动中可能获得的最常见的威望标志。这些标志通常是和宝物一起获得的，但有时它们也能独立存在。",
	"When gold is in short supply, the adventurers' benefactor might provide them with a letter of recommendation instead of monetary payment. Such a letter is usually enclosed in a handsome folio, case, or scroll tube for safe transport, and it usually bears the signature and seal of whoever wrote it.": "当黄金供应不足时，冒险家的恩人可能会向他们提供一封推荐信，而不是金钱报酬。这样的信通常被装在一个漂亮的对开箱、箱子或卷轴管里，以便安全运输，而且通常有写信人的签名和印章。",
	"A letter of recommendation from a person of impeccable reputation can grant adventurers access to NPCs that they would otherwise have trouble meeting on their own, such as a duke, viceroy, or queen. Moreover, carrying such a recommendation on one's person can help clear up \"misunderstandings\" with local authorities who might not otherwise take the adventurers at their word.": "一封来自无懈可击的人的推荐信可以让冒险者接触到他们自己很难见到的NPC，比如公爵、总督或女王。此外，随身携带这样的推荐信可以帮助消除与地方当局的 \"误解\"，否则他们可能不会相信冒险者的话。",
	"A letter of recommendation is worth only as much as the person who wrote it and offers no benefit in places where its writer holds no sway.": "一封推荐信的价值与写推荐信的人一样高，而且在写推荐信的人没有影响力的地方没有任何好处。",
	"Although they are often fashioned from gold and other precious materials, medals have an even greater symbolic value to those who award and receive them.": "尽管奖牌通常由黄金和其他贵重材料制成，但对于颁发和接受奖牌的人来说，它们具有更大的象征意义。",
	"Medals are typically awarded by powerful political figures for acts of heroism, and wearing a medal is usually enough to earn the respect of those who understand its significance.": "奖章通常是由有权势的政治人物为英雄主义行为颁发的，佩戴奖章通常足以赢得了解其意义的人的尊重。",
	"Different acts of heroism can warrant different kinds of medals. The King of Breland (in the Eberron campaign setting) might award a Royal Badge of Valor (shaped like a shield and made of ruby and electrum) to adventurers for defending Brelish citizens, while the Golden Bear of Breland (a medal made of gold and shaped in a likeness of a bear's head, with gems for eyes) might be reserved for adventurers who prove their allegiance to the Brelish Crown by uncovering and defeating a plot to end the Treaty of Thronehold and reignite the Last War.": "不同的英雄主义行为可以获得不同种类的奖章。布雷兰国王（在Eberron战役设定中）可能会授予冒险者皇家英勇勋章（形状像盾牌，由红宝石和白银制成），以保护布雷利什的公民，而布雷兰金熊勋章（由黄金制成，形状像熊头，用宝石做眼睛）可能是留给那些通过揭露和击败结束《王权条约》和重燃最后战争的阴谋来证明他们对布雷利什王室忠诚的冒险者。",
	"A medal doesn't offer a specific in-game benefit to one who wears it, but it can affect dealings with NPCs. For example, a character who proudly displays the Golden Bear of Breland will be regarded as a hero of the people within the kingdom of Breland. Outside Breland, the medal carries far less weight, except among allies of Breland's king.": "勋章并不能为佩戴者提供特定的游戏利益，但它可以影响与NPC的交往。例如，一个自豪地展示布雷兰金熊勋章的角色将被视为布雷兰王国内的人民英雄。在布雷兰之外，除了布雷兰国王的盟友之外，这枚勋章的分量要少得多。",
	"A parcel of land is just that, and usually comes with a royal letter affirming that the land has been granted as a reward for some service. Such land usually remains the property of the local ruler or ruling body, but is leased to a character with the understanding that it can be taken away, especially if his or her loyalty is ever called into question.": "一块土地就是这样，通常附有一封皇家信函，确认土地是作为某种服务的奖励而被授予的。这种土地通常仍是当地统治者或统治机构的财产，但租给某个人物时有一项谅解，即它可以被收回，特别是如果他或她的忠诚度受到质疑。",
	"A parcel of land, if sufficiently large, might have one or more farms or villages on it already, in which case the recipient is pronounced lord or lady of the land and is expected to collect taxes, along with any other duties.": "一块土地，如果足够大，可能已经有一个或多个农场或村庄，在这种情况下，接受者被宣布为土地的领主或夫人，并被期望收取税收和任何其他税款。",
	"A character who receives a parcel of land is free to build on it and is expected to safeguard it. He or she may yield the land as part of an inheritance, but can't sell or trade it without permission from the local ruler or ruling body.": "一个获得土地的角色可以自由地在其上进行建设，并被要求保护它。他或她可以将土地作为遗产的一部分，但未经当地统治者或统治机构的许可，不能出售或交易土地。",
	"Parcels of land make fine rewards for adventurers who are looking for a place to settle or who have family or some kind of personal investment in the region where the land is located.": "对于那些正在寻找定居地的冒险家，或者在土地所在地区有家人或某种个人投资的冒险家，地块是很好的奖励。",
	"A reward might come in the form of a favor that the characters can call on at some future date. Special favors work best when the individual granting them is trustworthy. A lawful good or lawful neutral NPC will do whatever can be done to fulfill an obligation when the time comes, short of breaking laws. A lawful evil NPC does the same, but only because a deal is a deal.": "奖励的形式可能是人物可以在未来的某个日子里利用的恩惠。当授予它们的人是值得信赖的时候，特别恩惠的效果最好。一个合法的好人或合法的中立的NPC会在时机成熟时尽其所能地履行义务，而不是违反法律。一个合法的邪恶的NPC也会这样做，但只是因为交易就是交易。",
	"A neutral good or neutral NPC might pay off favors to protect his or her reputation. A chaotic good NPC is more concerned about doing right by the adventurers, honoring any obligations without worrying too much about personal risk or adherence to the law.": "中立善或中立的NPC可能会为了保护他或她的声誉而付出代价。混乱善良的NPC更关心如何对得起冒险者，履行任何义务，而不太担心个人风险或对法律的遵守。",
	"A politically powerful person can reward characters by giving them special rights, which are usually articulated in some sort of official document. For example, characters might be granted special rights to carry weapons in public places, kill enemies of the crown, or negotiate on a duke's behalf. They might earn the right to demand free room and board from any establishment within a particular community, or have the right to draft local militia to assist them as needed. Special rights last only as long as the legal document dictates, and such rights can be revoked if the adventurers abuse them.": "政治上有权势的人可以通过赋予人物特殊的权利来奖励他们，这些权利通常在某种官方文件中得到阐述。例如，人物可能被授予在公共场所携带武器的特殊权利，杀死王室的敌人，或代表公爵进行谈判。他们可能有权要求某个社区内的任何机构提供免费食宿，或者有权在需要时征召当地民兵来协助他们。特殊权利只持续到法律文件规定的时间，如果冒险者滥用这些权利，这些权利可以被取消。",
	"A stronghold is a reward usually given to seasoned adventurers who demonstrate unwavering fealty to a powerful political figure or ruling body, such as a king, a knighthood, or a council of wizards. A stronghold can be anything from a fortified tower in the heart of a city to a provincial keep on the borderlands. While the stronghold is for the characters to govern as they see fit, the land on which it sits remains the property of the crown or local ruler. Should the characters prove disloyal or unworthy of the gift, they can be asked or forced to relinquish custody of the stronghold.": "堡垒是一种奖励，通常给予那些对强大的政治人物或统治机构，如国王、骑士团或巫师委员会表现出坚定不移的忠诚的经验丰富的冒险家。堡垒可以是任何东西，从城市中心的坚固塔楼到边境地区的省级堡垒。虽然据点是由人物按照他们认为合适的方式来管理的，但它所处的土地仍然是国王或当地统治者的财产。如果人物被证明不忠诚或不配得到这份礼物，他们可以被要求或被迫放弃对据点的监管。",
	"As an additional reward, the individual bequeathing the stronghold might offer to pay its maintenance costs for a period of one or more months, after which the characters inherit that responsibility. See chapter 6 for more information on stronghold maintenance.": "作为额外的奖励，遗赠据点的人可能会提出支付据点的维护费用，期限为一个月或几个月，之后人物就会继承这一责任。关于据点维护的更多信息，见第6章。",
	"A politically powerful figure has the ability to dispense titles. A title often comes with a parcel of land (see above). For example, a character might be awarded the title Earl of Stormriver or Countess of Dun Fjord, along with a parcel of land that includes a settlement or region of the same name.": "一个有政治权力的人物有能力发放产权。一个头衔往往伴随着一整块土地（见上文）。例如，一个人物可能被授予Stormriver伯爵或Dun Fjord伯爵夫人的头衔，以及包括同名定居点或地区在内的一块土地。",
	"A character can hold more than one title, and in a feudal society, those titles can be passed down to (or distributed among) one's children. While a character holds a title, he or she is expected to act in a manner befitting that title. By decree, titles can be stripped away if the local ruler or ruling body has reason to question the character's loyalty or competence.": "一个人物可以拥有一个以上的头衔，在封建社会中，这些头衔可以传给（或在）自己的孩子之间分配。当一个角色拥有一个头衔时，他或她应该以适合该头衔的方式行事。如果当地统治者或统治机构有理由质疑人物的忠诚度或能力，可以通过法令剥夺其头衔。",
	"A character might be offered special training in lieu of a financial reward. This kind of training isn't widely available and thus is highly desirable. It presumes the existence of a skilled trainer-perhaps a retired adventurer or champion who is willing to serve as a mentor. The trainer might be a reclusive wizard or haughty sorcerer who owes the queen a favor, the knight-commander of the King's Guard, the leader of a powerful druid circle, a quirky monk who lives in a remote mountaintop pagoda, a barbarian chieftain, a warlock living among nomads as a fortune-teller, or an absentminded bard whose plays and poetry are known throughout the land.": "一个角色可能会被提供特殊的训练以代替经济奖励。这种训练并不广泛，因此是非常可取的。它假定存在一个熟练的训练师--也许是一个退休的冒险家或愿意担任导师的冠军。培训师可能是一个隐居的巫师或傲慢的巫师，他欠女王一个人情；国王卫队的骑士长；一个强大的德鲁伊圈子的领袖；一个住在偏远山顶宝塔里的古怪和尚；一个野蛮人酋长；一个作为算命师生活在游牧民族中的术士；或者一个心不在焉的吟游诗人，他的戏剧和诗歌在整个大陆都很有名。",
	"A character who agrees to training as a reward must spend downtime with the trainer (see chapter 6 for more information on downtime activities). In exchange, the character is guaranteed to receive a special benefit. Possible training benefits include the following:": "作为奖励，同意接受训练的角色必须与训练者一起度过停工期（关于停工期活动的更多信息，见第6章）。作为交换，该角色保证会得到一个特殊的好处。可能的训练好处包括以下内容。",
	"The character gains inspiration daily at dawn for {@dice 1d4 + 6} days.": "角色每天在黎明时分获得灵感，持续（%0%）天。",
	"The character gains proficiency in a skill.": "角色获得对一项技能的熟练程度。",
	"The character gains a feat.": "该角色获得一项特技。",
	"An epic boon is a special power available only to 20th level characters. Characters at that level gain such boons only if you want them to and only when you feel it's appropriate. Epic boons are best awarded after the characters complete a major quest, or accomplish something else particularly notable. A character might gain an epic boon after destroying an evil artifact, defeating an ancient dragon, or halting an incursion from the Outer Planes.": "史诗般的恩惠是一种只有20级的角色才能获得的特殊力量。该等级的角色只有在你想让他们获得这种恩惠，并且只有在你认为合适的时候才会获得。史诗般的恩惠最好是在角色完成一个主要任务或完成其他特别值得注意的事情后授予。一个角色可能会在摧毁一个邪恶的神器、击败一条远古巨龙或阻止一次来自外星的入侵后获得史诗级的恩惠。",
	"Epic boons can also be used as a form of advancement, a way to provide greater power to characters who have no more levels to gain. With this approach, consider awarding one epic boon to each character for every 30,000 XP he or she earns above 355,000 XP.": "史诗性奖励也可以作为一种进阶方式，为那些没有更多等级的角色提供更大的力量。采用这种方法，可以考虑在每个角色获得355,000XP以上时，每获得30,000XP就授予一个史诗级的奖励。",
	"You determine which epic boon a character gains. Ideally, the boon you pick is something the character would put to use in future adventures. You can allow a player to select a boon for his or her character, subject to your approval.": "你决定一个角色获得哪种史诗般的恩惠。理想情况下，你所选择的恩赐是角色在未来的冒险中会用到的东西。你可以允许玩家为他或她的角色选择一种恩惠，但要经过你的批准。",
	"Whatever boon a character ends up with, consider its place in your story and world. Many of the boons are extraordinary and represent the gradual transformation of a character into something resembling a demigod. The acquisition of a boon might visibly transform a character. For example, the eyes of a character with the Boon of Truesight might glow when he or she feels strong emotion, and a character who has the Boon of High Magic might have faint motes of light glimmering around his or her head. Also, decide how the boon first appears. Does the boon appear spontaneously and mysteriously? Or does a being of cosmic power manifest to bestow it? The bestowal of a boon can itself be an exciting scene in an adventure.": "无论一个角色最后得到什么好处，都要考虑它在你的故事和世界中的地位。许多恩惠都是非同寻常的，代表着一个角色逐渐转变为类似于半神的东西。获得一种恩惠可能会明显地改变一个角色。例如，当他或她感受到强烈的情感时，拥有真知灼见的人物的眼睛可能会发光，而拥有高级魔法的人物可能会有微弱的光斑在他或她的头上闪现。另外，还要决定这个恩赐是如何出现的。这种恩赐是自发地、神秘地出现的吗？还是有宇宙的力量显现出来赐予它？赐予恩惠本身就可以成为冒险中一个令人兴奋的场景。",
	"The text of a boon addresses its user. Unless a boon says otherwise, a character can't gain it more than once.": "特惠的文字是针对其使用者的。除非恩赐另有规定，否则一个角色不能获得超过一次的恩赐。",

	"The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.": "角色可以将一个能力分值增加2，或将两个能力分值各增加1。现在，能力得分可以增加到20分以上，最高可增加到30分。",
	"The character gains a new feat chosen by the player, but subject to your approval.": "角色获得一个新的特技，由玩家选择，但须经你批准。",
	"Rules enable you and your players to have fun at the table. The rules serve you, not vice versa. There are the rules of the game, and there are table rules for how the game is played. For instance, players need to know what happens when one of them misses a session. They need to know whether to bring miniatures, any special rules you've decided to use, and how to treat a cocked die (a die that lands so that its face can't be clearly read). These topics and more are covered in this chapter.": "规则使你和你的棋手能够在棋桌上获得乐趣。规则为你服务，反之亦然。有游戏规则，也有关于如何玩游戏的牌桌规则。例如，玩家需要知道当他们中的一个人错过了一个环节时会发生什么。他们需要知道是否要带微型模型，你决定使用的任何特殊规则，以及如何处理翘起的骰子（骰子落地后无法清楚地阅读其表面）。本章将涵盖这些主题和更多内容。",

	"Turn off the television and video games. If you have young children, hire a babysitter. Reducing distractions helps players stay in character and enjoy the story. It might be fine to have players wandering away from the table and back, but some players prefer planned breaks.": "关掉电视和电子游戏。如果你有年幼的孩子，请一个保姆。减少分心有助于玩家保持角色，享受故事。让玩家从桌子上游荡开来，然后再回来，这也许是可以的，但有些玩家更喜欢有计划的休息。",

	"Decide how you feel about a player sharing information that his or her character wouldn't know or that the character is incapable of sharing as a result of being unconscious, dead, or far away.": "决定你如何看待玩家分享他或她的角色不会知道的信息，或者该角色由于昏迷、死亡或远离而无法分享的信息。",
	"Are you all right with players retracting what they just said their characters did?": "你是否同意玩家收回他们刚刚说的他们的角色所做的事情？",
	"Establish expectations about rolling dice. Rolling in full view of everyone is a good starting point. If you see a player rolling and scooping the dice up before anyone else can see, encourage that player to be less secretive.": "建立对掷骰子的期望。在所有人都看到的情况下掷骰子是一个好的起点。如果你看到一个玩家在其他人看到之前就开始掷骰子并把骰子舀起来，鼓励这个玩家不要那么神秘。",
	"When a die falls on the floor, do you count it or reroll it? When it lands cocked against a book, do you pull the book away and see where it lands, or reroll it?": "当一个骰子掉在地上时，你是计算它还是重掷它？当它落在书上的时候，你是把书拉开，看它落在哪里，还是重新掷骰子？",
	"What about you, the DM? Do you make your rolls in the open or hide them behind a DM screen? Consider the following:": "你呢，管理员？你是在公开场合做卷子还是把它们藏在DM屏幕后面？请考虑以下情况。",
	"If you roll dice where the players can see, they know you're playing impartially and not fudging rolls.": "如果你在玩家可以看到的地方掷骰子，他们就知道你是在公正地玩，而不是在伪造骰子。",
	"Rolling behind a screen keeps the players guessing about the strength of their opposition. When a monster hits all the time, is it of a much higher level than the characters, or are you rolling high numbers?": "在屏幕后面滚动让玩家猜测对手的实力。当一个怪物一直在打的时候，它的等级是否比人物高得多，或者你在滚动高数？",
	"Rolling behind a screen lets you fudge the results if you want to. If two critical hits in a row would kill a character, you could change the second critical hit into a normal hit, or even a miss. Don't distort die rolls too often, though, and don't let on that you're doing it. Otherwise, your players might think they don't face any real risks-or worse, that you're playing favorites.": "如果你想，在屏幕后面打滚可以让你伪造结果。如果连续两次击中要害会杀死一个角色，你可以把第二次击中要害改为普通击中，甚至是未击中。不过，不要太频繁地歪曲掷骰子的结果，也不要让人知道你在这样做。否则，你的玩家可能会认为他们没有面临任何真正的风险--或者更糟糕的是，你在玩偏爱。",
	"A roll behind a screen can help preserve mystery. For example, if a player thinks there might be someone invisible nearby and makes a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check, consider rolling a die behind the screen even if no one is there, making the player think someone is, indeed, hiding. Try not to overuse this trick.": "在屏幕后面掷骰子可以帮助保持神秘感。例如，如果玩家认为附近可能有人隐身，并进行了智慧（（%0%））检查，可以考虑在屏幕后面掷骰子，即使那里没有人，使玩家认为确实有人躲藏。尽量不要过度使用这个技巧。",
	"You might choose to make a roll for a player because you don't want the player to know how good the check total is. For example, if a player suspects a baroness might be charmed and wants to make a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check, you could make the roll in secret for the player. If the player rolled and got a high number but didn't sense anything amiss, the player would be confident that the baroness wasn't charmed. With a low roll, a negative answer wouldn't mean much. A hidden roll allows uncertainty.": "你可能会选择为玩家做一个卷，因为你不想让玩家知道检查的总数有多大。例如，如果一个玩家怀疑一个男爵夫人可能被迷住了，想做一个智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查，你可以为这个玩家秘密地做这个卷。如果玩家掷出的数字很高，但没有感觉到任何不妥，玩家就会确信男爵夫人没有被迷惑。如果掷出的数字很低，一个否定的答案就没有什么意义。隐秘卷允许不确定性。",
	"Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little faster around the table.": "玩家习惯于先抛出攻击卷，然后再抛出伤害卷。如果玩家同时进行攻击卷和伤害卷，行动就会在桌子上移动得更快一些。",
	"You might need to set a policy on rules discussions at the table. Some groups don't mind putting the game on hold while they hash out different interpretations of a rule. Others prefer to let the DM make a call and continue with the action. If you gloss over a rules issue in play, make a note of it (a good task to delegate to a player) and return to the issue later.": "你可能需要为牌桌上的规则讨论制定一个政策。有些团体不介意在他们对规则的不同解释进行讨论时，将游戏搁置起来。其他人则更喜欢让管理员做出决定，然后继续进行游戏。如果你在游戏中忽略了一个规则问题，那就把它记下来（这是一个可以委托给玩家的好任务），以后再来讨论这个问题。",
	"Metagame thinking means thinking about the game as a game. It's like when a character in a movie knows it's a movie and acts accordingly. For example, a player might say, \"The DM wouldn't throw such a powerful monster at us!\" or you might hear, \"The read-aloud text spent a lot of time describing that door-let's search it again!\" Discourage metagame thinking by giving players a gentle reminder: \"What do your characters think?\" You can curb metagame thinking by setting up situations that will be difficult for the characters and that might require negotiation or retreat to survive.": "元游戏思维意味着将游戏作为游戏来思考。这就像电影中的角色知道这是一部电影，并据此行事。例如，一个玩家可能会说：\"管理员不会把这么强大的怪物扔给我们！\"或者你可能会听到：\"朗读文本花了很多时间来描述那扇门--让我们再搜一遍！\" 通过给玩家一个温柔的提醒来阻止元气的思考。\"你的角色是怎么想的？\" 你可以通过设置一些对角色来说很困难的情况，以及可能需要谈判或撤退才能生存的情况，来抑制元游戏的思维。",
	"How should you deal with the characters of missing players? Consider these options:": "你应该如何处理失踪球员的角色？请考虑这些选项。",

Leave a way for the character to rejoin the party when the player returns.": "决定这个角色不在那里。为角色错过冒险编造一个很好的理由，也许可以让他或她在镇上逗留或继续进行停工期的活动。留出一个方法，让这个角色在玩家回来时重新加入聚会。",
	"Have the character fade into the background. This solution requires everyone to step out of the game world a bit and suspend disbelief, but might be the easiest solution. You act as if the character's not there, but don't try to come up with any in-game explanation for this absence. Monsters don't attack the character, who returns the favor. On returning, the player resumes playing as if he or she was never gone.": "让角色逐渐消失在背景中。这个解决方案需要每个人都走出游戏世界，悬而未决，但可能是最简单的解决方案。你要表现得好像这个角色不在那里，但不要试图为这种不在游戏中的情况提出任何解释。怪物不会攻击角色，而角色则会还以颜色。回来后，玩家继续游戏，好像他或她从未离开过。",
	"Most of the time, each player runs one character. The game plays best that way, without overwhelming anyone. But if your group is small, players can control more than one character. Or you can fill out the group with NPC followers, using the guidelines in chapter 4, \"Creating Nonplayer Characters.\" You can also make the characters more resilient by using the healing surge option in chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop.\" Don't force a reluctant player to take on multiple characters, and don't show favoritism by allowing only one player to do so. If one character is the mentor of the other, the player can focus on roleplaying just one character. Otherwise, players can end up awkwardly talking to themselves in character, or avoiding roleplaying altogether.": "大多数时候，每个玩家运行一个角色。游戏以这种方式进行得最好，不会让人感到压抑。但是，如果你的小组很小，玩家可以控制一个以上的角色。或者你可以用NPC追随者来充实这个小组，使用第4章 \"创建非玩家角色 \"中的指南。你还可以通过使用第9章 \"地下城主的工作室 \"中的治疗突增选项，使角色更有弹性。不要强迫一个不情愿的玩家承担多个角色，也不要只允许一个玩家承担，以示偏袒。如果一个角色是另一个角色的导师，玩家可以只专注于扮演一个角色。否则，玩家最终会在角色中尴尬地自言自语，或者完全避免角色扮演。",
	"Multiple characters can be a good idea in a game that features nonstop peril and a high rate of character death. If your group agrees to the premise, have each player keep one or two additional characters on hand, ready to jump in whenever the current character dies. Each time the main character gains a level, the backup characters do as well.": "在一个以不间断的危险和高比率的角色死亡为特征的游戏中，多个角色可能是一个好主意。如果你的团队同意这个前提，让每个玩家保留一到两个额外的角色，准备在当前角色死亡时跳出来。每当主角获得一个等级，后备角色也会获得一个等级。",
	"When a new player joins the group, allow the new player to create a character of a level equal to the lowest-level member of the party. The only exception to this guideline is when the new player is completely unfamiliar with the D&D game. In that case, have that player start with a 1st-level character. If the rest of the party is significantly higher in level, consider taking a short break from the campaign and having everyone play a 1st-level character for a few sessions while the new player learns the ropes.": "当新玩家加入团体时，允许新玩家创建一个等级与团体中最低等级成员相同的角色。这条准则的唯一例外是当新玩家完全不熟悉D&D游戏时。在这种情况下，让该玩家从一个1级的角色开始。如果队伍的其他成员的等级明显较高，可以考虑在活动中短暂休息一下，让每个人都扮演一个1级的角色，让新玩家学习一下。",
	"Integrating a new character into the group can be difficult if the party is in the middle of an adventure. The following approaches can help make it easier:": "如果党派正处于冒险之中，将一个新的角色融入团体可能会很困难。下面的方法可以帮助它变得更容易。",
	"The new character is a friend or relative of one of the adventurers who has been searching for the group.": "这个新角色是某个冒险者的朋友或亲戚，他一直在寻找这个团体。",
	"The new character is a prisoner of the foes the other characters are fighting. When rescued, this character joins their group.": "新角色是其他角色正在战斗的敌人的俘虏。获救后，这个角色会加入他们的队伍。",
	"The new character is the sole survivor of another adventuring group.": "新角色是另一个冒险团的唯一幸存者。",
	"Dice are neutral arbiters. They can determine the outcome of an action without assigning any motivation to the DM and without playing favorites. The extent to which you use them is entirely up to you.": "骰子是中立的仲裁者。它们可以决定一个行动的结果，而不给DM分配任何动机，也不偏袒任何人。你在多大程度上使用它们，完全取决于你。",
	"Some DMs rely on die rolls for almost everything. When a character attempts a task, the DM calls for a check and picks a DC. As a DM using this style, you can't rely on the characters succeeding or failing on any one check to move the action in a specific direction. You must be ready to improvise and react to a changing situation.": "有些管理员几乎什么都依赖掷骰子。当一个角色尝试一项任务时，DM要求进行检查并选择一个DC。作为一个使用这种方式的DM，你不能依靠角色在任何一次检查中的成功或失败来推动行动的进行。你必须准备好随机应变，对不断变化的情况做出反应。",
	"Relying on dice also gives the players the sense that anything is possible. Sure, it might seem unlikely that the party's halfling can leap on the ogre's back, pull a sack over its head, and then dive to safety, but with a lucky enough roll it just might work.": "依靠骰子也让玩家感觉到一切皆有可能。当然，党的半身人似乎不太可能跳到食人魔的背上，把麻袋拉到它的头上，然后跳到安全的地方，但是如果有足够幸运的骰子，就可能成功。",
	"A drawback of this approach is that roleplaying can diminish if players feel that their die rolls, rather than their decisions and characterizations, always determine success.": "这种方法的缺点是，如果玩家觉得他们的掷骰子，而不是他们的决定和角色描述，总是决定着成功，那么角色扮演就会减少。",
	"One approach is to use dice as rarely as possible. Some DMs use them only during combat, and determine success or failure as they like in other situations.": "一种方法是尽可能少地使用骰子。有些管理员只在战斗中使用骰子，而在其他情况下则按自己的意愿决定成功或失败。",
	"With this approach, the DM decides whether an action or a plan succeeds or fails based on how well the players make their case, how thorough or creative they are, or other factors. For example, the players might describe how they search for a secret door, detailing how they tap on a wall or twist a torch sconce to find its trigger. That could be enough to convince the DM that they find the secret door without having to make an ability check to do so.": "通过这种方法，DM根据玩家的情况、他们的彻底性或创造性或其他因素来决定一个行动或计划的成功与否。例如，玩家可能会描述他们如何寻找一扇秘密的门，详细说明他们如何敲击墙壁或扭动手电筒以找到其触发器。这就足以让DM相信他们找到了暗门，而不需要进行能力检查。",
	"This approach rewards creativity by encouraging players to look to the situation you've described for an answer, rather than looking to their character sheet or their character's special abilities. A downside is that no DM is completely neutral. A DM might come to favor certain players or approaches, or even work against good ideas if they send the game in a direction he or she doesn't like. This approach can also slow the game if the DM focuses on one \"correct\" action that the characters must describe to overcome an obstacle.": "这种方法鼓励玩家从你描述的情况中寻找答案，而不是从他们的角色表或角色的特殊能力中寻找答案，从而奖励创造力。一个缺点是，没有一个DM是完全中立的。DM可能会偏爱某些玩家或方法，甚至会反对好的想法，如果他们把游戏推向他或她不喜欢的方向。如果DM把注意力集中在一个 \"正确 \"的行动上，而角色必须描述这个行动来克服障碍，那么这种方法也会拖慢游戏的速度。",
	"Many DMs find that using a combination of the two approaches works best. By balancing the use of dice against deciding on success, you can encourage your players to strike a balance between relying on their bonuses and abilities and paying attention to the game and immersing themselves in its world.": "许多管理员发现，使用这两种方法的组合效果最好。通过平衡使用骰子和决定成功与否，你可以鼓励你的玩家在依靠他们的奖金和能力与关注游戏和沉浸在游戏世界中取得平衡。",
	"Remember that dice don't run your game-you do. Dice are like rules. They're tools to help keep the action moving. At any time, you can decide that a player's action is automatically successful. You can also grant the player advantage on any ability check, reducing the chance of a bad die roll foiling the character's plans. By the same token, a bad plan or unfortunate circumstances can transform the easiest task into an impossibility, or at least impose disadvantage.": "请记住，骰子并不能管理你的游戏，你才是。骰子就像规则一样。它们是帮助保持行动的工具。在任何时候，你都可以决定一个玩家的行动自动成功。你也可以在任何能力检查中给予玩家优势，减少一个糟糕的骰子挫败角色的计划的机会。同样地，一个糟糕的计划或不幸的情况可以把最容易的任务变成不可能的，或者至少造成不利。",
	"When a player wants to do something, it's often appropriate to let the attempt succeed without a roll or a reference to the character's ability scores. For example, a character doesn't normally need to make a Dexterity check to walk across an empty room or a Charisma check to order a mug of ale. Only call for a roll if there is a meaningful consequence for failure. When deciding whether to use a roll, ask yourself two questions:": "当玩家想要做某件事时，通常可以不通过掷骰子或参考角色的能力分数而让尝试成功。例如，一个角色通常不需要做灵巧检查就能走过一个空房间，也不需要做魅力检查就能点一杯麦酒。只有在失败会带来有意义的后果时，才会要求进行检查。在决定是否使用卷轴时，要问自己两个问题。",
	"Is a task so easy and so free of conflict and stress that there should be no chance of failure?": "一项任务是如此简单，没有冲突和压力，应该没有失败的机会？",
	"Is a task so inappropriate or impossible-such as hitting the moon with an arrow-that it can't work?": "一项任务是如此不合适或不可能的--例如用箭射向月亮--它就不可能成功？",
	"If the answer to both of these questions is no, some kind of roll is appropriate. The following sections provide guidance on determining whether to call for an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw; how to assign DCs; when to use advantage and disadvantage; and other related topics.": "如果这两个问题的答案都是否定的，那么就应该进行某种形式的滚动。以下章节提供了关于确定是否需要能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力的指导；如何分配DC；何时使用优势和劣势；以及其他相关主题。",
	"An ability check is a test to see whether a character succeeds at a task that he or she has decided to attempt. The Player's Handbook includes examples of what each ability score is used for. The Ability Checks table summarizes that material for easy reference.": "能力检查是一个测试，看一个角色是否能成功完成他或她决定要尝试的任务。玩家手册》中包括了每个能力分数的用途的例子。能力检查表总结了这些材料，以便于参考。",
	"Sometimes a character fails an ability check and wants to try again. In some cases, a character is free to do so; the only real cost is the time it takes. With enough attempts and enough time, a character should eventually succeed at the task. To speed things up, assume that a character spending ten times the normal amount of time needed to complete a task automatically succeeds at that task. However, no amount of repeating the check allows a character to turn an impossible task into a successful one.": "有时候，一个角色在能力检查中失败了，想再试一次。在某些情况下，一个角色可以自由地这样做；唯一真正的代价是它所花费的时间。只要有足够的尝试和足够的时间，一个角色最终应该能成功完成任务。为了加快进度，假设一个角色花费的时间是完成一项任务所需正常时间的10倍，就会自动成功完成该任务。然而，无论如何重复检查，都不能让角色把一个不可能完成的任务变成一个成功的任务。",
	"In other cases, failing an ability check makes it impossible to make the same check to do the same thing again. For example, a rogue might try to trick a town guard into thinking the adventurers are undercover agents of the king. If the rogue loses a contest of Charisma ({@skill Deception}) against the guard's Wisdom ({@skill Insight}), the same lie told again won't work. The characters can come up with a different way to get past the guard or try the check again against another guard at a different gate. But you might decide that the initial failure makes those checks more difficult to pull off.": "在其他情况下，如果能力检查失败，就不可能再做同样的检查来做同样的事情。例如，一个流氓可能试图欺骗一个镇上的守卫，使其认为冒险者是国王的卧底特工。如果流氓在与守卫的智慧（（%0%））的较量中输掉了魅力（（%0%）），那么再次说同样的谎言就不会成功。角色们可以想出不同的方法来越过守卫，或者在不同的门上对另一个守卫再次进行检查。但你可以决定，最初的失败使这些检查更难完成。",

Use a contest if a character attempts something that either directly foils or is directly opposed by another creature's efforts. In a contest, the ability checks are compared to each other, rather than to a target number.": "竞赛是一种能力检查，它使两个生物相互匹配。如果一个角色尝试的东西直接挫败了另一个生物的努力，或者直接被另一个生物的努力所反对，那么就使用竞赛。在竞赛中，能力检查是相互比较的，而不是与一个目标数字比较。",
	"When you call for a contest, you pick the ability that each side must use, deciding whether both sides use the same ability or whether different abilities should counter each other. For example, when a creature tries to hide, it engages in a contest of Dexterity against Wisdom. But if two creatures arm wrestle, or if one creature is holding a door closed against another's attempt to push it open, both use Strength.": "当你要求进行竞赛时，你挑选每一方必须使用的能力，决定双方是否使用相同的能力，或者不同的能力是否应该互相对抗。例如，当一个生物试图躲藏时，它进行的是灵巧与智慧的竞赛。但是如果两个生物掰手腕，或者如果一个生物把门关上，反对另一个生物试图推开它，双方都使用力量。",
	"If you have trouble deciding whether to call for an Intelligence or a Wisdom check to determine whether a character notices something, think of it in terms of what a very high or low score in those two abilities might mean.": "如果你难以决定是要求进行智力检查还是智慧检查来确定一个角色是否注意到什么，那么就从这两种能力的高分或低分可能意味着什么的角度来考虑。",
	"A character with a high Wisdom but low Intelligence is aware of the surroundings but is bad at interpreting what things mean.

	"A saving throw is an instant response to a harmful effect and is almost never done by choice. A save makes the most sense when something bad happens to a character and the character has a chance to avoid that effect. An ability check is something a character actively attempts to accomplish, whereas a saving throw is a split-second response to the activity of someone or something else.": "蓄力是对有害影响的即时反应，几乎从来没有人选择这样做。当有坏事发生在一个角色身上并且该角色有机会避免这种影响时，救赎是最有意义的。能力检查是一个角色积极尝试完成的事情，而蓄力是对某人或某物活动的瞬间反应。",

When you do so, think of how difficult a task is and then pick the associated DC from the Typical DCs table.": "当一条规则或一次冒险没有给你一个难度等级时，你的工作就是为能力检查或拯救动作建立难度等级。有时你甚至会想改变这种既定的难度等级。当你这样做的时候，想想一项任务有多难，然后从典型DCs表中选择相关的DC。",
	"Very easy": "非常容易",
	"Moderate": "中等水平",

	"Nearly impossible": "几乎不可能",
	"The numbers associated with these categories of difficulty are meant to be easy to keep in your head, so that you don't have to refer to this book every time you decide on a DC. Here are some tips for using DC categories at the gaming table.": "与这些难度类别相关的数字是为了方便你记在脑子里，这样你就不必在每次决定DC时都要参考这本书了。以下是在游戏桌上使用DC类别的一些提示。",
	"If you've decided that an ability check is called for, then most likely the task at hand isn't a very easy one. Most people can accomplish a DC 5 task with little chance of failure. Unless circumstances are unusual, let characters succeed at such a task without making a check.": "如果你决定要进行能力检查，那么很可能手头的任务并不是很容易。大多数人都能完成DC5的任务，而且失败的可能性很小。除非情况不寻常，否则让角色成功完成这样的任务而不进行检查。",
	"Then ask yourself, \"Is this task's difficulty easy, moderate, or hard?\" If the only DCs you ever use are 10, 15, and 20, your game will run just fine. Keep in mind that a character with a 10 in the associated ability and no proficiency will succeed at an easy task around 50 percent of the time. A moderate task requires a higher score or proficiency for success, whereas a hard task typically requires both. A big dose of luck with the {@dice d20} also doesn't hurt.": "然后问自己，\"这个任务的难度是简单、中等还是困难？\" 如果你唯一使用的DC是10、15和20，你的游戏就会运行良好。请记住，一个相关能力为10分且没有熟练度的角色，在简单任务中大约有50%的时间会成功。一个中等的任务需要更高的分数或熟练度才能成功，而一个困难的任务通常需要两者都有。大剂量的运气（%0%）也无伤大雅。",
	"If you find yourself thinking, \"This task is especially hard,\" you can use a higher DC, but do so with caution and consider the level of the characters. A DC 25 task is very hard for low-level characters to accomplish, but it becomes more reasonable after 10th level or so. A DC 30 check is nearly impossible for most low-level characters. A 20th-level character with proficiency and a relevant ability score of 20 still needs a 19 or 20 on the die roll to succeed at a task of this difficulty.": "如果你发现自己在想，\"这个任务特别难\"，你可以使用更高的DC，但要谨慎行事，并考虑角色的等级。一个DC25的任务对于低级别的角色来说是很难完成的，但在10级左右就会变得比较合理。对大多数低级别的角色来说，DC30的检查几乎是不可能的。一个20级的角色，如果熟练程度和相关的能力评分为20分，仍然需要在掷骰子时得到19或20分，才能成功完成这个难度的任务。",
	"Sometimes the randomness of a {@dice d20} roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges.": "有时，{@dice d20}卷的随机性导致了可笑的结果。比方说，一扇门需要用DC15的力量检查来击倒。一个力量为20的战士可能会因为糟糕的掷骰子而无助地拍打着门。同时，力量为10的无赖在她的第一次检定中掷出自然的20，将门从铰链上敲下来。",
	"If such results bother you, allow automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.": "如果这样的结果让你感到困扰，那就允许能力分数高的角色在检查中自动成功。在这个可选的规则下，一个角色在任何能力检查中都会自动成功，其DC值小于或等于相关能力得分减去5。所以在上面的例子中，战士会自动踢门。这条规则并不适用于竞赛、蓄力或攻击卷。",
	"The downside of this approach is its predictability. Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always try to match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.": "这种方法的缺点是其可预测性。一旦一个角色的能力得分达到20，使用该能力的DC15及以下的检查就会自动成功。聪明的玩家将总是试图让能力得分最高的角色来对付任何特定的检查。如果你想要一些失败的风险，你需要设置更高的DC。不过，这样做只会加剧你试图解决的问题：更高的DC需要更高的掷骰子，因此更依赖运气。",
	"You can modify this rule to account for proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score. If you don't mind predictability, and you can resist the temptation to increase DCs, you might find that this variant speeds up play and focuses attention on truly difficult, tense situations.": "你可以通过一个额外的选项来修改这个规则，以考虑到熟练程度。如果一个角色可以在检定中应用熟练度奖励，那么如果检定的DC小于或等于相关的能力分数，他或她就自动成功。如果你不介意可预测性，并且你能抵制增加DC的诱惑，你可能会发现这个变体能加快游戏速度，并将注意力集中在真正困难、紧张的情况上。",
	"When you ask a player to make an ability check, consider whether a skill or tool proficiency might apply to the check. The player might also ask you if a particular proficiency applies.": "当你要求玩家进行能力检查时，考虑技能或工具的熟练度是否适用于检查。玩家也可能问你是否适用某个特定的熟练度。",
	"One way to think about this is to consider whether a character could become better at a particular task through training and practice. If the answer is no, it's fine to say that no proficiency applies. But if the answer is yes, then find an appropriate skill or tool proficiency to reflect that training and practice.": "思考这个问题的一个方法是，考虑一个角色是否可以通过训练和练习在某一特定任务上变得更好。如果答案是否定的，可以说不适用任何熟练度。但如果答案是肯定的，那就找一个适当的技能或工具熟练度来反映这种训练和练习。",
	"As described in the Player's Handbook, a skill proficiency represents a character's focus on one aspect of an ability. Among all the things a character's Dexterity score describes, the character might be particularly skilled at sneaking around, reflected in proficiency in the Stealth skill. When that skill is used for an ability check, it is usually used with Dexterity.": "正如《玩家手册》中所描述的，技能熟练度代表一个角色对某方面能力的专注。在一个角色的灵巧分数所描述的所有事情中，这个角色可能特别擅长潜行，反映在对隐身技能的熟练程度上。当该技能被用于能力检查时，它通常与灵巧一起使用。",
	"Under certain circumstances, you can decide a character's proficiency in a skill can be applied to a different ability check. For example, you might decide that a character forced to swim from an island to the mainland must succeed on a Constitution check (as opposed to a Strength check) because of the distance involved. The character is proficient in the Athletics skill, which covers swimming, so you allow the character's proficiency bonus to apply to this ability check. In effect, you're asking for a Constitution ({@skill Athletics}) check, instead of a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "在某些情况下，你可以决定一个角色对某项技能的熟练程度可以应用于不同的能力检查。例如，你可以决定，一个被迫从岛上游到大陆的角色必须在体质检查（而不是力量检查）上取得成功，因为其中涉及的距离。这个角色精通运动技能，其中包括游泳，所以你允许这个角色的熟练度加分适用于这个能力检查。实际上，你要求的是体质（（%0%））检查，而不是力量（（%1%））检查。",
	"Often, players ask whether they can apply a skill proficiency to an ability check. If a player can provide a good justification for why a character's training and aptitude in a skill should apply to the check, go ahead and allow it, rewarding the player's creative thinking.": "通常，玩家会问他们是否可以将技能熟练度应用于能力检查。如果玩家能够提供一个很好的理由，说明为什么一个角色在技能方面的训练和能力应该适用于检查，那么就允许这样做，奖励玩家的创造性思维。",
	"Having proficiency with a tool allows you to apply your proficiency bonus to an ability check you make using that tool. For example, a character proficient with {@item carpenter's tools|phb} can apply his or her proficiency bonus to a Dexterity check to craft a wooden flute, an Intelligence check to craft a wooden secret door, or a Strength check to build a working trebuchet. However, the proficiency bonus wouldn't apply to an ability check made to identify unsafe wooden construction or to discern the origin of a crafted item, since neither check requires tool use.": "熟练掌握一种工具可以让你把你的熟练度加成应用到你使用该工具进行的能力检查中。例如，一个精通{@item carpenter's tools|phb}的角色可以将他或她的熟练度加分应用于制作木笛的灵巧检查，制作木质暗门的智力检查，或建造一个可以使用的风雷炮的力量检查。然而，熟练度加分并不适用于识别不安全的木质结构或辨别手工制品的来源的能力检查，因为这两种检查都不需要使用工具。",
	"Characters are either proficient with a saving throw or attack, or they aren't. The bonus always applies if a character is proficient. Otherwise, it doesn't.": "角色要么精通蓄力或攻击，要么不精通。如果一个角色是精通的，那么该奖励总是适用的。否则，它就不适用。",
	"Advantage and disadvantage are among the most useful tools in your DM's toolbox. They reflect temporary circumstances that might affect the chances of a character succeeding or failing at a task. Advantage is also a great way to reward a player who shows exceptional creativity in play.": "优势和劣势是你的DM工具箱中最有用的工具之一。它们反映了可能影响角色在任务中成功或失败机会的临时情况。优势也是奖励在游戏中表现出非凡创造力的玩家的好方法。",
	"Characters often gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, spells, or other features of their classes or backgrounds. In other cases, you decide whether a circumstance influences a roll in one direction or another, and you grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.": "角色经常通过使用特殊能力、行动、法术或其等级或背景的其他特征而获得优势或劣势。在其他情况下，你决定一个环境是否会影响到一个卷轴的方向，你会因此而给予优势或施加劣势。",
	"Consider granting {@b advantage} when...": "考虑授予{@b advantage}，当...",
	"Circumstances not related to a creature's inherent capabilities provide it with an edge.": "与生物的固有能力无关的情况为其提供了优势。",
	"Some aspect of the environment contributes to the character's chance of success.": "环境的某些方面对角色的成功机会有贡献。",
	"A player shows exceptional creativity or cunning in attempting or describing a task.": "玩家在尝试或描述一项任务时表现出非凡的创造力或狡猾。",
	"Previous actions (whether taken by the character making the attempt or some other creature) improve the chances of success.": "以前的行动（不管是由进行尝试的角色还是其他生物所做的）会提高成功的机会。",
	"Consider imposing {@b disadvantage} when...": "考虑强加（%0%），当...",
	"Circumstances hinder success in some way.": "环境在某种程度上阻碍了成功。",
	"Some aspect of the environment makes success less likely (assuming that aspect doesn't already impose a penalty to the roll being made).": "环境的某些方面使成功的可能性降低（假设该方面还没有对正在进行的卷轴造成惩罚）。",
	"An element of the plan or description of an action makes success less likely.": "计划或行动描述中的某一要素使成功的可能性降低。",
	"Because advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, there's no need to keep track of how many circumstances weigh on both sides.": "因为优势和劣势是相互抵消的，所以不需要记录双方有多少情况是重的。",
	"For example, imagine a wizard is running down a dungeon corridor to escape from a beholder. Around the corner ahead, two ogres lie in wait. Does the wizard hear the ogres readying their ambush? You look at the wizard's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score and consider all the factors weighing on it.": "例如，想象一个巫师在地下城的走廊上奔跑，以逃避一个看门人。在前面的拐角处，有两个食人魔在等待。巫师是否听到食人魔在准备伏击？你看一下巫师的被动智慧（（%0%））得分，并考虑所有影响它的因素。",
	"The wizard is running, not paying attention to what's ahead of him. This imposes disadvantage on the wizard's ability check. However, the ogres are readying a portcullis trap and making a lot of noise with a winch, which could grant the wizard advantage on the check. As a result, the character has neither advantage nor disadvantage on the Wisdom check, and you don't need to consider any additional factors. Past encounters with an ogre ambush, the fact that the wizard's ears are still ringing from the thunderwave spell he cast at the beholder, the overall noise level of the dungeon-none of that matters any more. They all cancel out.": "巫师正在奔跑，没有注意到他前面的情况。这对巫师的能力检查造成了不利。然而，食人魔正在准备一个舷窗陷阱，并且用绞盘发出很大的声音，这可能会给巫师的检查带来优势。因此，这个角色在智慧检查上既没有优势也没有劣势，你不需要考虑任何额外的因素。过去遇到食人魔的伏击，巫师的耳朵还在为他对看守者施放的雷电波咒语而嗡嗡作响，地牢的整体噪音水平--这些都不重要了。它们都被抵消了。",
	"Awarding inspiration is an effective way to encourage roleplaying and risk-taking. As explained in the Player's Handbook, having inspiration gives a character an obvious benefit: being able to gain advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. Remember that a character can have no more than one inspiration at a time.": "奖励灵感是鼓励角色扮演和冒险的一种有效方式。正如《玩家手册》中所解释的，拥有灵感会给角色带来一个明显的好处：能够在一个能力检查、攻击卷或救赎动作上获得优势。请记住，一个角色在同一时间不能有超过一个灵感。",
	"Think of inspiration as a spice that you can use to enhance your campaign. Some DMs forgo using inspiration, while others embrace it as a key part of the game. If you take away anything from this section, remember this golden rule: inspiration should make the game more enjoyable for everyone. Award inspiration when players take actions that make the game more exciting, amusing, or memorable.": "将灵感视为一种香料，你可以用它来加强你的活动。有些DM放弃了使用灵感，而另一些DM则把它作为游戏的一个关键部分。如果你从本节中得到了什么，请记住这条黄金法则：灵感应该使游戏对每个人来说都更加愉快。当玩家采取的行动使游戏更刺激、更有趣或更令人难忘时，就奖励灵感。",
	"As a rule of thumb, aim to award inspiration to each character about once per session of play. Over time, you might want to award inspiration more or less often, at a rate that works best for your table. You might use the same rate for your entire DMing career, or you might change it with each campaign.": "作为一个经验法则，目标是在每节游戏中向每个角色授予灵感一次。随着时间的推移，你可能想或多或少地给予灵感，以最适合你的桌子的速度。你可以在你的整个管理生涯中使用相同的比率，或者你可以在每次活动中改变它。",
	"Offering inspiration as a reward encourages certain types of behavior in your players. Think of your style as a DM and your group's preferences. What helps make the game more fun for your group? What type of actions fit in with your campaign's style or genre? Your answers to those questions help determine when you award inspiration.": "提供灵感作为奖励会鼓励你的玩家的某些类型的行为。想想你作为DM的风格和你的小组的喜好。什么有助于使游戏对你的小组更有趣？什么类型的行为符合你的活动风格或流派？你对这些问题的回答有助于决定你何时授予灵感。",
	"Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence, you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.": "对于大多数团体来说，使用灵感来奖励角色扮演是一个好的开始。当一个玩家使他或她的角色做了与该角色的个性特征、缺陷或纽带相一致的事情时，就用灵感来奖励该玩家。角色的行动应该在某些方面值得注意。它可能会推动故事的发展，将冒险者推入危险之中，或者让桌子上的所有人都笑起来。从本质上讲，你奖励玩家的角色扮演，使游戏对其他人来说更加愉快。",
	"Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.": "考虑到每个玩家的角色扮演风格，尽量不要偏向于一种风格。例如，艾莉森可能很喜欢用口音说话，并采用她的角色的举止，但保罗在尝试表演时感到很自觉，更喜欢描述他的角色的态度和行动。两种风格都不比对方好。灵感鼓励玩家参与并做出良好的努力，公平地授予它使游戏对每个人都更好。",
	"You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the midst of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.": "你可以用灵感来鼓励玩家角色去冒险。一个战士通常不会把自己扔到阳台上，落在一群饥饿的食尸鬼中间，但你可以用灵感来奖励这个角色的大胆举动。这样的奖励告诉玩家，你想让他们拥护挥霍无度的行动。",
	"This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a {@dice d20} roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure-and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.": "这种方法很适合强调行动英雄主义的活动。对于这样的战役，可以考虑让灵感在掷出{@dice d20}之后，而不是之前花费。这种方法将灵感变成对失败的缓冲--保证它只在玩家直接面临失败时才发挥作用。这样的保证使冒险的战术不那么令人生畏。",
	"Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.": "有些DM喜欢在他们的活动中扮演公正的角色。灵感通常需要DM的判断来授予，如果你喜欢让骰子决定大多数结果的战役，这可能会违背你的风格。如果这是你的风格，可以考虑在人物达到重要目标或取得胜利时使用灵感作为奖励，代表一种信心和能量的激增。",
	"Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.": "在这种模式下，如果人物成功地击败了一个强大的敌人，执行了一个狡猾的计划来实现一个目标，或以其他方式克服了运动中的一个艰巨的障碍，就给党内的每个人以灵感。",
	"Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw:": "灵感是一个方便的工具，可以强化某一特定流派的惯例。在这种方法下，把一个流派的主题看作是可以适用于任何冒险者的个性特征、缺陷和纽带。例如，在一个受黑色电影启发的活动中，人物可以有一个额外的缺陷。",
	"\"I can't resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.\" If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.": "\"我无法抗拒帮助一个我觉得很诱人的人，尽管有警告说他或她只是个麻烦。\" 如果人物同意帮助一个可疑但有诱惑力的贵族，从而卷入一个阴谋和背叛的网络，就用灵感来奖励他们。",
	"Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.": "同样，恐怖故事中的人物通常会情不自禁地在闹鬼的房子里过夜，了解它的秘密。他们可能也会在不应该去的时候独自离开。如果聚会分头进行，考虑给每个角色以灵感。",
	"A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.": "一个明智的人会避开贵族的阴谋和鬼屋，但在黑色电影或恐怖片中，我们面对的不是明智的人；我们面对的是一个特殊类型故事中的主角。为了使这种方法奏效，请创建一个你的流派的主要惯例的清单，并与你的玩家分享它。在活动开始前，讨论这个清单，以确保你的小组同意接受这些惯例。",
	"Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.": "记住，拥有灵感的玩家可以把它授予另一个玩家。有些团体甚至喜欢把灵感当作一种团体资源，集体决定什么时候把它用在卷轴上。最好的办法是让玩家按照他们认为合适的方式授予他们的灵感，但可以随时与他们讨论如何遵守某些准则，特别是如果你试图加强某种类型的惯例。",
	"Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.": "考虑你的灵感奖励的时机。有些管理人喜欢在行动后奖励灵感。其他管理员则喜欢在玩家考虑选项时提供灵感，以鼓励特定的行动。这两种方法都有其优势和劣势。",
	"Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.": "等到行动之后再进行，可以保留游戏的流程，但这也意味着玩家不知道他们的决定是否会给他们带来灵感。这也意味着玩家不能在赢得灵感的行为上花费灵感，除非你允许玩家追溯花费灵感，或者在任何掷骰子之前迅速授予灵感。这种方法最适合那些想要关注沉浸感和玩家代理权的团体，在这种情况下，管理员退后一步，给玩家更多的自由来做他们想做的事。",
	"Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling tale together.": "告诉玩家某项行动将获得灵感，可以让玩家明白，但也会让人觉得你在操纵玩家或为他们做选择。在行动之前提供灵感，对于那些喜欢强调流派模仿和集体讲故事的团体来说是很好的，在这些团体中，角色自由并不像编织一个引人注目的故事那样重要。",
	"Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.": "开始时，在一次行动后授予灵感，特别是对于你的第一次战役或与一个新团体一起玩时。这种方法对游戏流程的破坏性最小，而且可以避免让玩家觉得你在操纵他们。",
	"A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token Alternatively, you can hand out special {@dice d20}s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the {@dice d20} can go to that other person.": "玩家通常会在角色表上记下他或她是否有灵感，或者你可以使用扑克牌筹码或其他代币，或者你可以发放特殊的（%0%）来代表灵感。当玩家花费灵感时，他或她会掷出骰子，然后把它交还给你。如果玩家把灵感给了其他人，那么{@dice d20}可以给那个人。",
	"Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration.": "灵感可能对你的活动不起作用。有些管理员觉得它增加了一层元游戏的思维，而另一些人则觉得英雄主义、角色扮演和游戏的其他部分是他们自己的奖励，不需要灵感这样的激励。",
	"If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.": "如果你选择忽略灵感，你就是在告诉玩家，你的战役是一个让骰子落在哪里都可以的地方。这是一个很好的选择，适用于粗暴的战役，或者DM专注于扮演一个公正的规则仲裁者的角色。",
	"As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.": "作为一个DM，你在游戏过程中有很多事情要追踪。有时你会失去对灵感的追踪，而忘记授予它。作为一个变通规则，你可以让玩家完全处理授予灵感的问题。在每个环节中，每个玩家都可以向另一个玩家授予灵感。玩家遵循小组商定的授予灵感的任何准则。",
	"This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.": "这种方法使你的生活更轻松，也让玩家有机会互相认可对方的良好发挥。你仍然需要确保公平地授予灵感。",
	"This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.": "这种方法在专注于故事的小组中效果最好。如果玩家只是在关键情况下操纵它来获得优势，而没有通过良好的角色扮演或小组建立的其他标准来赢得灵感，那么这种方法就会落空。",
	"In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.": "在这个变体中，你可以允许每个棋手在每一节中授予灵感一次以上。如果你这样做，一个玩家在一个会话中第一次授予灵感是免费的。每当该玩家在同一会话中授予灵感时，你就会获得灵感，你可以用它来给玩家角色的任何敌人带来好处。你可以通过这种方式获得的灵感数量没有限制，而且未使用的灵感可以从一个会话延续到下一个会话。",
	"You determine the consequences of attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. In most cases, doing so is straightforward. When an attack hits, it deals damage.": "你决定攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力的后果。在大多数情况下，这样做是直截了当的。当攻击命中时，会造成伤害。",
	"When a creature fails a saving throw, the creature suffers a harmful effect. When an ability check equals or exceeds the DC, the check succeeds.": "当一个生物的拯救动作失败时，该生物会受到一个有害的影响。当一个能力检查等于或超过DC时，检查成功。",
	"As a DM, you have a variety of flourishes and approaches you can take when adjudicating success and failure to make things a little less black-and-white.": "作为一个管理人，你在裁决成功和失败时可以采取各种花样和方法，使事情变得不那么黑白分明。",
	"Failure can be tough, but the agony is compounded when a character fails by the barest margin. When a character fails a roll by only 1 or 2, you can allow the character to succeed at the cost of a complication or hindrance. Such complications can run along any of the following lines:": "失败是很难受的，但是当一个角色以最微小的差距失败时，这种痛苦就会更加严重。当一个角色只失败了1或2次时，你可以让这个角色以一个复杂情况或障碍为代价获得成功。这种复杂情况可以沿着以下任何一条线进行。",
	"A character manages to get her sword past a hobgoblin's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, but the hobgoblin twists its shield and disarms her.": "一个角色设法让她的剑穿过一个妖精的防御，并把一个近乎失误的攻击变成了一个命中，但妖精扭动它的盾牌并解除了她的武装。",
	"A character narrowly escapes the full brunt of a fireball but ends up prone.": "一个角色勉强躲过了火球的全部冲击，但最后还是倒地不起。",
	"A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking at the top of its lungs, alerting other nearby monsters.": "一个角色没能吓倒一个哥布林囚犯，但哥布林还是透露了自己的秘密，同时大声尖叫，惊动了附近的其他怪物。",
	"A character manages to finish an arduous climb to the top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the rope on which his companions dangle below him is close to breaking.": "一个人物在滑倒的情况下成功地完成了对悬崖顶部的艰苦攀登，却发现他的同伴在他下面吊着的绳子已经接近断裂。",
	"When you introduce costs such as these, try to make them obstacles and setbacks that change the nature of the adventuring situation. In exchange for success, players must consider new ways of facing the challenge.": "当你引入诸如此类的成本时，尽量使它们成为改变冒险情况性质的障碍和挫折。为了换取成功，玩家必须考虑新的方式来面对挑战。",
	"You can also use this technique when a character succeeds on a roll by hitting the DC exactly, complicating marginal success in interesting ways.": "你也可以在一个角色通过准确击中DC而翻身成功时使用这种技巧，以有趣的方式使边际成功复杂化。",
	"Sometimes a failed ability check has different consequences depending on the degree of failure. For example, a character who fails to disarm a trapped chest might accidentally spring the trap if the check fails by 5 or more, whereas a lesser failure means that the trap wasn't triggered during the botched disarm attempt.": "有时，能力检查失败会根据失败的程度而产生不同的后果。例如，一个人物在解除一个被困的箱子时失败了，如果检查失败了5个或更多，他可能会意外地触发陷阱，而较小的失败意味着陷阱在失败的解除尝试中没有被触发。",
	"Consider adding similar distinctions to other checks. Perhaps a failed Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check means a queen won't help, whereas a failure of 5 or more means she throws you in the dungeon for your impudence.": "考虑在其他检查中加入类似的区别。也许，魅力（（%0%））检查失败意味着女王不会帮忙，而失败5次以上意味着她会因为你的无礼而把你扔进地牢。",
	"Rolling a 20 or a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw doesn't normally have any special effect. However, you can choose to take such an exceptional roll into account when adjudicating the outcome. It's up to you to determine how this manifests in the game. An easy approach is to increase the impact of the success or failure. For example, rolling a 1 on a failed attempt to pick a lock might break the {@item thieves' tools|phb} being used, and rolling a 20 on a successful Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check might reveal an extra clue.": "在能力检查或蓄力投掷中掷出20或1，通常不会有任何特殊效果。然而，你可以选择在裁决结果时考虑到这种特殊的滚动。至于在游戏中如何表现，则由你来决定。一个简单的方法是增加成功或失败的影响。例如，在开锁失败的情况下掷出1，可能会打破正在使用的{@item thieves' tools|phb}，而在成功的智力({@skill Investigation})检查中掷出20，可能会发现一个额外的线索。",
	"This section provides guidance for running exploration, especially travel, tracking, and visibility.": "本节为运行探索提供指导，特别是旅行、跟踪和可视性。",
	"Whatever environment the adventurers are exploring, you can use a map to follow their progress as you relate the details of their travels. In a dungeon, tracking movement on a map lets you describe the branching passages, doors, chambers, and other features the adventurers encounter as they go, and gives the players the opportunity to choose their own path. Similarly, a wilderness map can show roads, rivers, terrain, and other features that might guide the characters on their travels-or lead them astray.": "无论冒险家们在探索什么环境，你都可以用地图来跟踪他们的进展，同时讲述他们旅行的细节。在地下城中，在地图上跟踪移动，可以让你描述冒险者在前进过程中遇到的分支通道、门、房间和其他特征，并让玩家有机会选择自己的道路。同样，荒野地图可以显示道路、河流、地形和其他可能引导人物旅行的特征，或者把他们引入歧途。",
	"The Map Travel Pace table helps you track travel on maps of different scales. The table shows how much distance on a map the adventurers can cover on foot in minutes, hours, or days. The table uses the travel paces-slow, normal, and fast-described in the Player's Handbook. Characters moving at a normal pace can walk about 24 miles in a day.": "地图旅行速度表可以帮助你在不同比例尺的地图上追踪旅行。该表显示了冒险者在地图上可以用几分钟、几小时或几天的时间步行走完多少距离。该表使用了《玩家手册》中描述的旅行步调--慢速、正常和快速。以正常速度前进的角色在一天内可以走大约24英里。",

	"The rules on travel pace in the Player's Handbook assume that a group of travelers adopts a pace that, over time, is unaffected by the individual members' walking speeds. The difference between walking speeds can be significant during combat, but during an overland journey, the difference vanishes as travelers pause to catch their breath, the faster ones wait for the slower ones, and one traveler's quickness is matched by another traveler's endurance.": "玩家手册中关于旅行速度的规则假定，一群旅行者采用的速度，随着时间的推移，不受个别成员行走速度的影响。在战斗中，行走速度的差异可能会很大，但在陆路旅行中，这种差异会消失，因为旅行者会暂停喘息，快的人等待慢的人，一个旅行者的速度会被另一个旅行者的耐力所匹配。",
	"A character bestride a phantom steed, soaring through the air on a carpet of flying, or riding a sailboat or a steam-powered gnomish contraption doesn't travel at a normal rate, since the magic, engine, or wind doesn't tire the way a creature does and the air doesn't contain the types of obstructions found on land. When a creature is traveling with a flying speed or with a speed granted by magic, an engine, or a natural force (such as wind or a water current), translate that speed into travel rates using the following rules:": "一个骑着幻影骏马的角色，乘着飞毯在空中翱翔，或者乘坐帆船或以蒸汽为动力的侏儒装置，都不会以正常的速度旅行，因为魔法、引擎或风不会像生物那样疲劳，而且空气中也没有陆地上的那种障碍物。当一个生物以飞行速度或以魔法、引擎或自然力量（如风或水流）赋予的速度旅行时，请使用以下规则将该速度转化为旅行速率。",

In 1 hour, the character can travel 7, 10, or 13 miles.": "同样地，幻影骏马咒语创造了一个速度为100英尺的魔法坐骑，它不会像真正的马一样疲劳。骑着幻影骏马的人物在1分钟内以正常速度可以走1000英尺，以快速度走1333英尺，或以慢速度走666英尺。在1小时内，该人物可以走7、10或13英里。",
	"When traveling outdoors, characters can see about 2 miles in any direction on a clear day, or until the point where trees, hills, or other obstructions block their view.

	"If neither side is being stealthy, creatures automatically notice each other once they are within sight or hearing range of one another. Otherwise, compare the Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check results of the creatures in the group that is hiding with the passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores of the other group, as explained in the {@i Player's Handbook}.": "如果双方都没有隐身，一旦他们在彼此的视线或听觉范围内，生物就会自动注意到对方。否则，将躲藏的那组生物的灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查结果与另一组的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分进行比较，如{@i Player's Handbook}中所解释的。",
	"Adventurers sometimes choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures-or other creatures might track the adventurers!

	"The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder.": "天气条件或地形的变化使追踪变得更加困难。",
	"The DC for the check depends on how well the ground shows signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. For example, no check is needed to track an army advancing along a muddy road. Spotting tracks on a bare stone floor is more challenging, unless the creature being tracked leaves a distinct trail. Additionally, the passage of time often makes tracks harder to follow. In a situation where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is impossible. The Tracking DCs table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage on the check if there's more than one set of tracks to follow, or disadvantage if the trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area.": "检查的DC取决于地面上的生物通过的痕迹有多大。在足迹明显的情况下，不需要进行检定。例如，追踪一支在泥泞道路上前进的军队就不需要检查。在光秃秃的石头地面上发现足迹则更具挑战性，除非被追踪的生物留下明显的痕迹。此外，时间的流逝往往使足迹更难追踪。在没有痕迹可循的情况下，你可以判定追踪是不可能的。追踪DCs表提供了设置DC的指南，或者，如果你愿意，你可以根据你对难度的评估选择一个DC。如果有一组以上的足迹可供追踪，你也可以在检查中给予优势，如果被追踪的足迹经过了一个人迹罕至的地区，则给予劣势。",
	"On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to find a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour outdoors.": "如果检查失败，角色就会失去踪迹，但可以通过对该地区进行仔细的搜索来试图再次找到它。在一个封闭的区域（如地牢）寻找线索需要10分钟，在户外则需要1小时。",

	"Some DMs prefer to run a social interaction as a free-form roleplaying exercise, where dice rarely come into play. Other DMs prefer to resolve the outcome of an interaction by having characters make Charisma checks. Either approach works, and most games fall somewhere in between, balancing player skill(roleplaying and persuading) with character skill (reflected by ability checks).": "有些DM喜欢把社交互动作为一种自由形式的角色扮演练习，骰子很少发挥作用。其他DM喜欢通过让角色进行魅力检查来决定互动的结果。两种方法都可以，而且大多数游戏都介于两者之间，在玩家的技能（角色扮演和说服）和角色的技能（通过能力检查反映出来）之间取得平衡。",

	"A {@b friendly} creature wants to help the adventurers and wishes for them to succeed. For tasks or actions that require no particular risk, effort, or cost, friendly creatures usually help without question. If an element of personal risk is involved, a successful Charisma check might be required to convince a friendly creature to take that risk.": "一个{@b friendly}的生物想要帮助冒险者，并希望他们能够成功。对于不需要特别风险、努力或代价的任务或行动，友好的生物通常会毫不犹豫地帮助。如果涉及到个人风险的因素，可能需要成功的魅力检查来说服友好的生物去承担这个风险。",
	"An {@b indifferent} creature might help or hinder the party, depending on what the creature sees as most beneficial. A creature's indifference doesn't necessarily make it standoffish or disinterested. Indifferent creatures might be polite and genial, surly and irritable, or anything in between. A successful Charisma check is necessary when the adventurers try to persuade an indifferent creature to do something.": "一个{@b indifferent}的生物可能会帮助或阻碍聚会，这取决于该生物认为什么是最有利的。一个生物的冷漠并不一定使它变得冷漠或不感兴趣。冷漠的生物可能是有礼貌的、和蔼的，也可能是暴躁的、易怒的，或者是介于两者之间的任何东西。当冒险者试图说服一个冷漠的生物做某事时，需要成功的魅力检查。",
	"A {@b hostile} creature opposes the adventurers and their goals but doesn't necessarily attack them on sight. For example, a condescending noble might wish to see a group of upstart adventurers fail so as to keep them from becoming rivals for the king's attention, thwarting them with slander and scheming rather than direct threats and violence. The adventurers need to succeed on one or more challenging Charisma checks to convince a hostile creature to do anything on their behalf. That said, a hostile creature might be so ill-disposed toward the party that no Charisma check can improve its attitude, in which case any attempt to sway it through diplomacy fails automatically.": "一个{@b hostile}的生物反对冒险者和他们的目标，但不一定要当场攻击他们。例如，一个居高临下的贵族可能希望看到一群新进的冒险者失败，以防止他们成为国王的竞争对手，用诽谤和阴谋诡计来挫败他们，而不是直接威胁和暴力。冒险家们需要在一次或多次具有挑战性的魅力检查中获得成功，才能说服敌对的生物为他们做任何事情。也就是说，一个敌对的生物可能对他们非常不友好，以至于任何魅力检查都无法改善它的态度，在这种情况下，任何试图通过外交手段动摇它的努力都会自动失败。",
	"Play out the conversation. Let the adventurers make their points, trying to frame their statements in terms that are meaningful to the creature they are interacting with.": "扮演好对话的角色。让冒险家们提出他们的观点，试着用对他们所交往的生物有意义的术语来表达他们的陈述。",
	"The attitude of a creature might change over the course of a conversation. If the adventurers say or do the right things during an interaction (perhaps by touching on a creature's ideal, bond, or flaw), they can make a hostile creature temporarily indifferent, or make an indifferent creature temporarily friendly. Likewise, a gaffe, insult, or harmful deed might make a friendly creature temporarily indifferent or turn an indifferent creature hostile.": "一个生物的态度可能在对话过程中发生变化。如果冒险者在互动过程中说了或做了正确的事情（也许是通过触及一个生物的理想、纽带或缺陷），他们可以使一个敌对的生物暂时变得冷漠，或者使一个冷漠的生物暂时变得友好。同样地，一个失误、侮辱或有害的行为可能会使一个友好的生物暂时变得冷漠，或使一个冷漠的生物变得敌对。",
	"Whether the adventurers can shift a creature's attitude is up to you. You decide whether the adventurers have successfully couched their statements in terms that matter to the creature. Typically, a creature's attitude can't shift more than one step during a single interaction, whether temporarily or permanently.": "冒险者是否能改变一个生物的态度由你决定。你决定冒险者是否成功地用对该生物有意义的术语表达了他们的陈述。一般来说，一个生物的态度在一次互动中不能转变超过一步，无论是暂时的还是永久的。",
	"The adventurers don't necessarily enter into a social interaction with a full understanding of a creature's ideal, bond, or flaw. If they want to shift a creature's attitude by playing on these characteristics, they first need to determine what the creature cares about. They can guess, but doing so runs the risk of shifting the creature's attitude in the wrong direction if they guess badly.": "冒险家们在进入社会互动时不一定完全了解一个生物的理想、纽带或缺陷。如果他们想通过利用这些特征来改变一个生物的态度，他们首先需要确定这个生物所关心的是什么。他们可以猜测，但这样做有可能使生物的态度向错误的方向转变，如果他们猜得不好的话。",
	"After interacting with a creature long enough to get a sense of its personality traits and characteristics through conversation, an adventurer can attempt a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to uncover one of the creature's characteristics. You set the DC. A check that fails by 10 or more might misidentify a characteristic, so you should provide a false characteristic or invert one of the creature's existing characteristics. For example, if an old sage's flaw is that he is prejudiced against the uneducated, an adventurer who badly fails the check might be told that the sage enjoys personally seeing to the education of the downtrodden.": "在与一个生物互动了足够长的时间，通过谈话了解了它的性格特征和特点之后，冒险者可以尝试用智慧（（%0%））检查来发现这个生物的一个特点。你来设定DC。如果检定失败了10次或更多，可能会误认一个特征，所以你应该提供一个假的特征或颠倒该生物的一个现有特征。例如，如果一个老圣人的缺陷是他对未受教育的人有偏见，那么一个严重失败的冒险者可能会被告知，这个圣人喜欢亲自去看那些被压迫者的教育。",
	"Given time, adventurers can also learn about a creature's characteristics from other sources, including its friends and allies, personal letters, and publicly told stories. Acquiring such information might be the basis of an entirely different set of social interactions.": "如果有时间，冒险者也可以从其他来源了解一个生物的特征，包括它的朋友和盟友、私人信件和公开讲述的故事。获得这些信息可能是一套完全不同的社会互动的基础。",
	"When the adventurers get to the point of their request, demand, or suggestion-or if you decide the conversation has run its course-call for a Charisma check. Any character who has actively participated in the conversation can make the check. Depending on how the adventurers handled the conversation, the Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation skill might apply to the check. The creature's current attitude determines the DC required to achieve a specific reaction, as shown in the Conversation Reaction table.": "当冒险者说到他们的请求、要求或建议时，或者如果你认为对话已经结束，就要求进行魅力检查。任何积极参加谈话的角色都可以进行检查。根据冒险者处理对话的方式，劝说、欺骗或恐吓技能可能适用于检查。生物的当前态度决定了实现特定反应所需的DC，如对话反应表所示。",
	"The creature does as asked without taking risks or making sacrifices.": "该生物按要求行事，不冒风险，不做牺牲。",
	"The creature accepts a minor risk or sacrifice to do as asked.": "该生物接受了一个小的风险或牺牲来做所要求的事。",
	"The creature accepts a significant risk or sacrifice to do as asked.": "该生物接受重大的风险或牺牲，按照要求行事。",
	"The creature offers no help but does no harm.": "该生物没有提供任何帮助，但没有造成任何伤害。",
	"The creature does as asked as long as no risks or sacrifices are involved.": "只要不涉及风险或牺牲，该生物就会按要求行事。",
	"The creature opposes the adventurers' actions and might take risks to do so.": "该生物反对冒险者的行动，并可能为此承担风险。",
	"Other characters who make substantial contributions to the conversation can help the character making the check. If a helping character says or does something that would influence the interaction in a positive way, the character making the Charisma check can do so with advantage. If the other character inadvertently says something counter productive or offensive, the character making the Charisma check has disadvantage on that check.": "其他对谈话有重大贡献的角色可以帮助进行检查的角色。如果帮助的角色说了或做了一些会对互动产生积极影响的事情，进行魅力检查的角色就会有优势。如果其他角色无意中说了一些反作用力或攻击性的话，进行魅力检查的角色在检查中处于不利地位。",
	"Certain situations might call for more than one check, particularly if the adventurers come into the interaction with multiple goals.": "某些情况下可能需要不止一次的检查，特别是当冒险者带着多个目标进入互动时。",
	"Once a Charisma check has been made, further attempts to influence the target of the interaction might be fruitless or run the risk of upsetting or angering the subject creature, potentially shifting its attitude toward hostility. Use your best judgment. For example, if the party's rogue says something that pushes a noble's attitude toward the party from indifferent to hostile, another character might be able to diffuse the noble's hostility with clever roleplaying and a successful Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check.": "一旦进行了魅力检查，进一步试图影响互动的目标可能没有结果，或者有可能使目标生物不安或愤怒，有可能使其态度转向敌意。使用你的最佳判断。例如，如果党的无赖说了一些话，把一个贵族对党的态度从冷漠推到了敌意，另一个角色可能会通过巧妙的角色扮演和成功的魅力（%0%）检查来化解这个贵族的敌意。",
	"For some DMs, roleplaying comes naturally. If it doesn't come naturally for you, don't worry. The main thing is for you to have fun portraying your NPCs and monsters and to amuse your players in the process. You don't need to be a practiced thespian or comedian to create drama or humor. The key is to pay attention to the story elements and characterizations that make your players laugh or feel emotionally engaged and to incorporate those things into your roleplaying.": "对于一些DM来说，角色扮演是很自然的。如果对你来说不自然，也不用担心。最主要的是，你要在扮演NPC和怪物的过程中获得乐趣，并让你的玩家感到愉快。你不需要成为一个熟练的戏剧家或喜剧演员来创造戏剧或幽默。关键是要注意那些能让你的玩家发笑或感到情绪激动的故事元素和角色描述，并将这些东西融入你的角色扮演中。",
	"Imagine how a character or monster you bring to life would react to the adventurers. Consider what it cares about. Does it have any ideals, flaws, or bonds? By working such things into your portrayal, you not only make the character or monster more believable, but you also enhance the sense that the adventurers are in a living world.": "想象一下，你带来的角色或怪物会对冒险者有什么反应。考虑一下它关心什么。它是否有任何理想、缺陷或纽带？通过在你的描写中加入这样的东西，你不仅使这个人物或怪物更加可信，而且还增强了冒险者在一个活生生的世界中的感觉。",
	"Strive for responses and actions that introduce twists into the game. For example, an old woman whose family was killed at the hands of an evil wizard might regard the party's wizard with grave suspicion.": "努力使反应和行动能够为游戏带来转折。例如，一个家庭在邪恶巫师手中被杀的老妇人可能会对党的巫师产生严重怀疑。",
	"However you roleplay a character or monster, the classic advice for writers holds true: show, don't tell. For example, rather than describe an NPC as shallow and self-centered, have the individual act the way you would expect a shallow, self-centered person to behave. The NPC might have off-the-cuff answers for everything, an over-willingness to share personal anecdotes, and a desperate need to make himself or herself the subject of every conversation.": "无论你如何扮演一个角色或怪物，对作家的经典建议是正确的：展示，不要告诉。例如，与其把一个NPC描述为浅薄和自我中心，不如让这个人以你期望一个浅薄、自我中心的人的方式来行事。这个NPC可能对任何事情都有随口而出的答案，过于愿意分享个人的轶事，并且急切地想让自己成为每次谈话的主题。",
	"Most of what you say during a session will be at a consistent level. For dramatic effect, be ready to shout out a battle cry or speak in a conspiratorial whisper.": "你在会议期间说的大部分话都会在一个一致的水平上。为了达到戏剧性的效果，要准备好喊出战斗的口号，或用阴谋家的低语说话。",
	"Also, characters and monsters with distinctive voices are memorable. If you're not a natural mimic or actor, borrowing distinctive speech patterns from real life, the movies, or television is a good place to start. Practice different voices and impersonations of famous people, then use those voices to bring your NPCs to life.": "此外，具有独特声音的人物和怪物也令人难忘。如果你不是一个天生的模仿者或演员，从现实生活、电影或电视中借用独特的说话方式是一个好的开始。练习不同的声音和对名人的模仿，然后用这些声音来使你的NPC活起来。",
	"Experiment with different speech patterns. For instance, a barmaid and a city magistrate probably use their words differently. Similarly, peasants could speak in earthy dialects, while rich folk talk in haughty drawls.": "实验一下不同的说话方式。例如，一个酒吧女和一个城市治安官可能用词不同。同样，农民可以用朴实的方言说话，而富人则用高傲的口气说话。",
	"Let a pirate NPC say, \"Arrrr, maties!\" in your best Long John Silver voice. Let intelligent monsters unfamiliar with Common stumble along with awkward grammar.": "让一个海盗NPC用你最擅长的Long John Silver的声音说：\"Arrrr, maties!\"。让不熟悉普通话的智能怪物用笨拙的语法蹒跚而行。",
	"Let drunkards and monsters mutter with slurred speech, while lizardfolk hiss their threats. In any interaction with multiple NPCs, make sure the adventurers remain the focus. Have the NPCs talk to them, not so much to each other. If possible, let one NPC do most of the talking, but if multiple NPCs need to talk, give them distinct voices so the players know who's who.": "让酒鬼和怪物口齿不清地嘀咕，而蜥蜴人则发出威胁的声音。在与多个NPC的任何互动中，要确保冒险者仍然是焦点。让NPC与他们交谈，而不是相互交谈。如果可能的话，让一个NPC做大部分的谈话，但是如果多个NPC需要谈话，让他们发出不同的声音，这样玩家就能知道谁是谁。",
	"Use your facial expressions to help show a character's emotions. Scowl, smile, grin, snarl, pout, cross your eyes-do whatever it takes to make the character or monster memorable to the players. When you combine facial expressions with an unusual voice, a character truly comes to life.": "使用你的面部表情来帮助显示一个角色的情绪。皱眉、微笑、咧嘴、咆哮、撅嘴、横眉冷对--只要能让玩家记住这个角色或怪物就可以了。当你把面部表情和不寻常的声音结合起来时，一个角色就会真正地活过来。",
	"Though you don't need to stand up out of your chair, you can use your arms to bring even more life to an NPC. A noble could chop the air with one hand while speaking in a deadpan monotone, while an archmage might express her displeasure by silently rolling her eyes and massaging her temples with her fingers.": "虽然你不需要从椅子上站起来，但你可以用你的手臂为NPC带来更多的活力。一个贵族可以用一只手砍空气，同时用死板的单调语气说话，而一个大法师可以通过默默地翻白眼和用手指按摩太阳穴来表达她的不满。",
	"Some players enjoy roleplaying and interaction more than others. Whatever your players' tastes, your lively portrayal of NPCs and monsters can inspire players to make just as much investment in portraying their characters. This makes social interactions an opportunity for everyone to become more immersed in the game, creating a story whose protagonists have depth.": "有些玩家比其他人更喜欢角色扮演和互动。无论你的玩家口味如何，你对NPC和怪物的生动描写可以激发玩家在描写他们的角色时做出同样多的投入。这使得社交互动成为每个人都能更沉浸于游戏的机会，创造一个主角有深度的故事。",
	"To make sure everyone has something to do during a roleplaying-heavy game session, consider one or more of the following approaches.": "为了确保每个人在重度角色扮演的游戏环节中都有事情可做，可以考虑以下一种或多种方法。",
	"There are in-game activities that players enjoy more than others, as discussed in this book's introduction. Players who like acting thrive in interaction situations, and it's fine to let those players take the spotlight. They often inspire other players by their example, but make sure those other players have an opportunity to join in the fun.": "有些游戏中的活动，玩家比其他玩家更喜欢，正如本书介绍中所讨论的。喜欢表演的玩家在互动的情况下会很活跃，让这些玩家成为焦点也是可以的。他们经常通过自己的榜样来激励其他玩家，但要确保其他玩家有机会加入到乐趣中。",
	"Players who like exploring and storytelling are usually amenable to roleplaying, as long as it moves the campaign forward and reveals more about the world. Players who like problem-solving often enjoy figuring out the right thing to say to shift an NPC's attitude. Players who are instigators like provoking reactions from NPCs, so they're often easily engaged-though not always productively.": "喜欢探索和讲故事的玩家通常都能接受角色扮演，只要它能推动活动的发展，并揭示更多关于世界的信息。喜欢解决问题的玩家通常喜欢找出正确的话来改变NPC的态度。喜欢煽动的玩家喜欢挑起NPC的反应，所以他们通常很容易参与，尽管并不总是有成效的。",
	"Players who like to optimize their characters and slay monsters also like to argue, and having conflict within an interaction can help those players embrace roleplaying. Still, creating combat connections to an extended interaction (such as a corrupt vizier sending assassins to kill the adventurers) is often the best way to keep action-focused players engaged.": "喜欢优化角色和杀戮怪物的玩家也喜欢争论，在互动中出现冲突可以帮助这些玩家接受角色扮演。不过，在扩展的互动中建立战斗联系（比如腐败的宰相派刺客去杀冒险家），往往是让注重行动的玩家参与进来的最好方法。",
	"Create situations where characters who might not otherwise be engaged with a social interaction have to do at least some of the talking. Perhaps the NPC in question is a family member or a contact of a particular adventurer and talks only to that character. An NPC of a certain race or class might listen only to characters he or she feels a kinship with. Creating a sense of importance can be a great way to get specific players engaged, but don't shut out players who are already roleplaying.": "创造一些情况，让那些在其他情况下可能不会参与社交活动的角色至少要做一些谈话。也许这个NPC是某位冒险家的家庭成员或联系人，他只和这个角色说话。某个种族或阶级的NPC可能只听他或她觉得有亲缘关系的人物说话。创造一种重要性的感觉可以是让特定玩家参与进来的好方法，但不要把已经在玩角色扮演的玩家拒之门外。",
	"If a couple of players are dominating the conversation, take a moment now and then to involve the others. You can do this in character if you like: \"And what about your hulking friend? Speak, barbarian! What will you pledge in exchange for my favor?\" Or just ask the player what his or her character is doing while the conversation is going on. The first approach is better for players who are already comfortable speaking in their characters' voices. The second approach works better for players who need encouragement to engage in a roleplaying scenario.": "如果有几个玩家主导了谈话，那就花点时间让其他人参与进来。如果你愿意，你可以在角色中这样做。\"那你的大块头朋友呢？说吧，野蛮人！你要用什么来交换？你会用什么来交换我的帮助？\" 或者直接问玩家他或她的角色在做什么，而对话正在进行中。第一种方法更适合那些已经能用自己角色的声音说话的玩家。第二种方法对那些需要鼓励才能参与角色扮演的玩家来说效果更好。",
	"When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire's coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character's success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.": "当角色需要锯断绳索、打碎窗户或砸碎吸血鬼的棺材时，唯一的硬性规定是：只要有足够的时间和正确的工具，角色就可以破坏任何可破坏的物体。在决定一个角色是否能成功破坏一个物体时，请使用常识。一个战士能用剑切开一段石墙吗？不能，剑很可能会在墙之前就断裂。",
	"For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.": "在这些规则中，物体是指一个离散的、无生命的物品，如窗户、门、剑、书、桌子、椅子或石头，而不是由许多其他物体组成的建筑物或车辆。",
	"When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.": "当时间是一个因素时，你可以给一个可破坏的物体分配一个装甲等级和命中率。你还可以赋予它免疫力、抵抗力和对特定类型伤害的脆弱性。",
	"An object's Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.": "一个物体的护甲等级是衡量对该物体造成伤害的难度（因为该物体没有机会躲避）。物体护甲等级表提供了各种物质的建议AC值。",

	"An object's hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.": "一个物体的命中率衡量它在失去其结构完整性之前能承受多少伤害。有弹性的物体比脆弱的物体有更多的击中点。大型物体也往往比小型物体有更多的命中率，除非打破物体的一小部分和打破整个物体一样有效。物体命中率表提供了脆弱和有弹性的大型或小型物体的建议命中率。",
	"Tiny (bottle, lock)": "小小的（瓶子，锁）。",
	"Small (chest, lute)": "小（胸腔、琵琶）",
	"Medium (barrel, chandelier)": "中型（桶形、吊灯）",

	"Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object's hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.": "普通的武器对许多巨大的物体没有什么用处，例如巨大的雕像、高耸的石柱或巨大的巨石。也就是说，一个火把就可以烧掉一个巨大的挂毯，一个地震法术就可以把一个巨像变成废墟。如果你愿意，你可以追踪一个巨大或巨型物体的命中率，或者你可以简单地决定这个物体能够承受多久的武器或力量。如果你追踪物体的命中率，可以把它分成大型或小型部分，分别追踪每一部分的命中率。摧毁其中一个部分可能会毁掉整个物体。例如，一个巨大的人类雕像，当它的一条大腿被降低到0命中率时，可能会翻倒。",
	"Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can't effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.": "物体对毒药和精神伤害是免疫的。你可能会决定某些伤害类型对某个特定的物体或物质比其他的更有效。例如，重击伤害对砸碎东西很有效，但对切割绳子或皮革则无效。纸质或布质物体可能容易受到火和雷电的伤害。镐头可以削掉石头，但不能有效地砍掉一棵树。一如既往，使用你的最佳判断。",
	"Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object's damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the object's hit points.": "像城堡墙壁这样的大型物体通常有额外的弹性，由伤害阈值表示。一个有伤害阈值的物体对所有的伤害都有免疫力，除非它从一次攻击或效果中受到的伤害量等于或大于它的伤害阈值，在这种情况下，它就会像平常一样受到伤害。任何未能达到或超过物体的伤害阈值的伤害都被认为是表面的，不会减少物体的命中率。",
	"This section builds on the combat rules in the Player's Handbook and offers tips for keeping the game running smoothly when a fight breaks out.": "本节以《玩家手册》中的战斗规则为基础，提供了在战斗爆发时保持游戏顺利进行的提示。",
	"You can use several different methods for keeping track of who goes when in combat.": "你可以使用几种不同的方法来记录谁在战斗中何时去。",
	"Many DMs keep track of initiative on a list the players can't see: usually a piece of paper behind a DM screen or a spreadsheet on a tablet computer. This method allows you to keep track of combatants who haven't been revealed yet, and you can use the initiative list as a place to record the current hit points of monsters, as well as other useful notes.": "许多DM在玩家看不到的清单上记录主动权：通常是DM屏幕后面的一张纸或平板电脑上的电子表格。这种方法可以让你追踪那些还没有暴露的战斗人员，你可以用主动权列表来记录怪物的当前命中率，以及其他有用的说明。",
	"A downside of this approach is that you have to remind the players round after round when their turns come up.": "这种方法的缺点是，当轮到玩家时，你必须一轮又一轮地提醒他们。",
	"You can use a whiteboard to track initiative. As the players tell you their initiative numbers, write them on the whiteboard in order from highest to lowest, leaving space between each name. Either write the monsters' initiatives on the list at the same time or add them to the list on each monster's first turn.": "你可以用白板来追踪主动权。当玩家告诉你他们的主动权号码时，按照从高到低的顺序将他们写在白板上，每个名字之间留出空间。你可以同时把怪物的主动权写在列表上，或者在每个怪物的第一个回合把它们加入列表。",
	"As a further improvement, use magnets that you can attach to a metal-based whiteboard with characters' and monsters' names written on them, or write those names on cards held in place by magnets.": "作为进一步的改进，使用磁铁，你可以把磁铁贴在金属基的白板上，上面写上人物和怪物的名字，或者把这些名字写在用磁铁固定的卡片上。",
	"A visible list lets everyone see the order of play. Players know when their turns are coming up, and they can start planning their actions in advance. A visible list also removes any uncertainty about when the monsters will act in the fight.": "可见的列表让每个人都能看到游戏的顺序。玩家知道他们的回合何时到来，他们可以提前开始计划他们的行动。可见的列表也消除了怪物在战斗中何时行动的任何不确定性。",
	"A variation on the visible list is to give one player responsibility for keeping track of initiative, either on a whiteboard or on a piece of paper the other players can see. This method reduces the number of things you need to keep track of yourself.": "可见清单的一个变种是让一个玩家负责记录主动权，可以在白板上或其他玩家可以看到的纸上记录。这种方法减少了你自己需要记录的事情。",
	"In this approach, each character gets an index card, as does each group of identical monsters. When the players tell you their initiative numbers, write the numbers on their characters' index cards. Do the same when you roll the monsters' initiative. Then arrange the cards in order from highest to lowest. Starting at the top, you move down through the stack. When you call out the name of the character whose turn it is, also mention who's next, prompting that player to start thinking ahead. After each character or group of monsters acts, the top card is moved to the bottom of the stack.": "在这种方法中，每个角色都有一张索引卡，每组相同的怪物也是如此。当玩家告诉你他们的主动权数字时，就把这些数字写在他们角色的索引卡上。当你掷出怪物的主动权时也要这样做。然后按从高到低的顺序排列卡片。从最上面开始，你在这堆卡片中往下走。当你喊出轮到的角色的名字时，也要提到谁是下一个，促使该玩家开始思考。每个角色或一组怪物行动后，最上面的牌被移到牌堆的底部。",
	"At first, players don't know the order of play when you use combat cards, and they don't know where the monsters fall into the order until the monsters act.": "一开始，玩家不知道你使用战斗牌时的游戏顺序，在怪物行动之前，他们不知道怪物的顺序在哪里。",
	"During a combat encounter, you need to track how much damage each monster takes. Most DMs track damage in secret so that their players don't know how many hit points a monster has remaining. Whether you choose to be secretive or not is up to you. What's important is that every monster's hit points be tracked individually.": "在战斗过程中，你需要跟踪每个怪物受到的伤害。大多数DM秘密地追踪伤害，这样他们的玩家就不知道怪物还剩下多少命中率。你是否选择保密，由你自己决定。重要的是，每个怪物的命中率都要单独跟踪。",
	"Tracking damage for one or two monsters isn't onerous, but it helps to have a system for larger groups of monsters. If you aren't using miniatures or other visual aids, the easiest way to keep track of your monsters is to assign them unique features.": "追踪一两个怪物的伤害并不繁重，但对于较大的怪物群来说，有一个系统是很有帮助的。如果你不使用微缩模型或其他视觉辅助工具，跟踪你的怪物的最简单的方法是为它们分配独特的特征。",
	"Descriptions such as \"the ogre with the nasty scar\" and \"the ogre with the horned helm\" help you and your players track which monster is which. For example, imagine that you're running an encounter with three ogres, each of which has 59 hit points. Once initiative is rolled, jot down each ogre's hit points and add notes (and even a name, if you like) to differentiate each one:": "诸如 \"有讨厌的疤痕的食人魔 \"和 \"有角盔的食人魔 \"这样的描述可以帮助你和你的玩家追踪哪个怪物是哪个。例如，想象一下，你正在进行一场有三个食人魔的遭遇战，每个食人魔都有59点攻击力。一旦开始行动，就记下每个食人魔的命中率，并加上注释（如果你愿意，甚至可以加上名字）来区分每个食人魔。",

	"Mur ({@creature ogre} who smells like poo): 59": "穆尔（（%0%）谁闻起来像大便）。59",
	"If you use miniatures to represent monsters, one easy way to differentiate them is to give each one a unique miniature. If you use identical miniatures to represent multiple monsters, you can tag the miniatures with small stickers of different colors or stickers with different letters or numbers on them.": "如果你用微缩模型来表现怪物，区分它们的一个简单方法是给每个怪物一个独特的微缩模型。如果你用相同的微缩模型来代表多个怪物，你可以用不同颜色的小贴纸或上面有不同字母或数字的贴纸来标记这些微缩模型。",
	"For example, in a combat encounter with three ogres, you could use three identical ogre miniatures tagged with stickers marked A, B, and C, respectively. To track the ogres' hit points, you can sort them by letter, then subtract damage from their hit points as they take it.": "例如，在与三个食人魔的战斗中，你可以使用三个相同的食人魔模型，分别用贴纸标记为A、B和C。为了追踪食人魔的命中率，你可以按照字母对它们进行分类，然后在它们受到伤害时从它们的命中率中减去。",
	"Your records might look something like this after a few rounds of combat:": "经过几轮战斗，你的记录可能看起来是这样的。",

	"Ogre C: 59": "Ogre C: 59",
	"Players often ask how hurt a monster looks. Don't ever feel as though you need to reveal exact hit points, but if a monster is below half its hit point maximum, it's fair to say that it has visible wounds and appears beaten down.": "玩家们经常会问一个怪物看起来有多大的伤害。不要觉得你需要透露准确的命中率，但如果一个怪物的命中率低于其最大命中率的一半，就可以说它有明显的伤痕，看起来被打倒了。",
	"You can describe a monster taken to half its hit points as bloodied, giving the players a sense of progress in a fight against a tough opponent, and helping them judge when to use their most powerful spells and abilities.": "你可以把一个被打到一半命中率的怪物描述成残血，让玩家在与强敌的战斗中感受到进展，并帮助他们判断何时使用他们最强大的法术和能力。",
	"Various rules and features in the game are clear about when they apply a condition to a creature. You can also apply conditions on the fly. They're meant to be intuitive for you to do so. For example, if a character is in a state, such as sleep, that lacks consciousness, you can say the character is {@condition unconscious}. Or did a character just stumble onto the ground? He or she is now {@condition prone}.": "游戏中的各种规则和功能都清楚地说明了它们何时对一个生物施加条件。你也可以在飞行中应用条件。他们的目的是为了让你能直观地这样做。例如，如果一个角色处于一种缺乏意识的状态，比如睡眠，你可以说这个角色是（%0%）。或者一个角色刚刚绊倒在地上？他或她现在是（%1%）。",
	"Keeping track of conditions can become tricky. For monsters, it's often easiest to track conditions on combat cards or wherever you track initiative. Players should remember any conditions affecting their characters. Because players have incentive to forget or overlook hampering conditions, character conditions can also be marked on combat cards or a whiteboard.": "追踪条件可能变得很棘手。对于怪物来说，追踪战斗卡上的条件或追踪主动权的地方往往是最容易的。玩家应该记住任何影响其角色的条件。因为玩家有动力去忘记或忽略妨碍他们的条件，所以角色的条件也可以在战斗卡或白板上标记。",
	"You might also try keeping a supply of index cards on hand, marked with conditions and their effects. Then hand the cards to players as the conditions come up. Having a bright pink index card on top of a character sheet can help even the most absentminded player remember the effects of being {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}.": "你也可以尝试在手边放一些索引卡，上面标有条件和效果。然后在条件出现的时候把卡片递给玩家。在角色表上放一张明亮的粉红色索引卡，可以帮助最心不在焉的玩家记住{@condition charmed}或{@condition frightened}的效果。",
	"A monster follows the same rule for critical hits as a player character. That said, if you use a monster's average damage, rather than rolling, you might wonder how to handle a critical hit. When the monster scores a critical hit, roll all the damage dice associated with the hit and add them to the average damage. For example, if a goblin normally deals 5 ({@dice 1d6 + 2}) slashing damage on a hit and scores a critical hit, it deals {@dice 1d6 + 5} slashing damage.": "怪物遵循与玩家角色相同的关键打击规则。也就是说，如果你使用怪物的平均伤害，而不是滚动，你可能会想知道如何处理关键打击。当怪物获得关键一击时，滚动所有与这一击相关的伤害骰子，并将其加入平均伤害。例如，如果一个地精通常在击中时造成5（（%0%））的砍击伤害，并且获得了关键一击，它就会造成（%1%）的砍击伤害。",
	"A monster or effect typically specifies the amount of damage it deals. In some cases, though, you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.": "一个怪物或效果通常会指定它所造成的伤害量。不过，在某些情况下，你需要临时决定伤害。即兴伤害表为你提供了这样做的建议。",

	"Many spells and other game features create areas of effect, such as the cone and the sphere. If you're not using miniatures or another visual aid, it can sometimes be difficult to determine who's in an area of effect and who isn't. The easiest way to address such uncertainty is to go with your gut and make a call.": "许多法术和其他游戏功能都会产生效果区域，如锥体和球体。如果你没有使用微缩模型或其他视觉辅助工具，有时会很难确定谁在效果区，谁不在效果区。解决这种不确定性的最简单的方法是凭你的直觉做出判断。",

A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.": "如果你想要精确地知道一个生物所面对的方向，可以考虑使用这个可选规则。每当一个生物结束其移动时，它都可以改变其朝向。每个生物都有一个前弧（它所面对的方向）、左和右的侧弧以及一个后弧。当任何其他生物移动时，一个生物也可以作为反应而改变其方向。",
	"A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.": "一个生物通常只能针对其前弧或侧弧的生物。它不能看到它的后弧。这意味着在该生物的后弧中的攻击者对它的攻击卷轴具有优势。",

	"Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc.

	"Typical combatants rely on the opportunity attack and the Ready action for most of their reactions in a fight. Various spells and features give a creature more reaction options, and sometimes the timing of a reaction can be difficult to adjudicate. Use this rule of thumb: follow whatever timing is specified in the reaction's description. For example, the opportunity attack and the shield spell are clear about the fact that they can interrupt their triggers. If a reaction has no timing specified, or the timing is unclear, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes, as in the Ready action.": "典型的战斗人员在战斗中的大部分反应都是依靠机会攻击和准备行动。各种法术和特征给了生物更多的反应选择，有时反应的时机可能很难判断。使用这一经验法则：遵循反应描述中所规定的任何时机。例如，机会攻击和盾牌咒语都清楚地说明了它们可以中断它们的触发。如果一个反应没有指定时间，或者时间不明确，那么反应就会在其触发结束后发生，就像在准备行动中一样。",
	"Different game features can affect a target at the same time. But when two or more game features have the same name, only the effects of one of them-the most potent one-apply while the durations of the effects overlap.

Game features include spells, class features, feats, racial traits, monster abilities, and magic items. See the related rule in the 'Combining Magical Effects' section of chapter 10 in the {@i Player's Handbook}.": "不同的游戏特征可以同时影响一个目标。但是当两个或更多的游戏特性有相同的名字时，只有其中一个的效果--最强的一个效果适用，而效果的持续时间是重叠的。例如，如果一个目标被火元素的{@i Fire Form}特性点燃，如果燃烧的目标再次受到该特性的影响，持续的火焰伤害不会增加。游戏特性包括法术、类特性、功勋、种族特性、怪物能力和魔法物品。请参阅第十章'组合魔法效果'一节中的相关规则（%1%）。",

A gap of two or three levels between different characters in the same party isn't going to ruin the game for anyone.": "随着时间的推移，你可能会发现从不缺席会议的玩家的角色和属于零星出席的玩家的角色之间存在着等级差距。这没有什么不对。同一派对中的不同角色之间有两到三个等级的差距并不会毁掉任何人的游戏。",
	"Some DMs treat XP as a reward for participating in the game, and keeping up with the rest of the party is good incentive for players to attend as many sessions as possible.": "一些管理员将XP作为参与游戏的奖励，而与党内其他成员保持一致是对玩家参加尽可能多的会议的良好激励。",
	"As an alternative, give absent characters the same XP that the other characters earned each session, keeping the group at the same level. Few players will intentionally miss out on the fun of gaming just because they know they'll receive XP for it even if they don't show up.": "作为一种选择，给缺席的角色提供与其他角色每节课获得的相同的XP，使小组保持在同一水平。很少有玩家会故意错过游戏的乐趣，只因为他们知道即使他们不出现也会得到XP。",
	"You decide whether to award experience to characters for overcoming challenges outside combat. If the adventurers complete a tense negotiation with a baron, forge a trade agreement with a clan of surly dwarves, or successfully navigate the Chasm of Doom, you might decide that they deserve an XP reward.": "你决定是否给角色奖励经验，以克服战斗以外的挑战。如果冒险者完成了与男爵的紧张谈判，与狡猾的矮人氏族达成了贸易协议，或者成功地穿越了厄运之渊，你可能会决定他们应该获得XP奖励。",
	"As a starting point, use the rules for building combat encounters in chapter 3 to gauge the difficulty of the challenge. Then award the characters XP as if it had been a combat encounter of the same difficulty, but only if the encounter involved a meaningful risk of failure.": "作为一个起点，使用第3章中关于建立战斗遭遇的规则来衡量挑战的难度。然后授予角色XP，就像相同难度的战斗遭遇战一样，但只有当遭遇战涉及到有意义的失败风险时，才授予角色XP。",
	"You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:": "你也可以在角色完成重要的里程碑时奖励XP。在准备你的冒险时，将某些事件或挑战指定为里程碑，如以下例子。",

In either case, you tell the players when their characters gain a level.": "你可以完全摒弃经验值，控制角色的升级速度。根据他们玩了多少次游戏，或者当他们在战役中完成了重要的故事目标时，来提升角色。无论哪种情况，你都要告诉玩家他们的角色什么时候获得一个等级。",
	"This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your campaign doesn't include much combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP becomes tiresome.": "如果你的活动不包括很多战斗，或者包括很多战斗，以至于追踪XP变得令人厌烦，那么这种等级提升的方法就会特别有帮助。",
	"A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.": "一个好的基于会话的升级速度是让角色在第一个会话后达到2级，在另一个会话后达到3级，再过两个会话后达到4级。然后再花两到三节课的时间来提升后续等级。这个速度反映了标准的升级速度，假设游戏时间约为四个小时。",

	"The optional rules in this section pertain to using ability scores.": "本节中的可选规则与使用能力分数有关。",
	"This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character's level.": "这条可选的规则用熟练度骰子代替了角色的熟练度奖励，给游戏增加了更多的随机性，使熟练度成为一个不那么可靠的掌握指标。角色的玩家不是在能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力投掷中加入熟练度奖励，而是掷骰子。熟练度骰子表显示了要掷的骰子，这由角色的等级决定。",
	"Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice instead of once.": "每当一个特征，例如流氓的专长，让一个角色的熟练度奖励翻倍时，玩家就会把角色的熟练度模子掷两次而不是一次。",
	"This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don't.": "这个选项是为有等级的玩家角色和非玩家角色准备的，而不是为没有等级的怪物。",
	"A skill dictates the circumstances under which a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to an ability check. Skills define those circumstances by referring to different aspects of the six ability scores. For example, Acrobatics and Stealth are two different aspects of Dexterity, and a character can specialize in either or both.": "一个技能决定了一个角色在什么情况下可以把他或她的熟练度加到能力检查上。技能通过参考六个能力分数的不同方面来定义这些情况。例如，杂技和隐身是灵巧的两个不同方面，一个角色可以专攻其中之一或两者。",
	"You can dispense with skills and use one of the following variants. Choose whichever one best suits your campaign.": "你可以不使用技能，而使用下列变体之一。选择最适合你的活动的那一种。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, each character has proficiency in two abilities: one tied to the character's class and one tied to the character's background.

	"The Expertise feature works differently than normal under this rule. At 1st level, instead of choosing two skill proficiencies, a character with the Expertise class feature chooses one of the abilities in which he or she has proficiency. Selecting an ability counts as two of the character's Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain proficiency.": "在这个规则下，\"专长 \"的作用与正常情况不同。在1级的时候，拥有 \"专长 \"类特征的角色不是选择两个技能的熟练度，而是选择他或她所熟练的能力中的一个。选择一种能力算作角色的两个专长选择。如果该角色可以获得一个额外的技能熟练度，该角色可以选择另一个能力检查来获得熟练度。",
	"This option removes skills from the game and doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can't choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.": "这个选项将技能从游戏中移除，并且不允许角色之间有太多的区别。例如，一个角色不能选择强调说服或恐吓；他或她同样擅长这两种。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character's prior training and experience (reflected in the character's background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character's background applies.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能或工具的熟练程度。任何可以赋予角色技能或工具熟练度的东西都不会带来好处。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何能力检查上，而该角色先前的训练和经验（反映在该角色的背景中）是合理适用的。DM是判断该角色的背景是否适用的最终法官。",
	"For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character's background applies. Not simply \"I'm a noble,\" but \"I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature to me now.\"": "例如，一个具有贵族背景的角色的玩家可以合理地争辩说，熟练度加分应该适用于该角色为确保与国王会面而进行的魅力检查。应该鼓励玩家用具体的术语来解释该角色的背景是如何应用的。不是简单的 \"我是一个贵族\"，而是 \"在开始我的冒险生涯之前，我花了三年时间担任我的家族在宫廷的大使，这种事情现在对我来说是第二天性了。\"",
	"This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters' histories. Don't let it result in endless debates about whether a character's proficiency bonus applies in a given situation.

	"If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies.

	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character's positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of \"I never have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go along\" might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a character.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能熟练度。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何与该角色的积极个性特征直接相关的能力检查上。例如，一个具有 \"我从来没有计划，但我很擅长随心所欲地做事情 \"的积极个性特征的角色，可以在从事一些不经意的欺骗行为以摆脱困境时应用这个奖励。玩家在创造一个角色时，至少要想出四个积极的人格特征。",
	"When a character's negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is \"I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings\" might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sneaking up.": "当一个角色的负面性格特征直接影响到能力检查时，该角色在检查中处于不利地位。例如，一个负面性格是 \"我经常迷失在自己的思想和沉思中，对周围的环境视而不见 \"的隐士，在进行能力检查时，可能会对注意偷袭的生物产生不利影响。",
	"If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personality trait.": "如果一个角色有专长特征，玩家可以把它的好处应用于与能力检查相关的人格特征，而不是技能或工具。如果一个角色会获得一个新的技能或工具的熟练度，那么这个角色会获得一个新的积极的个性特征。",
	"This system relies heavily on players developing their characters' personalities. Make sure that different characters' traits—positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency. Don't let a player get away with a positive trait that always seems to apply and a negative trait that never does.": "这个系统在很大程度上依赖于玩家对其角色个性的发展。要确保不同角色的特征--积极的和消极的--发挥作用的频率大致相同。不要让玩家以一种似乎总是适用的积极特征和一种从未适用的消极特征来逃脱。",

	"A player can spend a hero point whenever he or she makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw The player can spend the hero point after the roll is made but before any of its results are applied. Spending the hero point allows the player to roll a {@dice d6} and add it to the {@dice d20}, possibly turning a failure into a success. A player can spend only 1 hero point per roll.": "玩家可以在进行攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷时花费一个英雄点，玩家可以在卷轴做出后但在其结果应用前花费英雄点。花费英雄点可以让玩家掷出{@dice d6}并将其加入{@dice d20}，可能会将失败变成成功。玩家每次滚动只能花费1个英雄点。",
	"In addition, whenever a character fails a death saving throw, the player can spend one hero point to turn the failure into a success.": "此外，每当一个角色的死亡救赎失败时，玩家可以花费一个英雄点来把失败变成成功。",

	"If your campaign involves cultures where a rigid code of honor is part of daily life, consider using the Honor score as a means of measuring a character's devotion to that code. This ability fits well in a setting inspired by Asian cultures, such as Kara-Tur in the Forgotten Realms. The Honor ability is also useful in any campaign that revolves around orders of knights.": "如果你的战役涉及到的文化中，严格的荣誉准则是日常生活的一部分，那么可以考虑用荣誉分来衡量一个角色对该准则的忠诚度。这种能力很适合受亚洲文化启发的设定，例如《被遗忘的领域》中的卡拉图尔。荣誉能力在任何围绕骑士团的活动中也很有用。",
	"Honor measures not only a character's devotion to a code but also the character's understanding of it. The Honor score can also reflect how others perceive a character's honor. A character with a high Honor usually has a reputation that others know about, especially those who have high Honor scores themselves.": "荣誉不仅衡量一个角色对准则的奉献，也衡量这个角色对准则的理解。荣誉分也可以反映出别人如何看待一个角色的荣誉。一个拥有高荣誉的人物通常有一个别人知道的声誉，特别是那些自己拥有高荣誉分数的人。",
	"Unlike other abilities, Honor can't be raised with normal ability score increases. Instead, you can award increases to Honor—or impose reductions—based on a character's actions.

As with other ability scores, a character's Honor can't exceed 20 or fall below 1.": "与其他能力不同，\"荣誉 \"不能通过正常的能力分数增加来提高。相反，你可以根据角色的行为给予荣誉的增加，或者施加减少。在冒险结束时，如果你认为一个角色在冒险中的行为很好或很差地反映了他或她对法典的理解，你可以将该角色的荣誉增加或减少1。",
	"Honor checks can be used in social situations, much as Charisma would, when a character's understanding of a code of conduct is the most defining factor in the way a social interaction will play out.

	"This optional rule prolongs the amount of time that characters need to recover from their wounds without the benefits of magical healing and works well for grittier, more realistic campaigns.": "这条可选的规则延长了人物从伤口中恢复的时间，而没有魔法治疗的好处，对于更狡猾、更现实的战役很有效。",
	"The rules for short and long rests presented in chapter 8 of the Player's Handbook work well for a heroic-style campaign. Characters can go toe-to-toe with deadly foes, take damage to within an inch of their lives, yet still be ready to fight again the next day. If this approach doesn't fit your campaign, consider the following variants.": "玩家手册》第8章中提出的短期和长期休息的规则对英雄风格的战役非常有效。角色可以与致命的敌人交锋，受到的伤害不超过其生命的一寸，但第二天仍能准备好再次战斗。如果这种方法不适合你的活动，可以考虑以下的变体。",
	"This variant uses a short rest of 5 minutes and a long rest of 1 hour. This change makes combat more routine, since characters can easily recover from every battle. You might want to make combat encounters more difficult to compensate.": "这个变体使用5分钟的短休和1小时的长休。这种变化使战斗更加常规化，因为角色可以很容易地从每次战斗中恢复过来。你可能想让战斗的遭遇变得更加困难以作为补偿。",
	"Spellcasters using this system can afford to burn through spell slots quickly, especially at higher levels. Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.": "使用这个系统的施法者可以承受快速消耗法术槽的代价，尤其是在较高的等级。考虑允许施法者在长时间休息结束时恢复已消耗的法术槽，其数量仅相当于其最大法术槽的一半（四舍五入），并将恢复的法术槽限制在5级或以下。只有完整的8小时休息才能让施法者恢复所有的法术槽，并重新获得6级或以上的法术槽。",
	"This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. This puts the brakes on the campaign, requiring the players to carefully judge the benefits and drawbacks of combat. Characters can't afford to engage in too many battles in a row, and all adventuring requires careful planning.": "这个变体采用8小时的短休和7天的长休。这给活动踩了刹车，要求玩家仔细判断战斗的好处和坏处。角色不能连续参与太多的战斗，所有的冒险活动都需要仔细计划。",
	"This approach encourages the characters to spend time out of the dungeon. It's a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other PCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than rushed into.": "这种方法鼓励角色在地牢之外花时间。对于那些强调阴谋、政治和其他NPC之间互动的活动来说，这是一个很好的选择，在这些活动中，战斗是很少见的，或者是需要避免而不是急于进入的。",
	"If you want to model the swashbuckling style of The Three Musketeers and similar tales, you can introduce gunpowder weapon to your campaign that are associated with the Renaissance.

The Firearms table provides examples of firearms from all three of those periods. The modern and futuristic items are priceless.": "如果你想模仿《三个火枪手》和类似故事中的挥舞风格，你可以在你的战役中引入与文艺复兴有关的火药武器。同样，在一个宇宙飞船坠毁或现代地球元素出现的战役中，可能会出现未来主义或现代的火器。枪械表提供了所有这三个时期的枪械的例子。现代和未来派的物品是无价之宝。",
	"It's up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. Characters in most D&D worlds wouldn't have such proficiency.

If you want quicker combats, at the risk of those combats becoming unbalanced, try using the side initiative rule.": "记录每个人和怪物的主动权，以正确的顺序安排每个人，并记住你在名单中的位置，这些都会使游戏陷入困境。如果你想更快地进行战斗，在这些战斗变得不平衡的风险下，可以尝试使用侧面主动权规则。",
	"Under this variant, the players roll a {@dice d20} for their initiative as a group, or side. You also roll a {@dice d20}. Neither roll receives any modifiers. Whoever rolls highest wins initiative.

	"This variant encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative can gang up on enemies and take them out before they have a chance to act.": "这种变体鼓励团队合作，使你作为管理人的生活更容易，因为你可以更容易地协调怪物。但缺点是，赢得主动权的一方可以群殴敌人，在他们有机会行动之前就把他们干掉。",
	"Some DMs find the regular progression of initiative too predictable and prone to abuse. Players can use their knowledge of the initiative order to influence their decisions. For example, a badly wounded fighter might charge a troll because he knows that the cleric goes before the monster and can heal him.": "一些管理员发现，主动权的常规进展过于可预测，容易被滥用。玩家可以利用他们对主动权顺序的了解来影响他们的决定。例如，一个受了重伤的战士可能会冲向巨魔，因为他知道牧师在怪物之前，可以为他治疗。",
	"Speed factor is an option for initiative that introduces more uncertainty into combat, at the cost of speed of play. Under this variant, the participants in a battle roll initiative each round. Before rolling, each character or monster must choose an action.": "速度因素是一种主动权的选择，它在战斗中引入了更多的不确定性，但代价是游戏的速度。在这种变体下，战斗中的参与者每轮都会滚动主动权。在滚动之前，每个角色或怪物必须选择一个行动。",
	"Modifiers might apply to a creature's initiative depending on its size and the action it takes. For example, a creature that fights with a light weapon or casts a simple spell is more likely to act before a creature armed with a heavy or slow weapon.

There is no such monster in the Monster Manual, but the quaggoth is a savage humanoid predator with a climbing speed. You could borrow the quaggoth stat block for your new monster, changing nothing but the creature's name.

	"Adapting a stat block is far less time-consuming than creating one from scratch, and there are changes you can make to an existing monster that have no effect on its challenge rating, such as swapping languages, changing its alignment, or adding special senses. However, once you change the creature's offensive or defensive ability, such as its hit points or damage, its challenge rating might need to change, as shown later.": "改造一个状态块比从头开始创建一个状态块要省时得多，而且你可以对现有的怪物做出一些对其挑战等级没有影响的改变，例如交换语言、改变其排列方式或增加特殊感官。然而，一旦你改变了生物的进攻或防御能力，比如它的命中率或伤害，它的挑战等级就可能需要改变，如后面所示。",
	"If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, you can replace that weapon with a different one. For example, you could replace a hobgoblin's longsword with a halberd. Don't forget to change the damage and the attack's reach where appropriate. Also be aware of the consequences of switching from a one-handed weapon to a two-handed weapon, or vice versa. For example, a hobgoblin wielding a halberd (a two-handed weapon) loses the benefit of its shield, so its AC decreases by 2.": "如果一个怪物挥舞的是人造武器，你可以用不同的武器来代替它。例如，你可以用一把长戟代替地精的长剑。不要忘记在适当的地方改变伤害和攻击范围。还要注意从单手武器换成双手武器的后果，或者反之亦然。例如，一个挥舞着戟（双手武器）的妖精失去了盾牌的好处，所以它的攻击力减少了2。",
	"Another simple way to customize a monster is to add a special trait. You can add a special trait of your own devising or pick up a special trait from one of the many creatures in the Monster Manual. For example, you can create a goblin-spider hybrid by giving the normal goblin the Spider Climb special trait, turn an ordinary troll into a two-headed troll by giving it the Two Heads special trait, or turn an owlbear into a flying owlbear by giving it wings and a giant owl's flying speed.": "另一个定制怪物的简单方法是添加一个特殊的特性。你可以添加一个你自己设计的特殊特征，或者从《怪物手册》中的众多生物中挑选一个特殊特征。例如，你可以通过赋予普通地精以蜘蛛爬行的特殊特性来创造一个地精与蜘蛛的混血儿，通过赋予双头的特殊特性将普通巨魔变成双头巨魔，或者通过赋予猫头鹰的翅膀和巨大猫头鹰的飞行速度将猫头鹰变成飞行猫头鹰。",

	"A monster can have as many Hit Dice as you want, but the size of the die used to calculate its hit points depends on the monster's size, as shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

Using the Effective Hit Points Based on Resistances and Immunities table, apply the appropriate multiplier to the monster's hit points to determine its effective hit points for the purpose of gauging its final challenge rating. (The monster's actual hit points shouldn't change.)": "如果一个怪物对几种伤害类型有抵抗力或免疫力，特别是对来自非魔法武器的重击、穿刺和砍击伤害有抵抗力或免疫力，而且不是所有的角色都有办法抵消这种抵抗力或免疫力，那么在比较怪物的命中率和它的预期挑战等级时，你需要考虑到这些防御。使用基于抗性和豁免的有效命中率表，将适当的乘数应用于怪物的命中率，以确定其有效命中率，从而衡量其最终的挑战等级。(怪物的实际命中率不应改变）。",
	"For example, a monster with an expected challenge rating of 6, 150 hit points, and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons effectively has 225 hit points (using the 1.5 multiplier for resistances) for the purpose of gauging its final challenge rating.": "例如，一个预期挑战等级为6的怪物，150点的命中率，以及对非魔法武器的击打、穿刺和切割伤害的抗性，就衡量其最终挑战等级而言，实际上有225点的命中率（使用1.5倍的抗性）。",
	"Monsters don't normally have vulnerability to more than one or two types of damage. Vulnerabilities don't significantly affect a monster's challenge rating, unless a monster has vulnerabilities to multiple damage types that are prevalent, especially bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing. For such a strange monster, reduce its effective hit points by half. Or even better, eliminate the vulnerabilities and give the brittle monster fewer hit points.": "怪物通常不会对超过一种或两种类型的伤害有脆弱性。脆弱性不会明显影响怪物的挑战等级，除非怪物对普遍存在的多种伤害类型都有脆弱性，尤其是重击、穿刺和砍击。对于这样的怪兽，将其有效命中率降低一半。或者更好的办法是，消除这些弱点，给这个脆弱的怪物减少命中率。",
	"17 or more": "17岁或以上",
	"A monster's attack bonuses have a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's attack bonuses in one of two ways.": "怪物的攻击力对其挑战等级有直接影响，反之亦然。你可以通过以下两种方式之一确定怪物的攻击力。",
	"You can start with the monster's expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an appropriate attack bonus for all the monster's attacks, regardless of its ability scores.": "你可以从怪物的预期挑战等级开始，使用怪物统计表的挑战等级来确定怪物的所有攻击的适当攻击奖励，而不考虑它的能力得分。",
	"The table provides the baseline attack bonus for each challenge rating. Feel free to adjust the attack bonus as you see fit to match whatever concept you have in mind. For example, the baseline attack bonus for a challenge rating 1 monster is +3, but if your monster needs more accuracy, raise its bonus accordingly. Don't worry if the monster's attack bonus isn't matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps.": "该表提供了每个挑战等级的基线攻击奖励。你可以根据自己的想法来调整攻击奖励，以符合你心中的任何概念。例如，挑战等级为1的怪物的基准攻击奖励是+3，但如果你的怪物需要更多的准确性，就相应地提高它的奖励。如果怪物的攻击奖励与怪物的预期挑战等级不相符，也不必担心。其他因素也会影响怪物的挑战等级，如后面的步骤所示。",
	"Alternatively, you can calculate a monster's attack bonuses the same way players calculate the attack bonuses of a character.": "另外，你也可以用玩家计算角色攻击力的方法来计算怪物的攻击力加成。",
	"When a monster has an action that requires an attack roll, its attack bonus is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Strength or Dexterity modifier. A monster usually applies its Strength modifier to melee attacks and its Dexterity modifier to ranged attacks, although smaller monsters sometimes use Dexterity for both.": "当一个怪物有一个需要攻击卷的动作时，它的攻击奖励等于它的熟练度奖励+它的力量或灵巧修改器。怪物通常将它的力量修饰值用于近战攻击，将它的灵巧修饰值用于远程攻击，尽管较小的怪物有时将灵巧用于这两种攻击。",
	"Again, don't worry if the attack bonuses aren't matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. You can always adjust a monster's attack bonuses later.": "再说一遍，如果攻击力奖励与怪物的预期挑战等级不相符，也不用担心。你总是可以在以后调整怪物的攻击力。",
	"A monster's damage output the amount of damage it deals every round has a direct bearing on its challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine a monster's damage output in one of two ways.": "一个怪物的伤害输出，即它每回合造成的伤害量，与它的挑战等级有直接关系，反之亦然。你可以通过以下两种方式之一确定怪物的伤害输出。",
	"You can start with the monster's expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine how much damage the monster should deal every round. The table presents a range at each challenge rating. It doesn't matter how this damage is apportioned or distributed; for example, a monster might deal the damage every round with a single attack, or the damage could be split among multiple attacks against one or more foes.": "你可以从怪物的预期挑战等级开始，使用怪物统计表（按挑战等级）来确定怪物每回合应该造成多少伤害。该表列出了每个挑战等级的范围。这个伤害如何分配并不重要；例如，一个怪物可能每回合用一次攻击造成伤害，也可能在对一个或多个敌人的多次攻击中分出伤害。",
	"Choose the type of damage based on how you imagine the damage being delivered. For example, if the monster is attacking with razor-sharp claws, the damage it deals is probably slashing damage. If its claws are poisonous, some portion of the damage might be poison damage instead of slashing damage.": "根据你想象的伤害方式来选择伤害类型。例如，如果怪物用锋利的爪子攻击，它造成的伤害可能是砍击伤害。如果它的爪子是有毒的，那么一部分伤害可能是毒药伤害，而不是砍杀伤害。",
	"If you want the damage output to vary slightly from round to round, you can translate the damage range into a single die expression (for a monster with one attack) or multiple die expressions (for a monster with multiple attacks). For example, a challenge rating 2 monster deals 15-20 damage per round. If you imagine the creature having a Strength of 18 (+4 modifier), you could give it one melee attack that deals {@dice 3d8 + 4} (average 17.5) damage, split the damage output into two separate attacks that deal {@dice 1d10 + 4} (average 9) damage each, or use any other combination where the average damage output falls within the desired range.": "如果你想让伤害输出在各回合之间略有不同，你可以将伤害范围转化为单模表达（对于有一次攻击的怪物）或多模表达（对于有多次攻击的怪物）。例如，一个挑战等级为2的怪物每回合造成15-20的伤害。如果你想象这个怪物的力量是18（+4修改器），你可以给它一次近战攻击，造成{@dice 3d8 + 4}（平均17.5）的伤害，把伤害输出分成两次单独的攻击，每次造成{@dice 1d10 + 4}（平均9）的伤害，或者使用任何其他组合，使平均伤害输出落在所需范围内。",
	"Alternatively, you can use a die expression to represent the damage that a monster deals with each of its attacks based on whatever weapon it is using.": "另外，你可以用一个模子表达式来表示一个怪物根据它使用的任何武器进行的每一次攻击的伤害。",
	"Don't worry if the damage output isn't matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as will be discussed in later steps, and you can always adjust a monster's damage output later on.": "如果伤害输出与怪物的预期挑战等级不一致，也不必担心。其他因素会影响怪物的挑战等级，这一点将在后面的步骤中讨论，而且你可以在以后随时调整怪物的伤害输出。",
	"Some monsters use natural weapons, such as claws or tail spikes. Others wield manufactured weapons.": "有些怪物使用天然武器，如爪子或尾巴上的尖刺。其他人则挥舞着人造武器。",
	"If a monster has natural weapons, you decide how much damage it deals with those attacks, as well as the type of damage. See the Monster Manual for examples.": "如果一个怪物有天然武器，你可以决定它用这些攻击造成多少伤害，以及伤害的类型。例子见《怪物手册》。",
	"If a monster wields a manufactured weapon, it deals damage appropriate to the weapon. For example, a greataxe in the hands of a Medium monster deals {@dice 1d12} slashing damage plus the monster's Strength modifier, as is normal for that weapon.": "如果一个怪物挥舞着人造武器，它会造成与该武器相适应的伤害。例如，一个中型怪物手中的大斧头会造成（%0%）的砍击伤害，再加上怪物的力量修正值，这对该武器来说是正常的。",
	"Big monsters typically wield oversized weapons that deal extra dice of damage on a hit. Double the weapon dice if the creature is Large, triple the weapon dice if it's Huge, and quadruple the weapon dice if it's Gargantuan. For example, a Huge giant wielding an appropriately sized greataxe deals {@dice 3d12} slashing damage (plus its Strength bonus), instead of the normal {@dice 1d12}.": "大怪物通常会挥舞超大的武器，在击中时造成额外的骰子伤害。如果生物是大型的，武器骰子是双倍的，如果是巨大的，武器骰子是三倍的，如果是巨大的，武器骰子是四倍的。例如，一个巨大的巨人挥舞着适当大小的巨斧，会造成（%0%）的砍击伤害（加上其力量加成），而不是正常的（%1%）。",
	"A creature has disadvantage on attack rolls with a weapon that is sized for a larger attacker. You can rule that a weapon sized for an attacker two or more sizes larger is too big for the creature to use at all.": "一个生物在使用为较大的攻击者设计的武器进行攻击时有劣势。你可以裁定，为大两个或更大的攻击者设计的武器对该生物来说太大，根本无法使用。",
	"To determine a monster's overall damage output, take the average damage it deals with each of its attacks in a round and add them together. If a monster has different attack options, use the monster's most effective attacks to determine its damage output. For example, a fire giant can make two greatsword attacks or one rock attack in a round. The greatsword attacks deal more damage, so that attack routine determines the fire giant's damage output.": "要确定一个怪物的总体伤害输出，要取它在一个回合中每次攻击的平均伤害，然后把它们加在一起。如果一个怪物有不同的攻击选项，就用怪物最有效的攻击来确定其伤害输出。例如，火巨人在一回合内可以进行两次大剑攻击或一次岩石攻击。大剑攻击造成的伤害更大，所以这种攻击方式决定了火巨人的伤害输出。",
	"If a monster's damage output varies from round to round, calculate its damage output each round for the first three rounds of combat, and take the average. For example, a young white dragon has a multiattack routine (one bite attack and two claw attacks) that deals an average of 37 damage each round, as well as a breath weapon that deals 45 damage, or 90 if it hits two targets (and it probably will). In the first three rounds of combat, the dragon will probably get to use its breath weapon once and its multiattack routine twice, so its average damage output for the first three rounds would be (90 + 37 + 37) ÷ 3, or 54 damage (rounded down).": "如果一个怪物的伤害输出每回合都不一样，那么在前三轮战斗中计算它每回合的伤害输出，并取其平均值。例如，一条年轻的白龙有一个多重攻击程序（一次咬击和两次爪击），每回合平均造成37点伤害，还有一个呼吸武器，造成45点伤害，如果它击中两个目标（很可能会），则造成90点伤害。在前三轮战斗中，龙可能会使用一次呼吸武器和两次多重攻击程序，因此它在前三轮的平均伤害输出将是（90+37+37）÷3，或54次伤害（向下取整）。",
	"When calculating a monster's damage output, also account for special off-turn damage-dealing features, such as auras, reactions, legendary actions, or lair actions. For example, a balor's Fire Aura deals 10 fire damage to any creature that hits the balor with a melee attack. The aura also deals 10 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the balor at the start of each of the balor's turns. If you assume that one character in the party is within 5 feet of the balor at all times, hitting it with a melee weapon every round, then the balor's damage output per round increases by 20.": "在计算一个怪物的伤害输出时，也要考虑到特殊的非回合伤害特性，例如光环、反应、传奇行动或巢穴行动。例如，一个巴洛克的火系光环对任何用近战攻击击中巴洛克的生物造成10火系伤害。在巴洛尔的每个回合开始时，该光环也会对巴洛尔周围5英尺内的所有生物造成10点火伤害。如果你假设队伍中的一个角色一直在balor的5英尺范围内，每回合用近战武器击中它，那么balor每回合的伤害输出会增加20。",
	"Many monsters have attacks that do more than deal damage. Some effects that can be added to an attack to give it a flavorful twist include:": "许多怪物的攻击都不只是造成伤害。一些可以添加到攻击中的效果，使其具有风味的扭曲包括。",
	"Adding damage of a different type to the attack": "在攻击中增加不同类型的伤害",
	"Having the monster grapple the target on a hit": "让怪物在击中后抓取目标",
	"Allowing the monster to knock the target prone on a hit": "允许怪物在命中时将目标击倒在地",
	"Imposing a condition on the target if the attack hits and the target fails a saving throw": "如果攻击命中，而目标的蓄力失败，则对目标施加一个条件。",
	"A monster might have an attack or some other trait that requires a target to make a saving throw. The save DCs to resist such effects have a direct bearing on the monster's challenge rating, and vice versa. You can determine save DCs in one of two ways.": "一个怪物可能有一个攻击或其他一些特性，需要目标做一个拯救动作。抵抗这种效果的救赎DC对怪物的挑战等级有直接影响，反之亦然。你可以通过以下两种方式之一来确定救赎DC。",
	"You can start with the monster's expected challenge rating and use the Monster Statistics by Challenge Rating table to determine an appropriate save DC for any effect that requires a target to make a saving throw.": "你可以从怪物的预期挑战等级开始，并使用怪物统计表的挑战等级来确定任何需要目标进行救赎的效果的适当救赎DC。",
	"Alternatively, you can calculate a monster's save DCs as follows: 8 + the monster's proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability modifier. You choose the ability that best applies.": "或者，你可以按以下方式计算怪物的救赎DCs。8+怪物的熟练度加成+怪物的相关能力修改器。你选择最适用的能力。",
	"For example, if the effect is a poison, the relevant ability is probably the monster's Constitution. If the effect is similar to that of a spell, the relevant ability might be the monster's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.": "例如，如果效果是一种毒药，相关的能力可能是怪物的体质。如果效果类似于法术的效果，相关的能力可能是怪物的智力、智慧或魅力。",
	"Don't worry if the save DCs aren't matching up with the expected challenge rating for the monster. Other factors can affect a monster's challenge rating, as shown in later steps, and you can always adjust the save DCs later on.": "如果保存DC与怪物的预期挑战等级不一致，也不必担心。其他因素会影响怪物的挑战等级，如后面的步骤所示，你可以在以后调整保存DC。",
	"Some special traits (such as Magic Resistance), special actions (such as Superior Invisibility), and special reactions (such as Parry) can improve a monster's combat effectiveness and potentially increase its challenge rating.": "一些特殊的特性（如魔法抵抗）、特殊的行动（如高级隐身）和特殊的反应（如击退）可以提高怪物的战斗力，并有可能增加其挑战等级。",
	"The Monster Features table lists various features that you can plunder from the {@i Monster Manual}. The table notes which features increase a monster's effective Armor Class, hit points, attack bonus, or damage output for the purpose of determining its challenge rating. (The features don't actually change the monster's statistics.) Features that have no effect on a monster's challenge rating are noted with a dash (—).": "怪物特征表列出了你可以从（%0%）掠夺的各种特征。该表指出了哪些特征会增加怪物的有效护甲等级、命中率、攻击加成或伤害输出，以确定其挑战等级。(这些特征实际上并不改变怪物的统计数据。)对怪物的挑战等级没有影响的特征会用破折号(-)来表示。",
	"When assigning special traits, actions, or reactions to a monster, keep in mind that not all monsters need them. The more you add, the more complex (and harder to run) the monster becomes.": "当给怪物分配特殊的特征、行动或反应时，请记住，不是所有的怪物都需要它们。你添加的越多，怪物就越复杂（也越难运行）。",
	"The impact that the Innate Spellcasting and Spellcasting special traits have on a monster's challenge rating depends on the spells that the monster can cast.

See the \"Special Traits\" section in the introduction of the Monster Manual for more information on these two special traits.": "先天法术和法术特质对怪物的挑战等级的影响取决于怪物所能施放的法术。在确定怪物的最终挑战等级时，需要考虑到那些比怪物的正常攻击方式造成更多伤害的法术，以及增加怪物的AC或命中率的法术。有关这两种特殊特性的更多信息，请参见《怪物手册》导言中的 \"特殊特性 \"部分。",
	"Every monster has a walking speed. (Immobile monsters have a walking speed of 0 feet.) In addition to its walking speed, a monster might have one or more other speeds, including a burrowing, climbing, flying, or swimming speed.": "每个怪物都有一个行走速度。(除了行走速度之外，怪物还可能有一个或多个其他的速度，包括钻探、攀爬、飞行或游泳的速度。",
	"Increase the monster's effective Armor Class by 2 (not its actual AC) if it can fly and deal damage at range and if its expected challenge rating is 10 or lower (higher-level characters have a greater ability to deal with flying creatures).": "如果怪物能够飞行并在范围内造成伤害，并且其预期的挑战等级为10或更低，则将其有效护甲等级提高2（而不是其实际的AC）（更高级别的角色对付飞行生物的能力更高）。",
	"If you want a monster to be unusually resistant to certain kinds of effects, you can give it a bonus to saving throws tied to a particular ability.": "如果你想让一个怪物对某些类型的影响有不同寻常的抵抗力，你可以给它一个与特定能力相关的救赎奖励。",
	"A saving throw bonus is best used to counteract a low ability score. For example, an undead monster with a low Wisdom score might need a Wisdom saving throw bonus to account for the fact that it's more difficult to charm, frighten, or turn than its Wisdom would indicate.": "蓄力奖励最好用来抵消低能力得分。例如，一个智慧分低的亡灵怪物可能需要一个智慧救赎奖励，以说明它比它的智慧所显示的更难魅惑、惊吓或转化的事实。",
	"A saving throw bonus is equal to the monster's proficiency bonus + the monster's relevant ability modifier.": "拯救奖励等于怪物的熟练度奖励+怪物的相关能力修正值。",
	"A monster with three or more saving throw bonuses has a significant defensive advantage, so its effective AC (not its actual AC) should be raised when determining its challenge rating. If it has three or four bonuses, increase its effective AC by 2. If it has five or more bonuses, increase its effective AC by 4.": "一个拥有三个或更多救赎奖励的怪物具有显著的防御优势，因此在确定它的挑战等级时应提高它的有效攻击力（而不是它的实际攻击力）。如果它有三个或四个奖励，则将其有效AC值提高2；如果它有五个或更多奖励，则将其有效AC值提高4。",

	"You can use the rules in chapter 3 of the Player's Handbook to give class levels to a monster. For example, you can turn an ordinary werewolf into a werewolf with four levels of the barbarian class (such a monster would be expressed as \"Werewolf, 4th-level barbarian\").": "你可以使用《玩家手册》第3章的规则来给怪物赋予等级。例如，你可以将一个普通的狼人变成一个拥有四级野蛮人等级的狼人（这样的怪物会被表述为 \"狼人，四级野蛮人\"）。",
	"Start with the monster's stat block. The monster gains all the class features for every class level you add, with the following exceptions:": "从怪物的状态块开始。你每增加一个等级，怪物就会获得所有的等级特征，但以下情况除外。",
	"The monster doesn't gain the starting equipment of the added class.": "怪物不会获得新增等级的起始装备。",
	"For each class level you add, the monster gains one Hit Die of its normal type (based on its size), ignoring the class's Hit Die progression.": "你每增加一个等级，怪物就会获得一个正常类型的命中率（基于它的大小），无视等级的命中率递增。",
	"The monster's proficiency bonus is based on its challenge rating, not its class levels.": "怪物的熟练度奖励是基于它的挑战等级，而不是它的等级水平。",
	"Once you finish adding class levels to a monster, feel free to tweak its ability scores as you see fit (for example, raising the monster's Intelligence score so that the monster is a more effective wizard), and make whatever other adjustments are needed. You'll need to recalculate its challenge rating as though you had designed the monster from scratch.": "一旦你完成了对怪物等级的添加，你可以随意调整它的能力分数（例如，提高怪物的智力分数，使其成为一个更有效的巫师），并做其他任何需要的调整。你需要重新计算它的挑战等级，就像你从头开始设计这个怪物一样。",
	"Depending on the monster and the number of class levels you add to it, its challenge rating might change very little or increase dramatically. For example, a werewolf that gains four barbarian levels is a much greater threat than it was before. In contrast, the hit points, spells, and other class features that an ancient red dragon gains from five levels of wizard don't increase its challenge rating.": "根据怪物和你给它增加的等级数量，它的挑战等级可能变化不大，也可能急剧上升。例如，一个获得四个野蛮人等级的狼人比以前的威胁要大得多。相比之下，古代红龙从五级巫师中获得的命中率、法术和其他等级特征并不会增加它的挑战等级。",
	"When creating a new spell, use existing spells as guidelines. Here are some things to consider:": "当创建一个新的咒语时，以现有的咒语为准则。这里有一些需要考虑的事情。",
	"If a spell is so good that a caster would want to use it all the time, it might be too powerful for its level.": "如果一个法术好到让施法者想一直使用它，它可能对其等级来说太强大了。",
	"A long duration or large area can make up for a lesser effect, depending on the spell.": "持续时间长或面积大可以弥补较小的效果，这取决于法术。",
	"Avoid spells that have very limited use, such as one that works only against good dragons. Though such a spell could exist in the world, few characters will bother to learn or prepare it unless they know in advance that doing so will be worthwhile.": "避免使用非常有限的法术，比如说只对好龙有效的法术。虽然这样的法术可能存在于这个世界上，但很少有角色会去学习或准备它，除非他们事先知道这样做是值得的。",
	"Make sure the spell fits with the identity of the class. Wizards and sorcerers don't typically have access to healing spells, for example, and adding a healing spell to the wizard class list would step on the cleric's turf.": "确保该法术符合该类别的特性。例如，魔法师和巫师通常没有机会使用治疗法术，而在魔法师的等级列表中加入治疗法术会踩到牧师的地盘。",
	"For any spell that deals damage, use the Spell Damage table to determine approximately how much damage is appropriate given the spell's level. The table assumes the spell deals half damage on a successful saving throw or a missed attack. If your spell doesn't deal damage on a successful save, you can increase the damage by 25 percent.": "对于任何造成伤害的法术，使用法术伤害表来确定在该法术的等级下大约有多少伤害是合适的。该表假设该法术在救赎成功或攻击失败时造成一半的伤害。如果你的法术在救赎成功时没有造成伤害，你可以将伤害增加25%。",
	"You can use different damage dice than the ones in the table, provided that the average result is about the same. Doing so can add a little variety to the spell. For example, you could change a cantrip's damage from {@dice 1d10} (average 5.5) to {@dice 2d4} (average 5), reducing the maximum damage and making an average result more likely.": "你可以使用不同于表中的伤害骰子，只要平均结果大致相同。这样做可以为法术增加一点变化。例如，你可以将一个咒语的伤害从（%0%）（平均5.5）改为（%1%）（平均5），减少最大伤害，使平均结果更有可能。",
	"You can also use the Spell Damage table to determine how many hit points a healing spell restores. A cantrip shouldn't offer healing.": "你也可以使用法术伤害表来决定一个治疗法术能恢复多少命中率。咒语不应该提供治疗。",
	"The magic items in chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" are but a few of the magic treasures that characters can discover during their adventures. If your players are seasoned veterans and you want to surprise them, you can either modify an existing item or come up with something new.": "第7章 \"宝藏 \"中的魔法物品只是角色在冒险中可以发现的一些魔法宝藏。如果你的玩家是经验丰富的老手，你想给他们一个惊喜，你可以修改现有的物品，或者想出一些新的东西。",
	"The easiest way to invent a new item is to tweak an existing one. If a paladin uses a flail as her main weapon, you could change a holy avenger so that it's a flail instead of a sword. You can turn a ring of the ram into a wand, or a cloak of protection into a circlet of protection, all without altering the item's properties.": "发明新物品的最简单方法是调整现有物品。如果一个圣骑士使用连枷作为她的主要武器，你可以改变一个神圣复仇者，使其成为连枷而不是剑。你可以把公羊之环变成魔杖，或者把保护斗篷变成保护圈，所有这些都不需要改变物品的属性。",
	"Other substitutions are equally easy. An item that deals damage of one type can easily deal damage of another type. A flame tongue sword could deal lightning damage instead of fire, for example. One capability can replace another, so a potion of climbing can easily become a potion of stealth.": "其他的替换也同样容易。一个造成一种类型伤害的物品可以很容易地造成另一种类型的伤害。例如，一把火舌剑可以造成闪电伤害，而不是火。一种能力可以取代另一种能力，所以攀登药水可以很容易地变成隐身药水。",
	"You can also modify an item by fusing it with properties from another item. For example, you could combine the effects of a {@i helm of comprehending languages} with those of a {@i helm of telepathy} into a single helmet. This makes the item more powerful (and probably increases its rarity), but it won't break your game.": "你也可以通过将一个物品与另一个物品的属性融合来修改它。例如，你可以把{@i helm of comprehending languages}的效果和{@i helm of telepathy}的效果结合到一个头盔上。这使得物品更加强大（而且可能会增加其稀有性），但它不会破坏你的游戏。",
	"Finally, remember the tools that are provided for modifying items in chapter 7, \"Treasure.\" Giving an item an interesting minor property, a quirk, or sentience can alter its flavor significantly.": "最后，记住第七章 \"宝藏 \"中提供的修改物品的工具。赋予物品一个有趣的次要属性、一个怪癖或灵性，可以大大改变它的味道。",
	"If modifying an item doesn't quite do the trick, you can create one from scratch. A magic item should either let a character do something he or she couldn't do before, or improve the character's ability to do something he or she can do already. For example, the ring of jumping lets its wearer jump greater distances, thus augmenting what a character can already do. A ring of the ram, however, gives a character the ability to deal force damage.": "如果修改一个物品不能完全达到目的，你可以从头开始创造一个。一个魔法物品应该让角色做一些他或她以前不能做的事情，或者提高角色做他或她已经能做的事情的能力。例如，跳跃之环可以让佩戴者跳跃更远的距离，从而增强角色已经可以做的事情。而公羊之环则赋予角色以武力伤害的能力。",
	"The simpler your approach, the easier it is for a character to use the item in play. Giving the item charges is fine, especially if it has several different abilities, but simply deciding that an item is always active or can be used a fixed number of times per day is easier to manage.": "你的方法越简单，角色在游戏中使用该物品就越容易。给物品收费是可以的，特别是如果它有几种不同的能力，但是简单地决定一个物品总是活跃的，或者每天可以使用固定的次数，则更容易管理。",
	"If you make an item that lets a character kill whatever he or she hits with it, that item will likely unbalance your game. On the other hand, an item whose benefit rarely comes into play isn't much of a reward and probably not worth doling out as one.": "如果你制作的物品能让一个角色用它杀死任何东西，那么这个物品很可能会使你的游戏失去平衡。另一方面，一个好处很少出现的物品并不是什么奖励，可能不值得作为奖励发放。",
	"Use the Magic Item Power by Rarity table as a guide to help you determine how powerful an item should be, based on its rarity.": "使用按稀有度划分的魔法物品威力表作为指南，帮助你根据物品的稀有度来确定其威力。",
	"This column of the table indicates the highest-level spell effect the item should confer, in the form of a once-per-day or similarly limited property. For example, a common item might confer the benefit of a 1st-level spell once per day (or just once, if it's consumable). A rare, very rare, or legendary item might allow its possessor to cast a lower-level spell more frequently.": "表格的这一栏指出了物品应该赋予的最高等级的法术效果，形式是每天一次或类似的有限属性。例如，一个普通的物品可能会赋予每天一次的一级法术效果（如果是消耗品，则只有一次）。一个稀有的、非常稀有的或传奇性的物品可能会让它的拥有者更频繁地施放一个低级别的法术。",
	"If an item delivers a static bonus to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks, this column suggests an appropriate bonus based on the item's rarity.": "如果一件物品能给AC、攻击卷、蓄力或能力检查带来静态奖励，这一栏会根据该物品的稀有性建议一个合适的奖励。",
	"Decide whether the item requires a character to be attuned to it to use its properties. Use these rules of thumb to help you decide:": "决定该物品是否需要一个角色与之相适应才能使用其属性。使用这些经验法则来帮助你决定。",
	"If having all the characters in a party pass an item around to gain its lasting benefits would be disruptive, the item should require attunement.": "如果让聚会中的所有角色都传递物品以获得其持久的益处会造成破坏，那么该物品应该要求进行调和。",
	"If the item grants a bonus that other items also grant, it's a good idea to require attunement so that characters don't try to collect too many of those items.": "如果该物品给予的奖励是其他物品也给予的，那么要求调和是一个好主意，这样人物就不会试图收集太多的这些物品。",
	"If the options for player characters in the Player's Handbook don't meet all the needs of your campaign, consult the following sections for advice on creating new race, class, and background options.": "如果《玩家手册》中的玩家角色选项不能满足你的活动的所有需要，请参考以下章节，了解创建新的种族、等级和背景选项的建议。",
	"This section teaches you how to modify existing races, as well as create new ones. The most important step in customizing or designing races for your campaign is to start with the story behind the race or subrace you wish to create. Having a firm idea of a race's story in your campaign will help you make decisions during the creation process. Ask yourself several questions:": "本节教你如何修改现有的种族，以及创建新的种族。在为你的竞选活动定制或设计种族时，最重要的一步是从你想创建的种族或亚种族背后的故事开始。在你的活动中对种族的故事有一个坚定的想法将有助于你在创建过程中做出决定。问自己几个问题。",
	"Why does my campaign need the race to be playable?": "为什么我的竞选活动需要比赛才能进行？",
	"What does the race look like?": "比赛是什么样子的？",
	"Where do the members of this race live?": "这个种族的成员住在哪里？",
	"Are there interesting conflicts built into the race's history that make the race compelling from a storytelling standpoint?": "在比赛的历史中是否有有趣的冲突，使比赛从讲故事的角度来看具有吸引力？",
	"What is the race's relationship to the other playable races?": "该种族与其他可玩种族的关系是什么？",
	"What classes and backgrounds are well suited to members of the race?": "哪些阶层和背景很适合该种族的成员？",
	"What are the race's signature traits?": "该种族的标志性特征是什么？",
	"In the case of a new subrace, what sets it apart from the other subraces of the parent race?": "如果是一个新的亚种族，它与母种族的其他亚种族有什么不同？",
	"Compare the race you have in mind with the other race options available to players, to make sure that the new race doesn't pale in comparison to the existing options (which would result in the race being unpopular) or completely overshadow them (so that players don't feel as if the other options are inferior).": "将你心目中的种族与其他可供玩家选择的种族进行比较，以确保新的种族与现有的选项相比不会显得苍白无力（这将导致该种族不受欢迎）或完全掩盖它们（这样玩家就不会觉得其他选项不如人意）。",
	"When the time comes to design the game elements of the race, such as its traits, take a look at the game's existing races and let them inspire you.": "当设计种族的游戏元素的时候，比如它的特征，看看游戏中现有的种族，让它们给你带来灵感。",
	"A simple way to modify an existing race is to change its appearance. Changes to a race's appearance need not affect its game elements. For example, you could transform halflings into anthropomorphic mice without changing their racial traits at all.": "修改现有种族的一个简单方法是改变其外观。改变一个种族的外观不需要影响其游戏元素。例如，你可以把半身人变成拟人化的老鼠，而完全不改变其种族特征。",
	"Creating a new subrace is more involved than making some minor tweaks to existing racial features, but it does have the advantage of increasing the diversity of options for a particular race, rather than replacing some options with other ones.": "创建一个新的亚种族比对现有的种族特征做一些细微的调整要复杂得多，但它确实有一个好处，那就是增加某一种族的选择的多样性，而不是用其他的选择来取代一些选择。",
	"The following example walks through the creation of an elf subrace: the eladrin. This subrace has history in the D&D multiverse, so you already have some stories to draw on when building its traits.": "下面的例子介绍了精灵亚族的创建：艾拉德林。这个亚种在D&D多元宇宙中是有历史的，所以你在建立它的特征时已经有一些故事可以借鉴。",
	"Creatures of magic with strong ties to nature, eladrin live in the twilight realm of the Feywild. Their cities sometimes cross over to the Material Plane, appearing briefly in mountain valleys or deep forest glades before fading back into the Feywild.": "埃拉德林是一种与自然有着紧密联系的魔法生物，生活在仙界的黄昏领域。他们的城市有时会越过物质世界，短暂地出现在高山峡谷或森林深处，然后又逐渐消失在仙境中。",
	"The elf subraces in the Player's Handbook include an ability score increase, a weapon training feature, and two or three additional traits. Given the story of the eladrin and their magical nature, an increase to an eladrin character's Intelligence is appropriate. There's no need to alter the basic weapon training shared by high elves and wood elves.": "玩家手册中的精灵子种族包括一个能力得分的增加，一个武器训练特征，以及两到三个额外的特征。鉴于埃拉德林的故事和他们的魔法性质，增加埃拉德林角色的智力是合适的。没有必要改变高等精灵和木精灵共享的基本武器训练。",
	"An ability that sets the eladrin apart from other elves is their ability to step through the boundary between the planes, disappearing for a moment before reappearing somewhere else. In the game, this is reflected in a limited use of the misty step spell. Since misty step is a 2nd-level spell, this ability is potent enough that the subrace doesn't need additional traits. This leaves us with the following {@race Elf (Eladrin)|DMG|features for the eladrin subrace}.": "埃拉德林与其他精灵不同的能力是他们能够穿过平面之间的边界，在重新出现在其他地方之前消失片刻。在游戏中，这反映在对缥缈之步法术的有限使用上。由于缥缈之步是一个二级法术，这种能力足够强大，所以该亚族不需要额外的特性。这给我们留下了以下（%0%）。",
	"When creating a race from scratch, begin with the story and proceed from there. Compare your creation to the other races of your world, and borrow freely from the traits of other races. As an example, consider the aasimar, a race similar to the tiefling but with a celestial heritage.": "当从头开始创造一个种族时，从故事开始，然后再继续。将你的创作与你的世界中的其他种族进行比较，并自由地借用其他种族的特征。举个例子，考虑一下阿西玛人，这是一个与铁弗林相似的种族，但具有天人合一的遗产。",
	"Whereas tieflings have fiendish blood in their veins, aasimar are the descendants of celestial beings. These folk generally appear as glorious humans with lustrous hair, flawless skin, and piercing eyes. Aasimar often attempt to pass as humans in order to right wrongs and defend goodness on the Material Plane without drawing undue attention to their celestial heritage. They strive to fit into society, although they usually rise to the top, becoming revered leaders and honorable heroes.": "盗贼的血管里流淌着恶魔的血液，而阿西玛人则是天人的后代。这些人通常以光荣的人类形象出现，拥有光亮的头发、无暇的皮肤和刺眼的眼睛。阿西玛人经常试图伪装成人类，以便在物质世界中纠正错误和捍卫善良，而不会引起人们对其天体遗产的过分关注。他们努力融入社会，尽管他们通常会上升到顶端，成为受人尊敬的领袖和光荣的英雄。",
	"You might decide to use the aasimar as a counterpoint to the tiefling race. The two races could even be at odds, reflecting some greater conflict between the forces of good and evil in your campaign.": "你可以决定用阿西玛人作为铁弗林种族的对立面。这两个种族甚至可以发生冲突，反映出你的战役中正义和邪恶力量之间的某种更大的冲突。",
	"Here are our basic goals for the aasimar:": "以下是我们对阿西玛尔的基本目标。",
	"Aasimar should make effective clerics and paladins.": "Aasimar应该成为有效的牧师和圣骑士。",
	"Aasimar should be to celestials and humans what tieflings are to fiends and humans.": "阿西玛人对于天人和人类来说，应该就像铁弗林对于魔人和人类一样。",
	"Given that aasimar and tieflings are like two sides of the same coin, the tiefling makes a good starting point for coming up with the new race's traits. Since we want aasimar to be effective paladins and clerics, it makes sense to improve their Wisdom and Charisma instead of Intelligence and Charisma.": "鉴于阿西玛人和铁弗林就像一枚硬币的两面，铁弗林是制定新种族特征的一个好的起点。由于我们希望阿西玛人成为有效的圣骑士和牧师，所以提高他们的智慧和魅力而不是智力和魅力是有意义的。",
	"Like tieflings, aasimar have darkvision. Instead of resistance to fire damage, we give them resistance to radiant damage to reflect their celestial nature. However, radiant damage isn't as common as fire damage, so we give them resistance to necrotic damage as well, making them good at facing undead.": "像铁弗林一样，阿西玛人有黑暗视觉。为了反映他们的天性，我们没有让他们抵抗火系伤害，而是让他们抵抗辐射伤害。然而，辐射伤害并不像火伤害那样常见，所以我们也给他们提供了对坏死伤害的抗性，使他们在面对亡灵时表现出色。",
	"The tiefling's Infernal Legacy trait is a good model for a similar trait to reflect a magical, celestial heritage, replacing the tiefling's spells with spells of similar levels that more closely match the aasimar's celestial ancestry. However, the aasimar's expanded resistance might require limiting this trait to basic utility spells.": "tiefling的Infernal Legacy特性是一个很好的模型，它可以反映出一个神奇的、天人合一的遗产，用更符合aasimar的天人合一血统的类似等级的法术取代tiefling的法术。然而，由于阿西玛尔的抵抗力扩大，可能需要将这一特性限制在基本的实用法术上。",
	"Filling in the remaining details, we end up with the following {@race Aasimar|DMG|racial traits for the aasimar}.": "填补剩余的细节，我们最终得出以下结果（%0%）。",
	"The classes in the Player's Handbook capture a wide range of character archetypes, but your campaign world might have need of something more. The following section discusses ways to modify existing classes to better serve your game's needs.": "玩家手册》中的类涵盖了广泛的角色原型，但你的活动世界可能需要更多的东西。下一节将讨论如何修改现有的等级以更好地满足你的游戏需要。",
	"Changing a class's proficiencies is a safe and simple way to modify a class to better reflect your world. Swapping out one skill or tool proficiency for another doesn't make a character any stronger or weaker, but doing so can change the flavor of a class in subtle ways.": "改变一个等级的熟练程度是一个安全而简单的方法，可以修改一个等级以更好地反映你的世界。用一个技能或工具的熟练度换取另一个技能或工具的熟练度并不会使一个角色变得更强或更弱，但这样做可以以微妙的方式改变一个等级的味道。",
	"For example, a prominent guild of rogues in your world might worship a patron deity, performing secret missions in that deity's name. To reflect this cultural detail, you could add Religion to the list of skills that a rogue character can choose as a proficiency. You could even mandate that skill as one of the choices for rogues who belong to this guild.": "例如，在你的世界中，一个著名的流氓行会可能崇拜一个守护神，以该神的名义执行秘密任务。为了反映这一文化细节，你可以在流氓角色可以选择的技能列表中加入宗教学。你甚至可以规定该技能是属于该公会的流氓的选择之一。",
	"You can also change armor and weapon proficiencies to reflect certain aspects of your world. For example, you could decide that the clerics of a particular deity belong to an order that forbids the accumulation of material goods, other than magic items useful for their divine mission. Such clerics carry a staff, but they are forbidden from wearing armor or using weapons other than that staff. To reflect this, you could remove the armor and weapon proficiencies for clerics of this faith, making them proficient with the quarterstaff and nothing else. You could give them a benefit to make up for the loss of proficiencies something like the monk's Unarmored Defense class feature, but presented as a divine blessing.": "你还可以改变盔甲和武器的熟练程度，以反映你世界的某些方面。例如，你可以决定某个特定神灵的神职人员属于一个禁止积累物质财富的教团，除了对他们的神圣使命有用的魔法物品。这种神职人员携带一根法杖，但他们被禁止穿戴盔甲或使用法杖以外的武器。为了反映这一点，你可以取消这种信仰的神职人员的盔甲和武器熟练度，使他们只精通四分法杖，而不精通其他。你可以给他们一个好处，以弥补熟练程度的损失，就像和尚的无甲防御类特征一样，但要以神圣的祝福来呈现。",
	"Modifying a class's spell list usually has little effect on a character's power but can change the flavor of a class significantly. In your world, paladins might not swear their oaths to ideals, but instead swear fealty to powerful sorcerers. To capture this story concept, you could build a new paladin spell list with spells meant to protect their masters, drawn from the sorcerer or wizard lists. Suddenly, the paladin feels like a different class.": "修改一个等级的法术表通常对角色的力量影响不大，但可以大大改变一个等级的味道。在你的世界中，圣骑士可能不会向理想宣誓，而是向强大的巫师宣誓效忠。为了抓住这个故事概念，你可以建立一个新的圣骑士法术表，其中的法术是用来保护他们的主人的，从巫师或魔法师的法术表中抽取。突然间，圣骑士感觉像是一个不同的等级。",
	"Be cautious when changing the warlock spell list. Since warlocks regain their spell slots after a short rest, they have the potential to use certain spells more times in a day than other classes do.": "在改变术士的法术列表时要小心谨慎。由于术士在短暂的休息后会恢复他们的法术槽，他们有可能在一天内比其他等级更多次地使用某些法术。",
	"Without changing the way a class functions, you can root it more firmly in the world by associating the class with a particular race or culture.": "在不改变一个阶级的运作方式的情况下，你可以通过将这个阶级与一个特定的种族或文化联系起来，使其更牢固地扎根于这个世界。",
	"For example, you might decide that bards, sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards represent the magical traditions of four different races or cultures. The bardic colleges might be closed to everyone except elves, dragonborn might be the only creatures capable of becoming sorcerers, and all warlocks in your world might be human. You could break that down still further: bards of the College of Lore could be high elves, and bards of the College of War could be wood elves. Gnomes discovered the school of illusion, so all wizards who specialize in that school are gnomes. Different human cultures produce warlocks with different pacts, and so on. Similarly, different cleric domains might reflect entirely separate religions associated with different races or cultures.": "例如，你可能决定吟游诗人、巫师、术士和魔法师代表四个不同种族或文化的魔法传统。吟游诗人学院可能对除精灵以外的所有人都不开放，龙裔可能是唯一能够成为巫师的生物，而你的世界中所有术士可能都是人类。你可以进一步细分：传说学院的吟游诗人可能是高等精灵，而战争学院的吟游诗人可能是木精灵。地精发现了幻术学院，所以所有专攻该学院的巫师都是地精。不同的人类文化产生了具有不同契约的术士，等等。同样地，不同的牧师领域可能反映了与不同种族或文化相关的完全独立的宗教。",
	"You decide how flexible you want to be in allowing a player character to break these restrictions. Can a half-elf live among the elves and study their bardic traditions? Can a dwarf stumble into a warlock pact despite having no connection to a culture that normally produces warlocks? As always, it's better to say yes and use the player's desire as an opportunity to develop the character's story and that of your world, rather than shutting down possibilities.": "你决定在允许玩家角色打破这些限制时要有多大的灵活性。一个半精灵可以生活在精灵中并研究他们的吟游诗人传统吗？一个矮人可以在与通常产生术士的文化没有任何联系的情况下偶然进入一个术士契约吗？像往常一样，最好是说 \"可以\"，并把玩家的愿望作为发展角色和你的世界的故事的机会，而不是关闭可能性。",
	"If one or more features of a given class don't exactly fit the theme or tone of your campaign, you can pull them out of the class and replace them with new ones. In doing so, you should strive to make sure that the new options are just as appealing as the ones you are removing, and that the substitute class features contribute to the class's effectiveness at social interaction, exploration, or combat just as well as those being replaced.": "如果一个特定等级的一个或多个特征不完全符合你的活动的主题或基调，你可以把它们从这个等级中抽出来，用新的特征来代替。在这样做的时候，你应该努力确保新的选项和你要删除的选项一样吸引人，而且替代的阶级特征在社会交往、探索或战斗中的效果和被替代的一样好。",
	"Ultimately, a class exists to help a player express a particular character concept, and any class feature you replace is also removing an aspect of that character. Substituting a class feature should be done only to fit a specific need for your campaign, or to appeal to a player trying to create a specific kind of character (perhaps one modeled after a character from a novel, TV series, comic book, or movie).": "归根结底，一个类别的存在是为了帮助玩家表达一个特定的角色概念，而你所替换的任何类别特征也是在移除这个角色的一个方面。替换类的特征应该是为了满足你的活动的特定需要，或者是为了吸引试图创造特定类型角色的玩家（也许是仿照小说、电视剧、漫画或电影中的角色）。",
	"The first step is to figure out what class feature or group of class features you're going to replace. Then you need to evaluate what each feature provides to the class, so that the features you are adding don't make the class over- or underpowered. Ask yourself the following questions about a feature you're replacing:": "第一步是弄清楚你要替换的是哪一个或哪一组等级特征。然后，你需要评估每个特征为该类提供了什么，这样你所增加的特征就不会使该类的力量过剩或不足。就你要替换的特征问自己以下几个问题。",
	"What impact does replacing the feature have on exploration, social interaction, or combat?": "替换该功能对探索、社会互动或战斗有什么影响？",
	"Does replacing the feature affect how long the party can continue adventuring in a day?": "替换该功能是否会影响党在一天内可以继续冒险的时间？",
	"Does the feature consume resources provided elsewhere in the class?": "该功能是否会消耗类中其他地方提供的资源？",
	"Does the feature work all the time, or is it regained after a short rest, a long rest, or some other length of time?": "该功能是一直起作用，还是在短暂的休息、长时间的休息或其他时间长度后重新获得？",
	"Armed with answers to these questions, you can start designing new features that replace the ones you are removing. It's fine if the new class features drift closer to exploration, social interaction, or combat than the ones you are replacing, but be wary of going too far. For example, if you replace an exploration-focused feature with something purely combat focused, you've just made that class more powerful in combat, and it could overshadow the other classes in a way that you didn't intend.": "有了这些问题的答案，你就可以开始设计新的功能，以取代你要删除的功能。如果新的阶级特征比你要替换的特征更接近于探索、社会互动或战斗，那是可以的，但要注意不要走得太远。例如，如果你用纯粹的战斗功能取代了以探索为重点的功能，那么你就使这个等级在战斗中更加强大，它可能会以一种你无意的方式掩盖其他等级。",
	"There's no formula that can tell you how to design new class features. The best place to start is by looking at other class features, or at spells, feats, or any other rules for inspiration. You're almost certainly going to have some missteps, as features that seem good on the surface fall apart in play. That's all right. Everything you design will need to be playtested. When introducing new class features, be sure the players using them are comfortable with the fact that you might need to go back and make some changes after seeing them in play.": "没有任何公式可以告诉你如何设计新的等级特征。最好的开始是通过观察其他类别的特征，或者法术、特技或任何其他规则来获得灵感。你几乎肯定会有一些失误，因为表面上看起来很好的特征在游戏中会崩溃。这都是对的。你所设计的一切都需要进行游戏测试。当引入新的等级特征时，要确保使用这些特征的玩家能够接受这样一个事实，即你可能需要在游戏中看到这些特征后再回去做一些修改。",
	"Each class has at least one major choice point. Clerics choose a divine domain, fighters choose a martial archetype, wizards choose an arcane tradition, and so forth. Creating a new option doesn't require you to remove anything from the class, but any new option you add should be compared to existing options to make sure it's no more or less powerful, yet remains distinctive in flavor. Like anything in class design, be prepared to playtest your ideas and make changes if things aren't playing out the way you want them to.": "每个等级至少有一个主要的选择点。牧师选择一个神域，战士选择一个武术原型，巫师选择一个奥术传统，等等。创造一个新的选择并不要求你从这个等级中删除任何东西，但是你增加的任何新的选择都应该与现有的选择进行比较，以确保它不多也不少，但仍然具有独特的风味。就像在等级设计中的任何事情一样，要准备好测试你的想法，并在事情没有按照你想要的方式发展时做出改变。",
	"Once you have the concept for the class option in mind, it's time to design the specifics. If you're not sure where to begin, look at the existing options and see what class features they provide. It's perfectly acceptable for two class options to have similar features, and it's also fine to look at other classes for examples of mechanics you can draw on for inspiration. As you design each class feature, ask the following questions:": "一旦你心中有了班级选项的概念，就该设计具体内容了。如果你不确定该从哪里开始，可以看看现有的选项，看看它们提供了哪些等级特征。两个等级选项有类似的特征是完全可以接受的，而且看看其他等级的机制例子也是可以的，你可以从中获得灵感。当你设计每个等级的特征时，要问以下问题。",
	"How does the class feature reinforce the story or theme of the class option?": "班级特色是如何加强班级选项的故事或主题的？",
	"Is there an existing feature that can be used as a model?": "是否有一个现有的功能可以作为一个模型？",
	"How does the new class feature compare to other features of the same level?": "新的类特征与同级别的其他特征相比如何？",
	"One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.": "修改一个类别的感觉的一种方法是改变它使用法术的方式。在这个变体系统中，拥有咒语功能的角色使用咒语点而不是咒语槽来激发咒语。法术点给施法者带来了更多的灵活性，但代价是更大的复杂性。",
	"In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.": "在这个变体中，每个法术都有一个基于其等级的点数成本。法术点成本表总结了从1级到9级的插槽的法术点成本。咒语不需要插槽，因此不需要法术点数。",
	"Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.": "你不是从 \"施法 \"功能中获得一定数量的法术槽来施展你的法术，而是获得一个法术点的集合。你消耗一定数量的法术点数来创造一个给定等级的法术槽，然后使用该法术槽来施展一个法术。你不能将你的法术点数总数减少到小于0，而且当你完成一次长时休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术点数。",
	"Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.": "6级及以上的法术在施放时特别费力。你可以使用法术点数来创造一个6级或更高等级的槽。在你完成长时间的休息之前，你不能再创造一个相同等级的槽。",
	"The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.": "你需要花费的法术点数是基于你作为施法者的等级，如按等级计算的法术点数表所示。你的等级也决定了你可以创建的最大级别的法术槽。即使你可能有足够的点数来创造一个高于这个最大值的槽，你也不能这样做。",
	"The Spell Points by Level table applies to {@class bard||bards}, {@class cleric||clerics}, {@class druid||druid}, {@class sorcerer||sorcerers}, and {@class wizard||wizards}. For a {@class paladin} or {@class ranger}, halve the character's level in that class and then consult the table. For a {@class fighter|phb|fighter (Eldritch Knight)|Eldritch Knight} or {@class rogue|phb|rogue (Arcane Trickster)|Arcane Trickster}, divide the character's level in that class by three.": "按等级划分的法术点数表适用于（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）、（%3%）和（%4%）。对于{@class paladin}或{@class ranger}，将人物在该类中的等级减半，然后再参考该表。对于{@class fighter|phb|fighter (Eldritch Knight)|Eldritch Knight}或{@class rogue|phb|rogue (Arcane Trickster)|Arcane Trickster}，将角色在该等级中的等级除以3。",
	"This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.": "这个系统可以应用于使用法术槽施法的怪物，但不建议你这样做。跟踪怪物的法术点支出会很麻烦。",
	"A well-crafted background can help a player create a character that feels like an exciting addition to your campaign. It helps define the character's place in the world, rather than what a character is in terms of game mechanics.": "一个精心设计的背景可以帮助玩家创造一个感觉像是对你的战役的一个令人兴奋的补充的角色。它有助于确定角色在世界中的位置，而不是就游戏机制而言，角色是什么。",
	"Instead of focusing on a generic character background, such as merchant or wanderer, think about the factions, organizations, and cultures of your campaign and how they might be leveraged to create flavorful backgrounds for player characters. For example, you could create an acolyte of Candlekeep background that is functionally similar to a sage background, but which ties a character more closely to a place and organization in your world.": "与其专注于一般的角色背景，如商人或流浪者，不如想想你的战役中的派别、组织和文化，以及如何利用它们来为玩家角色创造有意义的背景。例如，你可以创建一个 \"烛龙 \"的信徒背景，其功能类似于圣人背景，但它将角色与你世界中的某个地方和组织联系得更紧密。",
	"A character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background probably has friends among the Avowed the monks who maintain the great library at Candlekeep. The character can enter the library and consult its lore freely, while others must donate a rare or valuable tome of knowledge before they are allowed entry. Candlekeep's enemies are the character's enemies, and its allies, the character's friends. Acolytes of Candlekeep are generally regarded as learned sages and protectors of knowledge. It's possible to envision many interesting interactions as NPCs discover the character's background and approach the character in search of assistance.": "一个拥有 \"烛之守信徒 \"背景的角色可能在 \"阿维德\"（Avowed）僧侣中拥有朋友，他们维护着烛之守的大图书馆。这个角色可以进入图书馆，自由地查阅图书馆的传说，而其他人则必须捐献一本稀有或有价值的知识巨著才可以进入。烛龙镇的敌人是该角色的敌人，而它的盟友则是该角色的朋友。烛龙镇的信徒通常被认为是博学的圣人和知识的保护者。当NPC发现角色的背景并接近角色以寻求帮助时，有可能设想出许多有趣的互动。",
	"To create your own background, follow these steps.": "要创建你自己的背景，请遵循以下步骤。",
	"To ground a new background in your campaign's setting, determine what element of your campaign the background is tied to: a faction, an organization, a trade, a person, an event, or a location.": "为了使新的背景与你的战役背景相吻合，要确定背景与你的战役的什么元素相关：一个派别、一个组织、一个行业、一个人、一个事件或一个地点。",
	"Create tables of suggested characteristics' personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws' that fit the background, or plunder entries from the tables presented in the {@i Player's Handbook}. Even if your players don't use the tables, this step helps you paint a picture of the background's place in your world. The tables need not be extensive; two or three entries per table are enough.": "创建适合背景的建议特征表，即个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷，或者从（%0%）中提出的表格中掠夺条目。即使你的玩家不使用这些表格，这个步骤也能帮助你描绘出背景在你的世界中的位置。这些表格不需要太多，每张表格有两三个条目就足够了。",
	"Choose two skill proficiencies and two tool proficiencies for the background. You can replace tool proficiencies with languages on a one-for-one basis.": "选择两个技能熟练度和两个工具熟练度作为背景。你可以用语言来代替工具能力，以一换一。",
	"Make sure your background offers a package of starting equipment. In addition to a small amount of money that a character can use to buy adventuring gear, the starting equipment should include items that a character would have acquired prior to becoming an adventurer, as well as one or two items unique to the background.": "确保你的背景提供一揽子的起始装备。除了角色可以用来购买冒险装备的少量金钱之外，起始装备应该包括角色在成为冒险家之前就已经获得的物品，以及背景中特有的一到两件物品。",
	"For example, starting equipment for a character with the acolyte of Candlekeep background might include a set of traveler's clothes, a scholar's robe, five candles, a tinderbox, an empty scroll case engraved with the symbol of Candlekeep, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp. The scroll case might be a gift given to an acolyte of Candlekeep who embarks on a life of adventure. At your discretion, it might also contain a useful map.": "例如，一个具有守墓人背景的角色的起始装备可能包括一套旅行者的衣服，一件学者的长袍，五根蜡烛，一个火绒盒，一个刻有守墓人标志的空卷轴箱，以及一个装有10金币的腰包。这个卷轴箱可能是送给开始冒险生活的守烛人信徒的礼物。根据你的判断，它也可能包含一张有用的地图。",
	"Choose an existing background feature or create a new one, as you prefer. If you choose an existing feature, add or tweak a few details to make it unique.": "根据你的喜好，选择一个现有的背景特征或创建一个新的特征。如果你选择一个现有的特征，添加或调整一些细节，使其成为独一无二的。",
	"For example, the acolyte of Candlekeep background might have the Researcher feature of the sage (as presented in the Player's Handbook), with the additional benefit that the character is allowed to enter Candlekeep without paying the normal cost.": "例如，烛龙镇的圣徒背景可能具有圣人的研究者特征（如《玩家手册》所介绍的），其额外的好处是允许该角色进入烛龙镇而无需支付正常的费用。",
	"A background feature should avoid strict game benefits, such as a bonus to an ability check or an attack roll. Instead, the feature should open up new options for roleplaying, exploring, and otherwise interacting with the world.": "一个背景特征应该避免严格的游戏利益，例如对能力检查或攻击卷的奖励。相反，该特征应该为角色扮演、探索和其他与世界的互动开辟新的选择。",
	"For example, the sage's Researcher feature is designed to send the character on adventures. It doesn't provide information or an automatic success for a check. Instead, if a character with the sage background fails to recall information, he or she instead knows where to learn it. This might be a pointer to another sage or to a library long lost within an ancient tomb.": "例如，圣人的研究者功能是为了让角色去冒险。它并不提供信息或自动成功的检查。相反，如果一个有贤者背景的角色不能回忆起信息，他或她反而知道在哪里可以学到它。这可能是一个指向另一个圣人的指针，或者指向一个在古墓中早已丢失的图书馆。",
	"The best background features give characters a reason to strike out on quests, to make contact with NPCs, and to develop bonds to the setting you've devised.": "最好的背景特征给角色一个理由，让他们去做任务，与NPC接触，并与你设计的环境产生联系。",
	"This appendix helps you quickly generate a dungeon. The tables work in an iterative manner. First, roll a starting area, then roll to determine the passages and doors found in that area.

	"Following these instructions can lead to sprawling complexes that more than fill a single sheet of graph paper. If you want to constrain the dungeon, establish limits ahead of time on how far it can grow. The most obvious limit to a dungeon's size is the graph paper it's drawn on.

A corridor might turn or come to a dead end at the map's edge, or you can make a chamber smaller to fit the available space.": "遵循这些指示，可以导致庞大的建筑群，超过了一张图画纸的容量。如果你想限制地牢的发展，那就提前建立它能发展到什么程度的限制。对地牢大小最明显的限制是它所画的图画纸。如果某项功能会超出页面的界限，那就减少它。一条走廊可能会在地图的边缘转弯或走到死胡同，或者你可以把一个房间变小以适应可用的空间。",
	"Alternatively, you can decide that passages leading off the edge of the map are additional dungeon entrances. Stairs, shafts, and other features that would normally lead to levels you don't plan to map can serve a similar purpose.": "另外，你也可以决定将地图边缘的通道作为额外的地牢入口。楼梯、竖井和其他通常会通向你不打算绘制地图的楼层的特征也可以起到类似的作用。",
	"The Starting Area table produces a chamber or a set of corridors at the entrance to your dungeon.
