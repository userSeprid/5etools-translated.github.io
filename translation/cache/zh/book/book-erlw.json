	"The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war. Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they can influence the world and its people.": "Eberron世界有着丰富的历史，它建立在英雄的事迹、不断发展的魔法以及长期的、毁灭性的战争的创伤之上。行动、冒险、正义、邪恶，以及无数的灰色阴影，都在大笔大笔地描绘着这个世界。古老的奥秘等待着人们去发现，从而影响这个世界和它的人民。",
	"Magic is built into the very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.": "魔法是建立在世界的结构中的。它弥漫在日常生活中。它提供了现代世界或任何中世纪幻想世界所不知道的舒适和便利。在整个霍尔韦尔大陆上，城堡在天空中飞舞，一个繁荣的商人家族贵族控制着世界经济的大部分，这要归功于神秘而稀有的龙纹给他们带来的优势。它的人民利用魔法作为工具，建造城市，在天空中航行，并创造奇迹和武器。",
	"Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as they are to threaten the world's safety.": "英雄有各种形状和大小，各种等级和种族。他们周游世界，在瞬息万变的行动中与恶棍搏斗。他们发掘出神奇的宝藏，处理险象环生和不祥的谜团，这些谜团既可能揭开几个世纪的秘密，也可能威胁到世界的安全。",
	"Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for worse.": "Eberron拥抱了挥舞的动作和纸浆冒险，同时加入了一层黑色的阴谋。故事的结局并不总是好的，也不是每个问题都有完美的答案。最后的战争将旧的盟友变成了痛苦的敌人，摧毁了整个国家，留下了可怕的伤痕。犯罪和腐败潜伏在Khorvaire的伟大城市中。隐藏的龙塑造了历史的进程，阴险的魔鬼影响着不怀好意者的梦想。然而，凡人的贪婪和野心可能比任何龙或魔鬼更危险。这片黑暗为一群大胆的冒险家提供了改变现状的机会--无论好坏。",

	"What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:": "什么是Eberron？以下是需要了解的关键事项。",
	"{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.": "{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. 一个多世纪前，最后一次战争使霍尔韦尔大陆陷入内战，使组成加利法尔王国的五个国家支离破碎。就在两年前，战争结束了，签署了《王权条约》，建立了12个公认的国家和脆弱的和平。然而，长期战争的冲突、愤怒和痛苦依然存在，新的国家在为大陆上爆发的下一场战争做准备时寻求一切优势。",
	"{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.": "{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. 伟大的龙纹家族是整个Khorvaire及其他地区的工业和商业男爵。他们的影响力超越了政治边界，在最后的战争中他们大多保持中立。严格来说，他们并不是任何国家的公民，每个家族的族长和元老都在他们位于霍尔韦尔各地的飞地和商场里过着辉煌的生活。这些商业王朝的权力来自于龙纹--遗传性的奥术符号，这些符号体现在家族中的某些人身上，赋予他们与每个家族控制的贸易行会相关的有限但有用的魔法能力。",
	"{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities, secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in the aftermath of the Last War.": "{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. 战争结束了，Khorvaire的国家现在试图建立一个和平和繁荣的新时代。然而，古老的威胁仍然存在，世界需要英雄们来承担起这个责任。各个国家在许多层面上竞争，包括经济主导地位、政治影响、领土、魔法力量等等，每个国家都希望通过任何手段来维持或提高自己的地位，而不是通过全面战争。龙纹屋、纯洁和腐败的教会、犯罪首脑、怪物帮派、幻术间谍、奥术大学、秘密社团、阴险的主谋、龙，以及众多组织和派别都加入了最后战争后的地位和权力争夺战中。",
	"{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.": "{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. 从Q'barra的丛林到恶魔荒原的爆炸山丘和山谷，从Sharn的摩天大楼到充满恐龙的Talenta平原，Eberron是一个冒险的世界。冒险可以把英雄们从一个异国情调的地方吸引到霍尔韦尔大陆上的另一个地方。对第七月之镜的探索可能会把英雄们从达尔古恩的一个隐秘的山间神殿带到阴影地带的一个破败的城堡，最后到科兰伯格图书馆下面的一个地牢。通过使用魔法运输工具，英雄们可以在冒险过程中到达广泛的环境，从而应对各种各样的怪物和其他挑战。",
	"{@b 5. A World of Magic}. The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.": "{@b 5. A World of Magic}. Eberron的技术不是通过科学的进步而是通过对魔法的掌握而发展起来的。魔法的广泛使用充斥着城市和城镇的生活。飞船和铁路运输使跨越大陆的快速旅行成为可能。一个由小法师组成的工作阶层，被称为魔法师，利用法术提供能源和其他必需品。魔法物品创造的进步导致了从自走式农具到在工匠的锻造中创造的有知觉的、自由意志的生命的一切。在被称为龙石的稀有水晶的帮助下，龙印可以变得更加强大，元素可以被控制和驾驭，魔法物品也可以被制作和塑形。",
	"{@b 6. New Races}. In addition to the common player character races found in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: {@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, and {@race warforged|ERLW}. Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war world.": "{@b 6. New Races}. 除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中常见的玩家角色种族外，玩家可以选择在Eberron中扮演兽人或哥布林人角色。或者他们可以从四个新种族中选择一个。{@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, 和 {@race warforged|ERLW}。变身者拥有类似于二重身的轻微变身能力。Kalashtar是与人类宿主合并的平面实体，赋予他们心灵感应的能力。变形人由人类和狼人的混合发展而来，这种结合赋予他们有限的兽性能力和野性的本能。战神是在最后一次战争中创造出来的一个构造种族，他们试图在战后的世界中找到自己的位置。",
	"{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&D multiverse, and many familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is alignment a given.": "{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的每个种族、怪物、咒语和魔法物品都在Eberron的某个地方有一席之地，但可能不是你期望的地方。Eberron在D&D多元宇宙中有着独特的位置，许多熟悉的游戏元素在这个世界中扮演着不同的角色。特别是，凡人生物是文化和环境的产物，而不是诸神的直接影响。因此，你不能假设金龙是好的，或看守者是邪恶的；只有在天人、魔人和某些其他生物的身份和世界观由魔法塑造的情况下（如狼人的诅咒），才会有一致的看法。",
	"Every child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's evil.": "每个孩子都知道始祖龙的故事：西伯利亚斯、艾伯伦和凯伯尔。在时间的黎明，这三个宇宙生物创造了13个存在的平面，每个平面都体现了一个概念。他们的最终作品是物质界，在那里所有的想法都将得到体现：一个可以知道战争与和平、生命与死亡、秩序与混乱的领域。但残酷的凯伯寻求对这个新现实的最终支配权。她毫无征兆地打击了西伯利亚，并将他撕碎。Eberron与Khyber搏斗，将叛徒捆绑在她的线圈中，但无法击败她。于是Eberron成为了一个活生生的监狱，这个世界将永远容纳Khyber的邪恶。",
	"Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.": "世界上几乎所有的文化都分享这个故事，作为解释世界的神话。碎裂的西伯利亚成为包裹着地球的金色龙鳞环，据说是魔法的来源。Eberron是世界，是所有自然生命的来源。而凯伯是地下世界，是反常者和恶魔的源头，永远在与她的束缚作斗争，渴望摧毁上面的世界。",
	"Another tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be catastrophic.": "另一个跨文化共享的故事描述了发生在世界第一个时代的另一场冲突。很久以前，被称为 \"霸主 \"的强大的大恶魔和他们的罗刹和小恶魔的军队统治了Eberron。光明的力量--有些版本的故事说是主宰的九个神，有些说是龙和天人的联盟--最终打败了霸主。但这些恶魔无法被消灭；相反，他们不朽的精华被束缚在开伯尔。无论这个故事的真实细节如何，有一点是真实的：如果霸主们打破他们的束缚，后果将是灾难性的。",
	"Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only through the remnants left behind.": "在几千年的时间里，许多文明都在崛起，却又在衰落。巨人在Xen'drik大陆上建立了强大的王国，但在与Argonnessen的龙的战争中遭到破坏。达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国统治着霍尔韦尔，直到它的统治被一支入侵的心灵感应者、持有者和创造他们的肮脏生物的军队所粉碎。今天，这些文明只能通过留下的残余物来了解。",
	"In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.": "在现代，最强大的力量是加利法尔王国，它覆盖了霍尔韦尔大陆的大部分地区。五个国家--Aundair、Breland、Karrnath、Thrane和Cyre--构成了这个王国的核心。虽然每个国家都有独特的文化特征，但它们都有这个统一的基础。家庭分布在五国之间；五国的统治者都是加里法尔的皇室血统--怀纳恩的后代。尽管存在差异，但一个昂代尔人与瑟兰人的共同点要比与齐尔地精或拉扎尔海盗的共同点多。",
	"A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.": "一个世纪前，加利法尔陷入内战，五国成为与邻国不和的独立国家。在赛尔在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的大灾难中被摧毁后，最后的战争结束了。今天，五国仍然处于分裂状态，与《王权条约》所建立的新国家共享霍尔韦尔。剩下的五国仍然是霍尔韦尔最大和最强大的国家。",
	"The Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.": "王权条约》正式结束了最后一次战争。该条约承认以下国家为主权国家。昂代尔（Aundair）、布雷兰德（Breland）、达尔古恩（Darguun）、艾尔迪恩（Eldeen Reaches）、卡尔纳特（Karrnath）、拉扎尔（Lhazaar）公国、姆罗尔（Moror）领地、卡巴拉（Q'barra）、塔伦塔平原（Talenta Plains）、瑟兰、瓦勒纳和齐拉尔戈。这些国家遵守一套共同的法律并保持外交关系。恶魔荒原和阴影牧场地区没有统一的政府。Droaam已经宣布自己是一个国家，但还没有被条约国家承认。",
	"Although Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about everyday life there.": "虽然Eberron是一个拥有许多大陆和文化的广阔世界，但你的冒险却从Khorvaire的土地上开始。这里有一些关于那里日常生活的细节。",
	"In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, as stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.": "在Eberron，语言反映了文化和地理；一个在Breland长大的矮人可能不知道矮人语，但一个在Moror Holds长大的半身人可能知道。语言和文化的历史发展也解释了用于书写各种语言的文字。例如，半兽人的语言是用地精文字书写的（而不是矮人文字，如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所述），因为霍尔韦尔的兽人从地精那里学会了书写。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's Speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "通用语是五国的语言，也是霍尔韦尔的贸易语言，为其大多数人所熟知。妖精语是达卡安的妖精帝国的贸易语言，并作为主要语言在达古恩、德罗阿姆和阴影地带生存。妖精语取代了兽人语；阴影地带的人们通常说妖精语，而兽人语是一种外来语言（参见《Eberron外来语言》表）。Xen'drik的所有种族成员都说巨人语，并将其作为他们的贸易语言。地狱语是所有魔族的共同语言。地狱语有时被称为 \"开伯尔之语\"，而天人语是 \"西伯利亚之语\"。",
	"With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.": "经DM批准，你可以将你的种族所赋予的语言换成Eberron标准语言表中的另一种语言。如果你的半身人是在Mror Holds长大的，你可以用矮人语代替半身人，以反映这一背景。DM可以改变分配给某个怪物或NPC的语言。一个来自Droaam的食人魔可能会说哥布林语而不是巨人语。",

	"Most citizens of Khorvaire have a given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or region of origin.

	"The noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.": "加利法尔的贵族家庭--以及那些被五国君主之一授予土地和头衔的人--在他们的姓氏前加上ir'。Darro ir'Lain这个名字告诉你，这个人是一个有土地的贵族。怀纳恩家族是加利法尔的皇室血统，昂代尔、布雷兰德和卡尔纳特的现任统治者都是怀纳恩血统的继承人。因此，昂代尔的奥拉拉女王就是奥拉拉-伊尔-怀纳恩。",

However, while the designs imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.": "商人和贵族使用信用证来处理大宗交易，动用Mror Holds的矮人银行的储备。但大多数日常交易都使用贵金属硬币。随着加利法尔王国的崩溃，五国中的每一个国家都开始铸造自己的货币，与Moror的银行家一起。然而，虽然印在这些硬币上的设计因来源而异，但这些派别中的每一个都继续使用加利法尔时代规定的相同金属、重量和面额，为整个霍尔韦尔的商业维持一个简单的标准。",
	"The copper crown (cp) traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which spawned the saying, \"In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns.\"": "铜冠（cp）传统上是在一面描绘加利法尔的王冠。王冠是加利法尔统治时期铸造的最低面额的硬币，这也催生了一句话：\"在加利法尔，即使是乞丐也有王冠\"。",

	"Eberron is a world in need of heroes. Lingering tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.": "Eberron是一个需要英雄的世界。挥之不去的战争紧张局势依然存在。从翡翠之爪的狂热者和龙下之城的疯狂邪教，到肉体扭曲的daelkyr和古老的大恶魔，Eberron面临着许多威胁，而除了玩家角色之外，很少有人能够阻止他们。诸神是遥远的，不会直接干预。银色火焰是一种神圣的光的力量，但它只能通过凡人的冠军来行动。少数强大的仁慈的NPC也有限制：火焰的守护者如果离开她的城堡就会失去她的力量。大德鲁伊（Great Druid）是Eldeen Reaches的精神领袖，他是一棵树。世界上大多数有权势的人都专注于自私的目标。如果一条愤怒的龙袭击了沙恩，没有其他人可以处理这个问题：城市的命运掌握在你手中。",
	"Consider a dynamic backstory when developing your character and choosing your background, whether you take a background from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or the house agent background in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|1} of this book. If you take the soldier background, you might have played a role in events of the last few years. What did you do during the Last War? What was your greatest triumph or defeat? If you're a spy, are you a prized agent or did you disavow your organization after they pushed you too far? Don't think of your character as a set of numbers: even at 1st level, you're remarkable in Eberron.": "在发展你的角色和选择你的背景时，考虑一个动态的背景故事，无论你采取的是本书（%0%）中的背景还是（%1%）中的房屋经纪人背景。如果你采取士兵的背景，你可能在过去几年的事件中扮演了一个角色。你在上次战争中做了什么？你最大的胜利或失败是什么？如果你是一个间谍，你是一个受人尊敬的特工，还是在你的组织把你逼得太紧之后，你放弃了你的组织？不要把你的角色看成是一组数字：即使是一级，你在Eberron也是很了不起的。",
	"What's better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.": "有什么比飞艇甲板上的战斗更精彩？那就是在即将坠毁的飞艇甲板上的战斗。DM应该寻找方法来提高Eberron场景的赌注，使玩家感到每一个决定都很重要。这可能是由失败的后果驱动的：你的行动会保护你的朋友、你的房子或你的国家。它可能涉及到时间：警报被触发了，在保安到达之前你只有6个回合的时间。这种事情甚至可以是偶然的。你是不是在酒吧后面的小巷里挑起了一场战斗？现在你注意到那个醉醺醺的食人魔在阴影中睡觉。如果她醒了，情况可能会变得很糟糕。",
	"Eberron is rich in villains, from two-bit hoods to continental masterminds. It might be a long time before you're ready to face the sinister leader behind the Order of the Emerald Claw in battle. But part of the flavor of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.": "Eberron的反派人物非常多，从二流子到大陆的主谋。在你准备好在战斗中面对翡翠之爪骑士团背后的邪恶领袖之前，可能还需要很长一段时间。但纸浆冒险的部分风味包括反复出现的与英雄密切相关的反派--随着你的力量提升的对手。",
	"To create a compelling villain, the DM and players might develop a villain's backstory together. A DM might ask a player: {@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?} Likewise, when a pulp villain appears to die, they can devise remarkable escapes from death. Perhaps Halas had a ring that cast an illusion of his death while stabilizing him or cast {@spell feather fall} when he leapt from that tower in Sharn. A DM could engage the players in determining the answer: {@i It's Halas Martain, all right. How do you think he survived your last encounter?} This collaboration can produce a compelling story and a sense of investment in the world.": "为了创造一个令人信服的反派，管理员和玩家可能会一起开发一个反派的背景故事。DM可能会问玩家。{@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?}同样地，当一个纸醉金迷的反派出现死亡时，他们可以设计出非凡的逃脱死亡的方法。也许Halas有一个戒指，在稳定他的同时投下了死亡的幻觉，或者在他从Sharn的那座塔上跳下时投下（%1%）。管理者可以让玩家参与确定答案。{@i It's Halas Martain, all right.

As you consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of missteps that might haunt you.": "玩家角色是了不起的人，但他们并不完美。当你考虑你的角色的缺陷时，你可以通过考虑过去来增加一点硬朗的味道。你是否犯了一个悲惨的错误，如果是的话，你是否能挽回？你是否伤害或背叛了某人，而他现在正在寻求报复？遗憾表提供了一些可能困扰你的失误的例子。",

	"A regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's flaw is to roll on the Debts table.": "遗憾有助于塑造你的个性，作为你过去的一个元素，在你的故事中发挥着持续的作用。但也许你现在就有一个需要解决的问题。另一种定义人物缺陷的方法是在债务表上滚动。",
	"Why would you want to take on a debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part of the story later on.": "你为什么要承担债务？债务增加了角色的深度，并为冒险提供了令人信服的直接动机--你不只是为了发财；你需要金子来把赏金从你头上拿下来。这也是一个机会，可以建立一个可以成为角色前进的一部分的元素。如果你想从当铺取回一件魔法物品，你要声明你的角色曾经拥有这件魔法物品--一件传家宝，你创造的东西，或者导师的礼物--你只是暂时失去了它。如果你想筹钱加入一个秘密组织，这表明加入这个组织可能是以后故事的一部分。",
	"Establishing a debt requires collaboration and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to join?

	"Not every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or ambition.

A leader guiding their nation into war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.": "并非每一场冲突都涉及到光明与黑暗之间的斗争。绝大多数人都被简单的动机所驱使：贪婪、恐惧、骄傲或野心。一个人只想在自己的口袋里得到一些金子。另一个人想给姘头留下好印象。一个引导他们的国家进入战争的领导人，既是出于对邻国的恐惧，也是真诚地相信霍尔韦尔在他们的统治下会变得更好。",
	"Primordial forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile villains, as well as everyone in between.": "原始的力量试图改变或摧毁Eberron。但更多时候，角色们会遇到误入歧途的爱国者、宗教极端分子、希望从霍尔韦尔那里多榨取几块金子的龙纹家族、为保护国家不惜一切代价的间谍，以及试图建立帝国的小罪犯。Eberron为无私的英雄和真正卑鄙的恶棍，以及介于两者之间的每个人提供了一个位置。",
	"In Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains. Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways to resolve these problems aren't always simple.": "在Eberron，要区分英雄和恶棍并不容易。好人可以做可怕的事情，而残忍或无情的人则可能为更大的利益服务。一个审问者可能会在寻求根除 \"下龙 \"邪教的过程中折磨无辜者；如果她被阻止了，这个邪教就会生存并发展壮大。一群兽人定期袭击一个人类定居点，因为定居者在兽人的圣地上建造了他们的村庄，并破坏了阻止邪恶的防护措施。英雄们在一座坟墓中发现了一件强大的魔法武器，但这件艺术品是古代妖精将军的剑，他的后人想要回它。解决这些问题的方法并不总是简单的。",

	"In a noir story, things don't necessarily end well. But any adventure carries a risk of death or failure, so what additional factors might be at risk for the characters? They should have something to lose beyond hit points, vulnerabilities not reflected in game statistics: fear of a tarnished reputation, a threat to a friend or lover, a favorite business destroyed or taken over. Character relationships require players to invest in the story and work best when the DM and player collaborate to develop details (the {@book group patrons|ERLW|4} in chapter 1 provide a framework for fleshing out such details).": "在一个黑色的故事中，事情不一定有好结果。但任何冒险都有死亡或失败的风险，那么对人物来说，还有什么额外的因素可能会有风险？除了命中率之外，他们还应该有一些可以失去的东西，即游戏统计中没有反映出来的弱点：害怕名誉受损、朋友或爱人受到威胁、最喜欢的生意被毁或被接管。角色关系需要玩家投入到故事中去，当DM和玩家合作开发细节时，效果最好（第一章中的（%0%）提供了一个充实这些细节的框架）。",
	"A DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: {@i Player one, how did Smitty save your life?

	"Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads.

This grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning.

Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.": "最后的战争是一场痛苦的斗争，永远改变了霍尔韦尔的形态。那是一个以联盟变化为标志的世纪，多年的僵局与激烈的战斗交织在一起。这场艰苦的冲突给这片土地和人民留下了深深的伤痕，但更糟糕的事情还在后面。在994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国家在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的魔法大灾难中被吞噬。哀悼的原因仍然不明；许多人担心它是由战争魔法的无节制使用造成的。震惊和恐惧将各国带到了谈判桌上，最后的战争在公元996年以《王权条约》结束。",

	"Before the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example, Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, seized during the war.": "在最后一次战争之前，加利法尔对整个霍尔韦尔提出了要求。在战争过程中出现了几个新的国家。在某些情况下，这在很大程度上是一种形式；加利法尔从未对拉扎尔公国或齐拉尔戈的地精国有过强有力的控制，他们只是名义上拥有恶魔荒原。其他国家在暴力中诞生：瓦勒纳的精灵和达尔古恩的地精通过武力夺取了他们的王国。但昂代尔（Aundair）渴望夺回艾尔迪恩河谷（Eldeen Reaches），布雷兰（Breland）对德罗阿姆（Droaam）的畸形王国保持警惕，许多人不信任瓦伦纳（Valenar）的精灵。在五国内部，人们对最后的分界线仍然心存愤怒；例如，瑟兰仍然控制着在战争中被夺取的昂代尔古城--塔利奥斯特。",
	"The borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who died in anguish.": "国家之间的边界显示了几代人的冲突所带来的影响。被火和魔法烧焦的森林和农田仍在恢复中。被毁坏的城市还没有被收回，还有破碎的村庄和废弃的堡垒。这些荒废的地方现在为强盗提供庇护，或者被那些在痛苦中死去的人的不安的灵魂所困扰。",
	"This damage reached far beyond the front lines. Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but the damage could linger for generations.": "这种损害远远超出了前线。以魔法为燃料的武器、空中骑兵和游击队都在敌人的领土深处进行打击，霍尔韦尔的城市也遭受了损失。无论你走到哪里，你都可能看到火球的焦痕或攻城武器的残骸。每个国家都在努力修复这些伤痕，但损害可能会持续几代人。",

Former nobles now have nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.": "难民生活在每个主要城市，包括成千上万因赛尔的毁灭而产生的流亡者。赛尔人是一个没有祖国的民族，他们在曾经的敌人的土地上寻求庇护和寄托。许多赛伦难民是前士兵，他们在哀伤袭来时正在敌人的领土上作战，或者他们是农民和商人，在他们的国家被吞噬之前逃跑了。昔日的贵族现在除了衣衫褴褛外一无所有，而学者或艺术家则住在巷子里。",
	"Cities and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost.

Others say that dead-gray mists rose in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.": "关于悼念活动的说法不一。有人说，一道刺眼的光芒吞噬了赛伦路附近的战场。还有人说，死灰色的迷雾在首都梅特罗尔升起，并从那里蔓延开来。在一天的时间里，赛尔国被一堵雾墙吞没了，任何被卷入雾中的东西都被可怕地改变了。在哀悼日当天，超过一百万赛尔人被杀。那些幸存下来的人是在敌方领土上作战的士兵，那些生活在边界的人能够从推进的迷雾中逃离，以及那些少数能够通过魔法手段逃离内部的人。在公元994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国不复存在。",
	"The Mourning threw Khorvaire into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those questions remain unanswered.": "哀悼会使霍尔韦尔陷入了震惊之中。谁能释放出这样的力量？这是一种武器吗？如果是的话，那些负责任的人何时会提出他们的要求？挥之不去的迷雾之墙的边界是否稳定，或者它们随时都可能扩大？该如何处理涌入每一个邻近国家的赛伦难民呢？恐惧的哀伤结束了战争。但所有这些问题仍未得到解答。",
	"Breland opened its borders to refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is this how the world ends?": "布雷兰德向难民开放边界，奥格夫王子在现在被称为新赛尔的地区担任事实上的统治者。尽管新赛尔的名字很宏伟，但它不过是一个巨大的难民营。其他难民分散在霍尔韦尔各地；有些人受到怜悯，有些人受到怀疑或愤怒。而对哀伤的恐惧像阴影一样笼罩着整个Khorvaire。它可能再次发生吗？世界就是这样结束的吗？",
	"A wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.": "一道死灰色的雾墙围绕着赛尔的遗迹。迷雾之外是一片被魔法扭曲的土地，一个无法愈合的伤口。这片被炸毁的土地发生了奇怪的变化。在一些地方，地面已经融合成锯齿状的玻璃。在其他地方，它是裂开和烧毁的。来自不同阵营的士兵的碎尸遍布这片土地--那些尸体拒绝腐烂的士兵。哀牢地是一个巨大的露天坟墓。",
	"In that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.": "在那片恐怖的土地上，卑劣的魔法效果挥之不去，怪物们变异成更加肮脏和恐怖的生物。魔法效应像风暴一样持续不断地降临在这片土地上，永不消散。故事中提到了活生生的咒语--具有物理形态的魔法，有生命的火球和卑鄙的云杀，无休止地寻找新的受害者。愤怒的鬼魂继续进行着他们最后的战斗。",
	"The only thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.": "哀牢地唯一可以预测的是，没有什么是可以预测的；任何种类的怪物或恐怖都可能潜伏在它的边界内。然而，它还拥有整个国家的财富和宝藏，以及坎尼斯家族的秘密和其他一切遗留下来的东西。它很危险。它是神秘的。但它也是一个相当于一个国家大小的地牢，为那些有勇气进入迷雾的人提供了机会。",
	"In making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your heart?": "在制作Eberron角色时，想想哀伤对你的影响。如果你是赛尔人，你是否失去了所有的家人和朋友？是否有遗失在迷雾中的传家宝，而你决心要夺回，或者你希望有一天能再次见到亲人？你是否对你的国家感到忠诚，并希望看到它得到恢复，或者你已经把赛尔城从你的心中烧掉了？",
	"Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be harnessed?": "即使你不是来自赛尔，哀悼也可能对你产生了深刻的影响。你是害怕哀伤会吞噬整个霍尔韦尔，还是不愿意纠结于这种事情？如果你有宗教信仰，哀悼会令人震惊的悲剧是导致你质疑你的信仰，还是加强了它？如果你是一个工匠或巫师，你是否有兴趣更仔细地研究它的影响。你甚至可能希望自己揭开它的神秘面纱？你是仅仅把它看作是一场悲剧，还是希望这种可怕的力量能够以某种方式被利用？",
	"Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following aftereffects of your experience:": "也许你被卷入了哀悼中，并在这次经历中幸存下来，但它的影响仍然伴随着你。考虑一下你的经历的以下后遗症。",
	"As a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits were bound to you.

	"As a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this tragedy.

Or do you believe that you siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?": "作为一个术士，你的守护者可能对哀伤感兴趣，并促使你去了解更多关于它的信息。你的守护者甚至可以是哀悼的一部分--也许是在哀悼日被杀的灵魂的集体，或者是可能对这场悲剧负责的黑暗和神秘的力量。如果你采取后一种方法，你是否觉得通过使用你的术士魔法，你在为哀悼服务？或者你认为你从它那里抽走了力量，用你的行为削弱了它？",

A fragment of the Prophecy might say, \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" The \"Bear King\" could refer to King Boranel of Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The \"Shadow of the Mourning\" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall.

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire.": "数万年前，阿贡尼森的龙族在现在的Q'barra建立了一支龙裔驻军。这些战士被指派保护该地区免受尘土领主的影响。随着时间的推移，他们偏离了自己的职责，在霍尔韦尔东部建立了一个国家，并与达卡尼帝国的妖精们发生了冲突。",
	"This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.": "这个龙裔国家在一个古老的恶魔霸主的搅动下轰然倒塌，释放出恶魔并腐蚀了许多龙裔自己。他们的国家成了一片废墟，龙裔们撤退到了黑暗的Q'barra。从那时起，他们一直呆在那里，防止腐败，并与毒黄昏的邪恶势力作斗争--毒黄昏有时被描述为对龙的崇拜，有时被描述为以魔鬼般的霸主之名聚集的军队。",
	"To date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?": "迄今为止，龙裔在很大程度上忽视了Q'barra的人类，少数遇到龙裔的人类认为他们是某种外来的蜥蜴人。如果你是龙裔，是什么导致你从Q'barra出现？你是为了帮助你的人民还是为了反对尘土领主？你是被游荡的欲望还是好奇心驱使？你是否在最后一场战争中充当过雇佣兵？你的旅行与你的人民的命运可能有什么联系？",

	"The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.": "矮人的起源被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱。他们的一些传说讲述了一次大迁徙，导致古代矮人从 \"无尽的冰雪之地 \"来到霍尔韦尔。许多人认为这指的是冰霜之城的北极之地，而其他人则声称第一批矮人一定来自里西亚的冰冻平面。无论他们的根在哪里，这些迁徙的矮人在霍尔韦尔的地表下建立了一个强大的国家。",
	"Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.": "大多数矮人的传说并不关心起源的问题，而是停留在古代深居简出的矮人所制作的强大神器和无价之宝，以及他们对达卡安的地精帝国发动的血腥战争。今天的矮人珍惜这个古老国家的记忆，因为霍尔韦尔的所有矮人都是被赶出地下王国的流亡者的后代--这个王国后来被戴尔基尔摧毁。特别是在Moror Holds，许多矮人珍视回到地下世界并重建他们的古老国家的想法，使他们恢复到他们已经完全遗忘的伟大。",
	"The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.": "摩尔大陆的矮人部分是由他们与古老的下层世界的关系决定的。为了重新发现和夺回他们古老国家的财产，矮人找到了许多在帝国最后时期制造的战争武器。其中一些武器是矮人为了对抗达尔凯尔而铸造的，但另一些则是达尔凯尔为他们的奴仆所制造的--奇怪的共生物品（其中一些出现在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中），它们利用宿主的生命力来增强其魔法能力。",
	"Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.": "一些部族禁止使用这些共生武器和对达尔凯尔魔法的任何探索，特别是著名的莫洛伦部族。其他人，特别是索多拉克氏族，已经接受了这种魔法来对抗达尔凯尔。定义与这些发现的关系可以成为你的角色背景的一个重要元素；你可能是一个致力于将任何daelkyr魔法的痕迹从下层世界中清除的Mroranon圣骑士或游侠，或者是一个为追求自己的力量以及为你的部族争取荣耀而吸取Xoriat魔法的Soldorak术士。",
	"Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.": "在扮演Mororian角色时要考虑的另一个重要问题是你为什么要离开Holds。离开Mor's Holds表提供了一些建议，可能会引发进一步的想法。",
	"A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down.": "与一个敌对部族的争斗已经失去控制，在事情冷却的时候，你最好离开霍尔兹几十年。",
	"You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world.": "你来自一个大家庭，在你的牵制下，没有空间让你发光，所以你希望在更广阔的世界里为自己扬名。",
	"Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down.": "你的宗族已经安排好了你的婚姻和你的未来，你决定在安顿下来之前进行一些冒险。",

	"You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home.": "你想召集能够帮助你探索祖先家园下面的古代遗迹的冠军。",
	"You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves.": "你拒绝了你的部族对daelkyr魔法的态度，赢得了强大矮人的敌意。",
	"You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr.": "你想了解霍尔韦尔的其他民族--尤其是哥布林和兽人--是如何与戴尔克尔作战的。",
	"Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.": "矮人分布在整个霍尔韦尔。矮人士兵和工程师是统一五国的军队的一部分，矮人石匠奠定了加利法尔最伟大城市的基础。传统上忠于家庭和部族的矮人，出生在Moror Holds之外的矮人倾向于将他们激烈的部族忠诚度转移到他们的新家--尤其是象征着这些地方的永久性和稳定性的石制品建筑。一个布雷利什矮人可能会对沙恩的塔楼或沃鲁特的大墙感到深深的个人联系；一些矮人比银焰的虔诚追随者更喜欢瑟兰的银焰大教堂。归根结底，大范围的霍尔韦尔的典型矮人比五国的普通人类更爱国，许多矮人在最后的战争中为他们的国家而战，至少有一段时间。",
	"When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?": "当创建一个来自五国的矮人角色时，既要考虑你对国家的忠诚度，也要考虑你的家庭在你生活中所扮演的角色。你住在家庭附近吗？你最亲近的家人从事什么样的工作，这是否反映在你选择的背景中？你和你的亲戚关系密切吗，或者你们之间有分歧吗？你在上次战争中失去了亲属吗？",
	"The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.": "守护印记出现在昆达拉克家族的矮人身上，该家族起源于莫洛霍尔的一个部族。昆达拉克矮人生活在霍尔韦尔各地，同时与莫尔霍尔家族保持着密切的联系，他们对家族的忠诚度高于任何特定国家。",
	"In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.": "除了提供各种形式的安全保障外，昆达拉克家族还主导着霍尔韦尔的银行业。作为一个有龙纹的家族，它有义务在所有国家的政治中保持中立，包括它的祖国。因此，昆达拉克家族在统治摩尔大陆的铁议会中不再有代表。然而，它对其他部族的影响反映了它的财富和它在霍尔兹以外的世界的地位，昆达拉克成员反对使用达尔凯尔魔法的声音具有重要的影响力。",
	"Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.": "举起你们的剑，谈论和平，或者躲在你们的石墙后面。当瓦勒纳的大军来袭时，两者都无法拯救你们。",
	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.": "数万年前，遥远的Xen'drik大陆的精灵们奋起反抗统治他们的巨人。这次叛乱是精灵历史上的决定性事件。随着古代战争的进行，巨人的魔法师们将魔法束缚在那些忠于他们的精灵身上，形成了专门猎杀其他亲属的乌鸦刺客。最终，精灵们逃离了Xen'drik，定居在Aerenal岛国，在那里他们分裂成两种不同的文化：内向的Aereni和好战的Tairnadal。因此，近四万年前的一场战争奠定了今天精灵们的生活模式。",
	"Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.": "Aereni和Tairnadal（包括Valenar的精灵）都对人类的活动没有太大的兴趣，但几个世纪以来，有少量的精灵移民到了Khorvaire，并或多或少地融入了五国的文化。不过，克罗人在霍尔韦尔几乎无人知晓。",
	"As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?": "作为一个整体，精灵们被传统和对过去的尊重所驱动。人类重视创新，而精灵则努力掌握和完善他们祖先的技术，并进行持续几个世纪的研究。在过去的五千年里，精灵社会没有什么变化，而霍尔韦尔则在不断地发展。无论你的精灵角色的起源是什么，请考虑你与过去的关系。你是否重视你祖先的传统？或者你担心你的人民过于沉溺于过去，而需要找到一种适应和前进的方法？",
	"For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.": "几千年来，艾瑞纳岛国一直被不死阁的神力所统治和保护，不死阁是由不死的高等精灵组成的议会。艾瑞尼人最伟大的英雄在死后加入不死阁，与他们的英雄祖先一起永生。",
	"The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?": "艾瑞尼人是孤立主义者，对他们岛屿以外的世界没有什么兴趣。五国是一个充满混乱和战争的地方，那么为什么任何明智的精灵都要冒险进入那个疯狂的世界呢？当你塑造一个艾瑞尼精灵的角色时，请决定是什么原因导致你离开你的岛屿家园和不死阁的保护，以便在世界范围内游荡。你是否在寻找一种可以让你在不朽之庭获得地位的力量？你是否被你自己的不死鸟祖先之一赋予了任务？或者你是一个流亡者，因为对你的人民统治者犯下的一些罪行而被放逐出你的家园？",
	"Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?": "考虑你的角色的个人和家庭历史。你的家族以什么著称，你怎样才能证明自己是这些技能的主人？你是否有祖先在不死阁，如果有，你与他们的关系如何？你觉得与短命的种族打交道有挑战性吗，还是你对他们有耐心？",
	"Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.": "泰尔纳达尔精灵将自己奉献给了战争艺术。泰尔纳达尔众多战争中最伟大的英雄--对抗巨人、龙和达卡安的冠军--在死后仍然活着，成为泰尔纳达尔的守护神。成年后，泰尔纳达尔精灵会与这些祖先之一建立联系，并努力追随这位祖先的脚步，像守护者一样生活。通过这种方式，冠军来体现他们的祖先，让死者继续生存下去。",
	"The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.": "泰尔纳达尔人有三个不同的血统：德拉雷斯-泰尔纳、西拉斯-泰尔纳和瓦拉斯-泰尔纳。这三个系都在艾瑞纳北部平原游荡，很久以前就离开了森林，但瓦莱斯-泰恩现在主要居住在瓦勒纳，是在霍尔韦尔最经常遇到的泰恩达人。尽管与艾瑞尼人同属一个家园，但泰尔纳达尔人有独特的宗教传统，他们敬仰自己的守护神祖先，而不是不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?": "在创建泰尔纳达尔角色时，包括瓦伦纳精灵，要考虑到你的守护者祖先。大多数泰尔纳达尔人追求的是与他们的守护者相同的等级，所以如果你的角色是一个巫师，你的祖先很可能是一个传奇的大法师。你的祖先是著名的爆破师、隐秘的猎人，还是战神？他们是侠义的还是无情的？大胆还是聪明？无论他们的道路如何，你都有责任以他们为榜样。这是你自豪地接受的东西，还是你抵制的东西？你是否认识另一个有相同守护者祖先的精灵，你和那个人物有什么关系？你是否知道一个精灵的守护者祖先是你的一个劲敌？",
	"Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?": "还要考虑为什么你要和一群玩家角色（他们应该不是你的战队成员）一起旅行，而不是为泰尔纳达尔人服务。你是否经历过你的守护神祖先的幻觉，驱使你走上一条特殊的道路？你是否在追寻一个反映你祖先传奇事迹的史诗般的任务？你是否在为朋友或盟友的死亡寻求复仇？或者你已经远离了你的人民，无论是出于选择还是因为对手的行为？",

	"Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.": "纵观历史，精灵们偶尔会迁移到Khorvaire的其他民族中生活。在极少数情况下，整个家族都会搬迁（就像皮亚伦家族在近三千年前所做的那样），但更多的时候，流浪者和流亡者会来到霍尔韦尔，并在那里发展。五国中许多最好的巫师和最著名的工匠都是高等精灵。在Eldeen Reaches的游侠和德鲁伊中可以找到木精灵，在Sharn的最黑暗的小巷中也可以找到木精灵。",
	"As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.": "作为一个在霍尔韦尔出生和长大的精灵，你的角色在寿命较短的种族中成长起来。你可能不像Aereni和Tairnadal那样关注历史和传统；你甚至可以完全活在当下，不关心你的家庭或你的遗产。或者你可以对你祖先的历史和传统着迷，并试图重新学习你的家族所遗忘的方式。",
	"Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?": "还要考虑你是否已经超过了人类的朋友，这可能会对你产生什么影响。你是否认识你党内另一位成员的父母或祖父母？你是想向那位早已去世的朋友偿还债务或履行承诺，还是想重拾多年前的友谊的一些火花？你还记得最后一次战争之前的一个时期吗？你在战争中战斗过吗？",
	"Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.": "很久以前，在Xen'drik大陆上，第一批乌鸦与巨人一起战斗，对抗其他精灵。几万年过去了，乌鸦和其他精灵都只记得对方是他们传说中的人物。不朽的法庭和泰尔纳达尔的祖先记得乌鸦，但他们很少有机会向他们活着的后代传授这些遥远的过去的影子。",
	"When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.": "当精灵们逃到阿伦纳时，乌鸦作为巨人的臣民留在了Xen'drik，他们被卷入了巨人文明的崩溃之中。今天，他们在Xen'drik徘徊，并确定了自己的方向，摆脱了巨人的恶意影响。",
	"Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.": "巨人陨落后形成了三种不同的鸦人文化。数量最多的是武库里（Vulkoori），他们是献给一个叫武库里的蝎子神的猎人。他们在自己的土地上猎杀巨人和其他危险品。在强大的德鲁伊和巫师的领导下，苏拉塔人坚持着可追溯到巨人时代的元素塑造传统。他们生活在整个Xen'drik的少数几个黑曜石城市中，并相信他们注定要在一场火热的天启中净化世界。最后，乌姆拉根（Umbragen）是在巨人文明衰落时逃入地球深处的乌鸦的后代。他们在与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）和其他地下世界的反常者进行的不间断战斗中挥舞着复杂的魔法。",
	"When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?": "当创建一个乌鸦角色时，想想你是如何来到Khorvaire的。你是一个随同远征队回到Khorvaire的Vulkoori猎人，现在在这个陌生的新世界中寻找自己的道路？你是一个在无尽的战争中寻求能够帮助你的人民的力量的Umbragen人吗？或者你是一个追求个人荣耀之路的苏拉塔人？",
	"How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.": "在你的旅途中遇到其他精灵文化的成员，你会有什么反应？你可能很快就认识到大多数人与你的民族传说中描述的恐怖没有什么相似之处，或者你可能有一种几乎本能的不信任反应。在活动开始时，你可能已经克服了你最初的偏见，或者你正在努力与你的冒险队伍中的另一个精灵成员建立信任。",
	"The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.": "阴影印记首次出现在皮亚伦系的精灵中，该家族很快将印记的阴影和幻觉的力量转化为一个经济王朝。对他们亲属的怀疑将他们从艾瑞纳赶到了霍尔韦尔，在最后的战争中，这个家族分裂了，产生了瑟兰尼家族。这两个影子家族控制着整个霍尔韦尔的间谍业务，但他们也经营着与艺术和娱乐有关的更合法的企业。",
	"Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|6|Aerenal}).": "皮亚伦的血统仍然流淌在一些Aereni精灵中，影子的印记在每一代精灵中出现一到两次。带着这个印记的精灵总是被纳入凯尔达尔之刃的精英部队--一个为Aerenal的兄弟姐妹国王服务的间谍机构（见（%0%））。",
	"Five words can defeat a thousand swords.": "五个字可以打败一千把剑。",
	"The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.": "普通地精对知识的热爱近乎痴迷，好奇心不受限制，并在每个人的熟人身上收集了大量潜在的有用信息。大多数地精厌恶肉体暴力，更喜欢用语言解决问题--无论是吟游诗人的雄辩说服，还是巫师的力量之语，或是流氓的谨慎威胁。他们给人的最初印象是友好的大忙人，总是准备伸出援手或分享故事，同时问一些倾向于稍微私人化的问题。不过，通常情况下，一个开朗和友好的地精正在有条不紊地增加一个知识的精神仓库，有一天可能会提供重要的筹码。",
	"To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.": "如果说每个Zil地精都是一个无情的阴谋家，那将是一种伤害性的夸大。不过，阴谋诡计是大多数齐尔人最喜欢的消遣方式。每一个Zilargo的地精孩子都被教导如何操纵和欺骗，当他们成年时，大多数人已经参与了几十个计划和争斗，其中一些一直持续到成年。即使是心地善良、目标高尚的地精--这类人很多--往往还是喜欢使用诡计和狡猾，而不是诚实或蛮力这些不可靠的工具。",
	"Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.": "大多数齐尔侏儒属于森林侏儒亚种。他们在幻觉方面的天赋帮助他们进行欺骗和娱乐，他们经常使用小动物作为信使和向导。",

Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories of your adventures back to the {@i Korranberg Chronicle}. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. If you are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent—gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.": "此外，考虑你与Zilargo的关系：你为什么离开，以及你与它还有什么联系？你的计划可以为你的离开提供一个很好的理由。或者你可以是一个为科兰伯格图书馆收集信息的圣人，或者是一个将你的冒险故事送回（%0%）的调查员。家庭对齐尔人很重要，你可以追求你家庭的利益。你甚至可以为神秘的托拉斯工作，这是三巨头王位背后的阴谋，悄悄地维持着齐乐国的秩序。如果你为信托会工作，你可能有一个特定的任务，但你也可能是一个潜伏的特工--收集信息和盟友，直到你被激活，你被投入你的预期用途。",
	"Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.": "Zil社会被划分为主要的家族，每个家族都由多个家庭组成。每个地精除了个人的名字外，还带有一个家族的名字和一个家庭的名字。例如，阿琳娜-洛里丹-莱里斯和塔利安-塔利厄斯-莱里斯是莱里斯家族中不同家族（洛里丹和塔利厄斯）的成员。地精的名字很长，也很抒情；Zil的一句谚语称 \"最甜美的歌是朋友的名字\"。个人和氏族的名字通常至少有三个音节，而且有强烈的典故传统。",
	"As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.": "正如他们无数代以来所做的那样，永不满足的好奇心和无穷无尽的机会将地精从Zilargo吸引到更广阔的Khorvaire土地。这些分散的地精大多找到了新的家园，并轻易地融入了当地文化。地精可以在任何生活领域被发现，无论是商人、魔法师、学者还是恶棍。虽然五国的地精并不像他们的齐尔表亲那样天生就很狡猾，但他们与齐尔一样强调家庭的重要性。",
	"As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.": "作为一个来自五国的地精角色，你可能有一个与你长大的社区的联系网络，可能是建立在信息交流的基础上。或者，你可能会在生活中寻求自己的道路，避开你的表亲们所崇拜的阴谋。",
	"The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.": "划线的标记出现在西维斯家族的地精中。这个家族的地精是最早离开兹拉尔戈并生活在人类土地上的同类之一。他们和故乡的地精一样喜欢官僚主义和阴谋诡计，但他们精心培养了公正和保密的声誉，因为他们的服务依赖于信任。",

Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.": "妖精物种--妖精、地精和虫熊--曾经是霍尔韦尔的主导文明，妖精帝国达卡安统治了这片大陆数千年之久。它被与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）及其反常军队的长期冲突所削弱；尽管达尔凯尔被打败了，但疯狂的种子在帝国中生根发芽并将其撕裂。今天，在霍尔韦尔有四种主要的地精文化。",
	"Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins.

	"The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|5}). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.": "Ghaal'dar部落是从达卡尼帝国的残余中产生的。霍布林是Ghaal'dar的领袖，将他们的意志强加给他们的地精和虫族同胞。Ghaal'dar的历史充满了纷争；当他们不与加利法尔或齐拉尔戈作战时，各部落通常会相互攻伐。这在最后一次战争中结束了。迪尼斯家族雇佣了盖尔达尔的雇佣兵，这让分裂的部落有了焦点。一个聪明的妖精，哈鲁克，团结了Ghaal'dar，在他的领导下，他们夺取了对现在的Darguun的控制权（见（%0%））。年迈的莱什-哈鲁克仍然是达尔昆的统治者，许多人担心他的死亡会使该地区陷入混乱。",

	"The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun.

	"As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.": "作为玛古尔虫族，你是野蛮的，并以此为荣。马古尔人崇拜嘲讽，相信不择手段的胜利：在战场上没有所谓的荣誉。对于一个玩家角色来说，这当然是一个不寻常的选择，但如果你对某一特定的小民群体有好感，你就可以成为一个强大的盟友。",
	"Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.": "虽然达卡尼帝国打败了外星的达尔基尔，但战争留下了腐败的种子，散落在整个帝国。当达卡尼开始衰落时，一些将军和总督聚集了他们的力量，并撤退到地球深处的庇护所，决心保护他们的文明，直到帝国最终能够恢复。几千年后，他们的后裔终于出现了，他们相互竞争，以确定哪位领导人值得拥有帝国的王冠。一旦解决了这个问题，他们将转向征服达尔古恩和霍尔韦尔。",
	"The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent.

Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the {@i khesh'dar} (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers.

	"The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.": "Eberron的半身人起源于Khorvaire东部，许多半身人的游牧部落仍然在Talenta平原旅行。龙纹在半身人中的出现刺激了他们在Khorvaire的缓慢迁移，随着最早的人类在大陆上的迁移，他们的治疗和款待服务也随之传播开来。现在，他们被发现在Khorvaire的每一个地方，把他们独特的才能用在这里。",

	"The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains.

	"As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.": "当你制作一个塔伦塔半身人角色时，请考虑一下你的角色为什么要离开开阔的平原。也许你在最后一次战争中担任了雇佣兵侦察员，你一直和你在冲突中遇到的战友在一起。也许你的部落被外敌消灭了，刺激你到更广阔的世界去寻找信息和复仇。你可能受到神灵的指引，他们向你发出低语和幻觉，引导你进行冒险。你可能是你的部落的官方特使，在世界范围内寻找盟友，或者只是被派去了解平原以外的土地。",
	"Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.": "另外，考虑你与恐龙的关系，恐龙在塔伦塔半身人的生活中起着核心作用。你可以将你的法术和等级特征描绘成与恐龙有关：你可以有一个爪足同伴，拥有一个快活的形态，以恐龙的攻击方式命名你的战斗方式和动作，或者从滑翔翼（翼龙）图腾精神中获得灵感。或者你可以简单地戴上恐龙面具（就像许多塔伦塔半身人所做的那样），用过去的恐龙伙伴的爪子和牙齿来装饰自己，或者采取类似恐龙的举止。无论你在哪里旅行，你与你家乡的恐龙的联系仍然很紧密。",

Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.": "敏捷而迷人，许多半身人把他们的天赋作为吟游诗人、大律师、商人和政治家在整个Khorvaire使用。当然，这些天赋对小偷、骗子和其他罪犯也同样有用。",
	"Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.": "特别值得注意的是半身人经营的犯罪企业波洛玛家族，这是布雷兰最强大的犯罪集团。波罗玛家族的总部设在沙恩，但他们的影响力遍及全国，甚至延伸到遥远的风暴城。如果你决定扮演一个半身人流氓，或者一个有犯罪或江湖背景的角色，请考虑（与你的管理员一起）你是否与波洛玛尔家族有联系。你可以是一个自由职业者，偶尔会从波洛马族的老板那里得到工作。你可能有一个表弟在集团里，他偶尔会把你拉到犯罪事务中去。或者你甚至可能是一个Boromar领袖的不情愿的继承人；也许你已经逃跑了，而不是在犯罪帝国中占据你指定的位置，但你的过去可能还会追上你。你也可以是让波洛马氏族成为你的团体赞助人的联络人，如本章后面所述。",
	"Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.": "有两个龙纹出现在霍尔韦尔的半身人中，即乔拉斯科家族的治愈之纹和加兰达家族的好客之纹。这两种龙纹都很古老，第一次出现在半身人中的时间与艾瑞纳尔的精灵获得他们的第一个龙纹的时间差不多--在人类到达科尔瓦尔的几个世纪之前。有时加兰达家族的半身人开玩笑说，他们的印记让他们为人类的到来做好了准备，让他们的新客人在科尔韦尔感到舒适。幽默中其实也有一些道理：两个半身人家族提供的服务都有助于人类在大陆上的传播。",
	"With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.": "凭借其与食物和住所有关的力量，好客的标志对早期的半身人游牧者来说是一个福音，但现在它使加兰达家族能够经营这片土地上最好的旅店、旅馆和酒馆。同样地，治疗的标记一直是游牧民族和定居者面对危险的荒野时的福音，乔拉斯科家族仍然采用魔法和世俗的治疗技术来照顾整个霍尔韦尔的病人的福祉。",
	"Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.": "矮人是坚毅的。精灵是聪明的。侏儒是狡猾的。而人类呢？他们无法决定自己的想法，所以他们试图同时成为所有这些东西。",
	"The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.": "第一批人类定居者大约在3000年前来到了Khorvaire，在现在被称为Lhazaar公国的地区登陆。从那里，他们开始缓慢但不可阻挡地蔓延到整个大陆，扰乱了平静的精灵帝国Aerenal，并在他们之后留下了更多堕落的达卡尼地精王国的废墟残骸。在这次迁徙中，他们建立了一些定居点，这些定居点后来发展成为五国。即使在今天，人类也占了这些国家人口的大多数。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，或者也许是因为他们的寿命，人类具有创新性、适应性和侵略性，总是在挑战自己的极限和追求新的想法。",
	"Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.": "在人类来到霍尔韦尔的几千年前，这片土地被达卡尼帝国的野生兽人和地精统治着。妖精帝国将兽人部落分散开来，迫使他们进入严酷而不受欢迎的土地：阴影沼泽、恶魔荒原和铁根山脉的深处。但在阴影地带，兽人从龙Vvaraak那里学到了德鲁伊魔法的秘密，成为第一批守门人。随着外来的达尔凯尔（daelkyr）从索里亚特入侵，守门人将龙的教导付诸实践，创造了神奇的封印，将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔的深处，保护埃伯龙免受来自疯狂世界的进一步入侵。",

However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.": "兽人守门员在击败达尔凯尔并将其邪恶束缚在开伯尔的过程中发挥了至关重要的作用，他们的后代继续维护着古老的封印，并与达尔凯尔的腐败所产生的异常现象作斗争。然而，许多兽人也屈服于这种堕落，接受了龙下之神的疯狂崇拜。遵循这两条道路的兽人继续生活在阴影地带，他们之间几个世纪的争斗使双方的力量都有所减弱。",

	"Patrons are more than a resource for your group to draw on, they are also a responsibility. Some patrons might be eager to support your group, while others might prove more demanding.": "赞助人不仅仅是你的团体可以利用的资源，他们也是一种责任。一些赞助人可能渴望支持你的团体，而另一些则可能要求更多。",
	"Your group's patron might occasionally come to you and give you an assignment. This can be an easy way to get into an adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can emerge if you decide to refuse an assignment.": "你们小组的赞助人可能偶尔会来找你，给你一个任务。这可能是进入冒险的一个简单方法。当然，这取决于你如何回应你的赞助人的要求，如果你决定拒绝任务，就会出现有趣的故事。",
	"Even a patron that isn't heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward. A university, for example, might not send you on a particular mission, but you might decide to follow leads to an ancient artifact hoping the university might reward you for bringing it back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while still letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.": "即使是一个并不严厉的赞助人也能极大地激励你的团体。也许你会根据你的赞助人的喜好来寻求冒险，从而获得奖励。例如，一所大学可能不会派你去做某个特定的任务，但你可能会决定跟踪一个古代文物的线索，希望大学能奖励你把它带回来。你可以自由地规划自己的命运，同时还可以让赞助人决定你的团体的性质和你所进行的冒险。",
	"It might help to think of the patrons in this section in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:": "从三大类自主权的角度来考虑本节中的赞助人可能会有所帮助。",
	"With a {@b highly directive} patron, you are an employee of an organization, and the organization often tells you what to do. Crime syndicates, dragonmarked houses, espionage agencies, military forces, and newspapers are typically highly directive.": "有了{@b highly directive}赞助人，你就是一个组织的雇员，而这个组织往往会告诉你该怎么做。犯罪集团、龙纹屋、间谍机构、军队和报纸通常都是高度指令性的。",
	"With a {@b highly autonomous} patron, you are more like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn't dictate your activities. Adventurers' guilds, heads of state, immortal beings, inquisitive agencies, religious orders, and universities are typically highly autonomous.": "有了{@b highly autonomous}赞助人，你就更像一个自由职业者。你的赞助人可能会给你提供任务，或者奖励你实现某些目标，但它不会支配你的活动。冒险家协会、国家元首、不朽的生命、探究机构、宗教团体和大学通常都是高度自治的。",
	"In a {@b player-directed} organization, you don't have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You're the boss; you tell others what to do, and you're responsible to no one for your own activities. A criminal syndicate, inquisitive agency, military force, or newspaper can be a player-directed organization.": "在一个{@b player-directed}的组织中，你没有赞助人，因为你的冒险党是负责任的。你是老板；你告诉别人该怎么做，而你对自己的活动不对任何人负责。一个犯罪集团、调查机构、军事力量或报纸都可以是一个由玩家指导的组织。",
	"Every group patron offers your party a number of benefits for your service. These benefits range from standard business arrangements, like a salary and access to staff facilities, to more extraordinary boons, like audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific benefits are presented in more detail in the benefits section of each group patron.": "每个团体赞助人都会为你们的服务提供一些好处。这些好处包括标准的商业安排，如工资和使用工作人员的设施，以及更多特殊的好处，如与有权势的人物会面或某些法律的例外。具体的好处在每个团体赞助人的好处部分有更详细的介绍。",
	"Beyond the benefits described in each group patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers their goals.": "除了每个团体赞助人描述的好处外，赞助人还可以给予额外的好处。如果你的党派与你的赞助人有良好的关系--证明你们是可靠的代理人，能实现团体的目标--你的赞助人可能会批准额外的好处请求。恩惠可以采取各种形式，适合赞助人的影响力或专业知识，如小额贷款、专门设备，或接触你无法接触的人和地方。那些经常与你发生冲突的赞助人不可能给你好处，除非这样做能直接促进他们的目标。",
	"In any case, the DM shouldn't feel limited to providing only the benefits noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron might use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.": "在任何情况下，DM都不应该觉得只提供每个团体赞助人描述中提到的好处是有限的。赞助人可以让一方获得他们无法获得的解决方案和支持，而且赞助人可能会利用他们的各种资源来指导他们的代理人，或者为他们准备更大的冒险。",
	"For certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group or found your own. For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, inquisitive agency, mercenary company, or newspaper is much more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.": "对于某些类型的组织，你可以加入一个现有的团体，也可以建立自己的组织。对于一些玩家来说，经营一个犯罪集团、调查机构、雇佣兵公司或报纸的想法要比为别人工作更令人兴奋。创立自己的组织提供了更大程度的自主权，尽管有可能以获得支持和可靠的工作为代价。",
	"The information in this section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization running.": "无论你是加入一个组织还是建立自己的组织，本节中的信息都适用。当你是老板时，属于一个组织的一些好处变成了你必须担心的开支；例如，当你经营自己的雇佣兵公司时，你需要储备自己的军械库，而不是从现有组织的库存中获取。组织带来了收入，但你必须花费其中的一部分来维持组织的运行。",
	"When you run your own organization, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity (see {@book chapter 6|DMG|6} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by all the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.": "当你经营自己的组织时，你可以使用经营企业的停工活动（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 6|DMG|6}）来反映你的组织的持续活动。一次可以有一个以上的角色参加这个活动。当滚动确定企业的业绩时，将所有角色花费的总天数加入到滚动中，以确定企业的成功（仍然遵守30的上限）。如果该企业获得了利润，则将该利润乘以4+参加该停工活动的人物数量。",

	"Your group has ties to a network of professional adventurers. These experts share contacts, resources, and leads on all manner of unusual and often dangerous work.

They might point you to adventures halfway across the world, but the general assumption is that you'll always come home to your guildhall, sooner or later.": "除了少数例外，冒险者公会的范围都是本地的，因为他们的主要利益集中在公会大厅。他们可能会指点你去世界各地的冒险，但一般的假设是，你总是会回到你的公会，迟早的事。",
	"Sharn's Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune. A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.": "沙恩的悬崖顶街区，位于杜拉区的上部，长期以来一直是冒险家和财富战士的十字路口。150年前，一个名叫Shekkal Korranor的矮人建立了悬崖顶冒险者公会，打算将其作为探险者和流浪者可以找到支持和好伙伴的地方。Shekkal在最后一次战争中死去，但公会仍然存在--一个冒险家的社交俱乐部，一个为寻求有能力的冠军的人提供的一站式市场。",

The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers' other needs with its variety of shops and services.": "悬崖顶冒险者协会总部是其所在地区的物质和社会中心，是一座巨大的石头建筑，是用一生的冒险经历获得的财富建造的。部分是安静的图书馆，部分是舒适的旅馆，部分是活跃的体育馆，部分是喧闹的酒馆，公会总部几乎包含了冒险者训练、学习和社交所需的所有设施。它周围的街区以各种商店和服务来满足冒险者的其他需求。",
	"Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers.

	"Relationships with most of the guild's allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild:": "与公会大多数盟友的关系都是基于业务，建立在良好的声誉上。不过，归根结底，公会是一个松散的团体联盟，与其中一个团体有良好关系的组织可能不会把他们的善意转移到另一个团体。以下团体与悬崖顶冒险者协会的成员做着活跃的生意。",
	"Watch Commander Lian Halamar, in charge of the large and prestigious Daggerwatch Garrison in Sharn's Dura quarter, has long been suspected of ties to the infamous Boromar Clan. Though these suspicions are often dismissed as simple prejudice in the assumption that any halfling in Sharn must be associated with the crime syndicate, the Voice of Breland, in cooperation with civic-minded members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guid, have uncovered stunning evidence confirming this connection. The Clifftop guild denies claims that these accusations embody the latest fracas in the long-running tensions between the Daggerwatch Garrison and the city's various groups of heroes for hire.": "负责沙恩杜拉区庞大而著名的匕首守卫部队的守卫指挥官廉-哈拉马，长期以来一直被怀疑与臭名昭著的波罗马家族有关系。尽管这些怀疑常常被认为是简单的偏见，认为沙恩的任何半身人都必须与犯罪集团有关，但布雷兰之声与具有公民意识的克利夫托普冒险者协会成员合作，发现了证实这种联系的惊人证据。崖顶公会否认了这些指控体现了匕首守卫队和城市的各种雇佣英雄团体之间长期以来的紧张关系中的最新争吵。",
	"{@b Affiliated guilds}.

	"{@b Clifftop businesses}. The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild's needs.

	"{@b House Tharashk}. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend'rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.": "{@b House Tharashk}. 位于Clifftop的Tharashk飞地提供具有丰富探索Xend'rik经验的向导服务，并且它很谨慎地只保留那些得到公会成员积极推荐的向导。萨拉什克家族还利用公会作为手段，雇佣冒险者作为他们自己勘探探险的保镖。",

	"{@b Sharn Watch}. Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 悬崖顶受到匕首守卫军和守卫指挥官Lian Halamar的保护。哈拉玛对冒险者没有好感，他很高兴能抓到犯法的公会成员。",
	"As members of an adventurers' guild, your group gains the following benefits:": "作为冒险家协会的成员，你的团体可以获得以下好处。",

	"{@b Storage}. The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a {@item bag of holding} or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall's basement for a time.": "{@b Storage}. 该公会将为其成员储存物品。崖顶公会在昆达拉克家族银行有一个账户，允许其成员在安全的金库中储存贵重物品。一些行会可以获得诸如{@item bag of holding}或打开到类似次元空间的保险箱的物品。在最坏的情况下，一件物品可以在公会的地下室里隐藏一段时间。",

	"Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild.

The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer's guild.": "通常情况下，一个冒险团在大的行会中没有特别的联系。有一个当地的领导或簿记员负责收取会费，但除此之外，你可能会在不同的情况下与公会的不同成员打交道--在寻找合同、收集推荐人、住在公会大厅等等。公会联系人表提供了你在与冒险者公会的任何特定接触中可能遇到的联系人的灵感。",

Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild made up largely of Last War veterans.

Founded by a renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions.

	"Your group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty apartments.

	"Crime syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.": "犯罪集团在最后一次战争期间蓬勃发展。战争使许多人感到绝望，促使他们走上犯罪的道路。战争还需要大量的精壮的士兵，这使得整个霍尔韦尔的执法队伍减少。因此，大多数定居点都有一些有组织的犯罪因素，从小型的地方盗贼行会到拥有几十个相互联系的分支机构的国际组织。",

They have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the majority of the gambling halls in the city, while most of the fences and thieves in Sharn either work directly for the them or pay tribute in exchange for independence. The Boromars control a vast network of extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends throughout the city, and their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the Boromars are one of the Sixty, the elite tier of Sharn's aristocracy. The Boromar Clan owns warehouses, taverns, and inns throughout the city, and it has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current head of the clan is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum (described in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11|The Boromar Clan}).": "波罗玛家族是沙恩市最强大的犯罪组织。从最初的走私犯和盗贼团伙，波洛玛家族已经崛起，成为城市中最有影响力的势力之一。他们垄断了走私贸易，并拥有城市中大部分的赌博厅，而沙恩的大多数栅栏和盗贼要么直接为他们工作，要么支付贡品以换取独立。波罗玛人控制着一个庞大的敲诈、勒索和嫁接网络，延伸到整个城市，他们的影响力远远超出了黑社会的范畴。几个世纪以来，早期的博罗玛族长进行了明智的投资，如今博罗玛族是沙恩贵族中的精英阶层--60人之一。波罗玛家族在整个城市拥有仓库、酒馆和旅店，并在航运贸易中拥有相当大的利益。波洛马的继承人是沙恩市议会的成员，该家族的现任族长是奥鲁姆黄金协约的成员（详见（%0%））。",
	"As much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any time soon.": "尽管沙恩委员会和守望先锋的一些成员很想看到博罗玛人被解散，但这个集团不太可能很快就会崩溃。",
	"The core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.": "Boromar氏族的核心成员--约占其成员总数的六分之一--是一个半身人的大家庭，他们是来自塔伦塔平原的移民的后代。另外三分之一的成员是没有血缘关系的半身人，其余的属于其他物种。该集团雇佣了各种各样的簿记员和行政人员，以及窃贼、骗子、走私者和其他罪犯。当需要使用暴力的时候，波洛玛家族通常会雇佣自由职业者--沙恩卫队的成员或塔卡南家族的代理人。波罗玛家族有一队私人保镖，叫做 \"爪足\"，他们大多是最近从塔伦塔平原迁来的凶猛的半身人战士。他们主要保卫博罗玛的财产和位于小平原的半身人区的总部。",
	"The Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:": "Boromar家族有一个无所不能的名声，甚至让沙恩的法律和秩序力量都对它犹豫不决。成为该集团的盟友，或者至少不受其影响，要比成为其敌人安全得多，而且更有利可图。以下团体是波罗马家族最亲密的盟友之一。",
	"{@b House Jorasco}. The head of the Boromar Clan, Saidan Boromar, is married to an unmarked heir of House Jorasco, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco. This marriage has created important ties between the Boromars and the halfling healers of Sharn. Members of the Boromar family can secure healing for free, and other members of the syndicate receive a 10 percent discount at Jorasco houses of healing.": "{@b House Jorasco}. 波罗玛家族的首领，赛丹-波罗玛，与乔拉斯科家族的一位无名继承人玛拉-波罗玛-德-乔拉斯科结婚。这场婚姻在博罗玛家族和沙恩的半身人治疗师之间建立了重要的联系。博罗玛家族的成员可以免费获得治疗，而集团的其他成员在乔拉斯科的治疗机构可以获得10%的折扣。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Of the seventeen members of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee aid.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 在沙恩市议会的17名成员中，有4人与波洛玛家族关系密切--包括一个叫伊拉-波洛玛的人，他直接向集团的负责人汇报。这四个人作为一个集团投票，以确保议会不对波洛玛家族采取直接行动，而其他议会成员对集团有足够的恐惧，所以他们倾向于进行投票。波罗玛氏族的成员可以通过求助来确保与这些理事之一会面，但这并不能保证得到援助。",
	"{@b Sharn Watch}. The Boromars have been bribing captains of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges dismissed.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 波罗玛人世代都在贿赂沙恩观察站的队长。更重要的是，如果波洛玛尔家族垮台，黑社会将爆发无政府状态，因为几十个小犯罪头目为了争夺地盘和地位而大打出手。因此，波洛玛尔家族的成员可以叫人帮忙，使轻微的刑事指控被撤销。",
	"Despite the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the greatest threats to Boromar interests:": "尽管波罗马家族在沙恩的地位很强，但它有很多敌人，他们无情的攻击使该集团处于可能是有史以来最危险的境地。目前，以下团体对波罗马的利益构成了最大的威胁。",
	"{@b Daask}. The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.": "{@b Daask}. 被称为Daask的畸形犯罪行会是Droaam领导人的棋子，在过去两年中开始对Boromar的财产发动暴力袭击。作为一个使用游击战术的流动组织，Daask已经成功地绕过了Boromar的安全，并避免了一系列暴力盗窃和破坏行为的严重报复。达斯克的特工不顾一切地伤害新晋的Boromar特工。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition they might bring to the council.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 尽管市议会中有四个朋友，但波罗马家族也有几个敌人。至少有三位议员因为真正关心他们的选民而反对Boromars；还有两位议员因为是敌对组织（Aurum和Tyrants）的成员而反对该集团。由于他们的影响力，议会至今拒绝投入任何资源来打击达斯克的崛起，希望这个畸形的行会能打倒波罗马人。波罗玛氏族的个别成员可以确信，这些议员会反对他们可能提交给议会的任何请愿书。",
	"With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个犯罪集团作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"The annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar, head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.": "众所周知，一年一度的泰恩盛会将沙恩最富有和最有名望的公民聚集在一起，隆重展示财富和权力。但昨晚，它也提供了一个令人震惊的暴力展示，因为赛丹-博罗玛--博罗玛家族的首领，据称与整个城市的各种犯罪活动有关--被一个可能的刺客（在她的近亲被确认和通知之前，她的名字不会被公开）撞见。博罗玛和他的妻子玛拉-博罗玛-乔拉斯科（Mala Boromar d'Jorasco）安然无恙，这要归功于他们的保镖的及时干预，他是来自塔伦塔平原的新移民，其迷人的文化和凶狠的举止都在昨晚一览无余。波洛马的发言人指出，这位保镖名叫哈拉克-波洛马，是波洛马家族的私人护卫队队长，以塔伦塔平原上半身人骑的恐龙命名。",
	"{@b Assignments}. The Boromar Clan doesn't pay you, but it might assign you to particular tasks. Sometimes these are tasks someone has hired the syndicate to perform (such as an assassination), in which case the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. Other times, your aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), in which case you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates might take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's discretion.": "{@b Assignments}. 波洛玛氏族不付给你报酬，但它可能会指派你完成特定的任务。有时，这些任务是有人雇佣该集团执行的（如暗杀），在这种情况下，该集团会将85%的费用转给你的团队。还有一些时候，你的目的是为了丰富集团的财富（例如通过抢劫），在这种情况下，你有特权保留你所偷的东西的85%。其他辛迪加可能会多拿或少拿15%的份额，由DM决定。",
	"{@b Contraband}. You have access to your syndicate's \"business\" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.": "{@b Contraband}. 你可以进入你的辛迪加的 \"业务\"，处理违禁品，如毒药或麻醉品。你在这些货物上得不到折扣，但你总能找到地方购买它们。",
	"{@b Fences}. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.": "{@b Fences}. 你的集团成员或同伙擅长处理赃物，你也可以使用这项服务。栅栏不仅对出售非法货物很有用，而且对出售昂贵的物品，如艺术品甚至魔法物品也很有用。就魔法物品而言，这允许你将寻找买家的工作（在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的停机活动）委托给围栏。缺点是，你不能选择是否接受你可能收到的报价--栅栏为你做了这个决定。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to interfere with your activities.": "{@b Immunity}. 作为波洛马氏族的成员，你受到保护，不受该氏族其他成员的影响。你的集团中没有人以你为目标进行他们自己的犯罪活动。(当然，对你也是如此。）另一方面，如果你在氏族内有对手，他们可能会找到其他方法来干扰你的活动。",
	"{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. The Boromar Clan owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.": "{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. Boromar家族拥有几家企业，主要是作为洗钱的幌子。当你从这些企业中购买时，你可以得到5%的折扣。DM决定有哪些商品和服务。",
	"Naturally, a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "自然，博洛玛家族的大部分成员都有犯罪背景。不过，没有理由其他背景的人物不能成为该集团的一员。波罗玛人招募退役士兵作为肌肉，招募训练有素的圣人进行研究，招募水手作为走私船的船员，招募江湖骗子和顽童以发挥他们的独特才能。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Bruiser}. Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with proficiency in {@skill Intimidation} to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.": "{@b Bruiser}. 有时微妙的做法意味着只需打破一个告密者的膝盖骨。恶棍使用武力和武力威胁来确保犯罪集团得到它想要的东西。力量是这个角色的先决条件，但魅力也是有用的，特别是当与精通{@skill Intimidation}相结合时，可以加强布鲁斯的内在危险。很多布鲁斯人都有犯罪的过去，但前士兵也经常被招募到这个角色。战士和流氓是天然的布鲁斯人。",
	"{@b Burglar}. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as {@skill Acrobatics}, {@skill Sleight of Hand}, and {@skill Stealth} to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.": "{@b Burglar}. 敏捷和灵活，盗贼依靠灵巧和熟练的技能，如{@skill Acrobatics}、{@skill Sleight of Hand}和{@skill Stealth}，进入目标地点，拿走贵重物品，然后不被发现地离开。有些盗贼专门从事某些类型的盗窃，如破门而入或扒窃口袋。除了有犯罪背景的人物，年轻的顽童经常通过扮演这个角色在犯罪集团中找到一席之地。罗格是天生的盗贼，但其他任何拥有正确技能和能力组合的人都可以做这项工作。",
	"{@b Mastermind}. Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as does proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Investigation}. Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.": "{@b Mastermind}. 任何犯罪活动都必须有人负责，这就是主谋的作用。高智力对这个人物有利，熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Investigation}等技能也是如此。策划者通常来自于圣徒、贵族或贤者等背景，这使他们拥有广泛的知识来支持他们的计划。吟游诗人、流氓和巫师经常被吸引到这个角色。",
	"{@b Safecracker}. The \"breaking\" part of \"breaking and entering\" is the Safecracker's job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.": "{@b Safecracker}. 破门而入 \"中的 \"破门 \"部分是安全窃贼的工作。一个典型的盗贼可能会熟练掌握盗贼的工具，以及熟练使用这些工具所需的灵巧能力。智力对于弄清复杂的锁和秘密的门很重要。许多安全钳工还拥有很高的实力，以应对锁具失效的情况。安全钳工通常有犯罪背景，但有使用其他工具和设备经验的人物，包括行会工匠甚至水手，也会自然而然地进入这个角色。工匠或流氓是安全钳工的自然等级选择。",
	"{@b Talker}. From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}. The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills. Bards are a natural fit for the job as well.": "{@b Talker}. 从骗子到围墙，任何依靠人际关系技巧和联系网络的人都属于谈话者的角色。魅力对这一角色很有用，同时还需要精通一些技能，如（1%）、（2%）和（3%）。骗子的背景很适合说话者，但罪犯、顽童和其他人也可以用合适的技能来扮演这个角色。吟游诗人也很自然地适合这个工作。",
	"Your work as syndicate members involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. A team with your skills comes together for greater purposes—more dangerous risks and far more splendid rewards. As a group, consider the options on the Syndicate Crimes table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of work you do for the Boromar Clan.": "作为集团成员，你们的工作不仅仅涉及简单的街头诈骗或扒窃。一个拥有你的技能的团队会为了更伟大的目标而聚在一起--更危险的风险和更丰厚的回报。作为一个团体，考虑一下 \"辛迪加犯罪 \"表中的选项，并与你的DM一起决定你为波罗马家族做哪些工作。",
	"{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. Your job is to acquire assets for the syndicate. You might steal important documents or clear out a location for use as a hideout.": "{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. 你的工作是为该集团获取资产。你可能会偷取重要的文件，或者清理出一个地点作为藏身之处。",
	"{@b Heists}. You plan and execute elaborate robberies that require the skills of everyone on your team.": "{@b Heists}. 你计划并执行精心设计的抢劫案，需要你团队中每个人的技能。",
	"{@b Gang Warfare}. Your primary job is to ensure that no other crime syndicate (such as Daask or House Tarkanan) gains a significant foothold in your territory.": "{@b Gang Warfare}. 你的主要工作是确保没有其他犯罪集团（如Daask或Tarkanan家族）在你的领土上获得一个重要的立足点。",
	"{@b Internal Affairs}. Your task is to keep all the corrupt, headstrong, and avaricious members of your syndicate in line with the goals and rules of the group.": "{@b Internal Affairs}. 你的任务是让你的集团中所有腐败的、刚愎自用的、贪婪的成员与集团的目标和规则保持一致。",
	"{@b Assassination}. Your work involves killing prominent people—the sort who have numerous bodyguards and elaborate security systems to circumvent.": "{@b Assassination}. 你的工作涉及杀戮知名人士--那种有众多保镖和精心设计的安全系统可以规避的人。",
	"{@b Topple the Powerful}. Your syndicate might be criminal and your methods illegal, but your goals are righteous. You help people who are powerless to defend themselves against exploitation by the rich and powerful.": "{@b Topple the Powerful}. 你的集团可能是犯罪，你的方法是非法的，但你的目标是正义的。你帮助那些无力保护自己免受富人和权贵剥削的人。",
	"Even among the notorious Boromar Clan, your group has a distinct identity and a reputation. What's the event or unique trait that makes your crew stand out? Consult the Group Infamy table for suggestions on how your group might stand out within the larger syndicate.": "即使在臭名昭著的波罗马家族中，你们的团队也有一个独特的身份和声誉。是什么事件或独特的特质让你的团队脱颖而出？请参考团体恶名表，看看你的团体如何在更大的集团中脱颖而出。",
	"{@b Tattoos}. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work.": "{@b Tattoos}. 你们小组的每个成员都有一个独特的纹身，能激发别人的恐惧。在可能的情况下，你用这个符号作为名片来标记你的工作。",
	"{@b Outfit}. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory.": "{@b Outfit}. 无论是带有团体标志的皮革掸子，还是塞在口袋里的独特手帕，你的团伙都有一个标志性的配件。",
	"{@b Infamy}. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town.": "{@b Infamy}. 你的团体与一起臭名昭著的犯罪有关，这起犯罪仍然是镇上的话题。",
	"{@b Idols}. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair.": "{@b Idols}. 某种类型的人觉得罪犯很诱人，而你的乐队已经获得了一群这样的挂靠者。他们本身不是罪犯，只是因为你的残暴、狡猾或天赋而钦佩你的外人。",
	"{@b Legitimate}. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder.": "{@b Legitimate}. Boromar家族有一个合法的幌子，尽管每个人都知道它背后的真相。你是这个合法幌子的一部分，但你有逃脱（字面）谋杀的声誉。",
	"{@b Legends}. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way.": "{@b Legends}. 你有一种神秘的气息，人们低声说你拥有奇怪的力量。不管是真是假，这种声誉使人们对你敬而远之。",
	"Some criminals believe you can't do a job without betraying your partners. Perhaps you have your own share of adversaries you've angered. The Group Rivals table presents a host of groups and individuals who might—legitimately or otherwise—hold a grudge against you.": "一些罪犯认为，你不背叛你的伙伴就无法完成工作。也许你也有自己的对手被你激怒。团体对手表列出了许多团体和个人，他们可能--合法的或其他的--对你怀有怨恨。",
	"{@b The Law}. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying.": "{@b The Law}. 沙恩观察的某个人发誓要把你送进监狱，否则就得死。",
	"{@b Gang War}. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason.": "{@b Gang War}. 敌对集团的一些成员（如达斯克、塔卡南家族或暴君）讨厌你，可能有充分的理由。",
	"{@b The Press}. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists.": "{@b The Press}. 你的团体的冒险是很好的头条新闻。你的一举一动都会被大报报道，你的脚步也会被记者追问。",
	"{@b Infighting}. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you.": "{@b Infighting}. 波洛马氏族中的另一个团体嫉妒你的成功，或对过去的错误感到愤怒。他们尽其所能地削弱你。",
	"{@b Vigilante}. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood.": "{@b Vigilante}. 一个被你冤枉的公民发誓要报仇。在任何一个角落，你都可能发现自己面对的是一个义务警员或一群愤怒的公民，他们要杀你。",
	"{@b The Bosses}. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal.": "{@b The Bosses}. 控制集团的半身人家族盯上了你，不遗余力地让你保持一致，确保你保持忠诚。",
	"Everyone has a well-defined place in the Boromar Clan hierarchy. You report to a contact who oversees your work, giving you assignments, and collecting the syndicate's cut. This person might be a criminal mastermind who plans all your exploits, or they could leave the planning to your group. In any case, the Syndicate Contact table can help you define the personality of this contact.": "每个人在波洛马氏族的等级制度中都有一个明确的位置。你向一个监督你工作的联系人报告，给你分配任务，并收取集团的分成。这个人可能是一个计划你所有行动的犯罪主谋，或者他们可以把计划留给你的小组。在任何情况下，辛迪加联系人表可以帮助你定义这个联系人的个性。",
	"A surrogate parent who views you as challenging but beloved children": "一个将你们视为具有挑战性但受人喜爱的孩子的代理家长",
	"A no-nonsense boss who treats the syndicate's work as just another business": "一个不苟言笑的老板，把辛迪加的工作当作另一项业务。",

	"A former urchin, now fabulously wealthy, who wants to see everyone in the syndicate find the same success": "一个曾经的顽童，现在富得流油，他希望看到集团中的每个人都能找到同样的成功。",
	"The boss at a gambling den or similar house of vice who enjoys the business just a little too much": "赌馆或类似的淫秽场所的老板，他只是有点太喜欢这一行了。",
	"A kind-hearted crook who's grateful to finally be able to delegate the dirty work on the streets to you": "一个心地善良的骗子，终于可以把街上的脏活累活交给你，他很感激。",

	"A former law enforcement officer who is full of cheerful tips for avoiding the law": "一位前执法官员，对避开法律充满了欢快的提示",
	"The city of Sharn is unusual in that it is home to no less than four powerful syndicates, which somehow have not yet managed to wipe each other out. The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others include the following groups:": "沙恩市的不寻常之处在于，它是不少于四个强大的集团的家，而这些集团不知为何还没有设法消灭对方。波洛马氏族是一个犯罪集团，而其他集团包括以下几个。",
	"Imagine it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises among \"blood addicts.\" And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and sold in drams or \"veins\" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember friends, \"Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!\"": "想象一下：一种持久的兴奋状态，一种力量和能量的感觉，对某些魔力有可衡量的影响，以及每次使用都有上瘾和致命的过量风险。这就是被称为龙血的药物所带来的快感，它目前在沙恩享有极高的人气。每天，这种神秘物质造成的死亡人数在 \"血瘾者 \"中不断上升。这也难怪，因为它产自德拉姆，由达斯克的畸形暴徒以德拉姆或 \"静脉 \"的形式出售，他们肯定只想破坏沙恩的繁荣，但目标是它最宝贵的资源：它清醒、勤劳的人民。记住朋友们，\"留在马车上。对龙说不！\"",
	"{@b Daask}. Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.": "{@b Daask}. 达斯克（Daask）是一个咄咄逼人的犯罪组织，在霍尔韦尔各地都有分部。该组织由来自德拉姆（Droaam）的畸形移民领导，其中包括巨魔、女妖、梅杜莎人、牛头人、食人魔、巨魔等，最终受德拉姆统治者之一索拉-卡特拉（Sora Katra）的指挥。身体暴力是其专长，但达斯克也涉足非法毒品。",
	"{@b House Tarkanan}. House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these marks during the ancient War of the Mark.": "{@b House Tarkanan}. 塔卡南家族是沙恩的一个由高技能刺客和盗贼组成的小团体。鲜为人知的是，这个公会主要由带有异常龙纹的罪犯组成--因此它选择了这个名字，因为哈拉斯-塔卡南勋爵在古代的龙纹战争中联合了这些龙纹的持有者。",
	"{@b The Tyrants}. The Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.": "{@b The Tyrants}. 暴君们是一个神秘的变身者团体，他们贩卖各种信息。他们出售秘密，勒索有权势的人，并伪造从身份证明文件到硬币和艺术品的一切。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing syndicate, you can start your own. You need to establish your own headquarters and direct the activities of the {@dice 3d6} criminals who work for you. By claiming a 15 percent share of their take, you can rely on an income that will sustain you at a modest lifestyle, plus an additional {@dice 1d6} gp in profit per week. You can access contraband and fences as described earlier in this section, but you don't get a discount at syndicate-owned businesses unless you acquire some businesses of your own. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your syndicate.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的辛迪加，你可以开始你自己的。你需要建立自己的总部，并指导为你工作的（1%）罪犯的活动。通过索取他们15%的份额，你可以依靠收入来维持你适度的生活方式，再加上每周额外的{@dice 1d6}金币的利润。你可以像本节前面描述的那样获得违禁品和栅栏，但你在集团所有的企业中得不到折扣，除非你自己收购一些企业。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的辛迪加集团的活动。",
	"Your group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire: the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests. You might function openly as representatives of the house, wearing its badge and exerting its authority, or you could be covert or unacknowledged agents.": "你们的团体为霍尔韦尔最有影响力的组织之一工作：有龙纹的家族。无论你的团队中是否有成员带着龙纹，甚至是否与某个家族有血缘关系，你都代表某个家族行事，以促进其利益。你们可以作为该家族的代表公开运作，佩戴其徽章并行使其权力，或者你们可以是秘密的或不被承认的代理人。",
	"The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.": "本章前面详细介绍了这十三座龙纹屋。",
	"With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个龙纹屋作为你的团体的守护者，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. Your patron house pays you for the work you do on its behalf. On average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the mission.": "{@b Compensation}. 你的庇护所为你所做的工作支付你。平均来说，家族会支付给你们每个成员一笔相当于10GP×你们的角色平均等级的金额，每一天你们都会花在任务上。",
	"{@b House Services}. When you require the services provided by your patron house, you can secure them at a discounted rate (10 percent off the normal charge). You might also be able to trade in a favor to get extraordinary services or a larger discount.": "{@b House Services}. 当你需要你的主顾家提供的服务时，你可以以折扣价（正常收费的10%）来保证他们。你也许还可以用人情来换取非凡的服务或更大的折扣。",
	"{@b Independence}. Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely to challenge you.)": "{@b Independence}. 你们小组的每个成员都会获得证件，以表明你们是你们守护家族的代理人。因为有龙纹的家族受古老的科思法令条款的约束而保持政治中立，这些证件保证你有权为你的守护家族的业务而自由穿越国境。 如果你声称你是为家族的业务而来，即使你不是，边境人员也不可能质疑你。",
	"Dragonmarked houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "龙纹屋雇用适合他们需要的冒险者。角色在有龙纹屋守护者的团体中所扮演的角色往往与他们与龙纹屋的关系有关，而不是与派对中的具体角色有关。你可以考虑为你的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Adventurer}. Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep pockets.": "{@b Adventurer}. 有些角色与你的守护家族有关，因为他们与该家族的统治者或其企业有联系。不过，冒险家受雇于该家族是为了获得更多传统的冒险技能--通常是该家族的其他代理人所缺乏的能力。冒险家可能拥有广泛的能力，特别是满足家族当时的任何需求。许多拥有奇特技能或高度具体的专业领域的人发现自己受雇于有龙纹的家族或拥有古怪兴趣和深厚财力的家族成员。",
	"{@b Guilder}. Every dragonmarked house is more than a single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.": "{@b Guilder}. 每个龙纹屋都不只是一个单一的家庭。每个家族至少有一个公会，其运作方式就像传统的手工业或贸易公会一样，有数百人与这些公会有联系，而与监督它们的家族没有其他关系。行会成员就是其中之一，比如说，他可能是乔拉斯科家族治疗师公会的一名熟练医生或牧师，或者是与塔拉什克家族的发现者公会有关的一名好奇者。行会成员可能有公会工匠的背景，或者其他一些适合你的守护家族的公会专长的技能。",
	"{@b Heir}. The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves particularly appropriate for this character.": "{@b Heir}. 继承人是你的龙纹家族守护者的成员，有血缘关系，并带有家族的名字。这个角色很可能选择与家族血统相匹配的种族。继承人可以是龙纹（有适当的龙纹亚种或种族变体）或无龙纹。家族代理人的背景（在本章中描述）被证明特别适合这个角色。",
	"Your group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with multiple possibilities for adventures that overlap with their interests. For the more general kind of work you might carry out on behalf of any dragonmarked house, consult the General House Missions table.": "你的小组和你的DM应该一起决定哪个家族雇用你。你所承担的任务的性质部分取决于你为之工作的家族或公会，但每个家族都需要代理人代表它完成一些一般的工作。家族任务表提供了关于哪个家族可能雇用你的建议，以及与他们的兴趣相重合的多种冒险的可能性。关于你可能代表任何龙纹家族进行的更一般的工作，请参考一般家族任务表。",

	"Reports emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only temporarily, as a matter of house security.": "本周出现了关于十二宫内部激烈争论的报告，十二宫是一个神秘的机构，据称体现了各宫之间的合作精神。据一位不愿透露姓名的消息人士称，上周十二院委员会召开了一次特别会议，以解决与昆达拉克家族有关的研究人员从研究所的预算中挪用资金来资助他们自己的私人项目，然后向他们的同事隐瞒这些项目的结果。据我们的消息来源称，昆达拉克的代表否认了这些指控，说研究人员是在其分配的预算范围内运作的，只是为了房子的安全而暂时对他们的结果保密。",
	"This matter is far from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the dragonmarked houses themselves.": "这件事远没有得到解决，因为理事会会议在解散前演变成了大喊大叫的争论。梅丹妮家族和塔拉什克家族的代表在谴责昆达拉克时特别大声，让本报记者怀疑十二人理事会内部的分裂是否迫在眉睫--这对有龙纹的家族之间的和平关系可能意味着什么。",
	"The Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar and the message stations of House Sivis": "十二院促进了龙纹家族之间的交流与合作。作为结束龙纹战争的协议的一部分，各家族同意创建一个魔法应用研究所--一个研究龙纹和更多传统形式的魔法的基金会。几个世纪以来，十二院一直负责许多魔法方面的进步，包括利兰达家族运营的飞艇和西维斯家族的信息站。",
	"As an arm of the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and make sure that each house is represented.": "作为龙纹家族的一个分支，十二星座试图在最后的战争中保持中立，但它的许多巫师和工匠的国家忠诚度比他们与学院的关系更强。现在，十二院已经恢复了正常的运作，它试图取代其失去的成员，并确保每个家族都有代表。",
	"While the Twelve provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. Consider using the following details as a template if there's a particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.": "虽然十二宫为你的团体提供了一种为多个龙纹屋工作的方式，但其目标和利益与单个龙纹屋相似。如果有一个特定的龙纹屋是你希望服务的，可以考虑使用下面的细节作为模板。",
	"As a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to advance magical developments that have practical value to society as well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the results of its research.": "作为一个赞助人，十二宫在功能上类似于一个有龙纹的家族。不过，十二宫并不是为了促进某个家族的利益，而是为了推动对社会有实际价值的魔法发展，以及潜在的利润。所有家族都为研究所的运营预算做出贡献，理论上他们都能从研究所的研究成果中获益。",
	"As agents of the Twelve, you might undertake missions intended to help one house at a time or all of them at once, typically with a focus on magical research or problem-solving. Members of your group might have different status within their houses, but within the Twelve you're held as equals. The Twelve pay you (see \"{@book Patron Benefits|ERLW|4|Patron Benefits}\"), and as their agents, you receive a 5 percent discount on services from all the dragonmarked houses (rather than a 10 percent discount from one house).": "作为十二宫的代理人，你们可能会承担任务，一次帮助一个家族，或者同时帮助所有的家族，通常以魔法研究或解决问题为重点。你们小组的成员在他们的家族中可能有不同的地位，但在十二宫中你们是平等的。十二家族会付给你们报酬（见\"（%0%）\"），而作为他们的代理人，你们可以从所有龙纹家族获得5%的服务折扣（而不是从一个家族获得10%的折扣）。",
	"The Committee of Twelve oversees the institute. It currently has fifteen members, though its membership is a matter of significant disagreement within the council. There are of course only twelve dragonmarks, but the Mark of Shadow is represented by two different houses, and House Cannith is currently fragmented into three branches, each of which has claimed a seat on the council.": "十二人委员会负责监督该机构。它目前有15名成员，但其成员组成在理事会内部存在重大分歧。当然只有十二个龙印，但影子印记由两个不同的家族代表，坎尼斯家族目前被分割成三个分支，每个分支都在委员会中占有一个席位。",
	"The Twelve is headquartered in a many-spired keep that floats in the air above the city of Korth in Karrnath. Most researchers funded by the Twelve operate within this structure, but the institute occasionally pays grants to researchers whose promising work can't easily (or safely) be relocated inside the keep.": "十二院的总部设在卡尔纳特的科思市上空的一个有很多图案的堡垒里。大多数由十二星座资助的研究人员都在这个结构内工作，但研究所偶尔也会向那些有前途的工作不能轻易（或安全）地在堡垒内重新安置的研究人员支付补助金。",
	"With a long record of providing benefit to society at large, the Twelve is widely respected. Some of their closest allies include the following groups:": "由于长期以来为整个社会提供利益的记录，十二门徒会受到广泛尊重。他们的一些最亲密的盟友包括以下团体。",
	"{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. Above all, the Twelve has the almost universal support of the dragonmarked houses, which provide the funding to support its continued operation. One of the few things that all the houses agree on is that the Twelve should be allowed to do its work in peace. Agents of the Twelve can count on at least a minimal level of assistance from the houses in case of dire need.": "{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. 最重要的是，\"十二门徒会 \"几乎得到了有龙纹的家族的普遍支持，他们提供资金支持其继续运作。所有家族都同意的少数几件事之一是，应该允许十二宫和平地开展工作。十二宫的代理人在有迫切需要的情况下，至少可以指望得到各宫的最低程度的援助。",
	"{@b King Kaius}. Not every nation shares the same goodwill toward the Twelve, but the institutes's location above the city of Korth makes its relationship with Karrnath particularly important. The kings of Karrnath have regularly sought council from the Twelve, and Kaius has not abandoned this practice. Agents of Karrnath's government are inclined to trust agents of the Twelve and side with them in times of trouble.": "{@b King Kaius}. 并非每个国家都对十二门徒有同样的好感，但研究所位于科思城的上方，这使得它与卡尔纳特的关系特别重要。卡尔纳斯的国王经常向十二院寻求意见，凯厄斯也没有放弃这种做法。卡尔纳斯政府的代理人倾向于信任十二星座的代理人，并在遇到困难时与他们站在一起。",
	"{@b Manifest Institute}. In the city of Sharn, the Twelve sponsors the research of a number of scholars who make a study of the manifest zone that links the city to the plane of Syrania. Loosely organized as the Manifest Institute, these researchers include representatives from House Cannith, House Lyrandar, House Orien, and others, as well as those who work directly for the Twelve. The institute evaluates ways that the manifest zone might improve life in Sharn, seeks a deeper understanding of manifest zones in general, and plans contingencies in the event that the manifest zone ever evaporates.": "{@b Manifest Institute}. 在沙恩市，十二星座赞助了一些学者的研究，他们对连接该市和西拉尼亚平面的显形区进行研究。这些研究人员被松散地组织为 \"显灵研究所\"，其中包括来自坎尼斯家族、利兰达家族、奥瑞恩家族和其他家族的代表，以及直接为十二星座工作的人。研究所评估了显露区可以改善沙恩生活的方式，寻求对显露区的更深入了解，并计划在显露区消失的情况下的应急措施。",
	"Most enemies of the Twelve are individuals with grudges against the institute, which often stem from hurt feelings over being excluded from it. Those noted here number among the Twelve's fiercest foes:": "十二门徒会的大多数敌人都是对该机构心怀怨恨的人，这些怨恨往往来自于被排除在该机构之外的伤感。这里提到的人是十二门徒会最凶恶的敌人之一。",
	"{@b Arcane Congress}. Established by King Galifar I expressly to serve as a political answer to the Twelve, the Arcane Congress competes with the Twelve over resources and students. Some would argue that the ongoing rivalry encourages both institutions toward more and better arcane discoveries, but the animosity sometimes escalates to sabotage and researchers taking excessive risks.": "{@b Arcane Congress}. 由加里法尔一世国王建立的奥术大会在政治上是对十二宫的回应，它与十二宫在资源和学生方面存在竞争。有些人认为，这种持续的竞争鼓励两个机构朝着更多、更好的奥术发现前进，但这种敌意有时会升级为破坏行为和研究人员的过度冒险。",
	"{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. Not many personal grudges jeopardize the Twelve, but when a powerful wizard feels slighted, the impact can be significant. The elf wizard Mordain was banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of his disturbing experiments related to the magic of the daelkyr. He dwells in Droaam now, focused on his research and plotting revenge. His reach isn't long, but agents of the Twelve avoid Droaam if at all possible.": "{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. 没有多少个人恩怨会危害到十二宫，但当一个强大的巫师感到被轻视时，其影响可能会很大。两个多世纪前，精灵巫师莫尔丹被放逐出十二宫，因为他做了与达尔凯尔魔法有关的令人不安的实验。他现在住在德罗阿姆，专注于他的研究并谋划着复仇。他的势力范围并不长，但十二神族的代理人尽可能地避开德罗阿姆。",
	"Secret agents, spies, undercover operatives—your group is part of an organization engaged in espionage. Most such agencies are attached to governments or dragonmarked houses, gathering information on the activities and plans of rival nations, houses, and businesses. Naturally, your affiliation with an espionage agency is a secret; you can't advertise that connection, and if you get in trouble with law enforcement forces (especially in foreign nations), your home nation will disavow you and deny any knowledge of your activities.": "秘密特工、间谍、卧底特工--你的团队是从事间谍活动的组织的一部分。大多数这样的机构都隶属于政府或有龙纹的家族，收集关于敌对国家、家族和企业的活动和计划的信息。自然，你与间谍机构的关系是一个秘密；你不能宣传这种关系，如果你遇到执法部队的麻烦（尤其是在外国），你的祖国会否认你，并否认知道你的活动。",
	"It's said the Last War was fought as much by spies as by armies. Espionage agencies in every nation sought secrets to bring military supremacy to their own lands and provide dominance over their neighbors. In the years since the end of the war, a clandestine struggle among these agencies (which the {@i Korranberg Chronicle} dubbed the Shadow War) has continued unabated, just outside of the public eye.": "据说，最后一场战争是由间谍和军队一样进行的。每个国家的间谍机构都在寻求秘密，以便将军事优势带到自己的土地上，并对其邻国提供支配地位。在战争结束后的几年里，这些机构之间的秘密斗争（%0%）被称为影子战争）有增无减，只是在公众视野之外。",
	"The King's Dark Lanterns is the intelligence division of the King's Citadel, an organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.": "国王的黑灯笼是国王城堡的情报部门，该组织发誓要从敌人手中保卫布雷兰，并以博拉内尔国王的名义执行正义。作为王室的秘密仆人，该组织的成员被授权在外国领土上开展情报行动，在全球范围内执行秘密任务，并防止国家机密落入敌对情报机构的手中。黑暗灯笼也有一个不成文的许可，可以消灭任何威胁到他们国家、其主权或其公民的生物。",
	"The King's Citadel is based in Breland's capital city of Wroat, under the command of the king's brother, Lord Kor ir'Wynarn. A changeling named Captain Vron serves as the leader of the Dark Lanterns, with four subordinate knights marshal leading branch offices across Breland, in Sharn, Starilaskur, and Xandrar. A much smaller branch office keeps an eye on Brelish interests in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Small, temporary field offices are sometimes established to coordinate missions outside Breland; these offices double as safe houses for agents in trouble, and they are designed to be wiped clean at a moment's notice if discovered by local authorities.": "国王的城堡位于布雷兰的首都沃鲁特，由国王的弟弟科尔-伊尔'维纳恩勋爵指挥。一位名叫弗隆（Vron）上尉的变种人担任黑暗之灯的首领，四位下属骑士负责领导布雷兰在沙恩、斯塔拉斯库尔和桑德拉的分支办事处。在Xen'drik的Stormreach市，有一个小得多的分支办公室，负责监视布瑞利什的利益。有时也会设立一些小型的、临时的外地办事处，以协调布瑞尔大陆以外的任务；这些办事处同时也是陷入困境的特工的安全屋，如果被当地政府发现，它们可以在第一时间被清除掉。",
	"The Sharn office of the King's Citadel is in Andith Tower in the Ambassador Towers district. Though a knight marshal commands the office, most of the King's Citadel members in Sharn are Dark Lanterns, and thus under the authority of a scheming and ruthless gnome named Talleon Haliar Tonan.": "国王城堡的沙恩办公室位于大使塔区的安迪斯塔内。虽然有一位骑士元帅指挥该办公室，但沙恩的大部分国王城堡成员都是黑暗灯笼，因此受一个名叫塔利昂-哈利亚尔-托南的阴谋家的管辖。",
	"The King's Dark Lanterns includes more than 500 agents operating within Breland's borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad. They often work in teams, and also work closely with the other divisions of the Citadel. Sometimes they recruit local talent, often under false pretenses, to help them accomplish their missions in foreign lands.": "国王的黑暗灯笼包括500多名在布雷兰境内活动的特工，大约有五分之一的特工驻扎在国外。他们经常以团队形式工作，也与城堡的其他部门紧密合作。有时他们会招募当地的人才，通常是以虚假的借口，帮助他们完成在外国的任务。",
	"By their nature, espionage agencies must be cautious in choosing their allies, and the King's Dark Lanterns is no exception. Its most trustworthy allies include the following facets of the Brelish government:": "就其性质而言，间谍机构在选择其盟友时必须谨慎，国王的黑暗灯笼也不例外。它最值得信赖的盟友包括布雷利什政府的以下方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The King's Dark Lanterns, as one would expect, serve the king of Breland, and he is their greatest advocate and ally. The king views loyalty as mutual: as long as an agent's loyalty is irreproachable, Boranel is willing to exercise his considerable power on that agent's behalf.": "{@b King Boranel}. 国王的黑暗灯笼，正如人们所期望的那样，为布雷兰德的国王服务，他是他们最大的支持者和盟友。国王认为忠诚是相互的：只要特工的忠诚是无可指责的，博拉内尔就愿意为该特工行使他的巨大权力。",
	"{@b The King's Citadel}. The Citadel has three branches besides the Dark Lanterns. The King's Swords are elite special combat forces. The King's Shields protect the king and his closest family members and associates. The King's Wands provide magical support to the other branches of the Citadel as well as other Brelish forces. Some Dark Lanterns might think themselves superior to members of the other branches, but even so they recognize other Citadel agents as players on the same team. When your group needs a little extra help, the other branches of the Citadel are there for you.": "{@b The King's Citadel}. 除了黑暗灯笼，城堡还有三个分支。国王之剑是精锐的特种作战部队。国王之盾保护国王和他最亲密的家人和伙伴。国王的魔杖为城堡的其他分支以及其他布雷利什部队提供魔法支持。一些黑灯侠可能会认为自己比其他分支的成员高明，但即便如此，他们也会承认其他城主府特工是同一团队的成员。当你的团队需要一点额外的帮助时，城堡的其他分支就在你身边。",
	"Rare is the espionage agency that is loved. Even within Breland, the populace views the Dark Lanterns with suspicion, and powerful people outside the royal family harbor resentment at the influence of the Citadel. Many people and institutions outside Breland view the Dark Lanterns as a hostile force. As a result, the following groups account for just a few enemies of the Dark Lanterns:": "罕见的是，间谍机构受到了喜爱。即使在布雷兰内部，民众也以怀疑的眼光看待黑暗之灯，而皇室以外的有权势的人则对城堡的影响力怀有怨恨。布雷兰德之外的许多人和机构将黑暗之灯视为一种敌对势力。因此，以下团体只占黑暗之灯的少数敌人。",
	"{@b Brelish Populists}. As much as King Boranel is loved in his country, many Brelish voices argue that the era of monarchy is at an end, and the throne of Breland should be replaced by a government democratically elected by the citizenry. When these forces grow restless enough to plot and riot, the Citadel—and often the Dark Lanterns—work to bring them to heel. As a result, those who question the authority of the king are the most likely Brelish citizens to mistrust the Dark Lanterns or view them with open hostility. According to rumor some of those people even hold high positions in the Brelish government.": "{@b Brelish Populists}. 尽管博拉内尔国王在他的国家里备受爱戴，但许多布雷利什人认为君主制的时代已经结束，布雷兰的王位应该由公民民主选举的政府所取代。当这些势力不安分地策划和骚乱时，城堡--通常是黑暗灯笼--就会努力将他们置于死地。因此，那些质疑国王权威的人是最有可能不信任黑暗灯笼的布雷利什公民，或者对他们抱有公开敌意。据传言，其中一些人甚至在布雷利什政府中担任高级职务。",
	"{@b Foreign Nations}. Every nation knows the King's Dark Lanterns serves as an espionage force and do their best to track the movements of Dark Lantern agents within their borders. Foreign governments treat Dark Lantern agents with care to avoid sparking an international incident, but they are quick to arrest Dark Lantern agents suspected of wrongdoing.": "{@b Foreign Nations}. 每个国家都知道国王的黑暗灯笼作为一支间谍部队，并尽力追踪黑暗灯笼特工在其境内的行动。外国政府谨慎对待黑暗灯笼特工，以避免引发国际事件，但他们会迅速逮捕涉嫌犯错的黑暗灯笼特工。",
	"{@b New Cyre}. One of the world's largest concentrations of Cyran refugees settled in eastern Breland under the leadership of Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last prince of Cyre. Many voices among the Cyrans, possibly including Oargev himself, call for the establishment of an independent nation in what is now Brelish territory, but Boranel is determined to hold on to every acre of his land. The Dark Lanterns actively infiltrate the Cyran refugee community, rooting out those who would act against the king.": "{@b New Cyre}. 世界上最大的赛伦难民集中地之一，在赛尔的最后一位王子Oargev ir'Wynarn的领导下，定居在布瑞尔东部。在赛尔人中有许多声音，可能包括奥格夫本人，呼吁在现在的布雷利什领土上建立一个独立的国家，但博拉内尔决心守住他的每一亩土地。黑暗灯笼积极渗透到锡兰难民社区，将那些反对国王的人连根拔起。",
	"You gain the following benefits when your group's patron is an espionage agency:": "当你的团体的赞助人是一个间谍机构时，你获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your agency might assign you specific tasks at any time, at the DM's discretion. You have wide latitude regarding how you carry out a task, and your assignments can sometimes be very broad and require considerable time to complete.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的机构可能在任何时候给你分配具体的任务，由管理部决定。你在如何执行任务方面有很大的自由度，你的任务有时可能非常广泛，需要相当长的时间来完成。",
	"{@b Expense Account}. You have access to an account maintained at the banks of House Kundarak. You can use this account to pay your daily living expenses, as well as for purchasing anything you need for completing your missions—equipment, transportation, bribes, and so on. Your normal spending limit is 100 gp per month for each member of your group. If you exceed that, your agency asks you to account for the month's expenses, and they might require you to pay back the excess if you can't justify it (at the DM's discretion). You can't carry over an unused amount from one month to the next, and your access to this account can be cut off at any time if you abuse it or fall out of the agency's good graces. The agency is aware of every time you access the account and where you are when you do so.": "{@b Expense Account}. 你可以使用昆达拉克家族银行的一个账户。你可以用这个账户来支付你的日常生活费用，以及购买你完成任务所需的任何东西--设备、交通、贿赂等等。你的正常消费限额是你的小组每个成员每月100戈比。如果你超过了这个限额，你的机构就会要求你说明这个月的开支，如果你不能说明理由，他们可能会要求你偿还超出的部分（由管理员决定）。你不能将未使用的金额从一个月结转到下一个月，而且如果你滥用这个账户或失去了机构的好感，你对这个账户的使用权随时可能被切断。该机构知道你每次进入该账户的情况，以及你这样做时的位置。",
	"{@b Identification}. Your agency provides you with identification papers establishing your true identity, and you also have ready access to false papers and matching travel documents showing different identities, when you need them for a mission. (Any time you enter a foreign nation, it is a good idea for you to do so under a false identity.)": "{@b Identification}. 你的机构为你提供确定你真实身份的身份证件，当你执行任务需要时，你也可以随时获得显示不同身份的假证件和匹配的旅行文件。(任何时候你进入一个外国，用一个假的身份是一个好主意）。",
	"{@b Powerful Friends}. An espionage agency, by nature, has a long reach and a lot of power to make things happen behind the scenes. You can call in a favor for a wide range of benefits: A legal case against you might be suddenly dropped. A rival might disappear. A much-needed magic item might be delivered to you. These favors can provide significant short-term benefit, but they can also come with equally significant long-term repercussions—which might lead to entirely new missions.": "{@b Powerful Friends}. 一个间谍机构，就其性质而言，具有很强的影响力和很大的权力，可以在幕后使事情发生。你可以叫人帮忙，获得广泛的利益。一个针对你的法律案件可能突然被撤销。一个对手可能会消失。一个急需的魔法物品可能会被送到你手中。这些人情可以提供重要的短期利益，但它们也可以带来同样重要的长期影响--这可能会导致全新的任务。",
	"Espionage agents are typically both highly trained and tightly specialized. The type of missions you undertake can shape your group's composition; you might be a team of hunters or investigators, focused on tracking people down or gathering information. More likely, you're a diverse team with a range of skills that allow you undertake a variety of different missions on your patron's behalf. Consider some or all of these roles for the characters in your party:": "间谍人员通常都是训练有素的，而且专业性很强。你所承担的任务类型可以塑造你的团队的组成；你可能是一个猎人或调查员的团队，专注于追踪人或收集信息。更有可能的是，你们是一个多样化的团队，拥有一系列的技能，可以代表你的赞助人承担各种不同的任务。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Chameleon}. A master of disguise, sleight of hand, and deception, the Chameleon can perform the work of the Investigator or a Confiscator right under a target's nose—or provide cover to agents with different specialties as they do their jobs. A high Charisma, proficiency with the disguise kit (or access to spells that cloak or disguise one's appearance), and proficiency with skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Performance}, and {@skill Sleight of Hand} all greatly benefit the Chameleon. Bards and rogues, as well as characters with the charlatan, entertainer, or urchin background, often excel in this role.": "{@b Chameleon}. 变色龙是伪装、诡计和欺骗的大师，他可以在目标的眼皮底下完成调查员或没收者的工作--或者为不同专业的特工在工作中提供掩护。高的魅力、对伪装工具的熟练掌握（或使用能掩盖或伪装自己外表的法术），以及对{@skill Deception}、{@skill Performance}和{@skill Sleight of Hand}等技能的熟练掌握，都对变色龙大有好处。吟游诗人和无赖，以及具有江湖郎中、艺人或顽童背景的人物，往往擅长这个角色。",
	"In a courthouse surrounded by agents of the King's Citadel and thronged by reporters, judge Haliss ir'Cronn took her seat for the first session in what some are calling the \"trial of the century.\"": "在一个被国王城堡的代理人包围并被记者簇拥的法院里，法官Haliss ir'Cronn在一些人称之为 \"世纪审判 \"的第一次会议上就座。",
	"Barath Drinn, a Karrn who has been living in Wroat since the end of the Last War, stands accused of stealing state secrets, sabotage, and one count of murder—though an anonymous source suggests that he is guilty of many more killings.": "巴拉斯-德林（Barath Drinn）是一个自最后一次战争结束后一直居住在沃洛特的卡恩人，他被指控窃取国家机密、进行破坏，并被指控犯有一项谋杀罪--尽管一个匿名消息来源表明，他还犯有许多谋杀罪。",
	"A spokesperson for the King's Citadel vehemently denied reports that Drinn is employed by the Citadel.": "国王城堡的一位发言人坚决否认关于德林受雇于城堡的报道。",
	"{@b Confiscator}. Sometimes an espionage agency needs something stolen—a document that incriminates a public figure to a prototype war machine. The Confiscator has the key skills for such jobs. A good Dexterity score proves helpful in undertaking such tasks, especially if it's enhanced with proficiency with thieves' tools and the {@skill Sleight of Hand} and {@skill Stealth} skills. Confiscators are often rogues, and many have a history of stealing for profit rather than national interest.": "{@b Confiscator}. 有时，一个间谍机构需要一些被盗的东西--将一个公众人物归罪于一个战争机器原型的文件。没收者拥有这种工作的关键技能。一个好的灵巧分数在执行这些任务时是有帮助的，特别是当它被熟练地使用盗贼工具和（1%）和（2%）技能时。没收者通常是流氓，许多人都有为了利润而不是国家利益而偷窃的历史。",
	"{@b Hunter}. The Hunter stalks humanoid prey, for purposes of assassination, abduction, or gathering information. A combination of combat prowess with stealth and interaction skills makes for well-prepared Hunters. Rangers and rogues prove particularly adept at this role, as might anyone with proficiency in the {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} skills. A high Charisma and proficiency in {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion} skills can also be useful. Hunters often come from backgrounds such as outlander or urchin.": "{@b Hunter}. 猎人跟踪类人猎物，以达到暗杀、绑架或收集信息的目的。战斗能力与隐蔽性和互动技能的结合使得猎人准备充分。游侠和流氓特别擅长这个角色，任何精通（1%）、（2%）和（3%）技能的人也是如此。高的魅力和精通（%4%）、（%5%）和（%6%）的技能也是有用的。猎人通常来自外乡人或顽童等背景。",
	"{@b Investigator}. The Investigator is the archetypal spy, a master of deductive reasoning and suave interaction. Naturally, {@skill Investigation} can be a crucial skill, which many characters in this role combine with magical means of scrying to learn about their enemies and objectives. Bards and wizards make natural Investigators, especially if they can acquire one or more skills from among {@skill Deception}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Persuasion}, and {@skill Stealth}. Investigators come from backgrounds as varied as charlatans, nobles, sages, and urchins.": "{@b Investigator}. 调查员是典型的间谍，是演绎推理和风趣互动的大师。当然，{@skill Investigation}可以是一个重要的技能，许多扮演这个角色的人物将其与窥探的魔法手段相结合，以了解他们的敌人和目标。吟游诗人和巫师是天然的调查员，特别是如果他们能从（2%）、（3%）、（4%）和（5%）中获得一个或多个技能。调查员的背景各不相同，有的是江湖郎中，有的是贵族，有的是圣人，有的是顽童。",
	"{@b Operator}. An Operator leads or organizes a team of agents in the field. Like a military officer, the Operator issues orders and bears responsibility for the agents on the team. High Charisma and Intelligence scores help make the Operator a strong leader, especially in conjunction with skill proficiencies such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill Investigation}. The wide array of skills used by other agents are also valuable to the Operator, who might end up stepping into a different role when the need arises. The Operator is often a bard and might come from a soldier or noble background (being accustomed to leadership in one form or another).": "{@b Operator}. 接线员领导或组织一个外勤特工小组。像一个军官一样，接线员发布命令并对团队中的特工负责。高的魅力和智力分数有助于使接线员成为一个强有力的领导者，特别是与技能熟练度相结合，如{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill Investigation}。其他特工使用的各种技能对接线员也很有价值，当需要时，他可能最终会进入一个不同的角色。操作员通常是一个吟游诗人，可能来自士兵或贵族背景（习惯于以某种形式进行领导）。",
	"{@b Saboteur}. The Saboteur interferes with the functioning of enemy assets. More than a reckless bomber, they combine a willingness to destroy with a knack for infiltration. Proficiency with thieves' tools and in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Investigation}, and {@skill Stealth} often serve the work of sabotage. The Saboteur benefits from an understanding of craft and magic items, making artificers particularly skilled in this role. Guild artisans might also disguise tools of destruction as mundane objects or works of art. Many Saboteurs come from backgrounds such as charlatans or soldiers.": "{@b Saboteur}. 破坏者干扰敌方资产的运作。比起鲁莽的轰炸机，他们把破坏的意愿和渗透的技巧结合起来。熟练掌握盗贼工具和技能，如(1%)、(2%)和(3%)，常常为破坏工作服务。破坏者得益于对工艺和魔法物品的理解，使工匠们在这个角色中特别熟练。行会的工匠们也可能将破坏工具伪装成世俗物品或艺术品。许多破坏者的背景是江湖术士或士兵。",
	"Espionage activities can be classified in three broad categories: counterintelligence, covert action, and intelligence gathering.

As a group, work with your DM and consult the Espionage Missions table to decide what kinds of missions you might undertake.": "间谍活动可分为三大类：反间谍、秘密行动和情报收集。你的队伍可能专注于其中一个领域，或者你是处理其他队伍所搞砸的情况的队伍。作为一个团体，与你的管理人合作，并参考间谍任务表，以决定你可能承担的任务类型。",

Consult the Memorable Mission table to determine the details of your career-defining exploit.": "你从事的任务至今仍给你的工作蒙上了阴影。那是一次完美的行动，还是你仍然带着因任务出错而留下的伤痕？请参考 \"难忘的任务 \"表，以确定你那决定职业生涯的任务细节。",

Oargev has not forgotten that kindness, and he would prefer not to jeopardize his friendship with Boranel by seizing land from Breland.

They tend to treat Cyran refugees as second-class citizens and vagabonds. Among non-Cyran communities, agents of Prince Oargev can't rely on aid from any of Cyre's former enemies.": "{@b The Five Nations}. 昂代尔人、卡伦人和瑟兰人一般都不同情流离失所的赛兰人的困境。他们中的许多人痛苦地承受着战争的伤痛，他们的怨恨被暴力的赛伦极端分子的行为所强化。即使是布雷利什人，尽管他们一直表现得很冷漠，但在面对赛伦人时也变得小心翼翼，因为赛伦人是他们的领导人强加给他们的负担。他们倾向于将居里安人难民视为二等公民和流浪者。在非居里安社区中，欧格夫王子的代理人不能依靠任何居里安的前敌人的援助。",
	"{@b The Lord of Blades.} In the depths of the Mournland, the closest thing to a sovereign is {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}—a heavily enhanced warforged who seeks vengeance against those who created his people to serve as weapons. He is hostile to adventurers who enter the Mournland on missions of plunder, and the idea of Prince Oargev reclaiming the Mournland fills him with fury. He shows Oargev's agents no mercy.": "{@b The Lord of Blades.}在哀伤之地的深处，最接近君主的东西是{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}--一个重度强化的战争锻造者，他要向那些创造他的人民作为武器的人复仇。他对进入哀牢地执行掠夺任务的冒险者充满敌意，而奥格夫王子夺回哀牢地的想法让他充满愤怒。他对Oargev的代理人毫不留情。",
	"With a head of state as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有国家元首作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"Prince Oargev, the exiled Cyran royal who governs the town of New Cyre by the sufferance of King Boranel, is planning a brazen act of secession, hoping to transform all of eastern Breland into a new Cyran realm, sources say. According to a group of adventurers recently employed by Oargev, the prince sent them into the Mournland to recover weapons of war so they could be wielded against the Brelish military during the secession. How will King Boranel respond to this treachery? Will the nations come to the defense of the displaced prince? Will Oargev's scheming result in all of eastern Breland being swathed in the same gray mist that consumed Cyre?": "Oargev王子，被流放的Cyran王族，在Boranel国王的容忍下管理着New Cyre镇，正在计划一个厚颜无耻的分离行为，希望把整个东部Breland变成一个新的Cyran王国，消息来源说。根据奥格夫最近雇佣的一群冒险家的说法，王子派他们进入哀伤之地找回战争武器，以便在分离期间可以用来对付布雷利什的军队。博拉内尔国王将如何应对这种背叛行为？各国会不会来保卫这个流离失所的王子？奥格夫的阴谋是否会导致整个布瑞尔东部被笼罩在吞噬赛尔的灰雾中？",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your work is performed at the direction of your patron. That means you are usually under assignment and not entirely free to choose your own course. Depending on the ruler and the task, these assignments can be directive or more hands-off, as you pursue long-term goals.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的工作是在你的赞助人的指导下进行的。这意味着你通常要接受任务，不能完全自由地选择自己的路线。根据统治者和任务的不同，这些任务可以是指令性的，也可以是更多的放手，因为你要追求长期的目标。",
	"{@b Expenses}. In addition to your salary, your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and might be called on to explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and most services don't draw a second glance.": "{@b Expenses}. 除了你的工资，你的赞助人还报销你在工作中发生的特殊费用。你被要求说明你的开支，并可能被要求解释任何特殊开支，但日常旅行、普通设备和大多数服务不会引起人们的注意。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As long as you remain in the head of state's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws of your home country. Committing serious crimes—especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the work you've been assigned—is a good way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. When you are carrying out your orders within your nation's borders, though, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to do that, and the law isn't an obstacle. (However, note that agents of Prince Oargev can't necessarily expect the same clemency in Breland outside of New Cyre.)": "{@b Immunity}. 只要你保持在国家元首的好感中，你就几乎不会受到本国法律的起诉。然而，犯下严重的罪行--特别是如果这些罪行与你被指派的工作无关或没有必要--是失去你的赞助人的好感的一个好办法。不过，当你在你的国家边界内执行你的命令时，你有很大的余地来选择如何做，而法律并不是一个障碍。(然而，请注意，在新赛尔之外的布雷兰，奥格夫王子的代理人不一定能指望得到同样的宽恕）。",
	"{@b Salary}. Your employment for a head of state brings you an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary might increase or decrease depending on which particular head of state you work for, the nature of your work, and the length of your employment.": "{@b Salary}. 你为国家元首工作给你带来了每天1戈比的收入，或者说足以维持一个适度的生活。根据DM的决定，你的工资可能会增加或减少，这取决于你为哪个特定的国家元首工作，你的工作性质，以及你工作的时间。",
	"A head of state like Prince Oargev requires a variety of adventurers to do the range of tasks they require. Depending on the kinds of work you do, your party might include some or all of these roles:": "像Oargev王子这样的国家元首需要各种冒险者来完成他们所需要的一系列任务。根据你的工作种类，你的队伍可能包括这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Civil Servant}. The vast majority of work performed on behalf of a head of state has very little to do with deadly adventure: it's about prosecuting and judging criminals in the courts of law, hearing the petitions and complaints of citizens, collecting taxes, and interminable amounts of paperwork. Once in a while, though, a faithful Civil Servant gets forcefully pulled from this work and thrust into life-or-death situations, with or without help from more hardened adventurers. The knowledge and experience of a Civil Servant can often be useful, with some developing skills as clerics, rogues, wizards, or other classes. Such characters often come from the sage background and have proficiency in skills that reflect their studies, such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Civil Servant}. 代表国家元首进行的绝大多数工作与致命的冒险关系不大：它是关于在法庭上起诉和审判罪犯，听取公民的请愿和投诉，收税，以及无休止的文书工作。不过，偶尔也会有忠实的公务员被强行从这项工作中拉出来，并被推入生死攸关的境地，不管有没有更强硬的冒险者的帮助。公务员的知识和经验往往是有用的，有些人可以发展为牧师、流氓、巫师或其他类别的技能。这样的角色通常来自于圣人背景，并拥有反映其研究的技能，如（1%）、（2%）、（3%）和（4%）的熟练度。",
	"{@b Diplomat}. Negotiating treaties, de-escalating conflicts, and issuing ultimatums are tasks that fall within the purview of the Diplomat, who typically puts their high Charisma to work in the service of the state. These characters often come from a noble background and bring proficiency in skills such as {@skill Intimidation} and {@skill Persuasion} to their work. Bards are natural fits in this role, as are paladins—as long as they aren't asked to do things that violate the tenets of their oaths.": "{@b Diplomat}. 谈判条约、缓和冲突和发布最后通牒都属于外交官的工作范围，他们通常将自己的高魅力投入到为国家服务的工作中。这些角色通常来自于贵族背景，并在他们的工作中带来熟练的技能，如（1%）和（2%）。吟游诗人是这个角色的自然人选，圣骑士也是如此--只要他们不被要求做违反其誓言的事情。",
	"{@b Marshal}. Combat is the specialty of the Marshal, who focuses on enforcing the law of the land and bringing fugitives to justice. Fighters and paladins make natural Marshals, many being former soldiers who continue fighting the Last War in different venues. They often have reasonable Intelligence scores or proficiency in {@skill Investigation}.": "{@b Marshal}. 战斗是元帅的专长，他专注于执行国家的法律并将逃犯绳之以法。战士和圣骑士是天然的元帅，许多人是前士兵，他们在不同的地方继续为最后的战争而战。他们通常有合理的智力分数或精通（%1%）。",
	"{@b Warden}. The Warden's focus isn't so much on the people of the nation, but on the land encompassed within its borders, both cultivated and wild. Sometimes that extends to protecting the border from incursions, but more often a Warden contend with monstrosities and wild beasts that threaten the populace, magical corruption that harms the land, and disasters jeopardizing the nation as a whole. Wardens are often rangers or druids, with proficiency in {@skill Nature} and {@skill Perception}. They might come from backgrounds as outlanders or hermits, making them more comfortable in the wilds than in cities or royal courts.": "{@b Warden}. 典狱长的工作重点不在于国家的人民，而在于其边界内的土地，包括耕地和荒地。有时，他们会保护边界不被入侵，但更多的时候，典狱长要与威胁民众的怪兽和野兽、危害土地的魔法腐败以及危害整个国家的灾难作斗争。典狱长通常是游侠或德鲁伊，精通（1%）和（2%）。他们可能来自外乡人或隐士的背景，这使得他们在荒野中比在城市或王室法庭中更加自如。",
	"Sometimes there's a fine line between the missions assigned by a head of state and those of an espionage agency or a military force, but your team's central focus is politics. As a group, consult the Cyran Affairs table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of adventures you undertake on behalf of Prince Oargev. The Heads of State table at the end of the section offers additional options for leaders who might make appealing patrons.": "有时，国家元首指派的任务与间谍机构或军事力量的任务之间存在着细微的差别，但你的团队的核心重点是政治。作为一个团队，请参考锡兰事务表，并与你的DM合作，决定你代表奥格夫王子进行什么样的冒险。本节末尾的国家元首表为那些可能成为吸引人的赞助人的领导人提供了额外的选择。",
	"Convince nations to recognize Oargev as a sovereign": "说服各国承认Oargev是一个主权国家",
	"Work diplomatically to secure land for a Cyran nation": "通过外交途径为锡兰国家争取土地",
	"Track down agents and infiltrators from other nations who are acting against New Cyre's interests": "追踪来自其他国家的有损新赛尔利益的特工和渗透者。",

	"Aid Cyran refugees in Breland and elsewhere": "援助在布雷兰德和其他地方的赛伦难民",
	"Make incriminating or embarrassing evidence about the prince quietly disappear": "让有关王子的罪证或令人尴尬的证据悄然消失",
	"Heads of state employ a variety of agents. Some are officially recognized, but others are expected to operate on the borders of legality. Consult the State Status table to determine the nature of your group's work": "国家元首雇用各种代理人。有些是官方承认的，但其他的则是要在合法的边界上运作。请参考国家地位表以确定你的团体的工作性质",
	"{@b Official}. You hold an official position and are recognized as attached to your patron. You can expect the head of state's support, but you must also ensure your actions avoid staining your patron's reputation.": "{@b Official}. 你拥有一个官方职位，并被公认为依附于你的赞助人。你可以期待国家元首的支持，但你也必须确保你的行为避免玷污你赞助人的声誉。",
	"{@b Shadow}. You can expect no official, public recognition of your work, but the head of state you work for does acknowledge you in private and provide help.": "{@b Shadow}. 你可以期望你的工作没有得到官方的、公开的承认，但你工作的国家元首确实在私下里承认你，并提供帮助。",
	"{@b Double}. Your allegiance lies with an official or government other than the one you overtly serve. You may receive support from the head of state you openly answer follow, as well as the official you secretly report to, but must remain on constant guard against having your true loyalties revealed.": "{@b Double}. 你的效忠对象是你公开服务的官员或政府以外的人。你可能会得到你公开效忠的国家元首的支持，以及你秘密报告的官员的支持，但你必须时刻保持警惕，防止你的真实忠诚度被暴露。",
	"Often, your connection to your patron is quite direct—the head of state summons you, grants you an audience, and gives you an assignment or hears your report. Heads of state are busy people, though, and if your business isn't pressing, you might be handled by a functionary of the court. The State Contacts table provides several options for what functionaries your group might work with when the head of state is indisposed.": "通常情况下，你与你的赞助人的联系是非常直接的--国家元首召唤你，准许你觐见，给你一个任务或听取你的报告。不过，国家元首都是大忙人，如果你的事情不急，你可能会被法院的一个官员处理。国家联系表提供了几个选项，当国家元首不在时，你的团体可以与哪些职能部门合作。",
	"A disapproving courtier who finds your extrajudicial work highly distasteful": "一个不赞成的朝臣认为你的法外工作非常令人讨厌",
	"A fawning sycophant who figures you are the best path to the head of state's good graces": "一个认为你是获得国家元首好感的最佳途径的献媚者。",
	"A wide-eyed bureaucrat who dreams of living a life as exciting and dangerous as yours": "一个眼界开阔的官僚，梦想着过上像你一样刺激和危险的生活",

	"The Heads of State table offers suggestions for the kind of work you might do for other national leaders in Khorvaire, if Prince Oargev isn't your patron.": "国家元首表为你在霍尔韦尔为其他国家领导人所做的工作提供了建议，如果Oargev王子不是你的赞助人。",

	"A mysterious figure who appears in lofty myths and children's fables, Sora Kell extends her reach across the world and through the myriad planes, claiming mystical knowledge by force and cunning. A mighty wizard with magic worthy of epic tales, she is a monster whose adamantine claws can flense whole armies before any soldier can land a blow on her plated hide. Tales of Sora Kell claim she is the first night hag, born from Khyber in the first age of the world alongside the ancient rakshasas. Some even claim that her daughters—the hags who rule Droaam—are either direct agents of her will or have trapped her and pursue their own goals.": "作为一个出现在崇高的神话和儿童寓言中的神秘人物，索拉-凯尔将她的触角伸向了整个世界和无数个星球，通过武力和狡猾来索取神秘的知识。她是一个强大的巫师，拥有堪比史诗故事的魔法，她是一个怪物，其金刚般的爪子可以在任何士兵对她的镀金皮进行打击之前就把整支军队打散。关于索拉-凯尔的故事声称她是第一个夜行者，在世界的第一个时代从开伯尔出生，与古老的罗刹人一起。有些人甚至声称她的女儿们--统治Droaam的女巫--要么是她意志的直接代理人，要么是困住了她并追求自己的目标。",
	"One fact is indisputable: Sora Kell is an immortal being who employs mortals to do her bidding. In exchange, she trades lore from her boundless stores of magic items, racks of scrolls, libraries of ancient spells, maps of forgotten ruins, and tomes unveiling the mysteries of the multiverse, which she has secreted away in caches across the planes.": "有一个事实是毋庸置疑的。索拉-凯尔是一个雇佣凡人为她服务的不朽生命。作为交换，她从她无边无际的魔法物品仓库、卷轴架、古代法术图书馆、被遗忘的废墟地图以及揭开多元宇宙之谜的书籍中交换传说，她把这些东西藏在各个星球的仓库里。",
	"Unlike some other immortal patrons, Sora Kell's physical form has not been seen on Eberron for over a century. Perhaps she has set a task before her daughters and watches events unfold. Maybe she is trapped upon another plane of existence or is devising magic that could shake the foundations of existence. In any case, she appears in the dreams of her agents, or occasionally uses magical means to communicate, sometimes directly, other times through sinister omens.": "与其他一些不朽的守护者不同，索拉-凯尔的身体形态已经有一个多世纪没有在Eberron出现了。也许她在她的女儿们面前布置了一个任务，并看着事件的发展。也许她被困在另一个存在平面上，或者正在设计可以动摇存在根基的魔法。在任何情况下，她都会出现在她的代理人的梦中，或者偶尔使用魔法手段进行交流，有时是直接交流，有时是通过险恶的预兆。",
	"As a creature of legend, Sora Kell can hardly be said to have allies, except for a handful of other legends like the following groups:": "作为传说中的生物，索拉-凯尔很难说有盟友，除了少数其他传说中的人，如以下团体。",
	"{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.} Sora Kell's three daughters—the gifted oracle Sora Teraza, the cunning trickster Sora Katra, and the vicious monster Sora Maenya—rule the nation of Droaam, either to facilitate their own scheming or at their mother's command. Adventurers who enjoy the patronage of Sora Kell can impose on her daughters for aid if they should ever find themselves in or near Droaam. They can also count on the aid of Daask, a criminal gang in Sharn, which is controlled by Sora Katra.": "{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.}索拉-凯尔的三个女儿--有天赋的神谕者索拉-泰拉扎、狡猾的诡计家索拉-卡特拉和邪恶的怪物索拉-梅尼亚--统治着德罗阿姆国家，或是为了方便她们自己的阴谋，或是听从她们母亲的命令。享有索拉-凯尔赞助的冒险家们如果发现自己在德罗阿姆或附近，可以向她的女儿们寻求援助。他们也可以指望达斯克的援助，达斯克是沙恩的一个犯罪团伙，由索拉-卡特拉控制。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Ancient fiends number among Sora Kell's allies—not the least of which are her daughters' three long-forgotten fathers. It isn't for Sora Kell's pawns to know which of the powerful villains are friendly to Sora Kell, but she occasionally sends adventurers to lend aid to rakshasas—often lesser fiends working to free the ancient overlords. Wise adventurers carefully weigh the rewards of working with such fiends against the costs—to themselves and the world.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 在索拉-凯尔的盟友中，古老的恶魔很多--其中最重要的是她女儿的三个早已被遗忘的父亲。索拉-凯尔的卒子不知道哪些强大的恶棍对索拉-凯尔是友好的，但她偶尔会派冒险者向拉卡萨斯提供援助--通常是那些致力于解放古代霸主的较小的恶魔。明智的冒险者会仔细权衡与这些恶魔合作的回报与他们自己和世界的代价。",
	"Like most immortal beings, Sora Kell has many enemies, though the mortal ones barely merit her attention. For the most part, only beings like those that follow dare oppose Sora Kell:": "像大多数不朽的生命一样，索拉-凯尔有许多敌人，尽管凡人几乎不值得她注意。在大多数情况下，只有像后面那些人一样的生命才敢反对索拉-凯尔。",
	"{@b The Dreaming Dark}. In Sora Kell's estimation, the greatest threat to her are the quori of Dal Quor, and their minions, the Dreaming Dark. Fortunately for the adventurers that serve Sora Kell, few mortals register as worthy foes in the alien minds of the quori.": "{@b The Dreaming Dark}. 在索拉-凯尔的估计中，对她最大的威胁是达尔-库尔的科里，以及他们的爪牙--梦中的黑暗。对于为索拉-凯尔服务的冒险者来说，幸运的是，在奎里人的外星思维中，很少有凡人能成为值得尊敬的敌人。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Sora Kell has allies among the Lords of Dust, but she also has bitter rivals. Like the quori, these fiends rarely pay much attention to Sora Kell's mortal minions, but they aren't above harming mortal adventurers just to spite her.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 索拉-凯尔在尘土领主中拥有盟友，但她也有激烈的对手。像科里一样，这些恶魔很少关注索拉-凯尔的凡人爪牙，但他们也不排除为了报复她而伤害凡人冒险者。",
	"The patronage of an immortal being is a relationship built on favors, not on employment or service. Your group does favors for your patron, and you can ask favors in return. These favors are the benefits you gain for having an immortal being as your group's patron, and they might include any of the following boons:": "不朽者的赞助是一种建立在恩惠上的关系，而不是雇佣或服务。你的团体为你的赞助人提供帮助，而你可以要求对方提供帮助作为回报。这些恩惠是你获得的好处，因为有一个不朽的生命作为你的团体的赞助人，它们可能包括以下任何一种好处。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Your group is almost certainly not the only one sponsored by your patron. Plans that span the world and the course of millennia require many agents to complete. If necessary, your patron can put you in contact with their other agents, who might be in a position to help you through status, influence, or magic.": "{@b Contacts}. 你的团体几乎肯定不是你的赞助人所赞助的唯一团体。跨越世界和千年的计划需要许多代理人来完成。如果有必要，你的赞助人可以让你与他们的其他代理人取得联系，他们可能会通过地位、影响或魔法来帮助你。",
	"{@b Information}. The most precious reward most immortals can give is a tidbit of their ages-spanning knowledge. Immortal beings often know secrets hidden from most mortals—including glimpses of possible futures. They don't usually share secrets freely, but they might reward your group for the completion of a mission with a hint, a puzzle, or a morsel of information that sets you off in pursuit of more.": "{@b Information}. 大多数不朽者能给予的最珍贵的奖赏是他们跨越时代的知识的一个小插曲。不朽的生命往往知道大多数凡人所不知道的秘密--包括对可能的未来的一瞥。他们通常不会随意分享秘密，但他们可能会在你的团队完成任务后给你一个提示，一个谜题，或者一个信息，让你去追求更多的东西。",
	"{@b Magic}. Immortal beings often have access to vast stores of magic, including their own spells and secret caches of magic items. They are mindful of the value of this magic, and grant spells and items as rewards appropriate to the favor and the power of the adventurers.": "{@b Magic}. 不朽的生命通常可以获得大量的魔法储存，包括他们自己的法术和秘密藏匿的魔法物品。他们注意到这些魔法的价值，并给予法术和物品作为与冒险者的恩惠和力量相适应的奖励。",
	"Though it is not a sentient force that can control or reward your party, the Draconic Prophecy can be similar to an Immortal Being patron. The Prophecy can act as a guide for adventurers who seek to fulfill it—or to steer its fulfillment in a particular direction. You stand among the heroes of the present age; surely you have a role to play in the unfolding prophecy.": "虽然它不是一种可以控制或奖励你的队伍的有生命的力量，但德拉贡的预言可以类似于不朽的存在的守护者。预言可以作为寻求实现它的冒险者的向导--或者将它的实现引向一个特定的方向。你站在当今时代的英雄之中；你肯定能在正在展开的预言中扮演一个角色。",
	"In order for the Draconic Prophecy to work as a patron, one or more of the characters needs to have access to words from the Prophecy. Your group might adventure to seek out places where the Prophecy is written: mountainsides and cavern walls, ancient text and crumbling ruins, or the patterns of moons, stars, and the Ring of Siberys (best interpreted at an observatory). A dragonmarked character might gain insight into the Prophecy from the marks on their skin. Alternatively, a character might hear words from the Prophecy in dreams or visions, or surfacing from some deeply buried memory of a traumatic event.": "为了让《德拉贡预言》作为守护者发挥作用，一个或多个角色需要接触到预言中的文字。你的团队可以冒险去寻找写有预言的地方：山坡和洞壁、古老的文字和摇摇欲坠的废墟，或者月亮、星星和西伯利亚之环的图案（最好在天文台解释）。一个有龙纹的角色可能从他们皮肤上的印记中获得对预言的洞察力。另外，一个角色可能会在梦境或幻觉中听到预言的话语，或者从某个深埋的创伤性事件的记忆中浮现出来。",
	"Given access to the words of the Prophecy, it's up to the characters to decide what they mean. The Prophecy is notoriously difficult to interpret, and a given passage might be fulfilled in different ways (or, possibly, in multiple ways over the course of centuries). For example, take a prophetic snippet like the one mentioned in the book's introduction: \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" This might mean that if King Boranel of Breland is killed in the Mournland, the kingdom of Breland will be dissolved, and if dissolving the monarchy is the characters' goal, they can try to bring about those circumstances. On the other hand, it could mean that if an awakened bear in the Eldeen Reaches declares himself king of the forest, and if the bear is killed on the anniversary of the Mourning, the tallest tree in the domain he claimed (the Crown of his nation) will fall. If that is the characters' goal, for whatever reason, they might try to bring those circumstances about.": "在获得了预言的话语后，就由人物来决定它们的含义。预言是出了名的难以解释，某段话可能会以不同的方式实现（或者，可能是在几个世纪的时间里以多种方式实现）。例如，就拿该书导言中提到的一个预言片段来说吧。\"如果熊王在哀伤的阴影中被一个悲伤的刺客杀死，王冠将从他的国家中掉落。\" 这可能意味着，如果布雷兰国王博拉内尔在哀伤之影中被杀，布雷兰王国将被解散，如果解散君主制是人物的目标，他们可以尝试促成这些情况的发生。另一方面，这可能意味着，如果一只在Eldeen Reaches觉醒的熊宣布自己是森林之王，如果这只熊在哀伤纪念日被杀，他所宣称的领域中最高的树（他的国家的王冠）将会倒下。如果这是人物的目标，无论出于什么原因，他们可能会试图使这些情况发生。",
	"The currency of favors that defines most patronage relationships is tricky when your group's patron is a series of vague oracular verses rather than a person. However, bringing about the fulfillment of the Prophecy in a certain way often has immediate or long-term benefits that are equivalent to the favors another patron might grant your group. Toppling the Crown in the Bear King's domain might give you access to a spell inscribed in the ancient tree's rings, for example.": "当你的团体的赞助人是一系列模糊的神谕诗句而不是一个人时，定义大多数赞助关系的恩惠货币就很棘手。然而，以某种方式实现预言往往会带来直接或长期的好处，这些好处相当于另一个赞助人可能给予你的团体的恩惠。例如，推翻熊王领域的王冠可能会让你获得刻在古树年轮上的咒语。",
	"No common thread unites adventurers with an immortal patron, except perhaps uncommon openness to the mysterious and unknown. You haven't been chosen because of your capabilities; they might have been chosen to fulfill the words of a prophecy, because they were born at auspicious times and places, or because they happened to be in a particular place at a certain time. Individual characters in your group might have different relationships with your patron, though; consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "没有任何共同的线索将冒险者与不朽的守护者联系在一起，也许只有对神秘和未知的不寻常的开放。你被选中并不是因为你的能力；他们被选中可能是为了实现一个预言，因为他们出生在吉祥的时间和地点，或者因为他们碰巧在某个时间出现在某个特定的地方。不过，你的小组中的个别角色可能与你的赞助人有不同的关系；为你的角色考虑一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Agent}. The Agent doesn't receive direct communications from an immortal patron, but puts faith in the dreams and inspiration of others, following such omens with an eager heart. This character is under no illusions of having a special role to play in the immortal's grand plans, but is ready to make sure those with such roles play them. This is often a character with no magical ability or sometimes from a scholarly background, such as a sage or hermit—perhaps someone familiar with lore about the immortal but not directly inspired by it. Agents typically have proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Agent}. 代理人不接受来自不朽的赞助人的直接沟通，但对其他人的梦想和灵感抱有信心，以热切的心关注这些预兆。这个角色不幻想在不朽者的宏伟计划中扮演特殊的角色，但准备确保那些有这种角色的人扮演他们。这通常是一个没有魔法能力的角色，或者有时来自学术背景，如圣人或隐士--也许是一个熟悉关于不朽者的传说但没有直接受到启发的人。代理人通常有熟练的技能，如（1%）、（2%）和（3%）。",
	"{@b Innocent}. Some characters have no intention of becoming adventurers and desire no connection to the machinations of the immortals, but they get caught up in schemes and prophecies anyway. The Innocent might have been identified as a key part of a prophecy, or made what seemed like an innocent bargain with a harmless old hermit, or found an artifact with mysterious powers. The folk hero background is ideal for the Innocent, combining humble origins with a sense of destiny. Any class or proficiencies are suited for this role.": "{@b Innocent}. 有些角色无意成为冒险家，也不希望与不朽者的阴谋有任何联系，但他们还是被卷入了阴谋和预言中。无辜者可能已经被确定为预言的关键部分，或者与一个无害的老隐士做了一个看似无辜的交易，或者发现了一个具有神秘力量的文物。民间英雄的背景是无罪者的理想选择，将卑微的出身与命运感结合起来。任何等级或能力都适合这个角色。",
	"{@b Visionary}. At least one character in the party should have a particular connection to your immortal patron. The Visionary might hear the patron's voice in dreams, see waking visions that convey the immortal's will, or interpret signs in accordance with prophecy. Different backgrounds might suggest different stories for a Visionary: An acolyte might have had a revelatory experience that paved the way for the immortal's communications. A hermit might have been plagued by disturbing dreams from youth. A sage might have made a lifetime study of the Draconic Prophecy. These characters are often clerics, druids, warlocks, or wizards, and typically proficient in skills such as {@skill Arcana} and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Visionary}. 队伍中至少有一个角色应该与你的不朽守护者有特殊联系。幻象师可能会在梦中听到守护者的声音，在清醒时看到传达不朽者意志的幻象，或者根据预言解释征兆。不同的背景可能会给幻象师带来不同的故事。一个圣徒可能有一个启示性的经历，为神仙的沟通铺平了道路。一个隐士可能从年轻时就被令人不安的梦境所困扰。一个圣人可能一生都在研究龙族的预言。这些角色通常是牧师、德鲁伊、术士或巫师，通常精通（1%）和（2%）等技能。",
	"The tasks you perform for your immortal patron can be mysterious, even trivial seeming, but they always have implications within the immortal's larger plans. Often it's hard to tell what those implications might be—and stumbling upon hints of an immortal's broader agenda might prove frightening. Your tasks could involve fulfilling prophecies in deliberate ways, preventing prophesied events from coming to pass, or even engaging in seemingly random actions that further designs invisible to mortal eyes. Immortal beings might send you on all manner of adventures, such as those shown on the Immortal Missions table.": "你为你的不朽守护者执行的任务可能是神秘的，甚至是看起来微不足道的，但它们总是在不朽者的更大计划中产生影响。通常很难说这些影响是什么--偶然发现不朽者更广泛的议程的暗示可能会被证明是可怕的。你的任务可能涉及以故意的方式实现预言，阻止预言事件的发生，或者甚至参与看似随机的行动，以推进凡人眼中看不见的设计。不朽的生命可能会派你进行各种形式的冒险，比如不朽的任务表上显示的那些。",

	"Protect a kalashtar monk who is being targeted by Dreaming Dark assassins as she studies a path that might eventually prevent the quori from projecting themselves into the Material Plane.": "保护一个被梦境中的黑暗刺客盯上的卡拉斯塔僧侣，因为她正在研究一条可能最终阻止奎里人投射到物质界的道路。",
	"Immortal beings sometimes use mortal intermediaries to contact their agents, but most of them possess magic powerful enough to communicate with you directly, even over impossible distances. Consult the Immortal Communication table to determine what mysterious method your patron uses to direct your party.": "不朽的生命有时会使用凡人的中介来联系他们的代理人，但他们中的大多数拥有强大的魔法，足以直接与你沟通，甚至在不可能的距离上。请参考不朽者交流表，以确定你的赞助人用什么神秘的方法来指导你的队伍。",

	"Various immortal beings exert their will upon the people and nations of Eberron. Many are villainous forces that adventurers might find themselves resisting, such as the fiends of the Lords of Dust or the Quori and the Dreaming Dark. Even those without evil motives are often inscrutable—the agendas of immortal beings spanning millennia. What role you might play in an immortal's schemes and what sorts of deeds you'll be called on to perform varies from patron to patron. Consider the following options when determining what immortal patron your party might serve:": "各种不朽的存在对艾伯伦的人民和国家施加他们的意志。很多都是冒险者可能会发现自己在抵抗的邪恶势力，比如尘埃领主的恶魔或科里和梦境的黑暗。即使是那些没有邪恶动机的人，也往往是难以捉摸的--不朽的生命的议程跨越了几千年的时间。你在不朽者的计划中可能扮演什么样的角色，以及你会被召唤去做什么样的事，因赞助人而异。在决定你的队伍可能为哪个不朽的守护者服务时，请考虑以下选项。",
	"{@b Flamewind}. A gynosphinx with oracular powers came back to Morgrave University with a Xen'drik expedition two years ago, and took up residence there. In addition to her first-hand knowledge of Xen'drik, she is one of the few nondragons to have made extensive study of the Draconic Prophecy. She sometimes sends adventurers on missions by uttering a cryptic prophecy. \"It is time for the Globe of Seven Lights to be brought out of Xen'drik,\" she might say. She never explains her proclamations, and never provides information on mundane affairs.": "{@b Flamewind}. 两年前，一个拥有神力的雌性动物随Xen'drik探险队回到了莫格莱夫大学，并在那里居住下来。除了对Xen'drik的第一手资料外，她还是少数对Draconic预言进行过广泛研究的非龙人之一。她有时会通过说出一个神秘的预言来派遣冒险者执行任务。她可能会说：\"现在是把七彩光球带出Xen'drik的时候了\"。她从不解释她的预言，也不提供有关世俗事务的信息。",
	"{@b Faerie Court}. Somewhere deep in the western forest of the Eldeen Reaches lies the Twilight Demesne, where powerful archfey hold court over an ongoing revelry. It often appears as if nothing more than mischief and caprice governs the actions of the archfey, but they have ancient interests in the mortal world—as well as extensive rivalries among themselves.": "{@b Faerie Court}. 在Eldeen Reaches西部森林深处的某个地方，有一个暮光之城，在那里，强大的大法师们正在举行狂欢。看起来似乎只有恶作剧和任性才能支配大法官的行动，但他们在凡人世界有古老的利益，以及他们之间广泛的竞争。",
	"{@b Undying Court}. The honored, undead ancestors of Aerenal rule the elven nation and shape their people's destiny. These undead—known as deathless—despise evil undead, nurture an ancient grudge against dragons, and pursue the fulfillment of ancient prophecies.": "{@b Undying Court}. 阿伦纳尔尊贵的亡灵祖先统治着精灵国度，塑造着他们的人民的命运。这些被称为 \"无死神 \"的亡灵憎恨邪恶的亡灵，对龙怀有古老的怨恨，并追求古代预言的实现。",
	"Your party works for an agency offering investigative services, or you might run your own firm as a group. Inquisitives put their keen minds and dogged determination to use unraveling mysteries. Inquisitive agencies run the gamut from private investigators to networks of detectives supported by dragonmarked houses.": "你们一行人在一个提供调查服务的机构工作，或者你们可能作为一个团体经营自己的公司。探究者将他们敏锐的头脑和坚定的决心用于揭开谜团。调查机构的范围很广，从私人调查员到由龙纹屋支持的侦探网络。",
	"Across Khorvaire, the inquisitives of House Tharashk have a reputation for discretion and cunning. Members of that house operate the Finders Guild, a loose collection of independent inquisitive agencies. Dragonmarked heirs of House Tharashk own and operate some of these agencies, but each employs unmarked inquisitives as well, leaving the heirs free to take on the most difficult cases. A connection with the Finders Guild is viewed as a mark of high quality, a guarantee that a particular agency numbers among the best in the business.": "在整个Khorvaire，Tharashk家族的调查员以谨慎和狡猾著称。该家族的成员经营着 \"发现者协会\"，这是一个独立调查机构的松散集合。塔拉什克家族的龙纹继承人拥有并经营其中一些机构，但每个机构也都雇佣了无纹章的审问者，让继承人自由地处理最棘手的案件。与探索者协会的联系被视为高质量的标志，是对某一机构在业务上名列前茅的保证。",
	"In the city of Sharn alone, four inquisitives with the Mark of Finding lead agencies in different parts of the city: Kurt Karr'Aashta's Investigations in the neighborhood of Deathsgate, Information Acquisition in Underlook, Thuranne Velderan's Investigative Services in Warden Towers, and Globe Information Agency in Dragon Towers. Your party might be associated with any of these groups, or you might operate your own affiliated agency. In any case, your connection to the Finders Guild means you have a sterling reputation to uphold.": "仅仅在沙恩市，就有四位拥有 \"寻找标记 \"的调查员在城市的不同地区领导机构。Kurt Karr'Aashta的调查公司在死亡之门附近，信息获取公司在Underlook，Thuranne Velderan的调查公司在Warden Towers，以及Globe Information Agency在Dragon Towers。你的政党可能与这些团体中的任何一个有关联，或者你可能经营你自己的附属机构。在任何情况下，你与寻找者协会的联系意味着你有一个良好的声誉需要维护。",
	"In yet another embarrassing blow to the Fairhaven Watch, renowned inquisitive \"Feather\" Fallester has apparently solved yet another case she randomly pulled from the watch's files of unsolved mysteries. The case—the theft of a bejeweled statuette on display in the University of Wynarn Museum of Antiquities—baffled watch officers seven years ago, but in a matter of five days, Fallester managed to pin the crime on a changeling thief called Spaut, who has confessed.": "在费尔黑文表的又一次尴尬打击中，著名的好奇心强的 \"羽毛 \"Fallester显然已经解决了她随意从表的未解之谜档案中抽出的又一个案件。七年前，怀恩大学古物博物馆展出的一尊宝石雕像被盗，这起案件令守望者困惑不已，但在短短五天内，Fallester成功地将罪行归咎于一个叫Spaut的变种人小偷，他已经招供。",
	"While the Finders' Guild's greatest strength is its internal connections, it lacks many strong allies beyond House Tharashk's holdings. That said, the following groups have had numerous interactions with the guild and generally view inquisitives in a positive light:": "虽然探究者协会最大的优势在于其内部联系，但在塔拉什克家族的领地之外，它缺乏许多强有力的盟友。尽管如此，以下团体已经与该公会进行了多次互动，并普遍以积极的态度看待探询者。",
	"{@b Droaam}. Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of monsters and the east, bartering the services of monstrous mercenaries across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of the same courtesies and opportunities as races long established in society, and house members are now using their status to do the same for various other races from Droaam. As a result, members of the Finders' Guild can expect at least a modicum of respect while traveling in Droaam": "{@b Droaam}. 自从索拉-凯尔的女儿们在德拉姆崛起后，塔拉什克家族的成员就成为了怪物王国和东方之间的中间人，在整个霍尔韦尔以怪物雇佣兵的服务进行交换。该家族非常自豪地迫使霍尔韦尔的主流社会认识到，兽人和半兽人值得获得与社会上长期存在的种族一样的礼遇和机会，而且该家族成员现在正利用他们的地位，为来自德拉姆的其他各种种族做同样的事。因此，寻找者协会的成员在德罗安旅行时，至少可以期待得到适度的尊重。",
	"{@b Gatekeepers}. House Tharashk and the druidic sect of the Gatekeepers share common origins in the Shadow Marches, and the druids remain friendly with the house and its Finders' Guild. In the Marches, the guild often helps the druids locate stray aberrations and open portals between planes of existence. For their part, the Gatekeepers offer the support of their magic to aid guild members in whatever ways they can.": "{@b Gatekeepers}. Tharashk家族和守门人的德鲁伊教派在阴影地带有着共同的起源，德鲁伊与该家族及其寻找者公会保持着友好关系。在马尔奇，该公会经常帮助德鲁伊找到游离的畸变体，并打开各存在平面之间的传送门。守门人则提供他们的魔法支持，以任何方式帮助公会成员。",
	"The work of inquisitives naturally creates enemies, mostly on a local scale: con artists, gangs, and others who have had their unsavory deeds uncovered. Such groups are inclined to hold grudges against the guild as a whole. The guild's enemies on a larger scale are few, but include the following groups.": "调查员的工作自然会产生敌人，主要是在当地范围内：骗子、帮派，以及其他被揭发了不光彩行为的人。这些团体倾向于对整个行会怀恨在心。公会在更大范围内的敌人很少，但包括以下群体。",
	"{@b Daask}. The Finders Guild has a difficult relationship with the criminal organization called Daask. On the one hand, Daask is a violent criminal gang whose members are often targeted by Finders Guild inquisitives. On the other hand, Daask is a gang of monsters, many of whom actually left Droaam under the auspices of House Tharashk. Finders Guild inquisitives who pry too deeply into Daask business often feel pressure to back away coming from higher in House Tharashk. Those who ignore that pressure tend to end up the targets of Daask assassins.": "{@b Daask}. 寻找者协会与名为Daask的犯罪组织有着艰难的关系。一方面，达斯克是一个暴力犯罪团伙，其成员经常成为寻找者协会调查员的目标。另一方面，达斯克是一个由怪物组成的团伙，其中许多人实际上是在塔拉什克家族的支持下离开德罗阿姆的。寻找者协会的调查员如果对达斯克的业务探究得太深，往往会感到来自塔拉什克家族高层的压力而退缩。那些无视这种压力的人最终会成为达斯克刺客的目标。",
	"{@b House Deneith}. For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. It was an unpleasant surprise for them when House Tharashk entered the mercenary market in the later days of the war, bringing monsters from Droaam to bolster Five Nations armies. House Deneith still resents House Tharashk for this, and the animosity between the houses only increases when Finders' Guild inquisitives stick their noses into Sentinel Marshal business.": "{@b House Deneith}. 几个世纪以来，Deneith家族垄断了Khorvaire的雇佣军市场。当Tharashk家族在战争后期进入雇佣兵市场，从Droaam带来怪物以加强五国军队时，这对他们来说是一个不愉快的惊喜。迪尼斯家族至今仍对塔拉什克家族心怀怨恨，而当发现者协会的调查员将他们的鼻子伸向哨兵元帅的生意时，两族之间的敌意只会增加。",
	"With an inquisitive agency as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "有一个充满好奇心的机构作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. You can collect fees from your clients when you undertake investigations on their behalf. You can set those fees, and clients will often pay higher fees as your reputation and prestige increase. A fee of 5 sp to 10 sp per inquisitive per day, plus expenses incurred as part of the investigation, is a reasonable starting rate.": "{@b Compensation}. 当你代表客户进行调查时，你可以从客户那里收取费用。你可以设定这些费用，随着你的声誉和声望的提高，客户往往会支付更高的费用。每位调查员每天的费用为5-10英镑，加上调查过程中产生的费用，这是一个合理的起始费率。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Through the Finders' Guild, each associated inquisitive agency can benefit from the knowledge and experience of not only other inquisitives, but also bounty hunters, explorers, dragonshard prospectors, and others who make use of House Tharashk's talent for finding. Thus, an affiliated agency might find helpful allies not only in cities throughout the Five Nations, but even in remote corners of the wilderness where trackers and prospectors ply their trade. At the DM's discretion, your contacts might direct you to new cases, offer you leads in the case you're working on, put you in touch with their own network of contacts, or show up suddenly to pull you out of the fire. You can call in a favor from your agency to draw on the resources of any of your contacts. At the start of the campaign, roll twice on the Contacts table to choose two contacts. You will certainly acquire new contacts in the course of your adventures, who might or might not fit the descriptions of contacts on this table.": "{@b Contacts}. 通过寻找者协会，每个相关的探究机构不仅可以从其他探究者的知识和经验中获益，还可以从赏金猎人、探险家、龙石勘探者以及其他利用塔拉什克家族的寻找天赋的人那里获益。因此，一个附属机构不仅可以在整个五国的城市中找到有用的盟友，甚至还可以在追踪者和勘探者从事贸易的偏远荒野角落中找到。根据DM的判断，你的联系人可能会把你引向新的案件，为你正在处理的案件提供线索，让你与他们自己的关系网取得联系，或者突然出现，把你从火中拉出来。你可以请你的机构帮忙，利用你的任何联系人的资源。在活动开始时，在联系人表上滚动两次，选择两个联系人。在你的冒险过程中，你肯定会获得新的联系人，他们可能符合也可能不符合这张表格中对联系人的描述。",

	"A wide variety of talents can be useful in the work of an inquisitive, leading the Finders' Guild to employ specialists with diverse skill sets. Many inquisitives come from backgrounds such as criminal, sage, soldier, or urchin, regardless of the role they play in a group. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "各种各样的才能在探究者的工作中都是有用的，这导致探究者协会雇佣了具有不同技能的专家。许多探究者的背景是罪犯、贤者、士兵或顽童，无论他们在一个团体中扮演什么角色。可以考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Client}. When a routine investigation goes sideways, sometimes innocents get unwillingly caught in the action. The common artisan who hired the party to find her missing partner might find herself and her hired inquisitives on the run when things take a deadly turn. Such a Client is often a nonplayer character whose connection with the party is dissolved at the end of an adventure, but sometimes a Client develops a taste for excitement and becomes a fixture in the campaign. A perfectly ordinary background such as guild artisan or folk hero often work well with this character, who otherwise needs no specific proficiencies or capabilities.": "{@b Client}. 当常规调查出现偏差时，有时无辜者会不情愿地被卷入这场行动。当事情出现致命的转变时，雇佣团队寻找失踪伙伴的普通工匠可能会发现自己和她雇佣的调查员正在逃亡。这样的客户通常是一个非玩家角色，在冒险结束时，他与队伍的联系就会被解除，但有时客户会发展出对刺激的兴趣，并成为活动中的一个固定角色。一个完全普通的背景，如行会工匠或民间英雄，往往能很好地配合这个角色，否则他不需要特殊的技能或能力。",
	"{@b Consultant}. Sometimes skilled individuals end up working alongside inquisitives for a time. Such Consultants might work for a newspaper, study an esoteric field, or write crime fiction for a living. This character is usually similar to an Investigator, but typically has an unusual background or expert knowledge. The relationship between a Consultant and the rest of the party can be a source of drama—or comedy.": "{@b Consultant}. 有时，有技能的人最终会与探究者一起工作一段时间。这样的顾问可能为报纸工作，研究一个深奥的领域，或者以写犯罪小说为生。这种人物通常与调查员相似，但通常有不寻常的背景或专家知识。顾问和其他成员之间的关系可以是戏剧性的来源，也可以是喜剧性的。",
	"{@b Interrogator}. The Interrogator specializes in interaction with suspects, witnesses, or others who need persuasion to reveal what they know.

	"{@b Tough}. An inquisitive's work is inherently dangerous, so it's often important for their group to include someone who can physically intervene when situations devolve into combat.

The {@skill Intimidation} skill can also helpfully supplement the Tough's work.": "{@b Tough}. 探究者的工作本质上是危险的，所以他们的小组中往往要有一个能在情况演变成战斗时进行身体干预的人。强硬派的角色可能包括打击犯罪分子，踢门，甚至粗暴对待嫌疑人，所有这些都表明他们有较高的力量得分和战斗能力。{@skill Intimidation}技能也可以帮助补充强悍者的工作。",
	"Much of the work done by inquisitives is relatively mundane: collecting evidence of marital infidelity, investigating insurance fraud, or finding runaways. Sometimes these relatively innocent investigations can lead into the shadowy underbelly of society and become more dangerous, but most adventurers prefer the more dangerous kinds of inquisitive work. Your group might specialize in one particular kind of work, or it might take whatever cases come its way. Roll or pick from the Investigative Expertise table to determine your agency's specialty.": "调查员所做的大部分工作都是相对平凡的：收集婚姻不忠的证据，调查保险欺诈，或寻找逃亡者。有时，这些相对无害的调查会引向社会的阴暗面，变得更加危险，但大多数冒险家更喜欢更危险的调查工作。你的团队可能会专门从事一种特殊的工作，也可能会接下任何案件。从调查专长表中选择，以确定你的机构的专长。",

	"Inquisitives occupy a significant place in the popular imagination, both in their real-life exploits (as reported in the newspapers) and in many fictionalized accounts.

	"{@b Warning Guild}. Affiliated with but largely independent from House Medani, the Warning Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire.

Its inquisitives are often called upon to solve mysteries that baffle local law enforcement.": "{@b Warning Guild}. 警告公会隶属于梅达尼家族，但在很大程度上独立于梅达尼家族，为整个霍尔韦尔的保镖、调查员和哨兵提供认证和合同雇佣。该公会强调使用逻辑、感知和推理，将证据的碎片组合成一个可识别的整体。它的调查员经常被要求解决那些令当地执法部门困惑的谜团。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing inquisitive agency, you can start your own. You need to establish your own office.

You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your agency, as described at the start of this section.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的探究机构，不如自己创业。你需要建立自己的办公室。你可以收取与为其他机构工作相同的费用，而且你可以获得相同范围的联系。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的机构的活动，如本节开头所述。",
	"Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a team of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or an ordinary squad of infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or even continue to fight the Last War in the shadows.

	"The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion number among the deadliest warriors in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, law enforcers turn to the Redcloak Battalion.

At the end of the war, the battalion was split up and its units assigned to cities and strongholds across Breland.": "红斗篷营的士兵是布雷兰德最致命的战士之一。当情况需要极端的军事力量时，执法者会求助于红环营。这支精英部队在最后的战争中战斗在最前线，布瑞利什的吟游诗人仍在歌颂锤子坎丹和女猎手梅拉的功绩。战争结束后，该营被拆分，其部队被分配到布瑞尔各地的城市和据点。",

	"First, the Redcloaks do sometimes take inexperienced adventurers under their wings. Existing Redcloaks proved themselves on the battlefields of the Last War; if the group is to continue, the Redcloaks of the future have to learn the soldier's trade in different battles. To such ends, senior members of the battalion send your party on missions across Khorvaire to provide you with combat experience as well as to further Redcloak goals.": "首先，红环会有时确实会把没有经验的冒险者纳入他们的麾下。现有的红环会成员在最后一次战争的战场上证明了自己；如果该组织要继续下去，未来的红环会成员必须在不同的战斗中学习士兵的技能。为了达到这样的目的，营里的高级成员会派你的队伍在整个霍尔韦尔执行任务，为你提供战斗经验，并进一步实现红环会的目标。",
	"Alternatively, your DM might decide to start the campaign with your characters at a higher level and already established as members of the Redcloaks (see \"{@book Starting at Higher Level|DMG|1|Starting at Higher Level}\" in chapter 1 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). In this case, you might also begin with magic items and other gear reflecting your status in the organization. The standard-issue uniform for the Redcloaks is a hooded crimson {@item cloak of protection} bearing two badges: the seal of the Brelish crown on the left shoulder and a snarling displacer beast surrounded by the words, \"First in battle, last to fall\"—the Redcloak insignia and motto—on the right.": "或者，你的DM可能会决定在活动开始时，让你的角色处于更高的级别，并且已经成为红环组织的成员（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第一章的\"{@book Starting at Higher Level|DMG|1|Starting at Higher Level}\"）。在这种情况下，你也可以开始拥有反映你在组织中地位的魔法物品和其他装备。红十字会的标准制服是一件深红色的连帽制服（%%2%），上面有两个徽章：左肩上有布雷利什王冠的印记，右肩上有一只咆哮的流离兽，周围写着 \"战斗第一，最后倒下\"--红十字会的徽章和箴言。",
	"As part of Breland's military forces, the Redcloaks can count on the support of the crown, the King's Citadel, and the larger Brelish army, largely summarized as the following parties:": "作为布雷兰军事力量的一部分，红衣军团可以依靠王室、国王城堡和更大的布雷兰军队的支持，主要概括为以下几方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The king of Breland is a cautious advocate of the Redcloaks. He values their contributions but fears their power, which is why he divided the battalion after the end of the war. Still, he rewards loyalty among the Redcloaks by showing loyalty to them in return. Again and again, he has proven himself willing to exercise his power on behalf of a loyal Redcloak.": "{@b King Boranel}. 布雷兰德的国王是红袍人的谨慎拥护者。他重视他们的贡献，但害怕他们的力量，这就是为什么他在战争结束后分化了营队。不过，他还是通过对红环会的忠诚作为回报来奖励他们的忠诚。他一次又一次地证明自己愿意为忠诚的红袍人行使他的权力。",
	"{@b Other Redcloaks}. The first place any Redcloak turns for help is another Redcloak. No one else is as reliable and competent, while being unerringly faithful to the Brelish king and the battalion. Every Redcloak readily provides aid to other members, with no questions asked and no favor expected in return.": "{@b Other Redcloaks}. 任何红袍人首先求助的地方是另一个红袍人。没有人像其他人那样可靠和有能力，同时对布雷利什国王和营队毫不动摇地忠诚。每个红斗篷人都乐意为其他成员提供帮助，不问任何问题，也不期待回报。",
	"As veterans of the Last War, many Redcloaks carry strong grudges against other nations. They tend to believe that the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission in the ongoing conflict, and soon enough King Boranel will take his proper place on the throne of a reunited Galifar. Many of these grudges are personal based on an individual soldier's experience in the war, but some of them run both ways. Among the Redcloaks, tensions still run hot regarding their former rivals, particularly those from the following nations:": "作为最后战争的老兵，许多红袍人对其他国家怀有强烈的怨恨。他们倾向于认为《王座条约》只是正在进行的冲突中的一个中场休息，很快博拉内尔国王就会在重新统一的加利法尔的王座上获得他应有的地位。这些怨恨中有许多是基于个别士兵在战争中的经历而产生的个人恩怨，但有些是双向的。在红袍人中，对于他们以前的对手，特别是来自以下国家的对手，紧张关系仍然很激烈。",
	"{@b Darguun}. The hobgoblins of Darguun fought alongside Brelish forces at the Battle of Cairn Hill, but the cordial relations between the two nations frayed immediately after. The Redcloaks skirmished with hobgoblins who were leading Thrane civilians in chains back to Darguun. Few Darguuls remember the skirmish itself, but the \"wicked red-cloaked Brelish\" have an established place in the goblinoids' collective memory—and many Redcloaks do remember the event bitterly.": "{@b Darguun}. 达尔古恩的妖精在凯恩山战役中与布瑞利什的部队并肩作战，但两国之间的友好关系紧接着就破裂了。红袍人与霍比特人发生了短兵相接，霍比特人正带着被锁链锁住的瑟兰平民返回达尔古恩。很少有达尔古尔人记得这场战斗本身，但 \"邪恶的红袍布雷利什 \"在地精们的集体记忆中占有一席之地--许多红袍人确实痛苦地记得这个事件。",
	"{@b Thrane}. In the waning years of the Last War, the Redcloaks played a major role in the devastating Battle of Cairn Hill between Brelish and Thrane forces. Thanks to heavy losses on both sides, veterans of that battle tend to nurse bitter grudges against their enemies.": "{@b Thrane}. 在最后一次战争即将结束的时候，红袍人在布雷利什和瑟兰军队之间毁灭性的凯恩山之战中发挥了重要作用。由于双方都损失惨重，那场战役的老兵们往往对他们的敌人怀有痛苦的怨恨。",
	"With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一支军队作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Accommodations}. You can always find a place to stay and meals on a base or fort connected to your military force. Your accommodations are appropriate to your rank and station, but never luxurious.": "{@b Accommodations}. 你总能在与你的军队有关的基地或要塞找到住宿和吃饭的地方。你的住宿条件与你的军衔和职位相称，但绝不是豪华的。",
	"Venturing unusually far from their accustomed territory in the eastern jungles, a band of enormous lizardfolk—described by local experts as members of the Blackscale Tribe—broke through the fortifications at Adderport and killed thirteen residents before retreating back into the jungles. Khalar d'Tharashk has announced a plan to track the perpetrators and exact retribution under the sponsorship of King Sebastes.": "一群巨大的蜥蜴人--被当地专家描述为黑鳞部落的成员--不寻常地远离了他们在东部丛林中的习惯领地，冲破了阿德波特的防御工事，杀死了13名居民，然后退回到丛林中。卡勒-达拉什克（Khalar d'Tharashk）宣布了一项计划，在塞巴斯蒂安国王的支持下，追踪肇事者并实施报复。",
	"{@b Armory}. You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility associated with your military force. This might also be a location where you can buy magic items, at the DM's discretion, but you receive no discount.": "{@b Armory}. 你可以在一个与你的军队有关的设施中以20%的折扣购买非魔法武器和盔甲。这也可能是一个你可以购买魔法物品的地点，由DM决定，但你没有得到任何折扣。",
	"{@b Chain of Command}. You are part of a rigid chain of command. In addition to providing you with orders, this structure reduces your responsibility for your own actions. If you land in trouble in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not local law enforcement.": "{@b Chain of Command}. 你是一个僵化的指挥系统的一部分。除了为你提供命令外，这种结构还减少了你对自己行为的责任。如果你在自己的国家遇到麻烦，你要对你的官员负责，而不是对当地执法部门负责。",
	"{@b Orders}. You undertake your missions at the direction of a commanding officer. Your absolute obedience is expected. These missions are often explicit, leading you into the path of adventure. In some cases, though, you might be trusted with more open-ended tasks that afford you more leeway in interpreting orders.": "{@b Orders}. 你们在指挥员的指导下执行任务。预计你会绝对服从。这些任务通常是明确的，引导你进入冒险的道路。但在某些情况下，你可能会被信任，承担更多的开放式任务，使你在解释命令时有更多的余地。",
	"{@b Salary}. Each member of your group is paid a regular salary. The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You might receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) but also receive food and housing on a military base. Or you could receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes commensurately higher pay. As an officer, you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.": "{@b Salary}. 你们小组的每个成员都有固定工资。数额因你的组织和你在其中的地位而异，但至少你享有适度的生活方式。你可能会收到一份小的工资（少到每天1英镑），但也会在一个军事基地获得食物和住房。或者你可以每天收到1戈比，但依靠这些钱来获得食宿。随着军衔的提高，工资也相应提高。作为一名军官，你可以保持一种舒适的生活方式。",
	"A military unit, like most adventuring parties, incorporates a range of useful skills while covering each member's weaknesses with another's strengths. Thus, characters of any class can find a home in such a unit, and a diversity of different skills and backgrounds benefits the group as a whole. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个军事单位，就像大多数冒险队伍一样，融合了一系列有用的技能，同时用另一个人的长处来弥补每个成员的弱点。因此，任何等级的角色都可以在这样的团队中找到归宿，不同技能和背景的多样性对整个团队都是有益的。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Commander}. Every band of infantry has its leader, even if that person isn't a officer. The Commander earns that position through some combination of high Charisma and Intelligence—the ability to inspire and the capacity to plan. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill History} can be helpful as well. The Commander might be a career soldier (with that background) or someone from a noble background placed in command by virtue of birth. A Commander might be a fighter, bard, cleric, paladin, or even wizard—as magic proves valuable in military engagements.": "{@b Commander}. 每支步兵队伍都有其领导者，即使这个人不是军官。指挥官通过高魅力和高智力的某种组合来赢得这个位置--激励的能力和计划的能力。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill History}等技能也会有帮助。指挥官可能是一个职业军人（有这种背景），或者是一个出身高贵的人，因为出生而被置于指挥地位。指挥官可能是一个战士、吟游诗人、牧师、圣骑士，甚至是巫师--因为魔法在军事行动中证明是有价值的。",
	"{@b Medic}. Keeping soldiers alive is essential to military success, and that's the Medic's job. In an elite unit of adventurers, the Medic is often a cleric or has another class with healing ability, but these characters are also often proficient in the {@skill Medicine} skill or use of a {@item herbalism kit|PHB}. A Medic can be a soldier who demonstrated aptitude in healing and got moved into this position, or a character from a different background (such as acolyte, sage, or even hermit) who decided to put medical expertise to military use.": "{@b Medic}. 保持士兵的生命是军事成功的关键，这就是医疗兵的工作。在冒险者的精英部队中，医护人员通常是牧师或拥有其他具有治疗能力的等级，但这些角色也通常精通（%%1%）技能或使用（%%2%）。医务兵可以是一个在治疗方面表现出天赋并被调到这个位置的士兵，也可以是一个来自不同背景的人物（如圣徒、贤者，甚至是隐士），他决定将医疗专长用于军事。",
	"{@b Scout}. Trained in navigating the wilderness and laying ambushes for enemy soldiers, the Scout melds the combat skill of a fighter with the skills of a ranger or rogue. High Dexterity and Wisdom scores, combined with proficiency in the {@skill Nature}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Stealth}, and {@skill Survival} skills, support this character's core capabilities. Scouts are often recruited from people who are more familiar with the wilds than with city streets, including folk heroes, hermits, and outlanders.": "{@b Scout}. 侦察员接受过在野外航行和为敌方士兵设下埋伏的训练，他将战士的战斗技能与游侠或流氓的技能融为一体。高的灵巧和智慧分数，加上对{@skill Nature}、{@skill Perception}、{@skill Stealth}和{@skill Survival}技能的精通，支持了这个人物的核心能力。侦察员通常是从那些对荒野比城市街道更熟悉的人中招募的，包括民间英雄、隐士和外乡人。",
	"{@b Soldier}. Soldiers make up the core of most military groups, whether they're general infantry, magical artillery, or elite special forces. These characters come from all classes and backgrounds—for some, their background before joining the military is more important than their current role. No particular set of talents is common to all soldiers, but military units often strive to avoid duplication of skills.": "{@b Soldier}. 士兵构成了大多数军事团体的核心，无论他们是普通步兵、魔法炮兵，还是精英特种部队。这些角色来自各个阶层和背景--有些人在加入军队之前的背景比他们现在的角色更重要。没有哪一套特定的才能是所有士兵共有的，但军事单位往往努力避免技能的重复。",
	"{@b Warforged}. Literally made for war, most warforged characters have spent the years since the end of the Last War trying to find a new way of life. For some warforged, the answer is to continue fighting the war one way or another, often as part of an organized military unit. This experience, as a people created to fulfill a role and now seemingly locked into a destructive destiny, is just a part of life for many warforged.": "{@b Warforged}. 从字面上看，大多数战神角色都是为战争而生，在最后一次战争结束后的几年里，他们一直在努力寻找一种新的生活方式。对于一些战神来说，答案是继续以这种或那种方式参加战争，通常是作为一个有组织的军事单位的一部分。这种经历，作为一个为履行角色而创造的民族，现在似乎被锁定在一个破坏性的命运中，对许多战神来说只是生活的一部分。",
	"The work involved in serving as a military unit is wide-ranging. Your missions potentially run the risk of shattering the fragile peace established by the Treaty of Thronehold and plunging all of Khorvaire back into war. Alternatively, you might consider running your campaign during the Last War, so your group's missions influence the war effort and don't risk violating the treaty. As a group, consider the options on the Military Missions table and work with your DM to decide how the work you do fits into the larger picture of war and peace in Khorvaire.": "作为一个军事单位，所涉及的工作范围很广。你的任务有可能打破《王权条约》建立的脆弱的和平，使整个霍尔韦尔重新陷入战争。另外，你可以考虑在最后一次战争期间开展你的活动，这样你的小组的任务就会影响到战争的努力，并且不会有违反条约的风险。作为一个团体，考虑军事任务表上的选项，并与你的DM合作，决定你所做的工作如何融入霍尔韦尔的战争与和平的大环境中。",

	"{@b Networker}. The Networker knows exactly who can get the party what they need. This character makes extensive use of contacts and friends to facilitate the party's work.

Interpersonal connections are typically more important than any particular skills or abilities for this character, although many Networkers have high Charisma scores.": "{@b Networker}. 网络者清楚地知道谁能为党派提供他们所需要的东西。这个人物广泛利用联系人和朋友来促进党的工作。一个有犯罪背景的人物可能有黑社会的关系，而一个顽童可能熟悉城市的内部和外部。对这种人物来说，人际关系通常比任何特定的技能或能力更重要，尽管许多网络人有很高的魅力分数。",
	"{@b Snoop}. A Snoop pries into secrets and pieces together the clues behind a sensational story.

	"Your group acts in the service of one of Khorvaire's most prominent or obscure religious institutions. Perhaps you're a team of devotees pursuing a cause for your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking advantage of a wealthy congregation. You could be on a mission to retrieve sacred relics lost in ancient ruins, holy objects from war-ravaged temples, or treasures to fill the church's coffers. Your faith might drive you to hunt evil monsters or stave off interplanar invasions, to protect and defend the powerless from oppression and exploitation, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a land that's hostile to it. Or you could serve a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly disappear—though even the most cynical mercenaries might become true believers when confronted with the miraculous.": "你们的团体为霍尔韦尔最著名或最隐蔽的宗教机构之一服务。也许你们是一队为信仰而追求事业的信徒，也许你们是一群利用富有的教徒的愤青。你们的任务可能是找回遗失在古代废墟中的圣物，从被战争蹂躏的寺庙中找回圣物，或者找回宝物来填充教会的库房。你的信仰可能驱使你去猎杀邪恶的怪物或抵御星际入侵，保护和捍卫无权无势的人免受压迫和剥削，或者在一个对你的宗教有敌意的地方传播你的教义。或者你可以通过让敌人悄悄消失来为腐败的等级制度服务--尽管即使是最愤世嫉俗的雇佣兵在面对奇迹的时候也可能成为真正的信徒。",

	"As templars of the Silver Flame, you have distinctive silver tabards to wear over your other clothing or armor. You also have the privilege of using a knightly honorific before your name (typically \"sir\" or \"lady\"), and you are immediately recognized as a knight, an agent of the church, and effectively a lesser member of Thrane's aristocracy. This status guarantees the good will of members of the church and citizens of Thrane, but carries less weight and might even provoke animosity outside Thrane.": "作为银色火焰的圣殿骑士，你们有独特的银色头巾，可以穿在其他衣服或盔甲外面。你们还享有在名字前使用骑士尊称的特权（通常是 \"先生 \"或 \"女士\"），而且你们会被立即认定为骑士，是教会的代理人，并且实际上是瑟兰贵族中较低级的成员。这一身份保证了教会成员和瑟兰公民的善意，但其分量较轻，甚至可能引起瑟兰以外的敌意。",
	"The order of the Templars of the Silver Flame is represented on the Council of Cardinals that serves as the governing body of Thrane and the church.

	"Knights templar are free to wander the world in pursuit of the order's aims. When leaving the jurisdiction of one commander and entering that of another, it is a knight's responsibility to promptly report to the commander of the new area, in case that commander has a pressing need for a knight to perform a mission. The commanders try to keep each other informed about where knights are operating and what they are doing, but this system works better in some places—and between some commanders—than others.": "圣殿骑士可以自由地在世界范围内游荡，追求骑士团的目标。当离开一位指挥官的管辖范围而进入另一位指挥官的管辖范围时，骑士有责任及时向新地区的指挥官报告，以防该指挥官迫切需要骑士执行任务。指挥官们试图让对方了解骑士在哪里行动以及他们在做什么，但这个系统在一些地方和一些指挥官之间比其他地方更有效。",

	"High Cardinal Baerdren ir'Davik, who also holds the rank of grand master of the templars, appears to be an exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of the order. Yet it is widely known that he chafes at the political and bureaucratic responsibilities that his position on the Council of Cardinals demands of him. This reporter has learned that Sir Baerdren would readily surrender his position, were it not for his distrust of his seneschal, Ofejjaia of Korth.": "红衣大主教Baerdren ir'Davik，同时也是圣殿骑士团的大团长，似乎是一个模范的圣殿骑士，完全致力于教团的使命。然而，众所周知，他对红衣主教会议要求他承担的政治和官僚责任感到不安。记者了解到，如果不是因为不信任他的参谋长--科思的奥菲加亚，贝尔德伦爵士会很乐意交出他的职位。",
	"Lady Ofejjaia, it seems, has other issues on her personal agenda besides advancing the cause of the knights templar, and one wonders if those issues are tied to her Karrnathi origin. Though her wisdom and sound judgment are not in dispute, it seems that Sir Baerdren fears that she would drive the order into obsolescence or even banishment if she were in charge.": "除了推进圣殿骑士团的事业之外，奥菲佳亚女士似乎还有其他的个人议程，人们不禁要问，这些问题是否与她的卡尔纳提出身有关。虽然她的智慧和正确的判断力没有争议，但似乎贝尔德伦爵士担心，如果她负责的话，她会使骑士团过时甚至被放逐。",
	"Does Lady Ofejjaia hold her lofty position because of her loyalty, her piety, and her qualifications? Or is she there simply so that Sir Baerdren can keep his eye on her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the templars from within?": "奥菲亚女士之所以能保持她的崇高地位，是因为她的忠诚、她的虔诚和她的资质吗？还是说她在那里只是为了让贝尔德伦爵士能盯着她，确保她不会从内部破坏圣殿骑士团？",
	"{@b Fixer}. The Fixer might work for a religious order for entirely non-religious reasons. This character does the order's dirty work and clears away its problems. It's entirely possible for an entire party to be made up of Fixers, but rogues and fighters are especially well suited to this kind of work. Characters with the criminal background excel at putting their skills and contacts to use on the church's behalf.": "{@b Fixer}. 修复者可能出于完全非宗教的原因为宗教组织工作。这个角色做教团的脏活累活，清除它的问题。整个党派完全有可能由修复者组成，但流氓和战士特别适合这种工作。具有犯罪背景的人物擅长于将他们的技能和关系用于教会的工作。",
	"{@b Prophet}. The Prophet is a visionary with a more-or-less direct connection to the divine. This character might be the driving force behind the group's quests, steering them according to divine will. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Religion} can help reflect this character's divine connection. The Prophet is often a cleric or druid, but could also be an NPC with no real adventuring skills, who needs the group's protection.": "{@b Prophet}. 先知是一个有远见的人，或多或少与神灵有直接联系。这个人物可能是团体任务背后的驱动力，根据神的意志引导他们。熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Religion}等技能可以帮助反映这个人物的神性联系。先知通常是一个牧师或德鲁伊，但也可能是一个没有真正冒险技能的NPC，他需要团体的保护。",
	"{@b Scholar}. The Scholar brings academic knowledge to bear in the religious order's work, often in the form of proficiency in {@skill History} and {@skill Religion}. This character might be an expert on ancient ruins or know all the weaknesses of the demons they are hunting. Characters with access to divination magic (including clerics with the Knowledge domains as well as wizards) might excel at this role. Many Scholars come from the sage background. Unlike the Prophet and Zealot, the Scholar isn't necessarily devout, just knowledgeable.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者将学术知识带入宗教团体的工作中，通常以精通（1%）和（2%）的形式。这个角色可能是古代遗迹的专家，或者知道他们所猎杀的恶魔的所有弱点。能够使用占卜魔法的角色（包括拥有知识领域的牧师以及巫师）可能会擅长这个角色。许多学者都来自圣人的背景。与先知和狂热者不同，学者不一定是虔诚的，只是有知识。",
	"{@b Teacher}. Those in this role spread the teachings of the faith. This isn't usually an effort to win converts—though it can be, especially in the case of the Church of the Silver Flame—but rather the task of encouraging people to live according to the highest ideals of faith. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} (or sometimes {@skill Intimidation}) and {@skill Religion} can be useful for this character. Many clerics fill this role, but devout bards can also be effective Teachers. Some Teachers bring skills from the entertainer background into the service of their faith.": "{@b Teacher}. 这个角色的人传播信仰的教义。这通常不是为了赢得皈依者--尽管它可以，特别是在银焰教会的情况下--而是鼓励人们按照信仰的最高理想生活的任务。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}（有时是{@skill Intimidation}）和{@skill Religion}等技能对这个角色很有用。许多牧师扮演这个角色，但虔诚的吟游诗人也可以成为有效的教师。有些教师将艺人背景的技能带入他们的信仰服务中。",
	"{@b Zealot}. Dedicated to smiting the foes of the faith, the Zealot focuses on combat above all. Clerics, druids, and paladins make iconic Zealots, but any character can play this role; there are barbarians whose fury is fueled by their devotion, and rangers sworn to track down the enemies of the faith. The soldier and folk hero backgrounds are well suited to such champions of the faith.": "{@b Zealot}. 狂热者致力于打击信仰的敌人，他的重点是战斗。牧师、德鲁伊和圣骑士是典型的狂热者，但任何角色都可以扮演这个角色；有野蛮人，他们的怒火被他们的奉献所激发，还有游侠发誓要追踪信仰的敌人。士兵和民间英雄的背景很适合于这种信仰的拥护者。",

	"Some religious orders are viewed with suspicion by the priestly hierarchies of their faiths; others are viewed as champions who act as the gods' hands in the world. Within a religious order, some members are highly respected while others are seen as dangerous for one reason or another. What is your relationship to the hierarchy you're a part of? Is your entire order held in particularly high or low esteem? Or does your adventuring party stand out from the larger order for some reason? Is your behavior in line with the expectations of your religion, or is it unorthodox in some way? Reference the Order Reputation table to determine how you're viewed by your larger religious institution.": "一些宗教团体被其信仰的牧师等级制度所怀疑；另一些则被视为冠军，在世界范围内充当神的手。在一个宗教团体中，一些成员受到高度尊重，而另一些则因为这样或那样的原因被视为危险人物。你与你所在的等级制度的关系是什么？你的整个教团受到特别高或特别低的尊重吗？或者你的冒险队伍由于某种原因而从大的秩序中脱颖而出？你的行为是符合你的宗教的期望，还是在某种程度上是非正统的？参考教团声誉表，以确定你被你的大宗教机构如何看待。",

	"Your primary contact within the religious order is usually some kind of priest—not necessarily a cleric or druid, but someone who holds a priestly office and a position of some authority in the hierarchy of the organization. This person might direct you and your adventures according to their interpretation of divine will, or they might trust the gods to lead you to do what needs to be done. Of course, some priests (as well as lay functionaries) are more interested in their own agendas than any supposed divine will. Consult the Order Contact table to determine your liaison within the religious order.": "你在宗教团体中的主要联系人通常是某种牧师--不一定是牧师或德鲁伊，而是在该组织的等级制度中担任牧师职务和某种权威地位的人。这个人可能会根据他们对神意的解释来指导你和你的冒险，或者他们可能相信神明会带领你去做需要做的事情。当然，有些牧师（以及非专业的职能人员）对他们自己的议程更感兴趣，而不是任何所谓的神的意志。请参考教团联系表，确定你在教团内的联络人。",
	"A cloistered priest with little worldly experience who doesn't really understand what you do but seems to approve of it anyway": "一个没有什么世俗经验的隐居牧师，他并不真正理解你的工作，但似乎还是赞同你的工作。",
	"A cynical priest who thinks nothing you do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things": "一个愤世嫉俗的牧师，认为你所做的一切在大计划中都没有任何区别",

	"An institution of higher education sponsors your group. You might be researchers, bodyguards for scholars, or glorified treasure hunters searching for ancient artifacts.

	"At the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik, thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be \"a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city.\"": "沙恩的莫格莱夫大学的核心是一个尖锐的二元对立。一方面，它被称为希望研究Xen'drik的学者们的纽带，这在很大程度上要归功于沙恩靠近这个秘密大陆。它所收藏的关于古代Xen'drik和达卡帝国的文物和学术著作是无与伦比的。在许多方面，它没有辜负其创始人拉雷斯-伊尔-莫格莱夫勋爵的光辉愿景，即成为 \"一座从城市最高的塔楼上照亮的知识明灯\"。",
	"On the other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.": "另一方面，该大学的声誉也因走私、寻宝和牟取暴利的指控而受到损害。许多从Xen'drik或Dhakaani遗迹中找到的无价文物都从大学的金库中消失了，并被发现进入黑市或落入Aurum的手中。大学的一些学者、教授、甚至学生与走私者和盗贼有联系，这是一个公开的秘密。所有这些指控，也都与该大学的创立有关系。据说莫格莱夫勋爵本人就是通过在黑市上出售达卡尼文物而发家的，有些人声称大学的真正目的是帮助他通过这种可疑的手段建立财富。",
	"The academic world is relatively small, and people at any one university tend to have connections at others. You might parlay such relationships into assistance from academies and institutions, such as the following organizations:": "学术界相对较小，任何一所大学的人往往在其他大学有关系。你可以将这种关系转化为来自学院和机构的援助，如以下组织。",
	"{@b Flamewind}. The sphinx Flamewind (described in the \"Immortal Being\" section) isn't officially affiliated with the university, but she lives there and spends much of her time in its libraries and museums. As a scholar of the Draconic Prophecy, Flamewind often poses strange questions and sends adventurers on obscure missions.": "{@b Flamewind}. 狮身人面兽Flamewind（在 \"不朽的存在 \"一节中描述过）并不正式隶属于这所大学，但她住在那里，大部分时间都在图书馆和博物馆中度过。作为一个研究龙族预言的学者，焰风经常提出一些奇怪的问题，并派冒险者执行一些晦涩难懂的任务。",
	"{@b Library of Korranberg}. The Library of Korranberg boasts the greatest collection of learning in Khorvaire.

	"{@b The Twelve}. For many scholars of magical studies, the idea of pursuing their research under the auspices of the Twelve is a cherished dream. Some faculty members at Morgrave have had the opportunity to do just that, and many others have nurtured connections to the Twelve in an attempt to secure that honor.

Should your group needs a grant or resources from the Wayfinders, a letter of recommendation from someone at Morgrave carries some weight.": "{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. 莫格莱夫与探路者基金会保持着广泛的联系--这是一个专门为冒险家服务的行会，它为远方的探险活动提供资金。如果你的团队需要探路者基金会的资助或资源，莫格莱夫的推荐信会有一定分量。",
	"Morgrave University has few true enemies but many rivals. Despite the friendly ties among academic institutions, Morgrave occupies the low end of the prestige scale among academic bodies, so its faculty tends to look for opportunities to steal glory from its academic peers. Beyond rivalries with allied organizations, Morgrave openly competes with the following group:": "莫格莱夫大学真正的敌人很少，但对手却很多。尽管学术机构之间有着友好的联系，但莫格莱夫在学术机构中占据着低端的声望，因此其教师往往会寻找机会从学术同行那里窃取荣耀。除了与联盟组织的竞争外，莫格莱夫还与以下团体公开竞争。",
	"{@b University of Wynarn}. Foremost among Morgrave's rivals is Aundair's University of Wynarn, whose administrators have been known to refer to Morgrave as an \"institute of learning, relic hunting, and grave robbing.\" The University of Wynarn is ancient—the first university established in the Five Nations—and more prestigious than Morgrave. It sponsors many of the same kind of expeditions and can boast many great discoveries, yet, somehow, Morgrave is more famous, and that stings many among the university's staff.": "{@b University of Wynarn}. 在莫格莱夫的竞争对手中，最重要的是昂代尔的威纳恩大学，其管理者曾将莫格莱夫称为 \"学习、遗迹狩猎和盗墓的学院\"。威纳恩大学是一所古老的大学，是五国中成立的第一所大学，比摩格莱夫更有声望。它赞助了许多同类型的探险活动，并可以夸耀许多伟大的发现，然而，不知何故，莫格莱夫更有名，这让大学的许多员工感到震惊。",
	"With a university as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一所大学作为你的团体的赞助人，你将获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Or you might be paid a bounty for each ancient artifact you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.": "{@b Compensation}. 大学为你代表它所做的工作付费。你的工作性质影响着你的报酬方式。平均来说，大学每天付给你们每个人1戈比，或者足够维持一个小规模的生活。或者，你从冒险中带回的每件古代文物都会得到一笔赏金，并交给大学。",
	"{@b Documentation}. Each member of your group has identification papers that include your affiliation with the university, which carries some clout in academic circles. The university also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. Finally, if your adventures take you to Xen'drik, the university secures the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which grant you permission to explore the ruins there.": "{@b Documentation}. 你们小组的每个成员都有身份证明文件，其中包括你们与大学的关系，这在学术界具有一定的影响力。如果你的工作需要，大学还可以为你提供文件、介绍信和旅行证件。最后，如果你的冒险活动带你到Xen'drik，大学会确保由Breland国王签发的必要授权书，这些授权书允许你探索那里的遗迹。",
	"{@b Research}. Research might be part of your group's job, but your patron has abundant resources to facilitate it. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to a colleague, contact, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering all expenses occurred as part of this research, and the DM determines the success, failure, or other possible results.": "{@b Research}. 研究可能是你小组工作的一部分，但你的赞助人有丰富的资源来促进它。你可以叫人帮忙，把研究传说的工作（在（%%1%）或（%%2%）中描述的停工活动）委托给同事、联系人或研究助理。你要负责支付作为这项研究的一部分而发生的所有费用，DM决定成功、失败或其他可能的结果。",
	"{@b Resources}. Most universities have extensive libraries and museums, which you have access to. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are generally not on exhibit—dangerous relics or possibly magic items, spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, the faculty of your university might make it possible for you to consult with experts in various fields—so long as you can coax them away from their work.": "{@b Resources}. 大多数大学都有广泛的图书馆和博物馆，你可以进入这些地方。你可以找人帮忙，以获得一般不展出的资源--危险的遗物或可能的魔法物品、法术书，以及类似物品。此外，你大学的教师可能会让你向各个领域的专家咨询--只要你能把他们从工作中哄走。",
	"{@b Training}. Because you're associated with the university, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}), you pay only one-half the normal cost, assuming that what you are studying is something the university teaches. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools might also be available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion} skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can only learn one of these skills in this way.": "{@b Training}. 因为你与大学有联系，你在任何你想接受的教育上都能得到折扣。当你作为停工活动接受培训时（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}所述），你只需支付正常费用的二分之一，假设你所学的是大学所教的东西。语言、乐器和其他工具的训练也可能会有，由DM决定。此外，你可以通过这种方法获得{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Nature}或{@skill Religion}技能的熟练度，就像你在学习一门语言一样。一个角色只能用这种方法学习其中一个技能。",
	"A group sponsored by a university might look very much like any other adventuring party, with a range of diverse skills and capabilities. The only significant distinction lies between characters who are scholars and those who are more traditional adventurers. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个由大学赞助的团体可能看起来很像其他的冒险队伍，拥有一系列不同的技能和能力。唯一重要的区别在于学者角色和传统的冒险家角色之间。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Field Researcher}. The academic in your group might also be a character with plenty of training and experience in the dangerous life of an adventurer. Sometimes called tomb raiders or grave robbers, such characters know that groundbreaking work requires firsthand experience with the creatures, cultures, forces, and histories being investigated, and the best way to get that is in the field. This role is similar to the Scholar, but the Field Researcher is armed with combat-oriented spells that supplement the knowledge-focused capabilities of the Scholar, preparing them to face those who guard the world's greatest secrets.": "{@b Field Researcher}. 你的小组中的学者也可能是一个在冒险家的危险生活中受过大量训练和有经验的角色。有时被称为盗墓者或盗墓者，这类角色知道，开创性的工作需要对被调查的生物、文化、力量和历史有第一手的经验，而获得这种经验的最好方式就是在野外。这个角色与学者类似，但实地研究者拥有战斗导向的法术，以补充学者以知识为中心的能力，使他们准备好面对那些守护世界最伟大秘密的人。",
	"{@b Financier}. Whether they're hunting for grants or seeking donations from wealthy philanthropists, the Financier seeks the funds to pay for academic expeditions. Such characters might know their ways around ballrooms, boardrooms, and seedy taverns, willing to do whats necessary to get what they need. Those in this role often exude Charisma and might be adept with the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion} skills. Bards and rogues make natural academic Financiers, as do those with the charlatan and noble backgrounds.": "{@b Financier}. 无论他们是在寻找资助还是从富有的慈善家那里寻求捐赠，金融家都会寻求资金来支付学术考察的费用。这样的人物可能知道他们在舞厅、会议室和肮脏的酒馆的方式，愿意做必要的事情来获得他们所需要的东西。这种角色常常散发着魅力，并且可能擅长（1%）、（2%）和（3%）的技能。吟游诗人和流氓是天然的学术金融家，那些有游侠和贵族背景的人也是如此。",
	"{@b Research Assistant}. Whether their seeking to graduate, get published, or make their academic mark, the Research Assistant's fate is likely tied up in the success of another scholar or a specific project. Alternatively, the Research Assistant might just be along for the ride, helping a professor merely to pass a course. Regardless, such characters might come from any class or background and could have skills gathered from experiences far outside the academic sphere. While there are certainly legitimate Research Assistants who honestly pursue their studies, this role might suit characters without academic interests.": "{@b Research Assistant}. 无论他们是想毕业，还是想发表文章，或是想在学术上有所建树，研究助理的命运很可能与另一位学者或某个特定项目的成功联系在一起。另外，研究助理也可能只是顺水推舟，只是为了帮助教授通过一门课程。无论如何，这样的人物可能来自任何阶层或背景，并可能拥有从学术领域以外的经验中收集的技能。当然也有合法的研究助理，他们真诚地追求他们的研究，这个角色可能适合没有学术兴趣的人物。",
	"{@b Scholar}. Likely possessing a high Intelligence score and a focus on learning and research, the Scholar in your party might represent the academic emphasis of the university. This character is often a noncombatant, a professor or student the rest of the party protects. Alternatively, they might live a dual life, shedding their academic persona as soon as they're off campus grounds. The Scholar might also be a nonplayer character, or the role could be filled by a player character whose spells and training don't include combat. A wizard whose spellbook is filled with utility-focused spells makes a fine Scholar, as might some clerics and monks. In any case, the sage background is an obvious choice for the Scholar, with acolyte and hermit also providing fine alternatives. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion} often proves useful for this character.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者可能拥有较高的智力分数，并专注于学习和研究，你的队伍中的学者可能代表大学的学术重点。这个角色通常是一个非战斗人员，是一个教授或学生，受到其他成员的保护。另外，他们也可能过着双重生活，一旦离开校园，就摆脱了他们的学术身份。学者也可以是一个非玩家角色，或者由一个其法术和训练不包括战斗的玩家角色来扮演这个角色。巫师的法术书中充满了以实用为重点的法术，就像一些牧师和僧侣一样，可以成为一个好的学者。在任何情况下，圣人背景都是学者的明显选择，圣徒和隐士也提供了不错的选择。熟练掌握{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Investigation}、{@skill Nature}和{@skill Religion}等技能通常对这个角色很有用。",
	"Decide as a group, in consultation with your DM, what kind of work your group does for the university. Consult the Scholarly Missions table to determine what sort of adventures you undertake.": "以小组为单位，与你的管理员协商，决定你的小组为大学做什么样的工作。请参考学术任务表，以确定你们进行什么样的冒险。",

	"{@b Historical Research}. Your team's work involves learning more about Eberron's long history.": "{@b Historical Research}. 你的团队的工作包括了解更多关于Eberron的悠久历史。",
	"{@b Radical Engineering}. The birth of a new race wasn't the peak of magical and mechanical engineering, it was just the beginning of new scientific fields you now explore.": "{@b Radical Engineering}. 一个新种族的诞生并不是魔法和机械工程的高峰，它只是你现在探索的新科学领域的开始。",
	"{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire is a vast continent, and areas beyond the heartland of the Five Nations are poorly charted. Your focus is on understanding the wilder places of the world, as well as distant cultures.": "{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire是一个广阔的大陆，而五国中心地带以外的地区则没有什么地图。你的重点是了解世界上比较荒凉的地方，以及遥远的文化。",

	"{@b Anonymous}. Try as you might, you can't earn positive or negative attention. Even worse, after you've published your findings, more prominent scholars have made similar statements to much acclaim.": "{@b Anonymous}. 无论你怎么努力，你都无法赢得正面或负面的关注。更糟糕的是，在你发表了你的发现之后，更多的知名学者也发表了类似的声明，获得了很多赞誉。",
	"{@b Misguided}. Your theories challenge scholarly consensus and are discounted. A prominent scholar argues against your conclusions, and their voice carries the day... for now.": "{@b Misguided}. 你的理论挑战了学术界的共识，被打了折扣。一位著名的学者反对你的结论，他们的声音在今天起到了作用......暂时是这样。",
	"{@b Fringe}. You work on the edges of your field, advocating bizarre theories that challenge scholarly consensus and seem patently outrageous, even scandalous.": "{@b Fringe}. 你在你的领域的边缘工作，主张挑战学术界共识的怪异理论，看起来显然很离谱，甚至是丑闻。",
	"{@b Fraud}. For right or wrong, many in the academic community believe you have invented at least some of your \"findings\" to earn attention.": "{@b Fraud}. 无论对错，学术界的许多人认为你至少编造了一些你的 \"发现 \"来赚取关注。",
	"With a university as your patron, you are part of a sprawling bureaucracy—maybe deep in the tangles of it or, more likely, lingering at the edges. Wherever you sit in the network of colleges, administrators, and faculty, a single person serves as your primary point of contact, someone who has a significant impact on the nature of your relationship with the university. Reference the University Contact table to help determine who manages the relationship between you and the university.": "以大学为靠山，你是一个庞大的官僚机构的一部分--也许是深陷其中，或者更有可能是在边缘徘徊。无论你在学院、行政人员和教师的网络中处于什么位置，都有一个人作为你的主要联系人，这个人对你与大学关系的性质有重大影响。参考大学联系表以帮助确定谁管理你和大学之间的关系。",
	"An overworked department head who doesn't quite know what to make of you but gives you work to keep you busy": "一个工作过度的部门主管，他不太了解你的情况，但给你工作让你忙碌。",
	"A career bureaucrat who insists you file paperwork in multiple offices in order to get anything done": "一个职业官僚，坚持要你在多个办公室提交文件，才能完成任何事情。",

In it, ir'Morgrave vows to put an end to the criminal activities occurring within the university and bolster the school's academic reputation. As regular readers of this paper know, he makes such promises frequently, but we have yet to see him take any substantive action to back up his promises.": "针对上周的独家报道，详细介绍了从莫格莱夫大学的仓库中取出珍贵古董并在黑市上出售的计划，Larrian ir'Morgrave大师发表了一份声明，其中充满了我们已经习惯于从大学校长办公室听到的通常的陈词滥调和空洞承诺。在声明中，IR'Morgrave发誓要结束发生在大学里的犯罪活动，并加强学校的学术声誉。正如本报的普通读者所知，他经常做出这样的承诺，但我们还没有看到他采取任何实质性行动来支持他的承诺。",

Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more.

Late in the war, a brilliant hobgoblin named Lhesh Haruuc Sharaat'kor recognized that the goblins had become the dominant military power in the region. Uniting the Ghaal'dar under his banner, Haruuc seized the territory he was supposed to protect.

	"Overall, Darguun is a nation that is still finding its identity—a kingdom that seeks to be more than a seized territory.

	"King Kaius III was one of the architects of the Treaty of Thronehold and remains committed to peace.

Should these warlords gain sufficient support, they could push for a military coup.": "国王凯乌斯三世是《王权条约》的设计者之一，他仍然致力于和平。然而，许多国家的军阀认为，卡尔纳特会赢得最后的战争，凯厄斯剥夺了卡尔纳特人应有的命运。如果这些军阀获得足够的支持，他们可以推动军事政变。",
	"A second destabilizing factor is the tension between the followers of the Blood of Vol and the Karrnathi traditionalists. The Seekers assert that the Blood of Vol saved Karrnath and point to the power of its undead troops. The traditionalists claim that the dark magic of the Seekers caused famines and plagues, crippling Karrnath and forcing it to rely on the undead. The Blood of Vol could back an uprising in Karrnath, or those who wish to drive out the Seekers could trigger a civil war.": "第二个破坏稳定的因素是沃尔之血的追随者和卡尔纳特的传统主义者之间的矛盾。探索者声称沃尔之血拯救了卡尔纳特，并指出其亡灵部队的力量。传统派则声称，探索者的黑暗魔法造成了饥荒和瘟疫，使卡尔纳特陷入瘫痪，被迫依靠亡灵。沃尔之血可以支持卡尔纳特的起义，或者那些希望赶走探索者的人可以引发内战。",

	"{@b Pride in Possessions}. From the wealthiest clan lord to the humblest miner, the Mror take great pride in their possessions. Quality is more important than appearance, and you are interested in the history of the items you carry.

While flawed, this vision isn't entirely inaccurate. The Shadow Marches are a desolate land of swamps and moors. The homeland of the orcs, the Marches were scarred in the ancient conflict with the daelkyr.

	"The Marches had little contact with the Kingdom of Galifar or the east until a few hundred years ago, when a House Sivis expedition made two discoveries: the region contained valuable dragonshards, and a number of clans had manifested the Dragonmark of Finding. This led to the foundation of House Tharashk, as these clans joined together to master the economic potential of their mark and leverage their mineral wealth.": "马奇地区与加利法尔王国或东部地区几乎没有联系，直到几百年前，西维斯家族的一支探险队有了两个发现：该地区有宝贵的龙石，而且一些部族已经显现出寻找龙纹的功能。这导致了塔拉什克家族的建立，因为这些部族联合起来掌握了他们标记的经济潜力并利用了他们的矿产财富。",

	"{@b Madness and Mysticism}. Most Marchers have a mystical view of the world, beliefs shaped by the traditions of the Gatekeepers and the madness of the daelkyr. Marchers typically feel that the people of the treaty nations are {@condition blinded} by their civilized ways.

Whether you're loyal to the Gatekeepers, the Sovereign Host, or the Dragon Below, superstitions inform your path.": "{@b Madness and Mysticism}. 大多数游行者对世界有一种神秘的看法，他们的信念是由守门人的传统和daelkyr的疯狂形成的。游行者通常觉得，条约国的人的文明方式是（%1%）。你在呱呱坠地的青蛙的声音中听到了真相，在水面上晃动的阴影中看到了真相。无论你是忠于守门人、主宰者，还是下面的龙，迷信都告知你的道路。",
	"{@b Clan or Tribe}? The people of the Shadow Marches are split into two distinct cultures. The clans blend the traditions of human and orc, building towns and working with steel. If you were raised in one of the clans, the ways of civilization aren't that strange to you; you've seen the city of Zarash'ak and worked with House Tharashk. By contrast, the Marcher tribes maintain traditions that predate humanity. As nomadic hunter-gatherers, they don't work metals; they make their tools from stone, hide, wood, and bone. If your character is from one of the Marcher tribes, you might be the first of your people to leave the swamps. Why have you left your people, and how are you adapting to this new world?": "{@b Clan or Tribe}? 影子牧场的人们分为两种不同的文化。氏族融合了人类和兽人的传统，建造城镇并与钢铁打交道。如果你在其中一个部族长大，文明的方式对你来说并不陌生；你见过扎拉什阿克城，并与塔拉什克家族合作。相比之下，马歇尔部落保持着人类之前的传统。作为游牧的狩猎采集者，他们不使用金属；他们用石头、兽皮、木材和骨头制作工具。如果你的角色来自马歇尔部落之一，你可能是你的族人中第一个离开沼泽的人。你为什么要离开你的人民，你是如何适应这个新世界的？",
	"The clans of the Shadow Marches primarily live in small towns and villages, their huts raised above the swamps on stilts. The Shadow Marches contain many manifest zones tied to Xoriat and Kythri (see {@book chapter 4|ERLW|10} for descriptions of both), the planes of madness and chaos. Time moves strangely in places in the deep swamps, which twists mundane beasts and plants into strange shapes. Daelkyr ruins linger in these areas, remnants of the ancient war against the goblins and orcs that once dominated Khorvaire.": "阴影地带的部族主要居住在小城镇和村庄，他们的小屋用高跷架在沼泽地上。阴影地带包含许多与Xoriat和Kythri（参见（%0%）对两者的描述）相关的显化区，即疯狂和混乱的平面。时间在深陷的沼泽地里奇怪地移动，将平凡的野兽和植物扭曲成奇怪的形状。戴尔凯尔（Daelkyr）的遗迹在这些地区徘徊，这是古代与曾经统治霍尔韦尔的地精和兽人战争的遗迹。",

Though Vvaraak is long dead, rumors say that her hidden lair holds secrets tied to the Draconic Prophecy and the mysteries of druidic magic.": "绿龙瓦拉亚克（Vvaraak）据说在几千年前将德鲁伊魔法的秘密传授给了第一批守门人。虽然弗瓦拉克早已死亡，但有传言说她的隐秘巢穴里有与德鲁伊预言和德鲁伊魔法之谜有关的秘密。",
	"Because overland travel through Droaam or the Eldeen Reaches can be extremely dangerous, most people who need to do business in the Marches travel by ship to the port city of Zarash'ak. Built on stilts and known for its cuisine and music, Zarash'ak offers the rare exports of the land without the difficulty of navigating the swamps. House Tharashk oversees the City of Stilts, but Marcher clans and tribes come here to sell crafts and other goods or to celebrate religious rituals.": "由于在陆路上穿越德罗阿姆（Droaam）或艾尔迪恩海滩（Eldeen Reaches）是非常危险的，大多数需要在马尔凯斯做生意的人都会乘船前往港口城市扎拉什阿克（Zarash'ak）。扎拉什阿克建在高跷上，以其美食和音乐而闻名，它提供了罕见的土地出口，而没有沼泽地的航行困难。塔拉什克家族负责监督高跷之城，但马奇家族和部落也来这里出售工艺品和其他物品，或庆祝宗教仪式。",
	"The Shadow Marches aren't a nation, and the region wasn't recognized by the Treaty of Thronehold. Most Marchers have little interest in the outside world. Marcher tribes don't know the names or number of the nations beyond the swamps, let alone that they were at war. However, as House Tharashk gains power and influence in the world beyond the swamps, it has increased its presence in its homeland. The house has expanded Zarash'ak dramatically over the last decade and is working on transforming other towns into cities. This has caused tension with a number of tribes. And House Tharashk's mining operations and its urban expansion always run the risk of disrupting Gatekeeper seals and unleashing ancient evils bound beneath the Marches.": "暗影行军不是一个国家，该地区也没有得到《王权条约》的承认。大多数行军者对外面的世界没有什么兴趣。游行者部落不知道沼泽地以外的国家的名称和数量，更不知道它们曾发生过战争。然而，随着塔拉什克家族在沼泽地以外的世界获得权力和影响力，它也增加了在其家乡的存在。在过去的十年里，该家族急剧扩张扎拉什阿克，并正在努力将其他城镇改造成城市。这已经引起了与一些部落的紧张关系。而塔拉什克家族的采矿作业和城市扩张总是有可能破坏守门人的封印，并释放出束缚在沼泽地下的古老邪恶。",

But compassion and charity are core values of the church, and the templars are tasked to defend all innocents. Even during the Last War, if a fiendish threat arose in a Brelish village, Thrane templars would ally with the locals to bring an end to the threat. Not all Thranes rise to this ideal. Zealous Thranes believe the church is destined to reunite Galifar under the Silver Flame, and corrupt priests are interested only in power and wealth.": "银色火焰的主要目的是保护无辜者免遭超自然的邪恶。教会一直都有好战的一面，圣殿骑士营和农民民兵准备面对亡灵、狼人或其他可怕的威胁。但怜悯和慈善是教会的核心价值，圣殿骑士的任务是保护所有无辜者。即使在最后一次战争期间，如果一个布雷利什村庄出现了邪恶的威胁，瑟兰圣殿骑士会与当地人结盟以结束威胁。并非所有瑟兰人都能达到这一理想。狂热的瑟兰人相信教会注定要在银色火焰下重新统一加利法尔，而腐败的牧师们只对权力和财富感兴趣。",
	"Not all priests are clerics, and the typical templar is a mundane warrior. However, due to the deep faith of its people, Thrane produces more clerics and paladins than any other nation in Khorvaire.": "并非所有的牧师都是神职人员，典型的圣殿骑士是一个世俗的战士。然而，由于其人民的深刻信仰，瑟兰产生的牧师和圣骑士比霍尔韦尔的任何其他国家都多。",

	"For most, these grim reminders of war strengthen Thrane resolve. The common people are united by their faith and sure of the righteousness of their cause.

People in a Thrane village regularly cooperate to raise a barn or practice archery in the fields.": "对大多数人来说，这些关于战争的严峻提醒加强了瑟兰的决心。普通人因为他们的信仰而团结起来，确信他们的事业是正义的。银色的火焰敦促人们在面对邪恶时团结一致，在全国范围内，村民们一起努力修复战争期间造成的损失。瑟兰村的人们经常合作饲养谷仓或在田间练习射箭。",
	"The Silver Flame urges its followers to feel compassion for all people, which often proves a more difficult challenge.

If these doubts spread, a serious faction might seek to restore Queen Diani to power.": "对大多数瑟兰人来说，这场战争加强了他们的信仰，并使他们团结在一起。然而，有些人质疑神权统治的有效性。这种怀疑甚至可以在最虔诚的信仰追随者中找到；这些人担心世俗和精神权力的合并会使教会偏离其应有的使命。如果这些怀疑蔓延开来，一个严重的派别可能会寻求恢复迪亚尼女王的权力。",

	"{@b Family Ties}. In a nation shaped by intrigue, you need someone you can rely on. For the Zil, that's family. Unless you're an orphan, discuss your family with your DM. What's their business? Who's your favorite relative? Are you currently involved in any family schemes? Family members might call on you for help over the course of your adventurers, but they can also be a resource for you.": "{@b Family Ties}. 在一个由阴谋塑造的国家，你需要一个你可以依靠的人。对于齐尔人来说，那就是家庭。除非你是个孤儿，否则要和你的管理人讨论你的家庭。他们的业务是什么？谁是你最喜欢的亲戚？你目前是否参与了任何家庭计划？在你的冒险过程中，家庭成员可能会向你寻求帮助，但他们也可以成为你的资源。",
	"{@b Knowledge and Power}. The Zil prize knowledge above all else. Sage is a suitable background for any Zil; charlatan and spy are also appropriate, reflecting their love of intrigue. Classes that specialize in melee combat are rare among the Zil. The soldiers of Zilargo include rogues, bards, wizards, and artificers.": "{@b Knowledge and Power}. 齐尔人把知识看得比什么都重要。贤者是任何齐尔人的合适背景；骗子和间谍也很合适，反映了他们对阴谋的热爱。专门从事近战的类别在齐尔人中是罕见的。齐拉尔戈的士兵包括流氓、吟游诗人、巫师和工匠。",
	"{@b The Trust}. In creating a Zil character, consider whether you have any ties to the Trust. A vast number of gnomes serve as the eyes and ears of the Trust, reporting interesting information to a Trust handler. As an active agent, you could receive missions tied to your current adventures. If you and your companions are fighting the Emerald Claw, you might have a secondary assignment to eliminate a specific Claw agent or acquire a particular object from their base. While the spy background is a logical choice for a Trust agent, the agency recruits characters of every class and background. Your class abilities reflect specialized training and granted abilities—the magical equivalent of spy gadgets!": "{@b The Trust}. 在创建Zil角色时，考虑你是否与信托基金有任何联系。大量的地精充当了信托的耳目，向信托的处理者报告有趣的信息。作为一个活跃的代理人，你可以接到与你当前的冒险有关的任务。如果你和你的同伴正在与翡翠之爪作战，你可能会有一个次要的任务，即消灭一个特定的爪子特工或从他们的基地获得一个特定的物体。虽然间谍背景是信托公司特工的合理选择，但该机构招募各种等级和背景的人物。你的等级能力反映了专门的训练和授予的能力--相当于间谍的魔法小工具",
	"The gnomes of Zilargo place a high value on appearances. They design beauty into their architecture, featuring delicate carvings, elaborate railings and balconies, and lavish gardens. Every community contains murals and statues scattered throughout. Most fixtures and buildings are designed for those of small stature, but buildings constructed for taller folk also exist. The Zil have a talent for illusion and for binding elementals, and they incorporate both of these forms of magic into everyday life.": "Zilargo的地精们非常重视外表。他们在建筑中设计美感，有精致的雕刻，精心设计的栏杆和阳台，以及豪华的花园。每个社区都有壁画和雕像散落在各处。大多数装置和建筑是为身材矮小的人设计的，但也有为高大的人建造的建筑。齐尔人有幻觉和束缚元素的天赋，他们将这两种形式的魔法融入日常生活中。",
	"Nestled against the base of the Seawall Mountains, Korranberg is the oldest city in Zilargo. Many aristocrats of other nations come to study in the famous library and the gnome colleges of Korranberg.

	"This port city draws musicians and artists from across Khorvaire. It addition to its legendary clubs and schools of music, Thurimbar is on the cutting edge of arcane sound—the use of illusion magic to generate music. Entertainers flock to Thurimbar to share their music and immerse themselves in its rich musical culture.": "这个港口城市吸引了来自霍尔韦尔各地的音乐家和艺术家。除了传说中的俱乐部和音乐学校之外，图林巴还处于奥秘声音的前沿--使用幻觉魔法来产生音乐。演艺人员涌向图林巴，分享他们的音乐并沉浸在其丰富的音乐文化中。",
	"With its crisscrossing canals and flooded streets, the capital of Zilargo serves as the center of the gnome shipbuilding industry and a nexus for trade. Scores of ships make port here daily.

	"Walking the streets of Korranberg, one might never know that the war occurred. Zilargo avoided most of the violence of the Last War, and cosmetic magic and illusions were employed to repair the few cities that suffered damage. Many Zil prefer to ignore the war completely, referring to it as \"that unpleasantness to the north.\" Nonetheless, Zilargo was a staunch ally of Breland during the war, providing the nation with ships, intelligence, and elemental weaponry. This aid left the nation with enemies. The Order of the Emerald Claw has launched attacks on Zil communities, and certain cells of Breland's Swords of Liberty accuse the Zil of manipulating Breland. The Trust has contained these attacks, but it always anticipates more trouble ahead.": "走在科兰伯格的街道上，人们可能永远不会知道战争的发生。齐拉尔戈避免了最后一次战争中的大部分暴力事件，并采用化妆魔法和幻觉来修复少数遭受破坏的城市。许多齐尔人宁愿完全忽略这场战争，把它称为 \"北方的不愉快\"。尽管如此，齐拉尔戈在战争期间是布雷兰的坚定盟友，为国家提供了船只、情报和元素武器。这种援助给这个国家留下了敌人。翡翠之爪骑士团对齐尔社区发动了攻击，布雷兰的自由之剑的某些小组指责齐尔人操纵了布雷兰。信托会已经控制了这些攻击，但它总是预见到未来会有更多的麻烦。",

	"Aereni civilization is over twenty thousand years old. Secure in their island sanctuary, the elves watched nations of goblins and humans rise and fall. The Aereni possess secrets and powers the rest of Khorvaire has yet to discover, but they are more interested in perfecting their ancient traditions than in innovation and discovery. An Aereni wizard might spend a decade refining the pronunciation of a single spell's incantation. For now, humanity can't match the power of the elves. If that balance changes, will Aerenal take action?": "Aereni文明有两万多年的历史。在他们的岛屿避难所里，精灵们目睹了地精和人类国家的兴衰。Aereni拥有Khorvaire其他地区尚未发现的秘密和力量，但他们对完善其古老的传统比对创新和发现更感兴趣。一个Aereni巫师可能会花十年时间来完善一个咒语的发音。目前，人类还无法与精灵的力量相提并论。如果这种平衡发生变化，艾瑞尼会采取行动吗？",

If you know anything about Aerenal, you've surely heard of the Undying Court, the deathless cabinet that guides the nation. Only the grandest members of society win elevation to the Undying Court, but there are many forms of preservation. Go to the Dalaen Forge and you'll see the ghost of Old Dalaen advising his descendants as they work wood and steel. Visit the Eidolon Tavern and you'll see poltergeists mixing drinks, and you can get advice from a spectral bartender with thousands of years of wisdom to share.

	"Wondrous as it is, as a human visitor, I found it more than a little unnerving. There's no escaping the past in Aerenal; it lingers all around you, whispering advice or warning you to avoid transgression.

	"Any time someone descends below the surface of the world, they enter Khyber. But the underworld takes two very different forms.

Because the demiplanes connect to the world at random, you never know what you might find when you venture into the depths. A newly opened chasm in the sewers could be an entirely mundane hole in the ground, or it could be a passage to the Abyssal Forests of Khar.": "这些联系以多种方式影响世界。黑暗势力可以在世界的任何地方兴起，从以前未知的门户迸发到开伯尔。这一事实决定了银焰教会的主要任务：随时准备保护无辜者免受这种非自然的威胁。由于半平面与世界的连接是随机的，你永远不知道当你冒险进入深处时会发现什么。下水道中新打开的裂缝可能是一个完全平凡的地洞，也可能是通往卡尔深渊森林的通道。",

Wondrous treasures might wait in the worlds below amid hordes of demons and aberrations.": "开伯尔的许多层都有相似之处，只是它们的怪异和致命性。Eberron是自然界；Khyber是恶魔和怪兽的源头，也是外来的daelkyr的领域。一些 \"地下龙 \"的崇拜者相信，天堂在内太阳谷等待着他们，但这些崇拜者也认为胡言乱语的人和思想混乱者是美丽的生物。在成群结队的恶魔和反常者中，奇妙的宝藏可能在下面的世界等待着。",

	"Khyber is an ever-present threat. Any deep passage could connect to a realm of fiends or spew out an army of aberrations. Despite the magnitude of this threat, portals to Khyber are very rare, and they are stable once found. If you dig a hole in the ground, the odds that you'll eventually reach the Vale of the Inner Sun are infinitesimal. And if a portal to Khyber existed in the sewers of Fairhaven, odds are good that it would already have been discovered. The risk arises when you're exploring passages where no one has gone before. The sewers of Fairhaven might be safe today, but if an earthquake opens a new shaft or a group of cultists digs deeper, a previously unknown passage to Khyber could be uncovered. Wherever a passage to Khyber appears, monsters and dark powers can rise up to threaten the world above.": "开伯尔是一个无处不在的威胁。任何深层通道都可能连接到恶魔的领域或喷出畸形人的军队。尽管这种威胁很大，但通往开伯尔的门户却非常罕见，而且一旦找到就很稳定。如果你在地上挖一个洞，最终到达内太阳谷的几率是无限小的。如果费尔哈文的下水道里有一个通往开伯尔的入口，那么很有可能它已经被发现了。当你探索以前没有人去过的通道时，风险就会出现。今天费尔哈文的下水道可能是安全的，但如果地震打开了一个新的竖井，或者一群邪教徒挖得更深，一个以前未知的通往开伯尔的通道就可能被发现。无论通往开伯尔的通道出现在哪里，怪物和黑暗势力都会崛起，威胁到上面的世界。",
	"Cults of the Dragon Below often have ties to Khyber. Some serve aberrations or fight alongside dolgrims and dolgaunts (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}). Others can unintentionally threaten a community by releasing something from the underworld: an unnatural disease, a malevolent demon, or a strange and addictive drug. In dealing with such a cult, the question is not only how to stop their current machinations, but how to seal the passage or prevent it from posing an ongoing threat.": "下面的龙的邪教往往与开伯尔有联系。有些人为畸形人服务，或与多尔格瑞姆和多尔冈特人并肩作战（见（%0%））。还有一些人可能会无意中从冥界释放出一些东西来威胁社区：一种非自然的疾病、一个恶毒的恶魔，或者一种奇怪的、令人上瘾的药物。在处理这样的邪教时，问题不仅在于如何阻止他们目前的阴谋，而且在于如何封住通道或防止它构成持续的威胁。",
	"Treasures from Khyber can take many forms. The daelkyr create living tools, including symbionts (see {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), but any magic item could be presented as an organic creation: a living {@item Cape of the Mountebank||cloak of the mountebank} that teleports its wearer through the plane of madness; a {@item dagger of venom} made from chitin and muscle, similar to a scorpion's barb; a {@item crystal ball} made by the daelkyr {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} that looks like a giant eye, casting visions of distant places directly into the wielder's mind. Items recovered from fiendish demiplanes might be constructed from standard materials but have a sinister aspect or appearance, such as a {@item sword of life stealing} from the Abyssal Forest of Khar made of jagged, blackened steel.

Outsiders are rarely welcome within the walls of Dar Qat.": "里德拉的灵感领主和霍尔韦尔的人民一样，对Xen'drik的资源感兴趣。Dar Qat是里德兰的一个港口，是一个由闪闪发光的水晶（生长出来的水晶和钢铁一样坚固）建成的堡垒，附近的一块巨石使之相形见绌，据说是城市的精神支柱。达卡特的城墙很少欢迎外来者。",
	"Once a haven for pirates and smugglers, Stormreach has become a thriving port that serves as the passage to the Xen'drik interior. All the dragonmarked houses have outposts in the city, and it is home to refugees, renegades, criminals, and others who have no place on the other continents. The city is ruled by the council of Storm Lords, who hold absolute power. As Stormreach is built on the foundations of an ancient giant city, ruins abound around and below the city. Some fear that if the city continues to expand, the growth will trigger an ancient curse. But for now, Stormreach is a prosperous community and a gateway to adventure.": "暴风城曾经是海盗和走私者的天堂，现在已经成为一个繁荣的港口，是通往Xen'drik内陆的通道。所有有龙纹的家族都在这个城市设有前哨站，这里是难民、叛徒、罪犯和其他在其他大陆没有地位的人的家。这座城市由拥有绝对权力的风暴领主议会统治。由于暴风城是建立在一个古老的巨型城市的基础上，城市周围和下面有很多废墟。有些人担心，如果城市继续扩张，其增长将触发一个古老的诅咒。但现在，Stormreach是一个繁荣的社区，是通往冒险的大门。",

The primitive drow make armor comparable to studded leather using the chitin of giant scorpions. Rumors abound of more advanced drow civilizations in the layers of Khyber that lie beneath Xen'drik. The elves lived and fought in Xen'drik before the exodus that took them to Aerenal, and elven artifacts remain scattered across the region. And the grandest treasures include the work of the giants—which can often be difficult to use because of their size. The spellbook of a giant wizard might hold priceless secrets, but the bulky tome can be quite awkward for smaller folk.": "Xen'drik人的巨大多样性意味着没有一个单一的特征可以定义这片土地上的物品和工艺品。原始的乌鸦人用巨蝎的甲壳素制作出堪比钉子皮的盔甲。在Xen'drik下面的Khyber层，有很多关于更先进的乌鸦文明的传言。精灵们在出走到阿伦纳尔之前，曾在Xen'drik生活和战斗过，精灵的文物仍然散落在这个地区。而最宏伟的宝藏包括巨人的作品--由于他们的体型，这些作品往往难以使用。巨人巫师的法术书可能蕴含着无价的秘密，但笨重的书本对小个子来说可能相当笨拙。",

Anyone who seeks to protect the innocent and battle evil can draw on the power of the Silver Flame to aid them, but they must beware of the Shadow in the Flame, the demon that still lingers and yearns to trick good people into evil.": "每个瑟兰的孩子都知道提拉-米隆的故事。几个世纪前，被锁在世界中的一个古老而强大的恶魔挣脱了束缚，给瑟兰的人民带来了可怕的痛苦。如果不是提拉-米隆，这个国家将被摧毁。这位圣骑士受到银色火焰的召唤，与强大的恶魔进行了战斗。当霸主显然无法被摧毁时，提拉献出了自己的生命，将她的精神与银色火焰的光芒结合起来，再次束缚了恶魔。现在，提拉作为 \"火焰之声\"，帮助其他人找到光明。任何寻求保护无辜者和与邪恶作斗争的人都可以借助银色火焰的力量来帮助他们，但他们必须提防火焰中的阴影，这个恶魔仍在徘徊，并渴望将好人诱入邪恶。",
	"The nation of Thrane shocked the world in 993 YK when it appointed a six-year-old child as Keeper of the Silver Flame, the supreme leadership position of the Church. Now eleven years old, Jaela Daran continues to astound all who encounter her. She possesses poise and wisdom beyond her years, and she displays the blend of courage and compassion that is the cornerstone of the faith. As Keeper of the Flame, she wields tremendous divine power; she has summoned angels to her side and resurrected Cardinal Halidor after his assassination.": "瑟兰国在993年震惊了世界，它任命一个六岁的孩子为银色火焰的守护者，这是教会的最高领导职位。现在11岁了，杰拉-达兰继续让所有遇到她的人感到震惊。她拥有超越其年龄的风度和智慧，她表现出勇气和同情心的融合，这是信仰的基石。作为火焰的守护者，她拥有巨大的神力；她曾召唤天使到她身边，并在红衣主教哈利多被暗杀后使他复活。",
	"But some claim that these stories are fabrications and that Jaela is merely a figurehead for High Cardinal Krozen. The reclusive Krozen is a brilliant strategist and ruthless leader. Many believe that Krozen was behind the death of Keeper Tagor in 992 YK, suggesting that he supported the child Keeper to solidify his own influence. Is Krozen the true power behind the Flame?": "但有人声称，这些故事都是捏造的，杰拉只是大红衣主教克里夫的一个形象代言人。隐居的克罗夫是一位出色的战略家和无情的领导者。许多人认为，克里夫是992年塔戈尔守护者之死的幕后黑手，这表明他支持儿童守护者以巩固自己的影响力。克罗伊夫是烈焰背后的真正力量吗？",
	"A pillar of argent fire marks the point of Tira's sacrifice, the center of the modern church. This pillar, located in Flamekeep, is a manifestation of the Silver Flame, not the source of its power.": "一根银色的火柱标志着提拉的牺牲点，即现代教堂的中心。这根柱子位于Flamekeep，是银色火焰的一种表现形式，而不是其力量的来源。",
	"The church's templars stand ready to protect the innocent from supernatural threats, battling undead, fiends, and aberrations. Friars and ministers fight evil by doing good, performing acts of compassion and charity across Khorvaire. In contrast to the Sovereign Host, the church maintains a defined structure and creed. Archbishops monitor regions; cardinals lead the church; and the ultimate authority is the Keeper of the Flame, who maintains the font in Flamekeep and communes with Tira Miron.": "教会的圣殿骑士随时准备保护无辜者免受超自然的威胁，与亡灵、恶魔和反常者战斗。修士和牧师们通过行善来对抗邪恶，在整个霍尔韦尔进行慈悲和慈善活动。与君主教会相比，该教会保持着明确的结构和信条。大主教监督各地区；红衣主教领导教会；而最终的权威是火焰守护者，他维护着火焰守护的字体，并与提拉-米隆交流。",
	"The Last War had a serious impact on the church. Leaders still respected the Keeper's authority over spiritual matters, but the war wasn't about good or evil. Templars of all nations still joined together to fight demons, but if no supernatural threat was present, they fought for their own nations. This division allowed cracks to form in the foundation. In Breland, some priests fell prey to greed or forged ties to criminal organizations. In Aundair, a zealous faction known as the Pure Flame advocates using violence rather than compassion as the primary tool for rooting out evil. And in Thrane, the church has become the ruling body. While still driven by Tira's principles of redemption and sacrifice, the intrusion of politics means that some come to the faith seeking power rather than purely to do good.": "最后的战争对教会产生了严重的影响。领导人仍然尊重守护者在精神事务上的权威，但战争并不是关于善或恶。所有国家的圣殿骑士仍然联合起来与恶魔作战，但如果没有超自然的威胁，他们就为自己的国家而战。这种分裂使基础形成了裂缝。在布雷兰，一些牧师因贪婪而堕落，或与犯罪组织建立了联系。在昂代尔，一个被称为 \"纯净之火 \"的狂热派别主张以暴力而非同情心作为根除邪恶的主要工具。而在瑟兰，教会已经成为统治机构。虽然仍然受到提拉的救赎和牺牲原则的驱使，但政治的侵入意味着一些人来到信仰中寻求权力，而不是纯粹为了行善。",

	"Last month, the Emerald Claw took credit for the ghoul outbreak in Wroat. This terrorist organization has a new and unusual critic: Hask Malevanor, an \"abactor\" of the Blood of Vol and high priest of the Crimson Monastery, a temple in the city of Atur in Karrnath. Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life. Despite the fact that the terrorists included priests from his church, Malevanor insists that his parishioners despise the Emerald Claw and harbor no hostility toward Breland.": "上个月，翡翠之爪为沃罗特的食尸鬼爆发立下汗马功劳。这个恐怖组织有一个新的不寻常的批评者：哈斯克-马勒瓦诺（Hask Malevanor），他是沃尔之血的 \"守护者\"，也是深红修道院（位于卡尔纳特的阿图尔市）的大祭司。关于Abactor Malevanor，你还应该知道一些事情：他已经死了50多年了！这个腐朽的牧师说，有一个人在他身边。这个腐朽的牧师说，他的状况没有任何不神圣的地方，他发誓他的人民崇尚所有的生命。尽管恐怖分子中包括他的教会的牧师，但马勒瓦诺坚持说他的教友们鄙视翡翠之爪，对布雷兰德没有敌意。",
	"While we'd like to take the abactor at his word, our research shows that Malevanor was personally involved in the program that produced the infamous Karrnathi undead soldiers. After decades of driving the Karrnathi war effort, this foul creature expects us to believe that he has nothing to do with the necromantic attacks on our people? Here at the {@i Voice of Breland}, we think something about this smells rotten, and it's not just the mummy.": "虽然我们愿意相信这位检察官的话，但我们的研究表明，马勒瓦诺亲自参与了生产臭名昭著的卡尔纳提亡灵士兵的计划。在推动卡尔纳提的战争努力数十年后，这个肮脏的生物希望我们相信他与对我们的人进行的亡灵攻击无关？在{@i Voice of Breland}这里，我们认为这件事有一些腐烂的味道，而且不只是木乃伊。",
	"What just god would allow death and suffering? The Blood of Vol teaches that we all have the potential to become divine beings—and that death is a curse, designed to kill you before you can unlock the divinity within you.": "什么公正的神会允许死亡和痛苦？沃尔之血》告诉我们，我们都有成为神性生命的潜力--而死亡是一种诅咒，目的是在你能够释放你内心的神性之前杀死你。",
	"The Blood of Vol is a grim faith, founded by Erandis d'Vol, an elf from Aerenal. It asserts that death is oblivion, that the universe is uncaring, and that if the Sovereigns exist, they are cruel. Its followers study the secrets of blood and life, and because they believe that death is the end, they see nothing wrong with using the bodies of the fallen to serve the living. Seekers of the Divinity Within (as the faithful call themselves) are glad to be reanimated after death; at least they can do some good.": "沃尔之血是一种严峻的信仰，由艾瑞纳尔的精灵埃兰迪斯-多尔（Erandis d'Vol）创立。它宣称死亡就是遗忘，宇宙是无情的，如果主权者存在，他们也是残忍的。它的追随者研究血液和生命的秘密，因为他们相信死亡就是结束，所以他们认为利用堕落者的身体来为活人服务没有错。内在神性的探索者（信徒自称）很高兴在死后被复活；至少他们可以做一些好事。",
	"Because of this association with necromancy, many believe the Blood of Vol embraces death and its followers want to become undead. Both ideas are false. The Blood of Vol sees death as the ultimate evil. Seekers don't want to become undead; they want to become divine beings. The faith teaches that divinity is tied to blood and soul, and the undead can never fully harness that power. The mummies and vampires of the Blood of Vol have sacrificed their chance at divinity to guide the living. They're martyrs, not something to envy.": "由于与死灵法术的联系，许多人认为沃尔之血拥抱死亡，其追随者希望成为不死之身。这两种想法都是错误的。沃尔之血认为死亡是终极邪恶。寻求者并不想成为不死之身；他们想成为神性的存在。该信仰教导人们，神性与血液和灵魂息息相关，而亡灵永远无法完全驾驭这种力量。沃尔之血的木乃伊和吸血鬼已经牺牲了他们获得神性的机会来引导活人。他们是殉道者，不值得羡慕。",
	"In addition to a general revulsion toward the undead, the public opinion of the Blood of Vol is colored by the actions of the Order of the Emerald Claw. This extremist sect serves a lich known as the Queen of Death, and it employs necromantic magic in acts of terror. However, most Seekers don't support the Emerald Claw.": "除了对亡灵的普遍反感之外，公众对沃尔之血的看法也因翡翠之爪骑士团的行为而变得丰富多彩。这个极端教派为一个被称为死亡女王的巫师服务，并在恐怖行动中使用亡灵魔法。然而，大多数探索者并不支持绿宝石之爪。",

	"The power of a cleric of the Blood of Vol comes from within them. As such, every cleric chooses a unique holy symbol—an object that resonates with them.

Priests of the Blood of Vol wear robes of red and black.": "沃尔之血教士的力量来自于他们的内心。因此，每个教士都会选择一个独特的神圣符号--一个能与他们产生共鸣的物体。一般来说，信仰的代表是一颗眼泪状的红色宝石或玻璃碎片。沃尔之血的牧师穿着红色和黑色的长袍。",
	"The services of the Blood of Vol focus on drawing the faithful together as a community and encouraging people to find power within themselves. The most important ritual of the faith is the Sacrament of Blood. After a sermon, each member of the congregation sheds a small amount of blood into a basin. This is a symbol of unity, and a message that members of the community would shed their blood to defend one another. In some temples, this blood is donated to vampire champions of the faith.": "沃尔之血的仪式主要是把信徒们作为一个群体吸引到一起，鼓励人们在自己的内心找到力量。该信仰最重要的仪式是血的圣事。讲道结束后，每个教徒都会将少量的血流到一个盆里。这是团结的象征，也是社会成员为保护彼此而流下鲜血的信息。在一些寺庙中，这些血被捐献给信仰的吸血鬼冠军。",
	"A shrine devoted to the Blood of Vol requires only an altar and a means for collecting ritually spilled blood.": "献给沃尔之血的神龛只需要一个祭坛和收集仪式上洒下的血的方法。",

Temples include vaults or catacombs, designed to hold undead or to store corpses.": "沃尔之血的寺庙是强化的结构，是为了作为圣地而建造的。与银色火焰不同的是，这种寺庙是呆板而实用的。寺庙包括拱顶或地下墓穴，旨在容纳亡灵或储存尸体。",

Other cultists may not recognize the true nature of the beings they serve. A cult of {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} might truly believe their lord will bring peace to the world, even if that peace must begin with bloody war.

	"Some followers of this faith believe that meditation alone is sufficient to change the path of the world, that merely contemplating the light is sufficient to bring about the change.

If you're a wizard, you've studied the spells created by your ancestor. If you're a warrior, you've practiced their specific martial techniques. When you trance, you relive their greatest battles. But these studies are just preparation. Now it's your sacred duty to be a revenant of your ancestor: to live your life as they did and allow the champion to walk the world again through you. (This title of revenant carried by Speakers of the Past is not to be confused with the undead revenants described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}.)": "作为瓦勒纳尔的泰尔纳达尔精灵，你是在你的族人的传说中长大的，在与强大的龙和巨人军队作战的冠军故事中长大的。当你成年后，过去的守护者们通过阅读标志来确定这些祖先中的哪一位选择你作为他们的容器。从那一天起，你就有责任效仿你的守护者祖先。如果你是一个巫师，你就研究你的祖先创造的法术。如果你是一个战士，你已经练习了他们特定的武术技巧。当你精神恍惚时，你会重温他们最伟大的战役。但这些研究只是准备。现在你的神圣职责是成为你祖先的复仇者：像他们那样生活，让冠军通过你再次行走在这个世界上。(这个由过去的演讲者携带的复仇者头衔不能与{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的亡灵复仇者相混淆)。",
	"The bond between ancestor and living elf is holy. Your ancestor doesn't speak to you or control your actions. But as a Tairnadal, you believe that they are with you—that your instincts and your reflexes are the ancestor moving through you, telling you what to do. The closer you follow the path, the more guidance they provide, helping you create new legends.": "祖先和活着的精灵之间的联系是神圣的。你的祖先不会对你说话，也不会控制你的行动。但作为一个泰尔纳达尔人，你相信他们与你同在--你的本能和你的反射是祖先在你身上移动，告诉你该怎么做。你走得越近，他们提供的指导就越多，帮助你创造新的传奇。",
	"The folk of Khorvaire see your people as mercenaries and conquerors. But you don't care about gold or personal glory. All you want is to let your ancestors live again, and that means you need to perform deeds worthy of champions. That drives you now: seeking out adventures that will add to the legends of your patron.": "霍尔韦尔的民众将你们的人视为雇佣兵和征服者。但你们并不关心黄金或个人荣誉。你所想要的是让你的祖先重新活下来，这意味着你需要完成值得冠军的事迹。这就是你现在的动力：寻找冒险，为你的守护者增添传奇色彩。",
	"You and your DM should develop the identity of your ancestor. How did they fight? What were some of their legendary deeds? Did they have a distinctive weapon or favor a particular kind of magic? Equally important is your relationship with the ancestor. Are you proud of your ancestor and excited to live as they did, or is your duty a burden?": "你和你的DM应该发展你祖先的身份。他们是如何战斗的？他们有哪些传奇性的事迹？他们是否有独特的武器或喜欢某种特殊的魔法？同样重要的是你与祖先的关系。你是否为你的祖先感到骄傲，并为能像他们那样生活而兴奋，还是你的职责是一种负担？",
	"Since the rise of Valenar, half-elves and even some humans have sought to be inducted into the faith. But so far the Keepers of the Past have declared that only elves can be revenants. Beyond the blood connection to the ancestor, an elf communes with their ancestor during trance, and half-elves can't enter this state. The Keepers say it can't be done, but perhaps you'll be the one to prove them wrong.": "自从瓦勒纳崛起以来，半精灵甚至一些人类都试图被纳入信仰。但到目前为止，过去的守护者们宣布只有精灵可以成为复仇者。除了与祖先的血缘关系外，精灵在恍惚中与他们的祖先交流，而半精灵不能进入这种状态。守护者们说这是不可能的，但也许你会成为证明他们错误的人。",
	"The primary symbol of the faith is the zaelshin, an amulet that bears the seal of your patron ancestor and worn either as a brooch or embedded in the forehead of a helmet. A devotee of the faith typically wears a veil—the zaelta, or \"spirit mask\"—over their lower face while in battle or performing rituals, so an opponent sees the zaelshin rather than the living elf.": "信仰的主要标志是zaelshin，一种带有你的守护祖先印记的护身符，作为胸针佩戴或嵌入头盔的前额。信仰的信徒在战斗或举行仪式时通常戴着面纱--zaelta，或 \"精神面具\"--遮住他们的下脸，因此对手看到的是zaelshin而不是活着的精灵。",
	"The zaelshin is the symbol of the faith, but the holy symbol used by a cleric is an object associated with their personal ancestor.": "zaelshin是信仰的象征，但教士使用的圣物是与他们个人祖先有关的物品。",
	"Services revolve around the stories of the ancestors, commemorating their glorious deeds, as well as ritual exercises and trance meditation. While resting, an elf spends four hours in trance. The faithful spend this time in communion with their ancestor, experiencing their memories and contemplating their deeds.": "仪式围绕着祖先的故事进行，纪念他们的光荣事迹，以及仪式练习和恍惚冥想。在休息的时候，一个精灵会花四个小时的时间进行恍惚。信徒们在这段时间里与他们的祖先交流，体验他们的记忆，思考他们的事迹。",
	"The nomadic Tairnadal elves don't raise permanent temples. A Keeper of the Past marks a circle on the ground with their blade, and the space within becomes sanctified for the service.": "游牧的泰尔纳达尔精灵并不建造永久性的神庙。过去的守护者用他们的刀在地上划出一个圆圈，里面的空间就成为神圣的服务。",
	"Our greatest champions and sages will never be lost to us. Their wisdom guides us, and their power protects us all.": "我们最伟大的冠军和圣人将永远不会被我们所遗忘。他们的智慧指引着我们，他们的力量保护着我们所有人。",
	"Honor our past. Respect our traditions. Perfect your skills and you may earn your place among the Deathless.": "尊敬我们的过去。尊重我们的传统。完善你的技能，你就可以在不死族中赢得你的地位。",
	"Destroy those foul creatures that channel the power of Mabar, for they consume the essence of our world.": "摧毁那些引导马巴尔力量的肮脏生物，因为它们吞噬了我们世界的精华。",
	"The elves of Aerenal refuse to let their greatest souls be lost to the oblivion that is Dolurrh. The wisest and most accomplished elves are preserved after death, becoming members of the Undying Court. The devotion of the living elves sustains the Undying Court, and the Court generates a well of mystic energy that empowers their clerics. As an Aereni cleric, your spells aren't personally granted to you by a specific Undying Councilor. Your powers flow from the Court itself, allowing you to serve its will and to protect your people.": "Aerenal的精灵们拒绝让他们最伟大的灵魂消失在Dolurrh的遗忘中。最有智慧和最有成就的精灵在死后被保留下来，成为不死阁的成员。活着的精灵们的奉献精神支撑着不死阁，而不死阁产生了一个神秘的能量井，为他们的神职人员提供能量。作为一个Aereni教士，你的法术并不是由特定的不死阁成员亲自授予的。你的力量来自法院本身，使你能够服务于它的意志并保护你的人民。",
	"Of all the religions of Eberron, the Undying Court is most grounded in the world. The Court stands in the city of Shae Mordai, and as an Aerenal elf, you could seek an audience with one of your deathless ancestors. As a devotee of the Undying Court, you recognize it as the power that sustains your civilization and as an assembly of your greatest sages and leaders. Should you accomplish great achievements in your life, you can aspire to join the Court.": "在Eberron的所有宗教中，不死阁是最接地气的宗教。不死阁矗立在Shae Mordai城，作为一个Aerenal精灵，你可以寻求与你的不死祖先之一会面。作为不死阁的信徒，你认识到它是维持你的文明的力量，是你最伟大的圣人和领袖的集会。如果你在你的生活中取得了巨大的成就，你可以渴望加入法庭。",
	"As a cleric or paladin of the Undying Court, you have a concrete relationship with your deity. In creating your character, consider why you've traveled so far from home. Are you on a specific mission? Are you serving the Court as a whole, or are you acting as an agent of a specific councilor—perhaps your own ancestor? The Undying Court despises undead creatures that prey on the living, so if you don't have a concrete mission, you can always hunt down undead and evil necromancers.": "作为不死阁的牧师或圣骑士，你与你的神灵有一种具体的关系。在创建你的角色时，考虑你为什么要离家这么远。你是在执行一个特定的任务吗？你是在为整个不死鸟法庭服务，还是作为一个特定的理事--也许是你自己的祖先--的代理人行事？不死鸟法庭鄙视那些捕食活人的不死生物，所以如果你没有具体的任务，你可以随时猎杀不死生物和邪恶的死灵法师。",
	"The symbol of the Undying Court is a golden mask with luminous eyes, worn over the face while a priest is carrying out their duties. Devotees wear a smaller mask as a brooch or amulet.": "不死阁的象征是一个金色的面具，有发光的眼睛，在牧师执行任务时戴在脸上。虔诚的信徒会佩戴一个较小的面具作为胸针或护身符。",
	"The most sacred rite of the Undying Court is trance communion. While in trance, an Aereni elf engages in meditation that connects them to the gestalt consciousness of the Court. This experience affirms the place of the individual as part of the greater whole.": "不朽之庭最神圣的仪式是恍惚共融。在精神恍惚时，艾瑞尼精灵会进行冥想，将他们与法院的格式塔意识联系起来。这种体验肯定了个人作为大整体的一部分的地位。",
	"Since trance communion is a personal experience, the role of the priest is to provide spiritual and practical guidance to their congregation. A masked priest serves as the face of the Court, and any elf can approach them seeking an ease to their burdens.": "由于恍惚共融是一种个人体验，牧师的作用是为他们的会众提供精神和实际指导。一个戴着面具的牧师作为法庭的代言人，任何精灵都可以接近他们，寻求减轻他们的负担。",
	"In Aerenal, the temples of the Undying Court are step pyramids built from stone. In Khorvaire, shrines to the Court use imported Aereni densewood, a particularly tough lumber that grows only on the island. Regardless of form, the walls are engraved with stories about the Undying Councilors that serve as the particular patrons of the temple, usually those related to the local priests.": "在Aerenal，不死阁的神庙是用石头建造的阶梯式金字塔。在霍尔韦尔，不死鸟法庭的神殿使用进口的艾瑞尼密林，这是一种特别坚硬的木材，只在岛上生长。无论哪种形式，墙壁上都刻有作为神庙特定赞助人的不死族议员的故事，通常是与当地牧师有关的人。",
	"The alliance of rebel farmers in western Aundair has declared an alliance with the Great Druid Oalian of the Towering Wood, asserting that the farmlands that border these woods are now part of the Eldeen Reaches. The Great Druid is a figure of legend, a powerful mystic who serves as the spiritual leader of a diverse range of druids spread across the region. Another interesting fact about Oalian? He's a tree! Some say he's a child of Eberron herself, while others assert that he's the spirit of an ancient druid trapped in tree form. Whatever the truth, the Great Druid Oalian appears as a massive greatpine in a grove called Greenheart, deep in the Towering Wood.": "昂代尔西部的反叛农民联盟已经宣布与高耸森林的大德鲁伊奥里安结盟，宣称与这些森林接壤的农田现在是艾尔迪恩河谷的一部分。大德鲁伊是一个传奇人物，是一个强大的神秘主义者，是遍布该地区的各种德鲁伊的精神领袖。关于Oalian的另一个有趣的事实？他是一棵树! 有人说他是艾伯伦自己的孩子，也有人断言他是一个古代德鲁伊的灵魂，被困于树形。无论真相如何，伟大的德鲁伊-奥里安是以一棵巨大的大松树出现在高耸的森林深处一个叫绿心的小树林里。",
	"We, the Ashbound, are the champions of the natural world. We defend it from anything and anyone who threatens it.": "我们，Ashbound人，是自然界的捍卫者。我们保护它不受任何东西和任何人的威胁。",
	"We, the Children of Winter, preserve the natural cycle of life and death. Disease and decay cull the weak and strengthen the whole. We must destroy undead and ensure that the cycle continues.": "我们，冬之子，维护着生命和死亡的自然循环。疾病和腐烂淘汰弱者，强化整体。我们必须消灭亡灵，确保这个循环继续下去。",
	"We, the Gatekeepers, protect the natural world from the forces that come from outside it, from those beings that slither in from the darkness beyond.": "我们，守门人，保护自然界不受来自外界的力量影响，不受那些从黑暗中溜进来的生命的影响。",
	"We, the Greensingers, celebrate the magic in the natural world, as well as the fey that embody that magic. We serve as ambassadors between the fey and mortals, protecting each from the other.": "我们，格林辛格人，赞美自然界的魔法，以及体现这种魔法的精灵。我们作为精灵和凡人之间的使者，保护每一个精灵免受对方的伤害。",
	"We, the Wardens of the Wood, protect all the children of Eberron, from the beasts of the wild to the people of the cities. We preserve the balance between nature and civilization and help each understand the other.": "我们，森林守护者，保护Eberron的所有孩子，从野外的野兽到城市的人们。我们保护自然与文明之间的平衡，并帮助双方了解对方。",
	"All druids look after the natural world, but they act in different ways. Five well-established paths define most of Khorvaire's druids. In creating a druid character, consider whether you have ties to one of these traditions, and what led you to leave your order. Are you on a mission? Are you exploring the world? Have you been banished, with good reason or otherwise?": "所有德鲁伊都关注自然世界，但他们的行动方式不同。五条成熟的道路定义了霍尔韦尔的大部分德鲁伊。在创建德鲁伊角色时，考虑你是否与这些传统之一有联系，以及是什么导致你离开你的秩序。你在执行任务吗？你在探索这个世界吗？你是否被放逐了，无论是否有充分的理由？",
	"The Ashbound defend the natural world from anything that threatens it. Some Ashbound consider civilization to be a threat and strike at any settlement that encroaches on the wild. Others focus their wrath on the dragonmarked houses or seek to free bound elementals.": "Ashbound人保护自然界免受任何威胁。一些灰袍人认为文明是一种威胁，并对任何侵犯野生环境的定居点进行打击。其他人则将他们的愤怒集中在有龙纹的房子上，或者寻求释放被束缚的元素。",
	"The Children of Winter believe that death and decay are vital aspects of the natural cycle of life. They believe that if the cycle falls out of balance, it will trigger a devastating cataclysm as the world resets this balance. They battle undead, but they also engage in actions that cull the weak. Extremists have been known to spread plagues in cities. The Children of Winter are particularly interested in unraveling the mystery of the Mourning, as some of them believe it is a sign of the apocalypse they fear.": "冬之子相信，死亡和腐烂是生命自然循环的重要方面。他们相信，如果这个循环失去了平衡，就会引发一场毁灭性的大灾难，因为世界会恢复这种平衡。他们与亡灵作战，但他们也参与了清除弱者的行动。众所周知，极端分子会在城市中传播瘟疫。冬之子对解开哀伤之谜特别感兴趣，因为他们中的一些人认为这是他们所担心的世界末日的一个标志。",
	"The Gatekeepers are one of the oldest sects, primarily found among the orcs of the Shadow Marches. They act to protect Eberron from aberrations and other unnatural creatures and seek to prevent extraplanar incursions and attacks. The Gatekeepers maintain ancient seals that hold long-forgotten evils at bay.": "守门人是最古老的教派之一，主要在阴影地带的兽人中发现。他们保护艾伯伦不受异形和其他非自然生物的侵害，并寻求防止星外入侵和攻击。守门人维护着古老的封印，将被遗忘已久的邪恶阻挡在门外。",
	"The Greensingers are devoted to the fey, and serve as mediators between the fey and mortals. The ranks of the Greensingers include bards as well as warlocks with Archfey patrons; a druid or ranger might also serve a specific archfey.": "绿心人献身于精灵，在精灵和凡人之间充当调解人。绿衣人的队伍包括吟游诗人以及有大法师赞助的术士；德鲁伊或游侠也可能服务于某个特定的大法师。",
	"The Wardens of the Wood believe that civilization has a place in the world. As a warden, you help others understand nature, ensuring that they don't cause unintentional harm or stumble into danger. Wardens serve as militia and mediators in the Eldeen Reaches. This is the largest of the druidic sects and the most recognized.": "森林守护者相信，文明在这个世界上有一席之地。作为一名守护者，你帮助他人了解自然，确保他们不会造成无意的伤害或误入危险。典狱长在艾尔迪恩河谷充当民兵和调解员。这是德鲁伊教派中最大的教派，也是最受认可的教派。",
	"I've been here a week, and it's still hard not to feel overwhelmed by the city. The towers rise up until they disappear into the clouds. Lights gleam in a thousand windows. Skycoaches work their way through the maze of bridges connecting the towers, and up above I can see the burning ring of an elemental airship.": "我已经在这里呆了一个星期，仍然很难不被这座城市所淹没。高楼拔地而起，直到消失在云层中。一千多扇窗户上的灯光闪闪发光。空中客车在连接塔楼的迷宫般的桥梁中行驶，在上面我可以看到一个元素飞艇的燃烧环。",
	"Distracted by the sights in the sky, I nearly walk into a warforged as it brushes past me. It's my first time seeing one, but then there are so many things I've never seen in this place. Over there, a tattooed elf haggles with a masked halfling, arguing about the price of lizard meat. Beyond them, a gargoyle watches from a high perch. I gather my senses and keep moving.": "我被天空中的景象所吸引，当它从我身边经过时，我差点撞上了一个战神。这是我第一次看到，但在这个地方，有很多东西我都没见过。在那边，一个有纹身的精灵和一个戴面具的半身人讨价还价，为蜥蜴肉的价格争论不休。在他们身后，一个石像鬼在高处观望。我收起我的感觉，继续前进。",
	"It's not until I reach the lift that I realize the warforged stole my purse.": "直到我到达电梯，我才意识到战神偷了我的钱包。",
	"All the major themes of Eberron are manifest in the great city of Sharn. It's a place of magic, with skycoaches circling mile-high towers and mystic forges toiling endlessly in the bowels. It's a place of adventure and intrigue. A fallen angel is gathering minions in the ruins below the city. A gang war is gaining strength in Callestan. The corpse of a murdered aristocrat has just been discovered in a floating mansion. A Cannith artificer is experimenting with a planar gateway—and something is about to go terribly wrong. All of these adventures and a hundred more are waiting in the City of Towers.": "Eberron的所有主要主题都体现在伟大的城市Sharn中。这是一个充满魔法的地方，天空之车在一英里高的塔楼上盘旋，神秘的锻造厂在地底无休止地工作。这是一个充满冒险和阴谋的地方。一个堕落的天使正在城市下面的废墟中聚集爪牙。一场帮派战争在卡利斯坦逐渐壮大。一个被谋杀的贵族的尸体刚刚在一座漂浮的豪宅中被发现。一个坎尼斯人的工匠正在试验一个平面网关--而一些事情即将发生严重的错误。所有这些冒险以及更多的冒险都在塔楼之城中等待着。",
	"This chapter details the city for players and DMs alike. The DM can find additional information about the city in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}.": "本章为玩家和DM详细介绍了这个城市。DM可以在{@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}中找到关于这个城市的额外信息。",
	"Sharn is the largest city in Khorvaire, with a population of half a million people. Humans make up about a third of that number, and dwarves are a sixth of it; the rest is a blend of every race found across Khorvaire. Halflings, elves, and gnomes all have a significant presence in the city, but even kalashtar and changelings have communities in Sharn. Beyond the permanent population, tens of thousands of people pass through Sharn every day. Refugees from the war still find their way to the city, along with tourists, spies, merchants, and folk hoping to find their fortune in the grandest city in Eberron.": "沙恩是Khorvaire最大的城市，拥有50万人口。人类占了其中的三分之一，矮人占了六分之一；其余的则是在霍尔韦尔各地发现的各个种族的混合体。半身人、精灵和地精都在这个城市有很大的影响力，但即使是卡拉什塔人和变革者也在沙恩有自己的社区。除了常住人口，每天还有数以万计的人经过沙恩。从战争中逃出来的难民仍然会来到这座城市，还有游客、间谍、商人，以及希望在Eberron最宏伟的城市中找到财富的人们。",
	"Sharn stands above the Dagger River and its eastern tributary, the Hilt. It's an important port for anyone dealing with Aerenal, Xen'drik, or Sarlona. Mountains line the shores of the Dagger, and Sharn can't spread out. So instead it has grown ever upward.": "沙恩矗立在大刀河及其东部支流希尔特河之上。对于任何与Aerenal、Xen'drik或Sarlona打交道的人来说，它是一个重要的港口。匕首河岸边有很多山脉，沙恩不能向外扩张。因此，它反而不断向上发展。",
	"The city is primarily made up of these quarters:": "这座城市主要由这些街区组成。",
	"Central Plateau": "中部高原",
	"Menthis Plateau": "门斯高原",
	"Northedge": "ǞǞǞ",
	"Tavick's Landing": "塔维克岛",
	"At the hub of each of these quarters is a cluster of enormous core towers. A web of bridges and platforms connects many of these vast spires, and smaller turrets sprout from the edges of the core towers. The district of Skyway floats above the highest towers, while the tunnels of the Cogs stretch out below the lower city.": "在每个区的中心，都有一簇巨大的核心塔楼。一个由桥梁和平台组成的网络连接着许多这些巨大的尖塔，而较小的炮塔则从核心塔的边缘冒出来。Skyway区漂浮在最高的塔楼之上，而Cogs区的隧道则延伸到低层城市的下面。",
	"In between those extremes, each of the quarters is divided into an upper ward, a middle ward, and a lower ward. Each ward is made up of a number of districts, so that the location of a place in Sharn can be expressed with a combination of a ward name and a district name. More information about each of the wards and the districts in them appears later in this chapter.": "在这两个极端之间，每个区又分为上区、中区和下区。每个区由若干个区组成，因此，沙恩的一个地方的位置可以用区名和区名的组合来表示。关于每个区和其中的区的更多信息将在本章后面出现。",
	"Far from the front lines, Sharn never fell under siege during the Last War. Regardless, the war's impacts affected the city's citizens and continue to even today.": "远离前线，沙恩在最后一次战争中从未被围困。尽管如此，战争的影响仍然影响着城市的公民，甚至持续到今天。",
	"Although Sharn was never subjected to a sustained assault, it didn't avoid damage. On many occasions, commandos and saboteurs launched significant attacks inside Sharn. The most infamous of these was the Aundairian attack that brought down the floating Glass Tower, devastating the district now known as Fallen. In any of the lower or middle wards, you might encounter evidence of the conflict in the form of a shattered bridge, a building collapsed by an arcane explosion, or an area some say is haunted because of the large number of people killed there during the war.": "虽然沙恩从未遭受过持续的攻击，但它也没有避免损失。在许多情况下，突击队和破坏者在沙恩内部发动了重大的攻击。其中最臭名昭著的是昂代尔（Aundairian）的攻击，它使漂浮的玻璃塔倒下，破坏了现在被称为堕落的地区。在任何一个低级或中级区，你可能会遇到冲突的证据，如一座破碎的桥梁，一栋被奥术爆炸摧毁的建筑，或一个有人说是闹鬼的地方，因为战争期间有大量的人在那里被杀。",
	"There are places in the city that house people who suffered because of the actions of other nations. For example, many of the residents of Dura hold all Aundairians responsible for the destruction of Fallen. In another district, folk could hate the Karrns for an undead attack that occurred during the war, and a different group could blame Thrane for the siege of Vathirond. These kinds of sentiments can shape the feelings of an entire district, but in the city as a whole there are far more people who have personal burdens to carry than those who feel resentment toward particular nations. For instance, on an individual level, most members of the Sharn Watch might not care about a gnoll being seen in a neighborhood, but a guard who fought on the Droaam front during the war might be out for revenge. Warforged are sometimes also the targets of this sort of prejudice; a person whose friends were killed by warforged soldiers might resent all such creatures.": "城市里有一些地方住着因为其他国家的行为而受苦的人。例如，杜拉的许多居民认为所有昂代尔人都要对堕落的毁灭负责。在另一个地区，人们可能会因为战争期间发生的一次亡灵攻击而憎恨卡伦家族，而另一群人则会因为瓦西隆德的围困而指责瑟兰。这些情绪可以塑造整个地区的感情，但在整个城市中，有个人负担的人远多于对特定国家感到不满的人。例如，在个人层面上，大多数沙恩守望的成员可能并不在意一个地精在附近出现，但在战争期间在德罗阿姆前线作战的卫兵可能会去复仇。战神有时也是这种偏见的目标；一个朋友被战神士兵杀死的人可能会憎恨所有这种生物。",
	"Because the ink is barely dry on the Treaty of Thronehold and relationships between the signatories are still being normalized, Sharn doesn't currently benefit from a lot of commerce with other nations. Problems could arise from a short supply of any imported goods, whether this manifests as inflated prices, the need for rationing, or certain items being simply unavailable. The factors of supply and demand also play into smuggling and the black market; some desirable goods might be available only through the Boromar Clan.": "由于《王权条约》的墨迹尚未干透，签署方之间的关系仍在正常化，沙恩目前并没有从与其他国家的大量贸易中受益。任何进口商品的供应短缺都会产生问题，无论是表现为价格上涨、需要配给，还是某些物品根本无法获得。供应和需求的因素也会影响到走私和黑市；一些理想的商品可能只能通过波洛马氏族获得。",
	"Cyran refugees have filled the district of High Walls in Lower Tavick's Landing beyond capacity, and Sharn is also home to a significant number of refugees from elsewhere in Breland—people whose homes and villages were destroyed during the war, and who have come to Sharn in search of new lives. The city also has its share of other people harmed during the war, soldiers and civilians with severe physical or psychological injuries. All these folk are most likely to be found in the lower wards. They aren't just poor; they're suffering—and they might seek vengeance against those they blame for their pain.": "西兰的难民已经把下塔维克登陆区的高墙区塞得满满当当，沙恩也有大量来自布雷兰其他地方的难民--他们的家园和村庄在战争中被摧毁，他们来到沙恩寻找新的生活。这个城市也有其他在战争中受到伤害的人，有身体或心理上受到严重伤害的士兵和平民。所有这些人最有可能被发现在下层病房。他们不仅仅是穷人；他们在受苦--他们可能会对那些被他们指责为痛苦的人寻求报复。",
	"When you live on the inside low, you never see the sun. People hear \"towers,\" they think of graceful little spires, the sort of thing you see poking up in the corner of your lord's keep. We've got those, and lots of 'em. But the foundation of the city is the core towers. The walls of these towers are so thick you could fit your lord's castle in one.": "当你住在里面的低层时，你永远看不到太阳。人们听到 \"塔楼\"，就会想到优雅的小尖塔，就是那种你在领主的城堡角落里看到的东西。我们有那些，而且有很多。但城市的基础是核心塔楼。这些塔楼的墙壁非常厚，你可以把你的领主的城堡装在其中。",
	"You've got your outside districts where you get the open air, built on the bridges and platforms that connect the core towers together. You've got the little turrets, built on the core tower walls and the bridges between. You've got the folk in the middle, who live and work in the walls themselves. And then you've got those of us on the inside, our districts entirely contained in the hollow well of a great tower. When you look up in Callestan, you see twinkling lights, to be sure. But those aren't stars, and that isn't the sky. You're looking up through a mile of bridges and platforms crossing the well, looking up at the districts above you.": "你有你的外部区域，在那里你可以得到开放的空气，建立在连接核心塔楼的桥梁和平台上。你有小炮台，建在核心塔楼的墙壁和中间的桥梁上。你已经得到了中间的人，他们生活和工作在城墙本身。然后你有我们这些在里面的人，我们的地区完全包含在一个大塔的空心井里。当你在Callestan仰望时，你会看到闪烁的灯光，这是肯定的。但那些不是星星，那也不是天空。你是通过一英里长的桥梁和平台穿过井，抬头看你上面的地区。",
	"You live up high, you can touch the sky. In the middle you can still see the sun. Down on the inside low, all we have is gloom and the constant drip, water and worse descending from the city above us.": "你住在高处，你可以触摸到天空。在中间，你仍然可以看到太阳。在里面的低处，我们只有阴暗和不断的滴水，水和更坏的东西从我们上面的城市降下来。",
	"Sharn is the most cosmopolitan city on the continent. Describing all the activities and offerings in the city could fill an entire book. Here's a summary of what you need to know to appreciate the city to the fullest.": "沙恩是非洲大陆上最国际化的城市。描述这个城市的所有活动和产品可以写满一整本书。以下是你需要了解的内容，以充分欣赏这座城市。",
	"Just this week a Brelish woman in Middle Central was squashed to death when a drunk Cyran man fell on her from the upper wards. He survived. A good Brelish woman, a veteran of the Last War, cushioned his fall!": "就在本周，中环的一名布瑞利什妇女被压死了，因为一名喝醉酒的锡兰人从上层病房倒在她身上。他活了下来。一个好的布瑞利什女人，一个参加过最后一次战争的老兵，缓冲了他的坠落!",
	"This incident isn't the first of its kind. Last month a clumsy warforged crushed two innocent halfling lovers. Before that, a shifter thief fell from a tower, injuring an unsuspecting griffon. I propose a new law: No traveling the middle or upper wards without a feather token. These affordable trinkets are all that stand between our safety and death caused by some rat who would rather spend gold on drink.": "这起事件并不是第一次发生。上个月，一个笨拙的战争锻造者压死了两个无辜的半身人恋人。在此之前，一个变身盗贼从塔上掉下来，砸伤了一个毫无防备的狮鹫。我提议制定一项新的法律。没有羽毛令牌就不能在中区或上区旅行。在我们的安全和一些宁愿花金子喝酒的老鼠造成的死亡之间，这些实惠的饰品是唯一的屏障。",
	"As befits the City of Towers, Sharn is also a city of bridges and balconies. These thoroughfares and outcroppings can be extremely narrow or comfortably wide. Although most of them are bounded by walls or railings, there's always a chance that during your time in Sharn, you or someone you know will go over the edge. So, how do residents cope with this risk?": "与塔楼之城相称的是，沙恩也是一座桥梁和阳台的城市。这些大道和外墙可以是非常狭窄的，也可以是舒适宽阔的。虽然它们中的大多数都有墙壁或栏杆，但在沙恩的日子里，你或你认识的人总是有机会翻越边缘。那么，居民是如何应对这种风险的呢？",
	"Those who can afford it usually carry a {@item feather token|ERLW} as insurance. No token? Don't panic! Because of the maze of bridges and spans connecting the towers, there's an excellent chance that you won't fall more than a hundred feet before impacting on a lower bridge. Though this alone might seem like small comfort, it's also true that the major bridges in the upper and middle wards are enchanted with {@spell feather fall} effects that trigger automatically, keeping you from crushing an innocent passerby in your descent.": "那些有能力的人通常会携带一个（%0%）作为保险。没有代币？不要惊慌! 由于连接塔楼的桥梁和跨度的迷宫，有一个极好的机会，在冲击较低的桥梁之前，你不会跌落超过一百英尺。虽然这一点可能看起来是小小的安慰，但上层和中层区的主要桥梁也确实被施了魔法，有自动触发的{@spell feather fall}效果，使你在下降过程中不会压死一个无辜的路人。",

	"In Sharn, as in any large community, different segments of the population occupy different places in the economic spectrum. The terms that D&D uses to quantify lifestyle expenses—wretched, squalid, poor, modest, comfortable, wealthy, and aristocratic (see \"{@book Expenses|PHB|5|Expenses}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB})—are also used in this chapter as an indicator of what it costs for someone to live in a given area, and also of the costs of goods and services there.": "在沙恩，就像任何一个大社区一样，不同阶层的人在经济光谱中占据着不同的位置。D&D用来量化生活方式支出的术语--穷困、肮脏、贫穷、适度、舒适、富有和贵族（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章中的\"{@book Expenses|PHB|5|Expenses}\"）--在本章中也被用作某人在特定地区的生活成本指标，以及那里的商品和服务成本指标。",

Characters seeking knowledge in any of these fields or others ought to be able to find resources in the library to aid their search. The university is an excellent source of sages who hire their services out on a short- or long-term basis.

	"Another important site for certain kinds of research is the City Archive, in the Highest Towers district of Upper Central.

	"The nation of Cyre was destroyed in 994 YK on this date, known as the Day of Mourning. Although that event had an impact on everyone in Khorvaire, this day of remembrance is especially significant to Cyran survivors. It is a time when Cyrans come together to recall their lost kingdom. Some tell stories or sing traditional songs, ensuring that their culture isn't forgotten. Other survivors still seethe with anger at the enemies who brought Cyre down, and thus far the holiday has been marked by a brief upturn in violence.": "赛尔国在994年的这一天被摧毁，被称为哀悼日。虽然这一事件对霍尔韦尔的每个人都有影响，但这个纪念日对赛尔人的幸存者来说特别重要。这是一个赛伦人聚集在一起，回忆他们失去的王国的时刻。一些人讲述故事或演唱传统歌曲，确保他们的文化不被遗忘。其他幸存者仍然对将赛尔击垮的敌人感到愤怒，到目前为止，这个节日的特点是暴力事件短暂上升。",

	"In honor of the Sovereign Balinor, a fierce beast is brought to the city and released on this day into an isolated section of Old Sharn. Anyone can participate in the Hunt by making a donation of 5 gp; the hunter (or group) who brings down the beast wins a purse of 500 gp and the blessing of Balinor. The motif of the Hunt can vary; in some years, multiple beasts are released, and the hunter who catches the most of them is the victor. In any case, it often turns out that the other competitors are a greater threat to hunters than the beasts they stalk.": "为了纪念君主Balinor，一只凶猛的野兽被带到了城市，并在这一天被释放到旧沙恩的一个孤立的区域。任何人只要捐献5金币就可以参加狩猎活动；打倒猛兽的猎人（或团体）将赢得500金币的奖金和巴里诺的祝福。狩猎的主题可能有所不同；在某些年份，会放出多只野兽，抓到最多野兽的猎人就是胜利者。在任何情况下，结果往往是其他竞争者比他们跟踪的野兽对猎人的威胁更大。",
	"This celebration commemorates a priest of the Silver Flame who was martyred while exposing lycanthropes in Sharn. The day's activities often cause tension with the shifter community.": "这个庆典是为了纪念一位在揭露沙恩的狼人时殉职的银焰牧师。这一天的活动经常会引起与变身者社区的紧张关系。",

Careful people spend this time indoors with friends, but those who relish the darkness might decide to take to the streets to prey on the weak and foolish.": "据说在这三个晚上，黑暗六人组的阴险神灵--阴影的力量达到了顶峰。小心翼翼的人在室内与朋友一起度过这段时间，但那些对黑暗感兴趣的人可能会决定上街掠夺弱者和愚蠢的人。",
	"Banners are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.": "今天，横幅在杜拉上空飘扬，街道上充满了色彩。穿着棕色和红色的衣服走过Oldkeep，你会被邀请为狮鹫举杯；如果你穿着白色和金色的衣服，即河马的颜色，你最好准备好保护自己。",
	"If you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength? Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!": "如果你是第一次来到沙恩，你可能会认为我们的城市已经疯了。在某些方面确实如此，但这种疯狂在每年夏天的 \"八风赛 \"中达到顶峰。很久以前，加里法尔国王把杜拉作为一个空降兵的试验场。什么更重要，是速度还是力量？我们的现代比赛是对速度和技巧的考验，比赛路线围绕着杜拉的尖顶，并在其中穿梭。有八名参赛者，这些勇敢的骑师每人都骑着不同的飞行生物--除了夜行神龙卡拉拉格，他依靠自己的翅膀!",
	"Speed is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!": "速度很重要，但仅仅是在比赛中生存下来也是一种挑战。不禁止流血，但骑手可以携带的唯一武器是轻型运动弩；骏马可以使用它们的爪子和喙，这就是狮鹫如此激烈的竞争者。毒药、魔法或其他任何会直接干扰野兽或骑手的东西都是严格禁止的--尽管多年来我们确实看到了富有想象力的尝试来扩展规则的范围",
	"Dura is divided into eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees always insist that the race is fair.": "杜拉被划分为八个地区的比赛，每个地区都有不同的生物代表。如果你要在杜拉花时间，最好是了解你的坐骑! 上杜拉的野兽在比赛中速度最快，而且总体上有最好的记录。卫冕冠军是高水的飞马，它的支持者穿着白色和银色的衣服。河马与上杜拉的眺望和匕首守望联系在一起，其颜色是白色和金色。诋毁者经常说，沙恩守望偏爱河马，瓦达里斯家族帮助飞马，但裁判总是坚持比赛是公平的。",
	"The beasts of Middle Dura are versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.": "中杜拉的野兽是多功能的。鹰在中杜拉代表破碎拱门和斯托姆霍德，它的支持者穿着棕色和金色。聪明的猫头鹰代表Rattlestone和Bazaar飞行，它的颜色是棕色和灰色。鹰在中杜拉代表翻滚镇和暗影，穿上它的褐色和棕色的混合色，通常可以在旅馆里得到一个好价钱。",
	"The beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. The current {@creature Gargoyle} is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion.": "下杜拉的野兽比可靠的更臭名昭著。狮鹫为普雷塞斯和奥德堡飞行，它的颜色是棕色和红色。它从未在比赛中获胜，但赌它会打倒哪个对手，就能赚到金子。滑翔翼代表黄金之门和商店，它的支持者穿着绿色和灰色的衣服；许多人相信博罗玛家族会支付坐骑和骑手的维护费用。马利翁之门曾经由蝙蝠代表，但12年前他们把这个吉祥物换成了鬼怪，其颜色是黑色和灰色。现在的{@creature Gargoyle}是一个叫卡拉拉格的石脸家伙，他的支持者们对他们的有翼冠军相当热情。",
	"As befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura. Three exotic sports practiced in the city are described below.": "作为一个拥有各种文化的人的大都市，沙恩举办了各种各样的运动和体育赛事。八风赛每年举行一次。其他活动则按日、周或月的时间表进行。例如，移居者每天晚上在下诺德奇举行非正式的哈拉扎克比赛。Cogs的食人魔喜欢拔河、掰手腕，以及类似的简单力量测试。想在体育上下注的人通常可以在下门提斯的火光区、下杜拉的卡莱斯坦、中塔维克兰丁的基石或中杜拉的哈雷斯之家找到愿意设定赔率的赌徒。下文介绍了城市中开展的三种异国运动。",
	"Two teams of seven shifters play hrazhak on a field with a goal at each end. Each team starts out carrying a wooden idol. To score, a team must steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and there are no limits on contact between participants, although only natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't allowed to use spells or similar abilities.": "两队七名移位者在两端各有一个球门的场地上玩hrazhak。每队开始时都带着一个木制神像。为了得分，一队必须偷取对手的神像，并将两个神像放在自己的球门里。障碍物，如树木、溪流和成堆的瓦砾都可能出现在hrazhak场地上，要求参赛者充分利用他们的跳跃和攀爬能力。偶像可以被投掷或携带，参与者之间的接触也没有限制，但只允许使用天然武器。通常情况下，如果需要，会有一个低级德鲁伊或神通者在现场提供治疗--但任何接受援助的竞争者都会在比赛的剩余时间内被取消比赛资格。竞争者不允许使用法术或类似能力。",
	"The only formal hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks.": "沙恩唯一正式的赫拉扎克竞技场位于基石区的石树，那里的比赛既是一项观赏性运动，也是赌博的理由。移居者不时地在城市的贫民窟和仓库区创建临时的哈拉扎克场，移居者的年轻人经常在公园里进行即兴的比赛。",
	"Common jousting is popular enough throughout Breland, but in Sharn, the sport has taken to the air. In a formal skyblades match, the goal is to knock an opposing rider from the saddle—attacks against mounts are forbidden, along with the use of magic or other supernatural abilities. Formal matches take place in one of Sharn's two aerial arenas, in Cornerstone and Hareth's Folly. Skyblades jousters typically ride {@creature Hippogriff||hippogriffs} and carry blunted lances that deal nonlethal damage.": "普通的比武在整个布雷兰都很流行，但在沙恩，这项运动已经开始在空中进行。在正式的空中比武中，目标是将对方的骑手从马鞍上打下来--禁止对坐骑进行攻击，也禁止使用魔法或其他超自然能力。正式的比赛在沙恩的两个空中竞技场之一进行，分别在基石和哈雷斯的福地。天刀术士通常骑马（%0%），并携带钝化的长矛，造成非致命的伤害。",
	"Informal matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An informal match might be played out across an entire district, with competitors weaving between towers and around bridges. The rules for an informal match are set before the start, establishing (among other things) whether magic can be used and mounts can be targeted.": "非正式比赛并不总是使用相同的规则，在下杜拉和中杜拉、塔维克登陆点和门斯高原时有发生。一场非正式比赛可能会在整个地区进行，选手们在塔楼和桥梁之间穿梭。非正式比赛的规则在开始前就已经设定好了，确定了（除其他事项外）是否可以使用魔法和坐骑可以被瞄准。",
	"A Droaam tradition brought to Sharn by immigrants, six stones is a game for seven competitors, who each pay a base stake. The seven are then sealed in a large chamber with a {@creature cockatrice}. The match ends when six of the players have been turned to stone, at which point the survivor is awarded all the stakes (except for a share set aside for the organizers). A {@creature medusa} handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might be lit, or it could be be pitch black.": "由移民带到沙恩的Droaam传统，六块石头是七个竞争者的游戏，他们各自支付基本赌注。然后这七个人被封在一个大房间里，房间里有一个{@creature cockatrice}。当六位选手被变成石头时，比赛就结束了，这时，幸存者将获得所有的赌注（除了为组织者预留的份额）。一个(1%)处理者监督比赛以确保规则得到遵守。参赛者不携带武器或盔甲，也不得使用魔法或超自然能力。此外，任何人都不允许攻击蟑螂。挑战在于超越其他参赛者，引诱他们或把他们推到蟑螂的道路上。战场可能是不毛之地，也可能到处是瓦砾和掩体；可能有灯光，也可能是一片漆黑。",
	"Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the \"{@book Criminal Activities|ERLW|8|Criminal Activities}\" section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds.": "六块石头的比赛是由犯罪组织Daask（见本章后面的\"{@book Criminal Activities|ERLW|8|Criminal Activities} \"部分）举办的。这项运动是非法的，但比赛仍在继续，因为比赛只限于下杜拉和科格斯地区，并且很好地隐藏了观察者的眼睛。通常每隔几个月才发生一次比赛。有时参赛者自愿参加比赛，但大多数是债务人，他们得到了通过赢得比赛来偿还贷款的机会。达斯克接受对结果的赌注，并通常赚取一笔不菲的收入作为其收益份额。",
	"Sharn has many people in positions of power: beadles, ministers, bailiffs, and all manner of minor functionaries and officials. But ultimate power rests in the hands of the City Council. That body has seventeen members: one for each ward in the city, plus representatives from Skyway and the Cogs. Each ward has its own process for selecting a councilor, and there are no legal restrictions on who can govern; if you build up a strong base of support in a ward, you could hold the position yourself!": "沙恩有很多人担任权力职务：执事、部长、法警，以及各种小职能部门和官员。但最终的权力掌握在市议会的手中。该机构有17名成员：城市的每个区都有一名成员，加上来自Skyway和Cogs的代表。每个区都有自己的程序来选择议员，对谁可以执政没有法律限制；如果你在一个区建立了强大的支持基础，你可以自己担任这个职位",
	"The members of the City Council are quite diverse. Some are crooked, others are idealists, and one of them appears to be an owl. All of them are well known in their home wards, and any of them could have use for a team of adventurers. The Sharn Councilors table describes a few of the city leaders you might bump into in Upper Central or at the Tain Gala. If your character has the noble background, you might already know one of them.": "市议会的成员是相当多样化的。有些是歪门邪道，有些是理想主义者，还有一个似乎是猫头鹰。他们都在自己的辖区内很有名气，他们中的任何一个都可以为冒险者团队所用。沙恩议员表描述了一些你可能在上层中心区或泰恩晚会上碰到的城市领导人。如果你的角色有贵族背景，你可能已经认识他们中的一个。",

Since taking her seat, she has fought to improve conditions for the lower classes of Sharn, and she has made many enemies on the council and beyond.": "{@b Sava Kharisa}（人类）是来自下中央的直言不讳的议员。自从就任以来，她一直在为改善沙恩下层阶级的条件而奋斗，她在议会内外树了很多敌人。",

	"{@b Maza Thadian} (elf) represents Upper Northedge. A venerable elf and owner of one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, she fights to maintain tradition but definitely puts the needs of the wealthy ahead of the poor.": "{@b Maza Thadian}(精灵)代表上诺德奇。她是一个可敬的精灵，也是沙恩最好的餐馆之一的老板，她努力维持传统，但绝对把富人的需求放在穷人的前面。",

He has a reputation for stirring up conflict and setting the other councilors against one another.": "{@b Bestan ir'Tonn}(半身人)代表上塔维克城30年了，基本上把他的选区看作是城中的一个独立城市。他以挑起冲突和挑拨其他议员之间的关系而闻名。",

Some insist that Kilk is actually an identity shared by a group of changelings.": "{@b Kilk}(changeling)代表下塔维克城的商人。低声的传言表明，变种人与神秘的暴君们有联系。有些人坚持认为，基尔克实际上是一群变种人共同的身份。",

	"{@b Nolan Toranak} (dwarf), the councilor for the Cogs, is largely seen as a tool of the industrialists who own the foundries there.

Priests don't usually sell their services; temples are places for worship and spiritual guidance.": "每个主要的宗教在沙恩都有前哨站。一些圣地吸引着来自布雷兰和霍尔韦尔各地的朝圣者来到这座城市。牧师通常不出售他们的服务；寺庙是崇拜和精神指导的地方。",
	"The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, represented by shrines and small temples throughout the city. The Pavilion of the Host in Middle Central is the heart of the faith, and most priests of the Host live in one of the Pavilion's nine towers. Pilgrims often come to visit one of three particular sites. The Korranath in Upper Central features Khorvaire's largest temple of Kol Korran. The Great Hall of Aureon in Upper Menthis draws scholars and worshipers alike. The Pool of Onatar's Tears in the Blackbones district of the Cogs is said to impart a blessing to any smith who bathes their hands in its waters.": "主教是布雷兰的主导宗教，在整个城市中以神龛和小庙为代表。位于中环的主神阁是该信仰的核心，大多数主神的牧师都住在主神阁的九座塔中的一座。朝圣者通常会来参观三个特定地点中的一个。位于上中部的科拉纳特（Korranath）有霍尔韦尔最大的科尔科兰神庙。位于上Menthis的Aureon大殿吸引了众多学者和崇拜者。位于科加斯黑骨区的奥纳塔之泪池据说能给任何在池水中沐浴的铁匠带来祝福。",
	"The Cathedral of the Cleansing Flame, Sharn's largest temple to the Silver Flame, is located in Upper Central. Archierophant Ythana Morr is frequently accused of corruption and nepotism, but there are smaller places of worship around the city devoted to the true principles of the faith. The hermit Gaia watches over the City of the Dead from Warden Tower. Coldflame Keep in Middle Northedge was once a mighty garrison; its glory has faded, but Flamebearer Mazin Tana still strives to protect his community. The priestess Faela maintains a small shrine in the shadows of Fallen, doing what she can to help the wretched people of that forsaken district.

	"Even some lesser known religions are represented in Sharn. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is a haven for followers of the Blood of Vol. The Gates of Passage in Upper Northedge is a temple of the Undying Court. The Overlook district of Upper Dura holds the Shrine of il-Yannah, dedicated to the Path of Light.": "甚至一些不太知名的宗教在沙恩也有代表。中塔维克城的灰石区是沃尔之血信徒的天堂。 上诺特奇的通道之门是不死阁的寺庙。上杜拉的眺望区有伊尔-雅娜神殿，专门供奉光明之路。",

Aside from those groups, the city features a number of less populous associations, such as those described below.": "所有与龙纹屋相关的行会在沙恩都有很好的代表性；大多数行会在中环的龙塔区都有行会馆。除了这些团体之外，这个城市还有一些人数较少的协会，比如下面介绍的那些。",
	"Sharn is a magnet for those who seek adventure and opportunity. Forgotten treasures are hidden in the ruins below the towers, and expeditions leave for Xen'drik every day. At any moment, dozens of sages, spies, and nobles around the city are searching for capable agents to help with their schemes and investigations. If you and your friends are searching for adventure, you've come to the right place, and you don't have to do it alone. Sharn is home to two organizations that provide adventurers with opportunities for work and camaraderie: the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild and the Deathsgate Guild.": "沙恩对那些寻求冒险和机会的人来说是一块磁石。被遗忘的宝藏隐藏在塔楼下的废墟中，探险队每天都会出发前往Xen'drik。在任何时候，城市周围的几十个圣人、间谍和贵族都在寻找有能力的代理人来帮助他们的计划和调查。如果你和你的朋友正在寻找冒险，你就来对地方了，而且你不需要独自行动。沙恩有两个组织为冒险者提供工作和友情的机会：悬崖顶冒险者公会和死亡之门公会。",
	"Those who are accepted into either adventurer's guild must pay dues of 12 gp each year. The primary benefit of belonging to a guild is access to work, since the guildmaster can connect parties of adventurers with patrons and jobs suited to their talents. Beyond that, there are a few additional benefits:": "那些被接纳为冒险者公会的人必须每年缴纳12金币的会费。加入公会的主要好处是可以获得工作，因为公会会长可以为冒险家们联系到适合他们才能的赞助人和工作。除此之外，还有一些额外的好处。",
	"You can store items at the guildhall free of charge.": "你可以在市政厅免费储存物品。",
	"You can book lodging at the guildhall for 5 sp per night. The accommodations are modest, but the guild provides stronger security for lodgers and their possessions than you'd find at an inn.": "你可以在公会里预订住宿，每晚5英镑。住宿条件一般，但公会为住宿者和他们的财产提供了比旅馆更强的安全保障。",
	"An adventurer's guild is an excellent source of information. By studying records and working with other guild members, you can gain advantage on any skill check to research a subject in which the guild has expertise or experience.": "冒险家协会是一个很好的信息来源。通过研究记录和与其他公会成员合作，你可以在任何技能检查中获得优势，以研究公会有专长或经验的主题。",
	"A strong rivalry exists between the Deathsgate Guild and the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. You might have trouble with members of the opposing guild, whether in the form of drunken boasting in a tavern or a rival stirring up trouble in the midst of a mission.": "死亡之门公会和克利夫托普冒险者公会之间存在着强烈的竞争关系。你可能会与敌对公会的成员发生矛盾，无论是在酒馆里的醉酒吹嘘，还是在任务中的对手挑起的麻烦。",
	"Located in the Clifftop district of Upper Dura, this organization has a sterling reputation as a source of reliable explorers and champions. Clifftop adventurers are known for their courage and integrity, and guildmaster Summer Korranor holds members to a high standard of virtuous behavior. As a Clifftop adventurer, you're expected to keep your word, to stand by your comrades, to uphold the law, and never to intentionally endanger innocents with your actions. Many of the local businesses cater to adventurers, and if you're a member of the guild, you can expect a warm welcome in the taverns of Clifftop.": "该组织位于上杜拉的悬崖顶区，作为可靠的探险家和冠军的来源，有着良好的声誉。悬崖顶冒险者以其勇气和正直而闻名，公会会长Summer Korranor对成员的品德行为要求很高。作为一个克利夫托普冒险者，你应该遵守你的诺言，站在你的同伴一边，维护法律，并且永远不要故意用你的行动来危害无辜者。当地的许多企业迎合了冒险者的需求，如果你是公会的成员，你可以期待在克利夫托普的酒馆里受到热烈欢迎。",
	"Adventurers who are willing to take on any job and to do whatever it takes to triumph might find themselves suited for membership in the Deathsgate Guild. Named for its proximity to the City of the Dead, the district of Deathsgate prides itself on being a haven for those who challenge death on a daily basis. The guild's founder, Kassh \"Blackaxe\" Droranath, doesn't care how his members do their jobs, as long as they don't fail.": "愿意承担任何工作并不惜一切代价取得胜利的冒险者可能会发现自己适合加入死亡之门公会。由于靠近死亡之城而得名，死亡之门区以成为那些每天都在挑战死亡的人的天堂而自豪。公会的创始人，\"黑斧 \"德洛兰斯（Kassh \"Blackaxe\" Droranath）并不关心他的成员如何完成他们的工作，只要他们不失败就行。",
	"A bard is a versatile individual, equally skilled at entertainment and espionage. These talents are perfectly matched to the city of Sharn, which is both the cultural heart of Breland and a nexus for intrigue and diplomacy. Bards have much to gain from the company of other bards, as they exchange news, stories, and songs. For this purpose, long ago a group of the finest bards in Sharn founded the Circle of Song, an alliance of entertainers and adventurers.": "吟游诗人是一个多面手，同样擅长娱乐和间谍活动。这些才能与沙恩城完美匹配，它既是布雷兰德的文化中心，又是阴谋和外交的枢纽。吟游诗人从其他吟游诗人的陪伴中获益良多，因为他们可以交流新闻、故事和歌曲。为此，很久以前，一群沙恩最优秀的吟游诗人成立了 \"歌之环\"，这是一个由艺人和冒险家组成的联盟。",
	"The Circle of Song is an informal organization, open to any bard who knows its customs and who can find an outpost. It has no membership dues; you're expected to make a donation if you make significant use of the group's resources. Membership provides the following benefits:": "歌之圈是一个非正式的组织，向任何了解其习俗并能找到前哨的吟游诗人开放。它没有会员费；如果你大量使用该组织的资源，你会被期望进行捐赠。会员资格提供以下好处。",
	"You can always find food and lodging at a circle outpost, though you might be expected to entertain the patrons in exchange. If times are tough, your food and lodging might be a step lower than the usual quality of the inn, but at least it's free.": "你总能在一个圈子的前哨找到食物和住宿，尽管你可能会被期望招待食客作为交换。如果时局艰难，你的食物和住宿可能比客栈的通常质量低一个档次，但至少是免费的。",
	"You have advantage on ability checks made to perform research or gather information while in a circle outpost, provided you have an opportunity to peruse archives and talk with other members.": "只要你有机会阅读档案并与其他成员交谈，你在进行研究或收集信息的能力检查中具有优势。",
	"Circle members are often willing to do minor favors for other members—gathering information, embarrassing a minor noble, causing a distraction. There's no cost for such a service, but anyone who helps you will expect you to provide similar assistance when they need it.": "圈子成员往往愿意为其他成员做一些小事--收集信息，让一个小贵族难堪，造成分心。这样的服务是没有成本的，但任何帮助你的人都会希望你在他们需要时提供类似的帮助。",
	"The first and oldest outpost of the Circle of Song is the Golden Horn in the University district of Upper Menthis; a few bards are almost always in residence and willing to share news and stories. Other, less elaborate outposts are maintained in Sharn, and over the centuries the circle has established outposts in most major cities and many smaller communities across Khorvaire. These sites are usually taverns or inns that have hidden areas accessible only to members of the circle.": "歌之环的第一个也是最古老的前哨站是位于上曼提斯大学区的金角；几个吟游诗人几乎总是居住在这里，愿意分享新闻和故事。在沙恩还有其他不那么精致的前哨站，几个世纪以来，歌谣圈在霍尔韦尔的大多数主要城市和许多小社区都建立了前哨站。这些地方通常是酒馆或旅馆，有只有圈子成员才能进入的隐藏区域。",
	"Bards are expected to set aside personal rivalries while in a circle outpost, and any kind of combat or violence is prohibited. Violating this rule results in immediate expulsion from the circle, at the least.": "吟游诗人在圈内前哨时，应将个人的争斗放在一边，禁止任何形式的战斗或暴力。违反这一规则，至少会被立即驱逐出圈子。",
	"Its mighty towers and floating spires mark Sharn as a symbol of mystic power and achievement. Soon after the founding of the city, the greatest wizards of Breland chose it to be the seat of their arcane order. Its goal was to celebrate excellence in the mystic arts, bringing together the greatest practitioners of magic in a society that rivals Arcanix and the institutions of Aundair.": "它强大的塔楼和漂浮的尖顶使沙恩成为神秘力量和成就的象征。在建城后不久，布雷兰德最伟大的巫师们选择这里作为他们的奥术组织的所在地。它的目标是庆祝神秘艺术的卓越成就，将最伟大的魔法从业者聚集在一起，与阿卡尼克斯和昂代尔的机构相媲美。",
	"A schism split the original society, but today both of the branches of the original organization, the Esoteric Order of Aureon and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows, are recognized and respected throughout Breland. Each one has lesser halls in every major city in the nation.": "一场分裂分裂了原来的社会，但今天原组织的两个分支，奥瑞恩密教团和星光与阴影公会，都在整个布雷兰得到认可和尊重。每个组织在全国各大城市都有较少的会馆。",
	"Someone accepted into an arcane order must pay 1,000 gp to join, with ongoing dues of 250 gp each year thereafter. With this payment comes many benefits, including the following:": "被接受加入奥术团的人必须支付1,000金币才能加入，此后每年支付250金币的持续会费。这笔钱带来了许多好处，包括以下内容。",
	"You can stay at the order's hall in any major city and enjoy the amenities of a wealthy lifestyle free of charge.": "你可以住在任何大城市的秩序厅，免费享受富裕生活的设施。",

	"Membership in an arcane order grants prestige within Breland. Though this status provides no tangible benefit, it proves that you are a gifted mage and stand above any mere magewright or dabbler.": "奥术团的成员资格在布雷兰德内部具有威望。虽然这种地位没有提供任何实际的好处，但它证明了你是一个有天赋的法师，并高于任何单纯的魔法师或涉猎者。",
	"Members of the larger of the two societies, the Esoteric Order of Aureon, take a vow to use their talents to preserve and advance civilization and to operate within the confines of the law. The Esoteric Order helped Galifar I maintain the rule of law, and many of its members served Breland during the Last War. Although its members aren't prohibited from studying any form of magic, the specialties of the order are abjuration, divination, and evocation magic. Wizards and artificers are almost always welcome in the guild. Sorcerers must prove their grasp of arcane theory to earn a place, and warlocks are rarely accepted as members. The hall of the Esoteric Order of Aureon is in the district of Clifftop in Upper Dura.": "这两个社团中较大的社团--奥瑞恩密教团的成员发誓要利用他们的才能来维护和推进文明，并在法律的范围内运作。神秘教团帮助加利法尔一世维持法治，它的许多成员在最后的战争中为布雷兰德服务。虽然它的成员并不被禁止学习任何形式的魔法，但该组织的专长是咒语、占卜和召唤魔法。巫师和工匠在公会里几乎都是受欢迎的。巫师必须证明他们对奥术理论的掌握才能获得一席之地，而术士则很少被接纳为会员。奥瑞恩神秘教团的大厅位于上杜拉的克利夫托普区。",
	"Breland's other arcane order encourages independence and innovation, qualities that contribute to a mutually uncomfortable relationship between the Guild of Starlight and Shadows and the Sharn Watch. The schools of conjuration, enchantment, and illusion are favored by this group. Warlocks, especially those of the Archfey, are generally welcome. Members of the Esoteric Order look down on Starlight wizards, and in turn the guild members often mock the wizards of the Esoteric Order and play pranks on them. The Guild of Starlight and Shadows has its hall in the Deathsgate district in Middle Tavick's Landing.": "布雷兰德的另一个奥术团体鼓励独立和创新，这些品质导致了星光与阴影公会和沙恩守望之间相互不舒服的关系。这个团体偏爱法术、魔法和幻术流派。术士，尤其是那些大帝的术士，通常是受欢迎的。神秘教团的成员看不起星光的巫师，反过来，公会成员也经常嘲笑神秘教团的巫师，并对他们进行恶作剧。星光与阴影公会的大厅位于中塔维克城的死亡之门区。",
	"There is one dark stain in the shared history of the arcane orders. Three hundred years ago, a third order arose in Sharn—a sinister cabal called the Closed Circle. This order specialized in transmutation and necromancy and dabbled in the forbidden lore of the daelkyr and the Dragon Below. It's said that the members of the Closed Circle went mad and sought to summon terrible things; whatever the truth, the guild was wiped out more than two hundred years ago by the combined action of the Church of the Silver Flame, the Esoteric Order, and the Guild of Starlight and Shadows. Hidden workshops of the Closed Circle might still be found in Sharn, where vengeful liches or other wizards of the Circle practice their dark arts in hiding.": "在奥术团的共同历史中，有一个黑暗的污点。三百年前，沙恩出现了第三个教团--一个名为 \"封闭圈 \"的阴险组织。这个组织专门从事转化和死灵法术，并涉足达尔凯尔和下龙的禁忌传说。据说封闭圈的成员发疯了，并试图召唤可怕的东西；无论真相如何，这个公会在两百多年前被银焰教会、神秘教团和星光与阴影公会的联合行动消灭了。在沙恩可能还能找到封闭圈的隐蔽工场，在那里，复仇的地衣或其他圈内的巫师在隐蔽地练习他们的黑暗艺术。",
	"Sharn is a vertical city, and elevation is an indicator of status and wealth. Each quarter is roughly divided into three levels, and the combination of quarter and level defines a ward. Thus, wards have names such as Lower Dura, Upper Central, and Middle Menthis.": "沙恩是一个垂直的城市，海拔高度是地位和财富的指标。每个区大致分为三个级别，区和级别的组合定义了一个区。因此，区的名称有下杜拉、上中央和中门提斯等。",
	"Upper wards are the domain of the rich and powerful. Here you'll find the finest goods and the most expensive services. Only those who maintain a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle can easily afford the prices for meals and lodging, and adventurers who maintain a squalid or wretched lifestyle might be treated with disdain (suffering disadvantage on Charisma checks).": "上层病房是富人和权贵的领域。在这里你可以找到最好的商品和最昂贵的服务。只有那些保持富裕或贵族生活方式的人才能轻松地负担得起餐饮和住宿的价格，而那些保持肮脏或卑劣生活方式的冒险者可能会受到轻视（在魅力检查中受到不利影响）。",
	"Violence is rare in any of the upper wards, and the Sharn Watch actively patrols these areas. Although the guards here might be corrupt just as in a middle or lower ward, they're already being well paid by powerful nobles and criminal organizations, and they work efficiently in the service of these forces.": "在任何一个上层区，暴力事件都是罕见的，而且沙恩看守所积极地在这些地区巡逻。虽然这里的守卫可能会像中区或下区一样腐败，但他们已经被有权势的贵族和犯罪组织支付了高额的报酬，而且他们在为这些势力服务时工作很有效率。",
	"Middle wards are home to the middle classes. Here you'll find bustling markets and taverns, along with a wide range of entertainment and housing. Most goods and services are affordable by those of a modest or comfortable lifestyle, with a few higher-priced options tucked away. The Sharn Watch has a presence, but not as strong as in the upper wards.": "中间区是中产阶级的家。在这里，你会发现热闹的市场和酒馆，以及广泛的娱乐和住房。大多数商品和服务都是那些生活适度或舒适的人可以负担得起的，但也有一些价格较高的选择隐藏在其中。沙恩观察站也有存在，但不像上层区那样强大。",
	"Lower wards house the hard-working laborers, along with the destitute and the desperate, including refugees who lost everything in the war and orphans who never had anything to begin with. Services priced for a modest lifestyle can be found, but overall the lower wards are home to those who have no better than a poor lifestyle; a visitor who displays signs of a wealthy or aristocratic lifestyle might attract unwanted attention. The watch pays little attention to the lower districts, making them a haven for criminals and gangs.": "下层病房住着辛勤工作的劳动者，以及赤贫和绝望的人，包括在战争中失去一切的难民和从未有过的孤儿。可以找到价格适中的服务，但总的来说，下层区是那些没有更好的生活方式的人的家；显示出富裕或贵族生活方式迹象的访客可能会引起不必要的注意。观察者很少关注低层区，使其成为罪犯和帮派的天堂。",
	"These are stereotypes that don't apply to all wards. Dura is a particularly poor quarter, meaning that Upper Dura is effectively a middle ward in economic terms; similarly, because Central Plateau is a hub of wealth and power, Lower Central is effectively a middle ward.": "这些定型观念并不适用于所有选区。杜拉是一个特别贫穷的区，这意味着上杜拉在经济方面实际上是一个中等区；同样，由于中原是一个财富和权力的中心，下中原实际上是一个中等区。",
	"Each ward is further subdivided into districts, which are neighborhoods defined by an economic role, a separate culture, or both. For example, Lower Northedge includes the districts of Stoneyard, Longstairs, and North Market. It's generally true that the combination of a district's ward and quarter will give you a broad idea of what to expect there. A district in Upper Central will typically be well kept and swarming with guards, while a district in Lower Dura will be squalid and dangerous.": "每个区又被进一步细分为若干个区，这些区是由经济角色、独立的文化或两者界定的街区。例如，Lower Northedge包括Stoneyard、Longstairs和North Market等区。一般来说，一个区的区和季度的组合可以让你大致了解那里的情况。上中区的一个区通常会有很好的维护，并有大量的警卫，而下杜拉区的一个区则是肮脏和危险的。",
	"Sharn is an enormous city, and traveling on foot from one side of the city to the other can be time-consuming. Here are some travel-time guidelines:": "沙恩是一个巨大的城市，从城市的一边步行到另一边可能会很费时间。以下是一些旅行时间指南。",
	"It takes at least 30 minutes to cross a ward.": "穿越一个病房至少需要30分钟。",
	"If you're traveling between wards, add 30 minutes for each ward you pass through.": "如果你在病房之间旅行，每经过一个病房就增加30分钟。",
	"Dura and Tavick's Landing are especially large; double the time it takes to move through one of them.": "杜拉和塔维克登陆点特别大；在其中一个地方移动的时间要加倍。",
	"For instance, traveling from Lower Menthis to Upper Central involves passing through three wards (taking a bridge from Lower Menthis to Lower Central, then ascending two levels) and can take 90 minutes or longer.": "例如，从Lower Menthis到Upper Central需要经过三个区（从Lower Menthis走桥到Lower Central，然后上升两层），可能需要90分钟或更长时间。",

If the truth ever comes out, you can be sure you'll read about it here!": "如果你读过两期以上的{@i Sharn Inquisitive}，你至少见过两个关于伊尔坦家族的故事。博拉内尔国王可能统治着布雷兰，市长大人可能是我们任命的最高官员，但伊尔坦家族才是我们城市真正的皇室。对于十年前在海上失踪的大连伊尔坦勋爵的命运，哪个沙恩的公民没有意见？许多人确信他是萨瓦金人的俘虏，这就解释了为什么塞利娅女士一直在资助对萨瓦金王国的探险活动。另一个阵营坚持认为，大连勋爵策划了他的死亡，这样他就可以接受作为海盗王的挥霍生活了。如果真相大白，你肯定会在这里看到。",
	"Matriarch Lady Celyria ir'Tain is the queen of high society in Sharn. Her activities and those of the ir'Tain children account for just as much newsprint as their father used to. Dalian's eldest son, Dalas ir'Tain, shocked society last week when he publicly denounced the Brelish monarchy. The dalliances of younger siblings Cyra and Daral sell more issues of the {@i Inquisitive} whenever such are reported, and the wedding of middle sister Cariana ir'Tain and Mayne Jhaelian of Aerenal will surely be the biggest social event of 998 YK.": "母族长Celyria ir'Tain女士是沙恩上流社会的女王。她和ir'Tain的孩子们的活动和他们的父亲一样占据了很多新闻版面。大连的长子达拉斯-伊尔-泰恩上周公开谴责布雷利什君主制，震惊了社会。弟妹赛拉和达拉尔的暧昧关系每当被报道时都会卖出更多的报纸（%0%），而中妹卡里安娜-伊尔泰恩和艾瑞纳的梅恩-杰赫连的婚礼肯定会成为998年最大的社会事件。",
	"The ir'Tain fortune is tied to the City of Towers. Tain gold funded the construction of many of the towers of Sharn, and the family owns vast sections of the city. You've likely heard of the Sixty Families of Sharn, considered the guiding lights of the city. Most assume that these luminaries are ancient and established, their status tied to a royal decree. In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that received standing invitations to the first Tain Gala. Though the list has remained generally stable through the years, just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place to Saiden Boromar—a surprising advancement for a family that began as Cliffside hooligans.": "伊尔泰恩的财富与塔楼之城息息相关。泰恩的黄金资助了沙恩许多塔楼的建设，而且该家族拥有城市的大片土地。你可能听说过沙恩的60个家族，他们被认为是这个城市的指路明灯。大多数人认为，这些发光体是古老而成熟的，他们的地位与皇家法令相联系。事实上，当泰恩家族在Skyway建造他们的豪宅时，他们命令建筑师设计一个可以容纳60个家庭及其仆人的宴会厅。最初的60个家庭是那些收到第一届泰恩晚宴长期邀请的家庭。虽然这些年来名单基本保持稳定，但就在去年，塞利利亚驱逐了伊尔莫罗斯家族，并将他们的位置让给了赛登-博洛玛--对于一个以悬崖边流氓起家的家族来说，这是一个令人惊讶的进步。",
	"Anyone who strives to rise in Sharn society must earn the favor of the Sixty.

And from our desks, we will be watching to see which families will be next to rise and fall.": "任何努力在沙恩社会中崛起的人都必须赢得六十人的青睐。同样地，那些在最后一次战争后寻求探索和冒险的人，肯定能在这些精英中找到靠山。在我们的办公桌上，我们将观察哪些家族将成为下一个崛起和衰落的家族。",

It's brutal, painful, and true—which is why it was all the more shocking when it first opened at the Diamond Theater. The Downstairs district of Lower Menthis is mainly known for its bawdy entertainment and base comedy, not cutting-edge political commentary. Thus, we critics assumed that this dramatic work was a singular event, until a new play titled {@i Fallen Angels} exceeded our every expectation.

	"Who is the playwright of the Diamond Theater responsible for these stirring stories? Her name is Luca Syara, but beyond that, she's an enigma. There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.": "负责这些激动人心的故事的钻石剧院的剧作家是谁？她的名字叫卢卡-西拉，但除此之外，她还是个谜。布雷兰德的吟游诗人学院的名册上没有这个人，皮亚伦家族和瑟兰尼家族也声称对她一无所知。西拉回避聚光灯，拒绝所有的采访。当她的作品在教室和酒馆里被争论和赞美时，这位艺术家却在钻石剧院喧闹的密室里度过了她的日子。这种隐居生活导致了一些令人遐想的传言。有人说茜拉参加了最后一次战争，她在哀悼日时在梅托尔。一个更疯狂的传言认为，她是一个来自Thelanis精灵法庭的流亡者，一个被束缚在人形上的大法师。",
	"While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. {@i Five Lives} is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that unite us all.

	"Shae Lias is arguably the most remarkable district of Upper Northedge. Its population is largely composed of elves, and it is a bastion of Aereni culture and traditions. The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.": "Shae Lias可以说是上Northedge最杰出的地区。它的人口主要由精灵组成，是艾瑞尼文化和传统的一个堡垒。Shae Lias的中心是通道之门，它是一个宏伟的建筑，既是Aereni的大使馆，也是不死之庭的庙宇。不死之庭的祭司们不与外人分享这一信息，但许多居民相信，不死之庭的真正成员--一个拥有丰富知识和神力的古老的不死精灵--就住在这座庙里。",

The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death.": "沙伊利亚斯的其他景点包括橡树餐厅，它是沙恩最好的餐厅之一，提供最高质量的食物（价格也是如此）。肉体的面纱 \"专门从事艾瑞尼的人体艺术，其形式包括传统的纹身和直接编织在皮肤上的临时幻觉。被称为 \"夜来香 \"的企业可能是沙恩最不寻常的饮品店，它既是药房又是酒馆；它的特色是用弱毒调制的饮料，旨在将饮用者带到死亡的边缘。",
	"This ward caters to the middle class of Sharn, offering a wide range of comfortable housing. Dwarves make up most of the population, with the highest concentration in the district of Holdfast.

	"High Hope is a temple district; although the city's most impressive churches and shrines are located in Upper Central, it's commonly known that if you're looking for a truly devoted priest, you should go to High Hope. The most notable feature of the district is Daca's Watch. Twelve feet high, this pillar is thought to have once held a statue or monument. Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign's voice. True or not, Daca's advice has proven to be remarkably sound, and she and her pillar have become a tourist attraction.": "高希望区是一个神庙区；尽管该市最令人印象深刻的教堂和神庙位于上中央区，但人们普遍知道，如果你要找一个真正虔诚的牧师，你应该去高希望区。该区最引人注目的地方是达卡的守望。这根柱子有12英尺高，人们认为它曾经是一座雕像或纪念碑。一个多世纪以前，一个名叫达卡的地精爬上了这个基座的顶端。从那时起，她就一直呆在那里，并向任何经过的人喊话。虽然达卡并不声称自己是牧师，但社区的人们说她受到波德莱神的祝福，并以圣主的声音说话。无论真假，达卡的建议被证明是非常正确的，她和她的柱子已经成为一个旅游景点。",
	"Although it's poverty-stricken, Lower Northedge is a significant step up from the slums of Lower Dura. The people of Lower Northedge don't look for trouble, and they don't like it coming to their doorstep. North Market is one of the largest markets in Sharn, though in contrast to the Bazaar of Dura it mostly offers simple, everyday goods.": "虽然下诺特赫奇很贫穷，但与下杜拉的贫民窟相比，它是一个重要的进步。下诺特赫奇的人不找麻烦，他们也不喜欢麻烦找上门来。北部市场是沙恩最大的市场之一，但与杜拉的集市相比，它主要提供简单的日常用品。",
	"Lower Northedge has a significant shifter population. The Rat's Nest is a tavern that caters to shifters, and the Bear's Rest is an inn run by a family of shifters. Tooth & Nail is an apothecary specializing in the care of fangs and claws. Particularly in the districts of North Market and Stoneyard, shifter children play hrazhak in the streets; this flamboyant sport involves making dramatic leaps and scaling walls.": "下诺德奇有大量的变身者。鼠窝 \"是一家为变身者服务的酒馆，而 \"熊的休息 \"是一家由变身者家族经营的旅馆。Tooth & Nail是一家专门护理獠牙和爪子的药店。特别是在北市场和斯托尼亚德区，变身者的孩子们在街上玩hrazhak；这种浮夸的运动包括戏剧性的跳跃和翻墙。",
	"The Shrine of Fathen the Martyr is an infamous spot in North Market. It is dedicated to a crusading priest of the Silver Flame who uncovered a group of wererats in the early days of Sharn. Fathen was torn apart by the wererats he had exposed, and in his honor the Church of the Silver Flame raised the shrine on this site. It's said that any lycanthrope that enters the shrine will be forced into its true form. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame come from across Khorvaire to pray at the shrine, but the local shifter population has no love for the pilgrims or the church.": "殉道者法特恩神殿是北市场一个臭名昭著的地方。它是为了纪念一位银色火焰的十字军牧师，他在沙恩的早期揭发了一群狼人。法坦被他揭发的狼人撕碎了，为了纪念他，银焰教会在这里建立了神龛。据说，任何进入神殿的狼人都会被强迫变成它的真实形态。致力于银色火焰的朝圣者从霍尔韦尔各地来到神殿祈祷，但当地的变种人对朝圣者和教会都没有爱。",
	"Northedge is the most peaceful quarter in Sharn. It does have a few taverns and temples, but if you're looking for excitement or a wide selection of goods and services, you'll want to go elsewhere. Even so, Northedge boasts some notable special attractions:": "Northedge是沙恩最宁静的地区。它确实有一些酒馆和寺庙，但如果你想寻找刺激或广泛的商品和服务选择，你会想去其他地方。即便如此，诺德奇还是拥有一些值得注意的特殊景点。",

	"{@b Find a patron}. Many eccentric nobles make their homes in Upper Northedge. A patron of the arts could take an interest in the career of a bard or an entertainer. A collector might keep capable adventurers on retainer with the understanding that they'll deliver any Dhakaani artifacts they come across in their travels. You never know what benefits a patron will provide; at the very least, having a patron can provide you with an introduction to high society.": "{@b Find a patron}. 许多古怪的贵族把家安在上诺特赫奇。艺术赞助人可能对吟游诗人或艺人的职业感兴趣。一个收藏家可能会保留有能力的冒险家，因为他们会提供他们在旅行中遇到的任何达卡尼文物。你永远不知道赞助人会提供什么好处；至少，拥有一个赞助人可以为你提供一个进入上流社会的介绍。",
	"Everyone who comes to Sharn, whether by land or air, passes through Tavick's Landing. The quarter took on a martial aspect during the Last War, and the tense atmosphere can still be felt today. On the positive side, Watch Commander Iyanna ir'Talan has gone to great efforts to purge corruption in the local garrisons of the Sharn Watch; as a result, this is one of the few districts where the Watch is both helpful and competent. On the downside, visitors from any nation that fought against Breland during the war might be greeted with suspicion or hostility.": "每一个来到沙恩的人，无论是陆路还是空中，都要经过塔维克的地盘。在最后一次战争期间，这一带呈现出军事化的特点，至今仍可感受到紧张的气氛。积极的一面是，守望先锋伊安娜-伊尔塔兰（Iyanna ir'Talan）为清除沙恩守望的当地驻军中的腐败现象做出了巨大努力；因此，这里是少数几个守望既能提供帮助又有能力的地区之一。相反，来自任何在战争期间与布雷兰德作战的国家的访客可能会受到怀疑或敌视。",

The Cornerstone is a huge arena that hosts events ranging from circuses to aerial jousting. The Deathsgate district caters to adventurers, much as the Clifftop district of Upper Dura does. Like Clifftop, the district has an adventurer's guild—though the Deathsgate Guild has a dark reputation, and its members often pick fights with Clifftop adventurers.

	"Two land routes to Sharn both end at Lower Tavick's Landing. The Orien lightning rail deposits passengers in the district of Terminus, while those who travel to Sharn on the Old Road arrive at Wroann's Gate. Getting to the better parts of Sharn from here means passing through Black Arch, a heavily fortified garrison district designed to repel enemies and withstand a full siege. The ward offers a variety of services catering to travelers; the Dragoneyes district is a maze of taverns, inns, brothels, and gambling halls.

	"These days, Lower Tavick's Landing is best known for High Walls, a former residential district converted into a home for refugees from the Last War.

The gates are open at present, but High Walls is designed to serve as a fortress prison if the need arises, and the Sharn Watch keeps an eye out for any signs of unrest.": "这些天来，下塔维克登陆区最出名的是高墙（High Walls），一个以前的住宅区被改造成了最后一次战争的难民之家。高墙的容量已经满了，大部分是因哀悼而流离失所的赛伦人。大门目前是开放的，但高墙的设计是为了在需要时作为一个要塞监狱，而且沙恩守望者一直在注意任何动乱的迹象。",
	"In the wake of the Mourning, our king welcomed the survivors of that tragedy into our cities. In Sharn, High Walls alone holds more Cyran refugees than Karrnath has allowed across its borders. If you read the Sharn Inquisitive or the Korranberg Chronicle, you've heard the endless litany of how difficult life is, tales of overcrowding, starvation, and disease. Although we at the Voice of Breland sympathize with all who suffer, we refuse to ignore the deadly threat in our midst. The majority of Cyrans who survived the Mourning did so because they were beyond the borders of their nation. And why is that? Because they were soldiers.": "在哀悼事件之后，我们的国王欢迎那场悲剧的幸存者进入我们的城市。在沙恩，仅高墙一地容纳的赛伦难民就比卡尔纳特允许越过其边界的人数多。如果你读过《沙恩探究者》或《科兰博格纪事》，你就会听到关于生活有多困难的无休止的传闻，关于过度拥挤、饥饿和疾病的故事。尽管我们布雷兰德之声同情所有受苦的人，但我们拒绝忽视我们中间的致命威胁。大多数在哀悼会上幸存下来的锡兰人是因为他们在他们国家的边界之外。而这是为什么呢？因为他们是军人。",
	"The Sharn Inquisitive talks about starving children and ailing peasants, but it doesn't mention the Cyran special forces and elite war mages who now reside in High Walls. As Brelish, we all want to show compassion to the truly innocent, but let us never forget that these people were once our enemy and could be again. And let us also remember that the cause of the Mourning remains a mystery. Was it divine punishment for Cyran sins that have yet to be washed clean? Or could it have been a premature activation of an arcane weapon—and if so, could Cyran artificers already be working on an improved version in the heart of our greatest city?": "沙恩探询者》谈到了饥饿的儿童和生病的农民，但它没有提到现在居住在高墙的赛伦特种部队和精英战争法师。作为布雷利什人，我们都想对真正无辜的人表示同情，但让我们永远不要忘记，这些人曾经是我们的敌人，也可能再次成为敌人。让我们也记住，哀悼的原因仍然是个谜。它是对尚未被洗净的Cyran罪孽的神圣惩罚吗？或者，它可能是一种神秘武器的过早激活--如果是这样，赛伦的工匠们会不会已经在我们最伟大的城市中心研究出一个改进版？",
	"Remain alert, people of Breland! Don't let the current plight of these unfortunates blind you to the danger!": "保持警惕，布雷兰德的人们！不要让这些不幸的人目前的困境蒙蔽了你们的眼睛。不要让这些不幸的人目前的困境蒙蔽了你的眼睛，让你看不到危险!",

If you you're looking for something a little more exotic, see if you can find Chance. This is the name both of a secret, roaming gambling den and of the changeling who runs it. In addition to offering all manner of mundane games and bets, Chance is said to be able to arrange and cover nearly any sort of wager or duel. Are you ready to gamble with a fiend? Would you wager a year of your life for a moment of good fortune when you need it the most? If any of the rumors are true, these are examples of what's possible at Chance.": "{@b Take a chance}. 龙眼区充满了输掉工资的方法，无论是在成熟的赌博厅还是在街头巷尾。如果你想找一些更奇特的东西，看看你是否能找到 \"机会\"。这既是一个秘密的、流动的赌馆的名字，也是经营这个赌馆的变种人的名字。除了提供各种平凡的游戏和赌注外，据说机会还能够安排和涵盖几乎所有种类的赌注或决斗。你准备好和一个恶魔赌博了吗？你愿意用你一年的生命作赌注，在你最需要的时候换取一时的好运吗？如果有任何传言是真的，这些都是在《机会》中可能出现的例子。",
	"{@b Find refuge}. Though most of the refugees in High Walls come from Cyre, the district is a haven for anyone displaced in the war, including Brelish.

	"{@b Bond over blood}. The Graystone district in Middle Tavick's Landing is one of the few places in Breland where the Blood of Vol religion is practiced openly. Residents are circumspect about their activities, and undead servants are largely kept off the streets. But if you're a follower of the faith, it's a place where you can participate in the Sacrament of the Blood or consult with a priest. It's also the best place to find a skilled necromancer, or to hear rumors about the latest schemes of the Order of the Emerald Claw.": "{@b Bond over blood}. 中塔维克城的灰石区是布雷兰德为数不多的公开信奉沃尔之血宗教的地方之一。居民们对自己的活动都很谨慎，不死的仆人也基本上不在街上出现。但如果你是该信仰的追随者，你可以在这里参加血之圣礼或向牧师咨询。这里也是寻找熟练的死灵法师的最好地方，或者听到关于翡翠之爪骑士团最新计划的传闻。",

	"A number of floating towers drift above the upper wards of Sharn, but these are dwarfed by Skyway, an entire district suspended above and between Central Plateau and Menthis Plateau. Built on an island of solidified cloud, Skyway holds the mansions of the wealthiest people in Khorvaire—nobles whose feet never touch the ground. It's a realm of wonders, filled with the finest examples of luxury and extravagance that gold can buy and magic can produce. For instance, Cloudpool Park is formed from sculpted cloudstuff, with window panels of ice that provide a view of the city below.": "一些浮动的塔楼漂浮在沙恩的上层区，但这些塔楼与天路相比相形见绌，天路是一个悬浮在中央高原和Menthis高原之间的整个地区。天空之路建立在一个凝固的云岛上，拥有霍尔韦尔最富有的人的豪宅--那些脚不沾地的贵族。这是一个奇迹的领域，充满了黄金可以买到的和魔法可以产生的最好的豪华和奢侈的例子。例如，云池公园是由雕刻的云层形成的，有冰窗板，可以看到下面的城市。",
	"Skyway is home to lavish estates. Prior to the Last War, noble families from across the Five Nations maintained mansions here. Though some of these places remain in the hands of their original owners, others were seized by the crown during the Last War and sold to wealthy citizens of Breland. The resulting influx of residents has brought more diversity to the district, with dragonmarked heirs and even wealthy criminals living alongside the nobility. The grandest estate in Skyway is Tain Manor, home of the ir'Tain family and the monthly Tain Gala (see \"{@book Holidays|ERLW|8|Holidays}\" earlier in this chapter).": "天路是奢华的庄园之家。在最后一次战争之前，来自五国各地的贵族家庭在这里维持着豪宅。虽然其中一些地方仍在原主人手中，但其他地方在最后一次战争期间被王室夺取，并卖给了布雷兰的富有公民。由此产生的居民涌入为该区带来了更多的多样性，有龙纹继承人，甚至是富有的罪犯与贵族们一起生活。天路最宏伟的庄园是泰恩庄园，是伊尔泰恩家族和每月一次的泰恩盛会的所在地（见本章前面的\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"This district offers the highest-priced services in the city. The Dragon's Hoard is a Ghallanda resort, where travelers can enjoy the utmost in luxury if they can afford the most expensive amenities. The Celestial Vista and the Cloud Dragon are wondrous restaurants. The Azure Gateway is a new hotel and restaurant that has replaced a Ghallanda establishment. The owner has remained anonymous, and this touch of mystery has piqued interest in the place.": "这个区提供城市中价格最高的服务。龙之囤是一个加兰达度假村，如果旅客能负担得起最昂贵的设施，就能享受到最豪华的服务。The Celestial Vista和云龙餐厅是奇妙的餐厅。蔚蓝之门是一家新的酒店和餐厅，取代了加兰达的一个机构。老板一直是匿名的，这种神秘感引起了人们对这个地方的兴趣。",
	"If you're interested in mingling with nobles or celebrities, or if you want to pull off a heist that targets the richest people in Sharn, Skyway is the place to do that.": "如果你对与贵族或名人打交道感兴趣，或者你想实施针对沙恩最富有的人的抢劫，天路就是这样的地方。",
	"No bridges or lifts connect Skyway to the rest of the city, so the usual way to reach the floating district is by taking a skycoach or hiring a flying mount.": "没有桥梁或电梯将天路与城市的其他地方连接起来，因此到达浮动区的通常方法是乘坐空中客车或租用飞行坐骑。",
	"Cliffside encompasses the docks and waterfront of Sharn, running along the edge of the Dagger River and up the cliff above it. Massive lifts levitate goods up to the skydocks in the district of Precarious. The area's rough and poor, filled with sailors and dockworkers. Many of these boisterous folk love the life in Cliffside; as a common saying goes, \"Better a tankard of ale in Cliffside than a barrel of Central wine.\"": "悬崖边包括了沙恩的码头和滨水区，沿着匕首河的边缘和上面的悬崖延伸。巨大的升降机将货物漂浮到岌岌可危区的空中码头上。这个地区粗糙而贫穷，到处是水手和码头工人。这些人中的许多人都喜欢崖边的生活；正如一句俗语所说，\"在崖边喝一罐啤酒比喝一桶中央酒更好\"。",
	"Plenty of legitimate services can be found here—ships need supplies and repairs, goods need to be stored, captains need to hire crew, and sailors need a dry bed to sleep in once in a while—but other businesses meet different kinds of demands. These services include bordellos, taverns, gaming dens, and shadier entertainments for sailors to spend their off duty hours and wages on.": "在这里可以找到很多合法的服务--船只需要补给和维修，货物需要储存，船长需要雇佣船员，水手们偶尔也需要一张干爽的床来睡觉。这些服务包括妓院、酒馆、游戏厅和更多的娱乐活动，供水手们在下班后的时间和工资上消费。",
	"Even though the Sharn Watch has a token presence here, Cliffside remains one of the most crime-ridden districts in the city. This situation is exacerbated by the presence of sahuagin, who sell their services as guides to help ships traveling to Xen'drik. In fact, the sahuagin rarely initiate violence, but there have been clashes between them and aggressive, drunken sailors.": "尽管沙恩观察站在这里有象征性的存在，悬崖边仍然是城市中犯罪率最高的地区之一。这种情况由于萨瓦金人的存在而变得更加严重，他们作为向导出售自己的服务，帮助前往Xen'drik的船只。事实上，萨瓦金人很少发起暴力，但他们与好斗的醉酒水手之间曾发生过冲突。",
	"The Cogs lie deep beneath Sharn, below the sewers and Old Sharn (described later in this chapter). Streams of Fernian lava flow through this area, and over the centuries, House Cannith has helped Breland establish vast foundries that tap this mystic resource. Ashblack and Blackbones are industrial districts, largely inhabited by warforged laborers and miserable workers of other races. It is said that House Cannith maintains a forgehold in the Ashblack district, and that this is where Baron Merrix d'Cannith conducts his experiments.": "Cogs位于沙恩的地下深处，在下水道和旧沙恩（本章后面有描述）之下。费尔尼安熔岩流经这一地区，几个世纪以来，坎尼斯家族帮助布雷兰德建立了巨大的铸造厂，开采这一神秘的资源。灰黑（Ashblack）和黑骨（Blackbones）是工业区，主要居住着战争锻造的劳工和其他种族的悲惨的工人。据说坎尼斯家族在灰黑区有一个锻造厂，而这也是梅里克斯-坎尼斯男爵进行实验的地方。",
	"The Sharn Watch maintains a presence in the Cogs, and overseers from House Cannith are stationed here to keep things in order. Beyond these industrial districts lies the deeper tunnels of Khyber's Gate, a tenement district.": "沙恩观察站在Cogs保持了一定的影响力，坎尼斯家族的监督员也驻扎在这里，以维持秩序。在这些工业区之外，是开伯尔之门（Khyber's Gate）的更深的隧道，这是一个租界区。",
	"Blackbones has a number of remarkable locations. For example, the Pool of Onatar's Tears is sacred to the Sovereign of the Forge. The current caretaker is a warforged priest named Smith, who believes that Onatar has plans for the warforged, and that the warforged and creatures of flesh are meant to live together.": "布莱克本斯有许多了不起的地方。例如，奥纳塔的眼泪之池是锻造之君的圣地。目前的看守人是一位名叫史密斯的战神牧师，他相信奥纳塔为战神制定了计划，而且战神和肉体的生物注定要生活在一起。",
	"Most of the citizens of Sharn have never been to the Cogs. The area does house the bulk of the city's warforged population, and if you're looking for a particular warforged, it's the best place to start. Industrial espionage and labor struggles can add drama to adventures in the great foundries, not to mention the possibility of artificers with secret forges hidden in the Cogs.": "大多数沙恩的市民都没有去过Cogs。这个地区确实容纳了城市中大部分的战争锻造者，如果你在寻找一个特定的战争锻造者，这里是最好的起点。工业间谍和劳工斗争可以为大铸造厂的冒险增加戏剧性，更不用说可能会有工匠在齿轮箱中隐藏秘密的锻造。",
	"Sharn boasts countless opportunities for adventurers. You can get caught up in espionage in Upper Central or drawn into a crime war in Lower Dura. Aside from the intrigues and politics of the city, Sharn has a wide range of cursed ruins, haunted slums, shunned catacombs, and other dangerous places. Wise folk avoid these areas, but those whose hunger for adventure outweighs their good sense might do the opposite.": "沙恩为冒险者提供了无数的机会。你可以在上中部陷入间谍活动，也可以被卷入下杜拉的犯罪战争中。除了城市的阴谋和政治之外，沙恩还有各种被诅咒的废墟、闹鬼的贫民窟、避之不及的地下墓穴和其他危险的地方。明智的人们会避开这些地方，但那些对冒险的渴望超过了他们的理智的人可能会做出相反的选择。",
	"Look to the cliffs to the north of Sharn, and you'll see a collection of crypts embedded into the cliff face. This is the City of the Dead, the final resting place of the wealthiest citizens of Sharn. Common folk are cremated after death, but members of the Sixty Families and others with sufficient wealth have their remains interred in the tombs and tunnels of this necropolis.": "向沙恩北部的悬崖看去，你会看到嵌在崖壁上的一系列墓穴。这是死者之城，是沙恩最富有的公民的最后安息之地。普通人死后会被火化，但60个家族的成员和其他拥有足够财富的人将他们的遗体埋葬在这座死城的墓穴和隧道里。",
	"Few people reside in this area. Among its major features are Aureon's Holt, a temple of the Restful Watch, where Sovereign priests conduct funerals and serve as the caretakers of the tombs. Warden Tower is an outpost of the Church of the Silver Flame, staffed by a single hermit tasked to watch for supernatural threats.": "很少有人居住在这个地区。它的主要特点是奥瑞恩的霍尔特，这是一座安息守望的神庙，主权牧师在这里主持葬礼并担任坟墓的看守人。典狱长塔是银焰教会的前哨，由一名隐士负责监视超自然的威胁。",
	"Though the City of the Dead is largely peaceful, stories circulate about dark powers lurking there. Some parents warn their children of the Lich-Priest Gath, who steals disobedient children and forces them to work in his kingdom of the dead, polishing the bones of his skeletal subjects.": "虽然死亡之城在很大程度上是和平的，但流传着关于那里潜伏着黑暗力量的故事。一些父母警告他们的孩子，巫师加思偷走了不听话的孩子，强迫他们在他的死亡王国里工作，为他的骷髅臣民打磨骨头。",
	"Sharn was built on the foundations of an older city, which was itself built atop goblin ruins. This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.": "沙恩建立在一个古老城市的基础上，而这个城市本身就是建立在地精的废墟之上。这座古老的城市被黑暗的魔法摧毁了，由臭名昭著的哈拉斯-塔卡南和他的妃子--瘟疫之女的元素力量提供。据说邪恶的力量仍然在这些废墟中徘徊，为此加利法尔一世国王用金属和魔法之门封住了通往这座地下城市的所有通道。这些门户至今仍被封存，篡改它们是非法的。但人们普遍认为，旧沙恩的废墟中隐藏着许多宝藏，以及过去难以言喻的秘密。",
	"No one knows exactly what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took refuge in the fallen city. In olden times, the Lady of the Plague had power over vermin and disease, and a fanciful tale says that even today the undercity is inhabited by swarms of sentient rats and beetles.": "没有人确切地知道在旧沙恩潜伏着什么。废墟中可能有鬼魂或其他亡灵，是那些在堕落的城市中避难的有反常标记的人的复仇之魂。在古代，瘟疫女士拥有控制害虫和疾病的力量，一个奇特的故事说，即使在今天，这个城市的地下仍然居住着成群的有生命的老鼠和甲虫。",
	"You'll hear warning bells toll tomorrow morning. You'll see packs of people with their faces hidden by plague masks or strips of cloth. Jorasco healers will roam the streets offering free examinations and blessings. If you're new to Sharn, have no fear! This isn't the outbreak of disease it appears to be; it's how Sharn observes the Lady's Day, commemorating a tragic incident in our past.": "明天早上你会听到警告的钟声。你会看到成群结队的人，他们的脸被瘟疫面具或布条遮住。乔拉斯科治疗师将在街上游荡，提供免费检查和祝福。如果你是新来的沙恩人，不要害怕！这不是爆发瘟疫。这并不是表面上的疾病爆发；这是沙恩纪念女士节的方式，纪念我们过去的一个悲惨事件。",
	"Today, aberrant dragonmarks are rare. But there was a time long ago when they were far more common. An army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of disease-infested vermin.": "今天，反常的龙纹是罕见的。但在很久之前，它们曾有过一段更为普遍的时期。在沙恩的早期，一支由反常继承人组成的军队在这里安家，领头的是被称为 \"撼地者 \"的哈拉斯-塔卡南，以及拥有控制害虫和疾病能力的 \"瘟疫女士\"。当龙纹屋围攻城市，他们的失败变得不可避免时，两人释放了他们的全部力量。塔卡南的力量将早期的塔楼变成了废墟，而瘟疫女士则召唤出了一大群疾病缠身的害虫。",
	"For centuries afterward, the region was shunned. When our modern city was built, the cursed ruins were sealed away. But one never knows when the darkness could rise up again. On the Lady's Day, we remember the tragedy that once befell Sharn, and we prepare for the possibility that it could happen again.": "在之后的几个世纪里，这个地区被避开了。当我们的现代城市建成后，被诅咒的废墟被封存起来。但人们永远不知道黑暗何时会再次兴起。在女士节，我们纪念曾经降临在沙恩身上的悲剧，并为它可能再次发生做好准备。",
	"The Fallen district in Lower Dura was once known as Godsgate. When the first towers were raised, Godsgate was the temple district. It had shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district was abandoned.": "下杜拉的堕落区曾被称为神门。当第一座塔楼升起时，神门是神庙区。它有献给君主的神龛和雕像，有骄傲的银色火焰教堂，甚至还有一座不朽法庭的纪念碑。但随着沙恩的发展和繁荣，宗教仪式被转移到上层区的更大的寺庙。神门成为了一个租户区，而神龛和纪念碑则被遗忘，任其腐烂。对这个曾经辉煌的地区的最后一击是在上次战争初期。一队Aundairian破坏者推倒了沙恩的一座浮动塔，坠落的塔尖击中了神门。建筑物倒塌了，数百人死亡。未经处理的尸体导致了感染和疾病。市议会没有兴趣将黄金沉入下杜拉以恢复该地区，该地区被遗弃。",
	"Today, the district known as Fallen is strewn with the rubble of the fallen tower, mingled with shattered buildings and broken statues. Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers, feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are the result of failed experiments.": "今天，被称为 \"堕落 \"的地区到处都是倒下的塔的废墟，混杂着破碎的建筑和破碎的雕像。那些冒险进入堕落区的人必须对付掠夺者，潜伏在阴影中的野蛮人。掠夺者的存在是毫无疑问的，但他们的真实性质仍然是一个争论的话题。一个常见的假设是，他们是该地区原始居民的后代，他们被塔楼倒塌时死去的人的鬼魂附身并被逼疯。还有人声称，瓦达里斯家族一直在尝试用魔法培育超级士兵，而拉弗尔人是实验失败的结果。",
	"Only the most desperate people live here, and the forces of the law won't come near it. As a result, the district has a lot of space available for any cult or secret society that needs a lair. The followers of a radiant idol, the Cult of the Dragon Below, or any other cabal could lay claim to a shattered church in Fallen.": "只有最绝望的人住在这里，法律的力量不会靠近它。因此，该区有大量的空间可供任何需要巢穴的邪教或秘密团体使用。辐射神像的追随者、龙下之教或任何其他阴谋集团都可以在堕落区的一个破碎的教堂里提出要求。",
	"Beyond the Cogs lies Khyber's Gate, a maze of tunnels and tenements carved into the stone. The Sharn Watch has no presence here, and the closest thing to an authority is the criminal organization known as Daask; if you're seeking the leaders of this group, this is where you'll find them. Many of the inhabitants of the Gate are goblins and immigrants from Droaam, but it's also home to fugitives, war criminals, and other unsavory types.": "在 \"齿轮 \"之外是开伯尔之门，这是一个由刻在石头上的隧道和房舍组成的迷宫。沙恩看守所在这里没有存在感，最接近权威的是被称为Daask的犯罪组织；如果你在寻找这个组织的领导人，你会在这里找到他们。门里的许多居民是地精和来自德拉姆的移民，但这里也是逃犯、战犯和其他不受欢迎的人的家。",
	"Khyber's Gate is part of the ruins of a goblin city that was abandoned thousands of years ago. No one knows how deep it goes. The monstrous inhabitants of the district have no love for treasure hunters or adventurers, and it's a dangerous place to explore.": "开伯尔之门是几千年前被遗弃的地精城市废墟的一部分。没有人知道它有多深。该区的畸形居民不喜欢寻宝者或冒险者，这是一个危险的探索之地。",
	"Shamukaar is the most successful tavern in Khyber's Gate. The place is a safe haven for all within it, regardless of species or politics; once you make it through the door, you can breathe easy.": "沙穆卡是开伯尔之门最成功的酒馆。这个地方对其内的所有人来说都是一个安全的避风港，不管是什么物种或政治；一旦你进了这个门，你就可以轻松地呼吸。",
	"The upper wards of Sharn use a network of chutes to funnel garbage down into the sewers. Refuse and filth is channeled into cavernous midden chambers, where it is left to rot or be devoured by the vermin and oozes that inhabit the sewers. Smaller tunnels channel wastewater into purification centers, where magewrights use magic to cleanse the water. A special unit of the Sharn Watch protects the purification chambers. Beyond these small, vital areas, the sewers are lawless.": "沙恩的上层区使用一个网络滑道将垃圾输送到下水道。垃圾和污秽物被输送到洞穴中，在那里任其腐烂或被居住在下水道中的害虫和渗虫吞噬。较小的隧道将废水导入净化中心，由魔法师使用魔法来净化水。沙恩守望的一支特殊部队保护着净化室。除了这些小而重要的区域，下水道是无法无天的。",
	"Though the sewers were never intended to support a population, over the centuries a subculture has evolved in this region. A few tribes of people—mostly goblins, along with a few shifters, dwarves, and feral halflings—live in the sewers, rummaging through the midden heaps and selling their goods in the lower city. These sewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival. The sewer clans can pose a threat to adventurers, but they can also be valuable allies; there are no better guides to the sewers and what lies beneath them than one of the folk who live there.": "虽然下水道从来就不是用来支持人口的，但几个世纪以来，在这个地区已经发展出一种亚文化。有几个部落的人--主要是地精，还有一些变异人、矮人和野蛮的半身人--住在下水道里，在禁闭室里翻箱倒柜，在下层城市里卖东西。这些下水道氏族不断地争夺地盘，因为控制一个或多个禁猎室对生存至关重要。下水道氏族可以对冒险者构成威胁，但他们也可以成为有价值的盟友；没有比住在下水道里的人更适合指导下水道及其下面的东西了。",
	"Under the laws of Sharn, crime takes many forms. Any sort of theft is illegal, including \"malicious theft of identity\"—the use of shapeshifting abilities or illusion magic to impersonate someone with the intent to cause harm. Assault, murder, and fraud will all land you in hot water. Other activities walk the edge of legality. Gambling and prostitution are legal in Sharn, but these industries are heavily taxed and regulated. Likewise, smuggled goods include illegal merchandise such as drugs and mystical explosives, but also heavily taxed goods, such as the drug known as dreamlily (described in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11|Crime in Sharn}).": "根据沙恩的法律，犯罪有多种形式。任何形式的盗窃都是非法的，包括 \"恶意盗窃身份\"--使用变形能力或幻觉魔法来冒充某人，意图造成伤害。攻击、谋杀和欺诈都会使你陷入困境。其他活动则处于合法的边缘。赌博和卖淫在沙恩是合法的，但这些行业都受到严格的税收和监管。同样地，走私货物包括非法商品，如毒品和神秘的爆炸物，但也有重税货物，如被称为Dreamlily的药物（在（%0%）中描述）。",
	"Although crime occurs throughout Sharn, it is most apparent in Lower Dura and the Cogs. The Sharn Watch has a minimal presence in these wards, which are the easiest places to sell stolen goods or to hire an assassin. Of course, they're also good places to get robbed or caught up in a street brawl.": "尽管犯罪在整个沙恩都有发生，但在下杜拉和齿轮区最为明显。沙恩观察站在这些地区的存在感极低，这些地区是最容易出售赃物或雇佣刺客的地方。当然，它们也是被抢劫或被卷入街头斗殴的好地方。",
	"Sharn is home to a large number of minor gangs and independent criminals. Even so, most criminal activities in the city come under the purview of one of four criminal organizations: the Boromar Clan, Daask, House Tarkanan, and the Tyrants. Even independents usually have an arrangement with one of these power groups. If your character has the criminal background, work with the DM to determine which of these organizations you're connected to (the DM has more information about these groups in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}).": "沙恩是大量小帮派和独立罪犯的家园。即便如此，这个城市的大多数犯罪活动都属于四个犯罪组织之一的管辖范围：波罗马家族、达斯克、塔卡南家族和暴君。即使是独立的人，也通常与这些权力集团之一有安排。如果你的角色有犯罪背景，请与DM合作，确定你与这些组织中的哪一个有联系（DM在{@book chapter 4|ERLW|11}中有关于这些组织的更多信息）。",
	"The Boromar Clan began as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Today the Boromars are one of Sharn's most influential families; there's a Boromar on the City Council. Also, the Boromars have close ties by marriage to the local branch of House Jorasco, and clan members can be seen at every Skyway gala.": "波洛玛氏族最初是一个来自塔伦塔平原的半身人移民家庭。今天，波洛玛家族是沙恩最具影响力的家族之一；市议会中就有一名波洛玛人。另外，博罗玛家族与乔拉斯科家族的当地分支有着密切的婚姻关系，在每一次天威盛典上都能看到该家族成员的身影。",
	"The Boromar Clan specializes in gambling, theft, and smuggling. In addition, it governs a wide network of lesser gangs and crime lords across the city. In the past, the clan's reputation was sufficiently strong to prevent any challenges. Over the last decade, however, the Boromars have been fending off a serious challenge from Daask. Those monsters have been aggressively targeting Boromar agents and holdings, and the feud between the two forces grows more heated all the time.": "波洛马氏族专门从事赌博、盗窃和走私活动。此外，它还管辖着整个城市的一个广泛的小型帮派和犯罪头目网络。在过去，该部族的声誉足以阻止任何挑战。然而，在过去的十年里，博罗玛家族一直在抵御来自达斯克的严重挑战。那些怪物一直在积极地针对波罗马人的代理人和财产，两股势力之间的争斗一直在加剧。",
	"Having a connection to the Boromar Clan makes you part of the established power in Sharn. It's an organization that values tradition and prefers to avoid violence. As an associate of the clan, you'll be expected to respect the hierarchy and follow the rules, and you might be targeted by Daask just as if you were a Boromar yourself.": "与博洛玛氏族有联系，使你成为沙恩既定权力的一部分。这是一个重视传统并倾向于避免暴力的组织。作为该家族的一员，你将被要求尊重等级制度并遵守规则，而且你可能会成为达斯克的目标，就像你自己是波罗马人一样。",

	"The Sharn Watch is responsible for enforcing the laws of the city. The sentinels of the watch patrol the streets of Sharn, to all outward appearances vigilant for signs of unrest. In truth, the Sharn Watch is riddled with corruption, from the commanding officers down to the lowliest patrollers. Dedicated guards who truly want to protect the innocent do exist. But bribery nonetheless runs rampant, and the watch has a way of failing to show up somewhere at the same time that Daask or the Boromar Clan is perpetrating some misdeed. The DM can find more information on the watch in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11|Sharn Watch}.": "沙恩监察局负责执行城市的法律。守望的哨兵们在沙恩的街道上巡逻，从外表上看，他们对动乱的迹象保持着警惕。事实上，沙恩守望充满了腐败，从指挥官到最低级的巡逻者都是如此。真正想保护无辜者的敬业的守卫确实存在。但贿赂还是很猖獗，而且在达斯克或波洛玛家族犯下某些恶行的时候，守夜人也有办法不出现在某个地方。DM可以在（%0%）中找到更多关于手表的信息。",
	"The members of the King's Citadel are the direct agents of the Brelish Crown. As such, the King's Citadel stands above the Sharn Watch. Its members have the authority to take control of any investigation and to command the service of any guard or sentinel. Typically the Citadel leaves the daily chores of law enforcement (including the conflicts between the criminal organizations of the lower towers) in the hands of the Sharn Watch. The Citadel is concerned with forces that threaten the entire city, or even the kingdom. Foreign spies, mad necromancers, and ancient fiends—these are the foes of the King's Citadel, rather than pickpockets and burglars.": "国王城堡的成员是布雷利什王室的直接代理人。因此，国王城堡的地位高于沙恩守望。其成员有权控制任何调查，并指挥任何警卫或哨兵的服务。通常情况下，城堡将执法的日常琐事（包括下层塔楼的犯罪组织之间的冲突）交给沙恩守望。城堡关注的是那些威胁到整个城市，甚至王国的力量。外国间谍、疯狂的死灵法师和古老的恶魔--这些都是国王城堡的敌人，而不是扒手和窃贼。",
	"Of course, many of these greater threats might be beyond the capabilities of the typical Citadel agents. Much as the Blackened Book does, the Citadel keeps a close eye on unusual and talented individuals, and a party of adventurers might be called upon to assist the Citadel in a dangerous mission.": "当然，这些更大的威胁中有许多可能超出了典型的城堡特工的能力。就像黑化书所做的那样，城主府密切关注不寻常的、有才华的人，一队冒险者可能会被要求协助城主府完成一项危险的任务。",
	"Unlike the Sharn Watch, the Citadel doesn't ask for help: it demands it. The knights of the Citadel are the representatives of the King of Breland, and any Brelish citizen who refuses to help them is committing an act of treason. The Citadel isn't required to provide compensation for the services it demands, but an adventurer who wins the respect of the Citadel can certainly benefit from the relationship.": "与沙恩守望不同，城主府并不要求帮助：它要求帮助。学城的骑士们是布雷兰国王的代表，任何拒绝帮助他们的布雷利什公民都是叛国行为。城主府不需要为它所要求的服务提供补偿，但赢得城主府尊重的冒险者肯定能从这种关系中获益。",

	"{@b The King's Swords} are elite soldiers used in the most dangerous military operations.": "{@b The King's Swords}是用于最危险军事行动的精英士兵。",
	"{@b The King's Wands} are wizards and sorcerers, serving the crown in all arcane matters.": "{@b The King's Wands}是魔法师和巫师，在所有奥秘事务中为王室服务。",
	"The headquarters of the Citadel is in the Ambassador Towers district of Middle Central, in Andith Tower. That structure also serves as the city jail.": "城堡的总部在中环的大使塔区，位于安迪斯塔。该建筑也是城市监狱。",
	"The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion are among the deadliest warriors in Sharn. When a situation calls for extreme military force, both the Sharn Watch and the King's Citadel turn to the Redcloak Battalion. This elite unit fought in the forefront of the Last War, and the bards in Menthis today sing of the exploits of Khandan the Hammer and Meira the Huntress. At the end of the war, the battalion was split up, and one unit was assigned to Sharn. Its headquarters is located in the Daggerwatch district of Upper Dura.": "红斗篷营的士兵是沙恩最致命的战士之一。当情况需要极端的军事力量时，沙恩守望和国王城堡都会求助于红斗篷营。这支精英部队在最后的战争中战斗在最前线，今天Menthis的吟游诗人唱起了锤子Khandan和女猎人Meira的功绩。战争结束后，该营被拆分，一支部队被分配到沙恩。其总部位于上杜拉的小刀观音区。",
	"Many of the members of the Redcloak Battalion resent being relegated to mere law enforcement, and there is a strong rivalry between the Redcloaks and the King's Swords of the Citadel, who generally have less military experience even though they enjoy far greater authority and prestige.": "红斗篷营的许多成员对被降级为单纯的执法者感到不满，而且红斗篷营与城堡的国王之剑之间存在着强烈的竞争，后者的军事经验通常较少，尽管他们享有更大的权力和威望。",
	"As veterans and heroes of the Last War, many of the Redcloaks are unfriendly toward travelers from other nations. As far as the Redcloaks are concerned, the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission, and soon King Boranel will come to his senses and finish the job that Wroann ir'Wynarn began.": "作为最后战争的老兵和英雄，许多红袍人对来自其他国家的旅行者并不友好。就红袍人而言，《王座条约》只是一个中场休息，很快博拉内尔国王就会恢复理智，完成沃伦-伊尔-维纳恩开始的工作。",
	"Officers of the watch can levy fines on the spot when they catch culprits, which is the typical way that minor crimes are dealt with. For a serious offense, the perpetrator is taken to a garrison and held until a trial can be arranged. A criminal who is considered to be a serious flight risk will be taken to the most secure facility in Sharn—the King's Citadel headquarters.": "值班人员在抓到罪犯时可以当场征收罚款，这是处理轻微犯罪的典型方式。对于严重的犯罪行为，犯罪者会被带到驻军中，并被关押到可以安排的审判。被认为有严重逃亡风险的罪犯会被带到沙恩最安全的设施--国王的城堡总部。",
	"Typically, a prisoner's case comes to the attention of a local magistrate within {@dice 1d4} days. The magistrate reviews the facts of the case and asks the victim to confirm or deny their role in the crime while under the influence of a {@spell zone of truth} spell. The magistrate will then propose a punishment to the accused; if the offer is refused, the case goes to trial.": "通常情况下，囚犯的案件会在{@dice 1d4}天内得到当地法官的关注。地方法官审查案件的事实，并要求受害者在{@spell zone of truth}咒语的影响下确认或否认他们在犯罪中的作用。然后，地方法官将向被告提出处罚建议；如果建议被拒绝，案件将被审判。",
	"Punishment for convicted criminals varies, but long-term imprisonment is quite rare. Prisoners who deemed to be too dangerous to be allowed to roam free are more likely to be executed than imprisoned. Typically, a long prison sentence is used only for criminals who can't be allowed to go free, but whose deaths would have negative diplomatic repercussions.": "对被定罪的罪犯的惩罚各不相同，但长期监禁是相当罕见的。被认为太危险而不允许自由活动的囚犯更有可能被处决而不是被监禁。通常情况下，长期监禁只用于不能允许自由的罪犯，但其死亡会产生负面的外交影响。",
	"Fines are the typical form of punishment. The amount of a fine is generally based on the nature of the crime, but a magistrate has the right to increase a fine to ensure that it is an effective punishment. For example, a fine of 10 gp is crippling to a commoner but can be inconsequential to an adventurer or a member of the Aurum, and in such cases it will be increased. Also, the court can confiscate possessions in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword confiscated instead might sting. If a criminal can't afford to pay a fine, the sentence might be changed to hard labor—or, in the case of adventurers, performing special services on behalf of the city or the Crown.": "罚款是典型的惩罚形式。罚款的数额一般是基于犯罪的性质，但地方法官有权增加罚款以确保它是一种有效的惩罚。例如，10金币的罚款对一个平民来说是致命的，但对一个冒险家或Aurum成员来说可能是无足轻重的，在这种情况下，它将被增加。另外，法庭可以没收财物来代替金币的支付；你可能不在乎必须支付100金币的罚款，但你祖父的魔剑被没收可能会很刺耳。如果一个罪犯无力支付罚金，可能会被改判为苦役，或者在冒险家的情况下，代表城市或王室进行特殊服务。",
	"Other kinds of punishment include branding (generally in a visible location, warning others of your criminal actions), exile, or several magical measures: an ongoing curse, a period of induced blindness, and so on. A repeat offender might be declared an outlaw, which status is often indicated by a brand. An outlaw is stripped of the protection of the law, and anyone can take any action against them without fear of legal retribution.": "其他类型的惩罚包括烙印（一般是在明显的位置，警告他人你的犯罪行为）、流放，或几种魔法措施：持续的诅咒、一段诱导性失明等等。惯犯可能会被宣布为逃犯，这种状态通常以烙印来表示。逃犯被剥夺了法律的保护，任何人都可以对他们采取任何行动而不必担心受到法律的报复。",
	"Get your own Eberron adventures up and running using the inspiration in this chapter. Eberron is filled with political intrigue, extraplanar threats, magical mysteries, and back-alley detective work—all in the context of a world emerging from the turmoil of war.": "利用本章的灵感，让你自己的Eberron冒险开始运行。Eberron充满了政治阴谋、星外威胁、魔法之谜和小巷侦探工作--所有这些都是在一个从战争的动荡中出现的世界背景下发生的。",

Following that overview is an in-depth look at various organizations and other elements you can use to drive the adventures you create. Such elements include maps of locations that can serve as thrilling set pieces; information on the planes of existence, elemental-powered airships, and the lightning rail; and an introductory adventure set in Sharn.": "本章首先介绍了弥漫在许多Eberron冒险中的三个关键主题：反复出现的恶棍、行动和阴谋。在这一概述之后，是对各种组织和其他元素的深入研究，你可以用它们来推动你所创造的冒险。这些元素包括可以作为惊心动魄的场景的地图；关于存在平面、元素驱动的飞艇和闪电轨道的信息；以及一个以沙恩为背景的介绍性冒险。",

	"A group of adventurers leaves the dark, rainy city, putting its mean streets behind them. They board a flame-ringed airship for a journey across the continent, but they're attacked by wyvern-riding bandits on the way and must fight for their lives as the airship hurtles toward the ground!": "一群冒险家离开了黑暗的雨城，将卑鄙的街道抛在脑后。他们登上火环飞艇，准备穿越大陆，但他们在途中遭到了骑狼人的强盗袭击，必须在飞艇冲向地面的过程中为自己的生命而战!",
	"After surviving the crash through a combination of quick thinking and heroic effort, they find themselves stranded in the gray mists of the Mournland, facing the dangers of a war-ravaged land as they try to find their way back to their original destination. The greatest horrors they are about to face might be the ones that lurk in the depths of their own hearts.": "在通过敏捷的思维和英勇的努力从坠机中幸存下来后，他们发现自己被困在哀伤之地的灰色迷雾中，在试图找到回到最初目的地的路上，他们面临着战争蹂躏下的危险。他们即将面临的最大恐怖可能是潜伏在他们自己内心深处的恐怖。",
	"As discussed in the introduction to this book, pulp adventure and noir intrigue are two major themes that interlace in Eberron. Weaving these themes together, or exploring either one in isolation, can give Eberron stories a unique feel. Adventures that take advantage of those themes help to reinforce a sense of place, immersing the players (and you) in a world that is still reeling from the effects of a hundred years of war, that is shaped by modern ideas and aesthetics, and that is set apart from the rest of the D&D multiverse by a magical barrier.": "正如本书介绍中所讨论的，纸浆冒险和黑色阴谋是Eberron中交织的两个主要主题。将这些主题交织在一起，或者孤立地探索其中任何一个，都能给Eberron故事带来独特的感觉。利用这些主题的冒险有助于加强地方感，使玩家（和你）沉浸在一个仍然从百年战争的影响中恢复过来的世界中，这个世界是由现代思想和美学塑造的，并且被一个神奇的屏障与D&D多元宇宙的其他部分分开。",
	"This section is an introduction to those themes, designed to help you tell stories that fit well in Eberron. It explores techniques for making compelling recurring villains, and for keeping the action moving over the course of an adventure. It discusses how to use the Last War as a theme and a setting for adventures, and details the Mournland as an adventure location. It goes on to describe adventures and encounters that can occur in transit—on airships, on lightning rails, and at resting spots along the way. Finally, this section discusses the role that creatures typically defined as \"monsters\" play in Khorvaire, and explores Eberron's cosmology.": "本节是对这些主题的介绍，旨在帮助你讲述适合Eberron的故事。它探讨了制作令人信服的反复出现的反派的技巧，以及在冒险过程中保持行动的技巧。它讨论了如何将 \"最后的战争 \"作为一个主题和冒险的背景，并详细介绍了作为冒险地点的 \"哀伤之地\"。它接着描述了在运输过程中可能发生的冒险和遭遇--在飞艇上、在闪电轨道上以及在沿途的休息点。最后，本节讨论了通常被定义为 \"怪物 \"的生物在Khorvaire中扮演的角色，并探讨了Eberron的宇宙学。",
	"The most effective villains are the ones that return, over and over, to plague their heroic nemeses. When the heroes foil the schemes of an evil mastermind, the clever villain escapes to fight another day. A well-developed recurring villain can put a face to the sinister conspiracies that lurk in the darkness and thus strengthen the players' sense of immersion in the world.": "最有效的反派是那些一次又一次回来困扰他们的英雄对手的反派。当英雄们挫败了一个邪恶主谋的阴谋时，聪明的反派就会逃之夭夭。一个发展良好的反复出现的反派可以为潜伏在黑暗中的险恶阴谋揭开面纱，从而加强玩家对这个世界的沉浸感。",
	"You can make a recurring villain in your campaign more intriguing by introducing moral ambiguity into the villain's background, possibly through references to the individual's experiences during the Last War.": "你可以通过在反派的背景中引入道德上的模糊性来使你的活动中反复出现的反派更加引人注意，可能是通过参考个人在最后战争中的经历。",
	"It was too good to be true.": "这好得不像是真的。",
	"A year ago, the nefarious Alais ir'Rannan was presumed dead when she fell from an airship into the middle of Lake Galifar. Her scheme to bring the towers of Arcanix to the ground likewise seemed ended.": "一年前，邪恶的Alais ir'Rannan从飞艇上坠入加利法尔湖中，被认为已经死亡。她将阿卡尼克斯的塔楼夷为平地的计划似乎也随之结束。",
	"But yesterday, according to eyewitness reports, ir'Rannan was seen in the common room of Passage's own King's Star Inn, talking with two other unsavory-looking characters who could not be identified.": "但昨天，根据目击者的报告，有人看到伊尔兰南在帕萨奇自己的国王之星旅馆的公共房间里，与另外两个看起来不光彩的人物交谈，这些人的身份无法确定。",
	"The first task in crafting a good recurring villain is ensuring that the villain survives a first encounter with the adventurers in order to come back and plague them again. What follows are some tactics to make sure that even the most resourceful characters can't dispose of your villain at the first possible opportunity.": "塑造一个好的反复出现的反派的首要任务是确保反派在与冒险者的第一次遭遇中幸存下来，以便再次回来困扰他们。下面是一些策略，以确保即使是最机智的角色也不能在第一时间处理掉你的反派。",
	"{@b Have Lackeys Do the Work.} A villain can easily postpone that first face-to-face confrontation with the adventurers by having lackeys soften the party up, all the while making sure that the adventurers know whom they work for—thus enhancing the villain's reputation.": "{@b Have Lackeys Do the Work.}一个恶棍可以通过让走狗软化队伍来轻松推迟与冒险者的第一次面对面的对抗，同时确保冒险者知道他们为谁工作--从而提高恶棍的声誉。",
	"{@b Use All Available Resources.} A smart villain, especially one with access to magic, can put a lot of obstacles in the way of an adventuring party. Mechanical and magical traps, wards against divination, and protective magic items are just a few of the security measures available to a resourceful villain. Keep in mind that reports from surviving lackeys—and news about the adventurers from other sources—can give the villain enough information about the party's capabilities to prepare appropriate countermeasures.": "{@b Use All Available Resources.}一个聪明的反派，尤其是一个可以使用魔法的反派，可以在冒险队伍的路上设置很多障碍。机械和魔法陷阱、防止占卜的屏障和保护性的魔法物品只是足智多谋的小人可用的安全措施中的一部分。请记住，从幸存的走狗那里得到的报告，以及从其他来源得到的关于冒险者的消息，可以给小人提供足够的关于队伍能力的信息，以准备适当的反措施。",
	"{@b Have an Escape Plan.} Secret passages, spells of invisibility or teleportation, flying mounts, and throngs of minions can help a villain escape when a confrontation with the adventurers goes badly. Any villain likely has at least one fallback plan.": "{@b Have an Escape Plan.}秘密通道、隐身术或传送术、飞行坐骑和大量的奴仆可以帮助反派在与冒险者的对峙中逃脱。任何恶棍都可能有至少一个后备计划。",
	"{@b Take Hostages}. Most adventurers wouldn't be willing to attack the villain if they fear that the villains' lackeys are about to slaughter innocent captives the moment they draw their swords.": "{@b Take Hostages}. 如果大多数冒险家担心恶棍的走狗在他们拔剑的瞬间就要屠杀无辜的俘虏，他们就不会愿意攻击恶棍。",
	"{@b Returning from Death}. Of course, death is not a final fate for player characters, and it doesn't need to be for villains either. After the adventurers kill their nemesis, they might next encounter the villain raised from the dead or as an undead. It's conceivable that dying could make a villain more powerful and more angry at the meddling adventurers. Alternatively, the characters might assume a villain is dead—after falling over a waterfall, being trapped in a burning building, or getting swallowed by a purple worm—only to discover later that the villain survived and is hungry for revenge.": "{@b Returning from Death}. 当然，死亡并不是玩家角色的最终命运，对反派来说也不需要如此。在冒险家们杀死他们的克星后，他们可能会遇到这个坏蛋从死里复活或变成不死之身。可以想象，死亡可以使反派更加强大，对爱管闲事的冒险者更加愤怒。另外，角色们可能会认为反派已经死了--在跌落瀑布、被困在燃烧的建筑物中或被紫色的虫子吞下之后--后来发现反派幸存下来，并且渴望复仇。",
	"Adventurers get more powerful over time, so if a villain is going to remain a relevant threat, the villain needs to get more powerful as well. There are three ways you can approach this issue:": "随着时间的推移，冒险者会变得更加强大，所以如果一个反派要保持相关的威胁，反派也需要变得更加强大。有三种方法可以处理这个问题。",
	"{@b Mechanical Improvement}. Use the guidelines in {@book chapter 9|DMG|9|Modifying a Monster} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to add class levels or Hit Dice to the villain and improve its challenge rating to make it relevant to the higher-level characters.": "{@b Mechanical Improvement}. 使用{@book chapter 9|DMG|9|Modifying a Monster}中的准则，为小人增加等级或命中率，并提高其挑战等级，使之与高等级角色相关。",
	"{@b NPC Stat Blocks}. Some of the stat blocks in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} can reflect the same character at different stages of advancement. For example, the adventurers might confront a villain who uses the stat block of a {@creature mage} (9th-level wizard) and then returns later as an {@creature archmage} (18th-level wizard). You could also use stat blocks in other sources to add to the sequence, so the characters could even meet this aspiring villain as an {@creature apprentice wizard|VGM} and later as an {@creature evoker|VGM} (both in {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}).": "{@b NPC Stat Blocks}. {@book Monster Manual|MM}中的一些状态块可以反映同一个角色在不同阶段的进步。例如，冒险家们可能会面对一个使用{@creature mage}（9级巫师）状态块的恶棍，然后在后来作为{@creature archmage}（18级巫师）回来。你也可以使用其他来源的状态块来增加这个序列，所以人物甚至可以在{@creature apprentice wizard|VGM}时遇到这个有抱负的恶棍，后来又以{@creature evoker|VGM}的身份出现（都在{@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM}）。",
	"{@b Organizations as Villains}. Rather than use an individual as a recurring villain, you could think in terms of the organization the villain belongs to or represents. For example, low-level adventurers might fight low-level agents of the Order of the Emerald Claw and grow to loathe the sight of their claw-shaped symbol and green cloaks. As they attain higher levels, the characters will face increasingly more powerful members of the order.": "{@b Organizations as Villains}. 与其用一个人作为反复出现的反派，你可以从反派所属或代表的组织方面考虑。例如，低级别的冒险者可能会与翡翠之爪组织的低级别的代理人作战，并逐渐厌恶看到他们的爪形标志和绿色斗篷。当他们达到更高的级别时，人物将面对越来越强大的秩序成员。",
	"Moral ambiguity is a feature of the noir genre that can add richness and complexity to an Eberron adventure. In a world where a red dragon isn't necessarily evil (and a bronze one isn't necessarily good), it's impossible to know who you can trust, and even the actions of a so-called villain might not fit neatly into clear-cut definitions of good and evil. Even adventure villains are more often driven by human motives than by cosmic concepts of good and evil. People sometimes do evil things for good reasons.": "道德模糊性是黑色流派的一个特点，可以为Eberron的冒险增加丰富性和复杂性。在这个世界上，红龙不一定是邪恶的（而青铜龙也不一定是好的），你不可能知道谁可以信任，甚至一个所谓的反派的行为也可能不符合明确的善与恶的定义。即使是冒险中的反派，也往往是由人类的动机所驱动，而不是由宇宙的善恶概念所驱动。人们有时会出于好的理由做坏事。",
	"Exercise some caution when exploring these noir themes in the stories you develop. It can be fun for some people to wrestle with moral quandaries in adventures, but it doesn't work for all play groups. In particular, if there's no good solution to the quandary—if the characters have no choice but to follow a course of action they abhor—some players might end up unhappy.": "在你开发的故事中探索这些黑色主题时，要谨慎行事。对一些人来说，在冒险中与道德难题搏斗是很有趣的，但这并不适合所有的游戏团体。特别是，如果没有好的解决办法--如果角色别无选择，只能采取他们厌恶的行动--一些玩家最终可能会不高兴。",
	"The Morally Ambiguous Villains table offers some twists you can add to the villains in this chapter, giving them more or less good reasons to perform their evil deeds.": "道德上模棱两可的恶棍表提供了一些你可以添加到本章中的恶棍身上的转折，让他们有或多或少的理由去做他们的坏事。",
	"The villain is targeting people with aberrant dragonmarks in the desperate hope of preventing another War of the Mark.": "这个恶棍把目标对准了有异常龙纹的人，绝望地希望能阻止另一场龙纹战争。",
	"The villain is suffering under a terrible curse, and their increasingly serious crimes are an effort to fight off the curse.": "小人在一个可怕的诅咒下受苦，他们越来越严重的犯罪是为了抵御诅咒。",
	"The villain is rising to power through entirely legal means, winning popular support (through generous campaign promises) and working within the system.": "小人通过完全合法的手段上台，赢得民众支持（通过慷慨的竞选承诺），并在体制内工作。",
	"The villain's schemes are directed at preventing the release of a demonic overlord.": "恶棍的计划是为了阻止一个恶魔霸主的释放。",
	"Not every villain is a mastermind who schemes in the shadows or a world-destroying horror. Sometimes the most significant villain is someone the characters see every day—someone who moves around society in plain sight but keeps their evil deeds well hidden. The law enforcers and adventurers who are trying to bring the villain to justice are thwarted at every turn, unable to find proof of the villain's crimes. If the players come to loathe the villain, everything is going according to plan.": "并非每个反派都是在阴影中策划的主谋，或者是毁灭世界的恐怖人物。有时，最重要的反派是角色们每天都能看到的人--一个在社会上明目张胆地活动，却把他们的恶行隐藏得很好的人。执法者和冒险者试图将这个恶棍绳之以法，却处处受挫，无法找到恶棍犯罪的证据。如果玩家开始厌恶这个恶棍，那么一切都在按计划进行。",

	"In contrast to a villain who is a part of the characters' everyday life, an otherworldly villain isn't only anonymous but also fundamentally mysterious. It's not just a question of {@i who} the villain is, but also of {@i what} the villain is, and what extraordinary measures might be required to put a stop to their villainy. Even after the adventurers discover that their long-term nemesis is one of the Inspired, for example, they still need to learn the secrets of the Inspired and their quori masters in order to figure out how to deal with this threat.": "与作为人物日常生活一部分的反派相比，另一个世界的反派不仅是匿名的，而且从根本上说是神秘的。这不仅仅是一个{@i who}小人是什么的问题，也是一个{@i what}小人是什么的问题，以及可能需要采取什么非常规措施来制止他们的小人行为。例如，即使在冒险家们发现他们的长期克星是启发者之一之后，他们仍然需要了解启发者和他们的魁首的秘密，以便弄清楚如何应对这一威胁。",
	"Sometimes the mystery is enough to make such a villain compelling, with curiosity driving the adventurers to delve ever deeper into their foe's secrets. When the time is right, you can turn a mysterious villain into an unnervingly familiar villain—as a quori spirit takes delight in speaking through the mouths of multiple different Inspired hosts, taunting the adventurers for their inability to reach the spirit itself. Then resentment combines with curiosity to drive the adventurers to further exploration. When characters dig deeply into the mysteries of the world, your campaign benefits as they become more immersed in and attached to the setting.": "有时，神秘感足以让这样的反派引人注目，好奇心驱使冒险者不断深入研究他们敌人的秘密。当时机成熟时，你可以把一个神秘的小人变成一个令人不安的熟悉的小人--如一个夸父的灵魂很高兴通过多个不同的灵感主人的嘴说话，嘲弄冒险者，因为他们无法接触到灵魂本身。然后，怨恨与好奇心相结合，驱使冒险家们进一步探索。当角色深入挖掘世界的奥秘时，你的活动就会受益，因为他们会更加沉浸在这个环境中并对其产生感情。",
	"Some mysterious villains wield enough power to threaten the entire world through colossal strength, mastery of magic, dizzying intellect, or overwhelming charisma (or often some combination of these factors). These villains typically lurk in the shadows, pulling the strings of minions and partners while rarely making an appearance themselves. These villains are especially hard to get rid of, even if they are banished or imprisoned—their magic and their network of servants ensure that their reach extends far beyond their physical presence.": "一些神秘的反派通过巨大的力量、对魔法的掌握、令人眼花缭乱的智力或压倒性的魅力（或往往是这些因素的某种组合），拥有足以威胁整个世界的权力。这些反派通常潜伏在暗处，拉拢爪牙和伙伴，而自己却很少露面。这些恶棍特别难以摆脱，即使他们被放逐或监禁--他们的魔法和他们的仆人网络确保他们的影响力远远超过他们的实际存在。",

	"On the surface, the Aurum appears to be an exclusive society for the richest and most influential people of Khorvaire. Merchants, priests, military officers, and other luminaries gather for grand galas and salons. Beneath this gilded veneer, the members of the Aurum use their shared wealth and power to pursue their selfish goals, and a secret cabal at the heart of this fraternity dreams of global domination.": "从表面上看，Aurum似乎是一个专为Khorvaire最富有和最有影响力的人设立的社团。商人、牧师、军官和其他知名人士聚集在一起举行盛大的晚会和沙龙。在这层镀金的外衣下，Aurum的成员利用他们共享的财富和权力来追求他们自私的目标，而这个兄弟会的核心是一个秘密的阴谋集团，梦想着统治全球。",
	"The Aurum is divided into four suborders called Concords—copper, silver, gold, and platinum, in order of ascendance. Higher rank provides a member with improved access to the resources of the Aurum and a greater voice in society meetings. The Aurum isn't a secret society, and its meeting halls can be found in most major cities. Many powerful people openly wear the eight rings—one on each finger, with the metal indicating the rank of the wearer—that label them as Aurum members. The Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members might be celebrated by their local communities.": "Aurum分为四个子等级，称为Concords--铜、银、金和铂，依次递升。级别越高，会员就越能获得Aurum的资源，并在社会会议中拥有更大的发言权。Aurum并不是一个秘密社团，它的会议厅在大多数大城市都能找到。许多有权势的人公开戴着八个戒指，每个手指上都有一个，金属表明佩戴者的等级，表明他们是Aurum成员。曙光会经常从事慈善活动，因此一些成员可能会受到当地社区的赞誉。",
	"When members gather, they discuss shared interests, especially in history and archaeology. Aurum members often take an interest in a particular civilization or era of history; one Concordian collects relics of the Cul'sir giants of Xen'drik, while another pursues artifacts of the dragons of Argonnessen. One of the most common ways in which adventurers cross paths with the Aurum is through these collectors. Members of the Aurum often fund expeditions to exotic lands or newly discovered ruins, interested in expanding their private hoards. Occasionally a Concordian tries to acquire prized relics through less honorable means; adventurers could be employed to acquire an exotic prize from a rival through any means necessary, legal or otherwise.": "当成员聚会时，他们讨论共同的兴趣，特别是在历史和考古学方面。Aurum成员通常对某个特定的文明或历史时代感兴趣；一个Concordian人收集Xen'drik的Cul's sir巨人的遗物，而另一个则追求Argonnessen龙的文物。冒险家们与曙光会交手的最常见方式之一就是通过这些收藏家。奥鲁姆的成员经常资助探险队前往异国他乡或新发现的遗迹，对扩大他们的私人囤积物感兴趣。偶尔也有康科迪亚人试图通过不那么光荣的手段获得珍贵的遗物；冒险者可以被雇佣，通过任何必要的手段，不管是合法的还是其他的，从对手那里获得异域的奖品。",
	"All of these activities are entirely legitimate. The Aurum is a society for wealthy scholars and philanthropists. But there is a secret order that ranks higher than the Platinum Concord—an inner circle known as the Shadow Cabinet. The members of this cabal are nobles but not kings; they are powerful industrialists, but not dragonmarked barons. They are determined to become the true rulers of Khorvaire, whether by binding the current barons and monarchs to their will or by tearing down the current systems and creating something new.": "所有这些活动都是完全合法的。Aurum是一个为富有的学者和慈善家服务的社团。但有一个比白金协约更高级的秘密秩序--一个被称为影子内阁的内部圈子。这个阴谋集团的成员是贵族，但不是国王；他们是强大的工业家，但不是龙纹男爵。他们决心成为Khorvaire的真正统治者，无论是通过将当前的男爵和君主束缚在他们的意志之下，还是通过拆毁当前的系统并创造新的东西。",
	"In stories driven by action, the Aurum can fund expeditions to exotic lands and use magical doomsday devices to hold cities for ransom. In adventures driven by intrigue, the Aurum provides an opportunity to explore the lure of gold, and how far the characters might go in the service of an amoral patron.": "在以行动为导向的故事中，Aurum可以为远征异国他乡提供资金，并使用神奇的末日装置来勒索城市的赎金。在由阴谋驱动的冒险中，Aurum提供了一个机会来探索黄金的诱惑，以及人物在为不道德的主顾服务时可能走多远。",
	"The Last War gave birth to the Shadow Cabinet. The war ignited the passions of Concordians who blamed the monarchs of the Five Nations for the vast devastation and loss. It also created opportunities that never existed under the united Galifar. Many of the members of the Aurum gained influence by bankrolling one or more war efforts, or by stepping in to maintain the infrastructure while the government directed its attention to military matters. The Aurum also includes a number of powerful military officers and warlords. Some despise the nobles that drove them to war; others are furious that the war ended without a decisive victory. Either way, these can provide the Shadow Cabinet with unexpected military power.": "最后一场战争催生了影子内阁。这场战争点燃了康科迪亚人的激情，他们指责五国君主造成了巨大的破坏和损失。它也创造了在统一的加利法尔时期从未存在过的机会。Aurum的许多成员通过为一场或多场战争提供资金，或在政府将注意力集中在军事事务上时介入维护基础设施，从而获得影响力。奥鲁姆还包括一些强大的军事官员和军阀。有些人鄙视驱使他们参战的贵族；有些人则对战争没有取得决定性的胜利就结束感到愤怒。无论怎样，这些都能为影子内阁提供意想不到的军事力量。",
	"Now, amid the war's cooling ashes, the Aurum's power is fragmented. On several occasions, investments and gambles that paid dividends in money and power to one Concordian sapped the fortune of another, because each was unknowingly working against the other's interests. Huge collections of art, historical artifacts, and precious tomes were destroyed or lost during the war, and the Aurum's leaders salivate at the thought of recovering some of those riches.": "现在，在战争冷却的灰烬中，Aurum的力量四分五裂。有几次，为一个康科迪亚人带来金钱和权力红利的投资和赌博耗尽了另一个康科迪亚人的财富，因为每个人都在不知不觉中与对方的利益作对。大量的艺术品、历史文物和珍贵的书籍在战争中被毁或丢失，而Aurum的领导人一想到能找回其中的一些财富就垂涎三尺。",
	"Aurum Concordians are defined by their wealth and power. When you create an Aurum NPC, consider the source of that person's wealth and how it is expressed. The dwarf Antus ir'Soldorak is chancellor of the Platinum Concord and founder of the Shadow Cabinet. He owns vast gold and silver mines in the Mror Holds and mints his own currency, and he travels in a gilded airship. Loyal Daison is a Karrnathi slumlord who has made a fortune providing low-rent (and low-quality) housing for refugees. He lost his hand in an industrial accident and had it replaced with a golden prosthetic.": "Aurum Concordians是由他们的财富和权力决定的。当你创建一个Aurum NPC时，要考虑这个人的财富来源以及如何表达。矮人Antus ir'Soldorak是白金协约国的首相和影子内阁的创始人。他在Mror Holds拥有巨大的金银矿，并铸造自己的货币，他乘坐镀金的飞艇旅行。洛亚-戴森是卡尔纳特的贫民窟主，他为难民提供低租金（和低质量）的住房而发了财。他在一次工业事故中失去了手，并被换成了一个金色的假肢。",
	"Members of the Aurum become villains if their quest for greater influence, personal power, and wealth victimizes the innocent. Whether villains or allies, all Concordians wield significant political influence. They have access to minions and resources in the higher levels of society. They prefer to pursue schemes of coercion and conspiracy, putting their money and influence to work, than resort to blatant violence in any form.": "如果奥鲁姆的成员为了追求更大的影响力、个人权力和财富而使无辜者受害，他们就会成为恶棍。无论是恶棍还是盟友，所有康科迪恩人都拥有巨大的政治影响力。他们可以接触到社会高层的爪牙和资源。他们更喜欢追求胁迫和阴谋的计划，将他们的金钱和影响力用于工作，而不是诉诸任何形式的公然暴力。",
	"An aging dwarf—a retired general and an Aurum Concordian—collects unusual constructs, hoping to find a way to transfer his mind into a superior body.": "一个年迈的矮人--退役将军和Aurum Concordian--收集不寻常的构造物，希望找到一种方法，将他的思想转移到一个卓越的身体中。",
	"An Aurum Concordian is renowned for having the finest arcane library in Khorvaire. Adventurers might help them collect more tome, but when a number of prominent wizards are murdered and their research goes missing, is the Concordian to blame?": "一个Aurum Concordian因拥有Khorvaire最好的奥术图书馆而闻名。冒险家们可能会帮助他们收集更多的巨著，但是当一些著名的巫师被谋杀，他们的研究也失踪了，康科迪安人是否应该受到责备？",
	"A member of the Gold Concord is on the run from the Aurum after learning a terrible secret.": "黄金协约组织的一名成员在得知一个可怕的秘密后，正从奥鲁姆那里逃亡。",
	"An imprisoned Concordian mobilizes a network of contacts and well-placed Aurum members in order to secure their own release.": "一个被囚禁的协约国成员动员了一个联络网和位置良好的Aurum成员，以确保他们自己的释放。",
	"It's easy to introduce the Aurum to the characters early in a campaign. Its members are public figures, sometimes eccentric but not necessarily evil. A Concordian could hire the adventurers to solve a mystery or to acquire a harmless curio. A Concordian could be tied to the party's group patron (see {@book chapter 1|ERLW|4})—the owner of the newspaper, a major donor to the university, or the power behind a criminal syndicate.": "在战役的早期，很容易将Aurum介绍给人物。它的成员是公众人物，有时很古怪，但不一定是坏人。Concordian可以雇佣冒险者来解开一个谜团或者获得一个无害的古玩。一个协作者可以与团队的赞助人（见（%0%））联系在一起--报纸的所有者、大学的主要捐赠者，或者犯罪集团的幕后力量。",
	"Alternatively, an Aurum Concordian can be a behind-the-scenes villain: low-level adventurers could clash with the Concordian's hired goons as they pursue the same treasure, or the adventurers could be trying to solve a mystery the thugs are covering up. As the campaign progresses, the characters might face higher-ranking members of the Aurum, or recurring mercenaries who are increasing in power and status at the same rate they are.": "另外，Aurum Concordian可以是一个幕后的恶棍：低级别的冒险者可以与Concordian雇佣的打手发生冲突，因为他们追求的是同一个宝藏，或者冒险者可以试图解决打手们掩盖的一个谜团。随着战役的进展，角色们可能会面对更高级别的奥鲁姆成员，或者是以同样的速度增加权力和地位的反复出现的雇佣兵。",
	"Whether they interact with the Aurum as ally or enemy, at some point the adventurers might well realize that the Concordians aren't just greedy plutocrats, but participants in an international conspiracy. The Aurum's arc in the campaign might climax with the characters learning of the Shadow Cabinet and thwarting one of its grand schemes.": "无论他们是以盟友还是敌人的身份与Aurum互动，在某些时候，冒险者们可能会意识到Concordians不仅仅是贪婪的财阀，而是一个国际阴谋的参与者。奥鲁姆在战役中的弧线可能会随着人物了解到影子内阁并挫败它的一个大计划而达到高潮。",
	"The Aurum Missions table suggests a variety of assignments that adventurers might be asked to undertake on behalf of the Aurum or one of its members, whether or not they're aware of their patron's affiliation.": "奥鲁姆任务表提出了冒险者可能被要求代表奥鲁姆或其成员承担的各种任务，无论他们是否知道其赞助人的关系。",

In general, the chaos of the war has left behind ample areas of shadow in which new cults can form and thrive.": "战争及其后果为 \"龙下 \"邪教创造了肥沃的滋生地。在这个充满不确定性和恐惧的时代，人们很容易倾向于一个能提供目标感或安全承诺的团体。这种心态因哀悼事件后难民的蔓延，以及持续分裂人们的挥之不去的敌意而加剧。在Moror Holds，与{@creature Dyrrn|ERLW|Dyrrn the Corruptor}的冲突已经开始留下痕迹，新的邪教出现在全国各地。总的来说，战争的混乱留下了大量的阴影区域，新的邪教可以在这里形成和发展。",
	"Some Cults of the Dragon Below are bizarre yet harmless, but most of them are dangerous and destructive forces that prey on innocents and vulnerable people. Some cultists are aware of the true nature of the beings they serve, but many are delusional; cultists might perceive their mind flayer master as a wise and gentle priest.": "有些 \"龙底 \"邪教很怪异但无害，但大多数都是危险的破坏性力量，对无辜者和弱势人群下手。有些邪教徒知道他们所服务的生命的真实性质，但许多人都有妄想症；邪教徒可能会把他们的噬心者主人看成是一个明智而温和的牧师。",

As the campaign moves through the tiers of play, stronger aberrations and fiends become viable antagonists, as well as more powerful cult leaders who serve the daelkyr, the Lords of Dust, or other dark entities.": "在战役中，\"龙下 \"的邪教是一个多功能的反派。他们可以在早期以低级邪教分子和小型无组织细胞的形式被引入作为威胁。随着战役的发展，更强大的反常者和恶魔成为可行的对手，还有更强大的邪教领袖，他们为达尔凯尔、尘土领主或其他黑暗实体服务。",
	"The cults can also serve different styles of play. One would be perfect for a slowly unfolding investigation that starts out seemingly mundane, but slowly delves deeper into otherworldly influences and dark magic. Allies become suspect, and perhaps even erstwhile enemies become necessary bedfellows.": "这些邪教也可以为不同的游戏风格服务。其中一个非常适合慢慢展开的调查，开始时似乎很平凡，但慢慢深入到其他世界的影响和黑魔法。盟友变得可疑，甚至昔日的敌人也可能成为必要的伙伴。",

Unified Galifar had the strength and influence to impose its will on the collected dragonmarked houses, but in the wake of the war it remains to be seen if any single nation has the resources to challenge them.": "这些家族的影响力是如此之大，以至于他们在Khorvaire和其他地方的文明土地上的生活的每一个方面都有利益。这些利益常常使他们与地方统治者和国家政府发生冲突。统一的加利法尔有实力和影响力将其意志强加给收集到的龙纹家族，但在战争结束后，是否有任何一个国家有资源来挑战它们，还有待观察。",
	"Although most houses have distinct spheres of interest, their concerns overlap just enough to cause friction. House Orien's control of transportation and shipping is threatened by the growing reach of House Lyrandar's airships.

	"The dragonmarked houses generally thrived during the Last War. Each house's unique talents were easily adapted to the war effort.

	"In some ways, though, the dragonmarked houses did feel the brunt of the conflict. House Cannith, for instance, suffered great setbacks near the end of the war. Many of its foundries and factories were destroyed, and the Treaty of Thronehold forced the house to dismantle the creation forges that produced the warforged. Worst of all for the house, the destruction of Cyre left Cannith without a clear leader, resulting in the house being fragmented into three semi-independent branches.": "不过，在某些方面，有龙纹的家族确实在冲突中首当其冲。例如，坎尼斯家族在战争即将结束时遭受了巨大的挫折。它的许多铸造厂和工厂都被摧毁了，《王座条约》迫使该家族拆除了生产战时锻造品的创造锻造厂。最糟糕的是，赛尔的毁灭使得坎尼斯没有一个明确的领导者，导致该家族被分割成三个半独立的分支。",
	"In another major development, House Thuranni broke away from House Phiarlan during the war, in part because of the conflicts of interest that arose within an espionage organization that was being called on to serve multiple sides in a complex conflict.": "在另一项重大发展中，瑟兰尼家族在战争期间与菲亚尔兰家族决裂，部分原因是在一个被要求在复杂的冲突中为多方服务的间谍组织内部出现了利益冲突。",

	"Arcane workshops have many features in common, from workbenches and tools to diagrams etched into the floors and walls. Although most workshops are controlled by House Cannith, that house is not the only group of artificers who build and operate such locations. Zil gnomes who bind elementals and Mror dwarves who forge powerful weapons and armor must have spaces devoted to that work. The wizards of Arcanix in Aundair who create magic items and test new spells build specialized workshops for those purposes.": "奥术工坊有许多共同的特点，从工作台和工具到刻在地板和墙壁上的图示。虽然大多数工场都由坎尼斯家族控制，但该家族并不是唯一一个建造和经营此类场所的工匠团体。捆绑元素的Zil地精和锻造强大武器和盔甲的Moror矮人必须有专门的空间来进行这项工作。昂代尔（Aundair）的阿卡尼克斯（Arcanix）的巫师们创造魔法物品并测试新的法术，为这些目的建立专门的工场。",

If the adventurers are allied with a dragonmarked house, you can concentrate on the house's positive aspects and its work in moving Khorvaire beyond the feudalism of Galifar. At the same time, the houses also represent a way to explore the consequences of corporate greed and unrestrained expansion. This self-interest can be a defining feature of some or all of the houses, or you can focus on factions within certain houses, with idealistic leaders seeking to direct the house along a more responsible path while barons are driven by greed alone.": "有龙纹的家族为你的活动提供了一个机会，以探索魔法在社会中的作用和工业在战后世界的力量。如果冒险者与一个龙纹屋结盟，你就可以集中讨论该屋的积极方面，以及它在推动霍尔韦尔超越加利法尔的封建主义方面的工作。同时，这些家族也代表了一种探索企业贪婪和无限制扩张的后果的方式。这种自我利益可以是一些或所有家族的决定性特征，或者你可以关注某些家族中的派别，理想主义的领导人试图引导家族走一条更负责任的道路，而男爵则只受贪婪驱使。",
	"As a prominent part of society, the dragonmarked houses strive to maintain the appearance of respectability and propriety. Thus, even when a house is utterly corrupted, any agents who are caught in their evil deeds are quickly and convincingly disavowed, preserving the house's image and reputation.

	"Most dragons live on the mystery-shrouded continent of Argonnessen and avoid contact with those they see as lesser creatures. They are obsessed with the Draconic Prophecy, which is a map of possible futures rather than a clear-cut prediction. Its paths are revealed in the motion of planes and moons, in the actions of the dragonmarked houses, and in dozens of other more subtle manifestations. Most dragons that are active in Khorvaire are part of a cabal known as the Chamber.": "大多数龙生活在神秘的阿贡纳森大陆上，避免与他们认为较低级的生物接触。他们痴迷于龙族的预言，这是一张可能的未来的地图，而不是一个明确的预测。它的路径在飞机和月亮的运动中，在龙纹屋的行动中，以及在其他几十种更微妙的表现中被揭示。大多数活跃在霍尔韦尔的龙都是一个被称为商会的阴谋集团的一部分。",
	"A dragon in Khorvaire that isn't part of the Chamber could be an exile driven from Argonnessen for some crime or a scholar pursuing independent research. Some orphaned dragons grow up in Khorvaire without contact with Argonnessen, and some dragons have been twisted by the daelkyr or corrupted by fiends; any of these could be an antagonist if the adventure you're crafting calls for a cruel dragon.": "在Khorvaire，不属于商会的龙可能是因某种罪行而被赶出Argonnessen的流放者，或者是追求独立研究的学者。有些孤儿龙在霍尔韦尔长大，与阿贡纳森没有联系，有些龙被达尔凯尔扭曲，或者被恶魔腐蚀；如果你要设计的冒险需要一条残酷的龙，那么这些龙都可以成为一个对立面。",
	"The dragons of Eberron aren't restricted in alignment—good red dragons and evil gold dragons are equally common. Most dragons tend toward neutrality. Even those with good alignments often don't consider the impact of their actions on lesser beings; if a Chamber dragon must destroy a human village to foil the plans of a demon, it will do so without hesitation.": "Eberron的龙在结盟方面不受限制--善良的红龙和邪恶的金龙同样常见。大多数龙都倾向于中立。即使是那些有良好倾向的龙，也常常不考虑它们的行为对低等生物的影响；如果一条商会龙必须摧毁一个人类村庄以挫败一个恶魔的计划，它将毫不犹豫地这样做。",
	"Conspiracy theorists insist that a network of dragons is hidden in Khorvaire, and these mighty creatures use powerful magic and humanoid agents to work their will across the continent and beyond. These claims are usually dismissed as madness, but they are in fact correct. The Chamber is a cabal of dragons that have monitored Khorvaire for thousands of years, treating humanoids as pawns in an ancient game.": "阴谋论者坚持认为，在霍尔韦尔隐藏着一个龙的网络，这些强大的生物利用强大的魔法和人形代理人在整个大陆和其他地方实现他们的意志。这些说法通常被斥为疯狂，但事实上它们是正确的。密室是一个由龙组成的阴谋集团，数千年来一直监视着霍尔韦尔，把人形生物当作一个古老游戏中的棋子。",
	"First and foremost, the dragons of the Chamber are observers, gathering information about new aspects of the Prophecy and sharing it with their elders in Argonnessen. They are also charged with stopping any creature that seeks to use the Prophecy for its own ends. This responsibility sets them against the Lords of Dust, who must manipulate the Prophecy in order to release their fiendish overlords. It also leads them to recruit or eliminate any humanoid who learns too much about the Prophecy.": "首先，商会的龙是观察者，收集有关预言的新方面的信息，并与他们在阿贡纳森的长老分享。他们还负责阻止任何试图利用预言来达到自己目的的生物。这项责任使他们与尘土领主对抗，后者必须操纵预言以释放他们邪恶的霸主。这也导致他们招募或消灭任何对预言了解过多的类人。",
	"The Chamber is loosely organized. Each dragon monitors its own small corner of the world and maintains a network of humanoid agents. Although the mission of the Chamber is one of observation, individual dragons often have their own agendas. Some seek to manipulate the Prophecy personally, directing the future along a particular path. Others conduct experiments on dragonmarked humanoids, trying to understand the connection between these creatures and the Prophecy. Still others are obsessed with the Lords of Dust engage in century-spanning games of cat-and-mouse with their fiendish counterparts. In general, the Chamber seeks to maintain the status quo and opposes demons, so agents of the Chamber can often be useful allies or patrons. But ultimately humanoids are just pawns in the dragons' eyes, and they readily sacrifice any of those pawns to ensure the sanctity of the Prophecy and the defeat of the Lords of Dust.": "商会的组织很松散。每条龙都监视着自己世界的一个小角落，并维持着一个人形特工网络。虽然商会的任务是观察，但个别龙往往有自己的议程。有些龙试图亲自操纵预言，将未来引向一个特定的道路。其他人则对带有龙纹的人类进行实验，试图了解这些生物与预言之间的联系。还有一些人痴迷于 \"尘埃领主\"，与他们的恶魔同行进行跨越世纪的猫捉老鼠游戏。一般来说，商会寻求维持现状并反对恶魔，所以商会的代理人往往可以成为有用的盟友或赞助人。但在龙的眼中，人类终究只是棋子，他们很乐意牺牲任何一个棋子来确保预言的神圣性和尘土领主的失败。",
	"The lives of humanoids and the welfare of their nations mean little to the ancient dragons. A member of the Chamber who is friendly now might turn out to be little more than a war criminal, responsible for horrible atrocities while directing critical events of the war to ensure that a skirmish or an untimely assassination didn't derail some crucial stanza of the Prophecy. An even more disturbing prospect is that the Mourning might have been orchestrated by the Chamber, either as part of its struggle against the Lords of Dust or even directly in response to the dictates of the Prophecy.": "人类的生命和他们国家的福利对古龙来说没有什么意义。现在友好的商会成员可能会变成一个战争罪犯，在指挥战争的关键事件时对可怕的暴行负有责任，以确保一场小规模的冲突或一次不合时宜的暗杀不会破坏预言的某些关键章节。一个更令人不安的前景是，哀悼会可能是由商会策划的，作为其与尘土领主斗争的一部分，甚至直接响应预言的指令。",
	"Whatever the truth, the Last War's impact on the Chamber was small in the grand scheme of things. Planar observatories were damaged here and there, humanoid servants died in droves, and the clash of armies derailed short-term plans. But even the effects of a hundred years of war are minor in the context of plans that span continents and millennia.": "无论真相如何，最后的战争对商会的影响在整个计划中是很小的。行星观测站在这里和那里被损坏，人形仆人成群结队地死去，军队的冲突破坏了短期计划。但即使是百年战争的影响，在跨越大陆和千年的计划中也是微不足道的。",
	"A planar observatory is a structure at the heart of the Chamber's efforts to divine the meaning of the draconic Prophecy.

All about the observatory are enormous dragonshards of all three kinds (Eberron, Khyber, and Siberys).": "地图4.2显示了一个平面观测站可能是什么样子。这些巨大的地方是由龙建造的，也是为龙建造的。围绕着中央空间的兽栏追踪着平面的走向，因为它们在向Eberron转移和离开。观察站周围都是三种类型的巨大龙鳞（Eberron、Khyber和Siberys）。",
	"Each observatory must be built in a location that is balanced between Siberys and Khyber; finding such a site might take years of careful study and surveying, and these places are typically remote. Several are located in Argonnessen; those in Khorvaire are usually found in mountain ranges and hidden forest clearings. Many have crystal roofs, or domes that open with the aid of great mechanisms to allow an unobstructed view of the night sky, since the movements of Eberron's moons are thought to correspond to the shifting relationships among the planes.": "每个观察站都必须建在西伯利亚和开伯尔之间的平衡位置；找到这样的地点可能需要多年的仔细研究和勘察，而且这些地方通常都很偏远。有几个位于Argonnessen；Khorvaire的那些通常在山脉和隐蔽的森林空地上找到。很多都有水晶屋顶，或者借助巨大的机械装置打开的穹顶，以使夜空的景色一览无余，因为艾伯伦的月亮的运动被认为是与各平面之间的变化关系相对应。",

	"In a campaign featuring the Chamber, the adventurers might initially carry out simple tasks on behalf of a disguised dragon or secret Chamber agent, not necessarily doing anything shady or villainous, but maneuvering pieces into position so they can play their designated parts. As the campaign unfolds, the dragons of the Chamber might reveal that the adventurers have their own part to play—in particular, perhaps, any member of the party who bears a dragonmark. The Chamber begins interfering in the characters' activities, for good and for ill, and the Lords of Dust might also get involved. Unfortunately for the adventurers, the dragons are not necessarily any more concerned for their well-being than the Lords of Dust are, and the characters might have to consort or cooperate with demons in order to escape the clutches of the dragons.": "在以商会为主题的活动中，冒险者最初可能会代表伪装的龙或商会的秘密特工执行简单的任务，不一定要做什么见不得人的事，也不一定要做什么坏事，但要操纵碎片进入位置，以便发挥他们的指定作用。随着战役的展开，商会的龙可能会发现冒险者们也有自己的角色要扮演--特别是，也许是任何带有龙纹的成员。商会开始干预人物的活动，不管是好事还是坏事，尘土领主也可能参与进来。对冒险者来说，不幸的是，龙并不一定比尘土领主更关心他们的福祉，为了逃脱龙的魔掌，人物可能不得不与恶魔结盟或合作。",
	"Throughout the campaign, the goals of the Chamber might not be readily apparent.

Now they have turned their many eyes toward Khorvaire. The ultimate goal of the Dreaming Dark is to control all the nations of the world. The plane of Dal Quor goes through cycles of light and darkness, and the current age is coming to an end. The nightmare spirits that rule the plane believe that by seizing control of mortal civilization—by forcing all the people of Eberron to dream the dreams they devise—they can maintain this current age of darkness indefinitely. So the fiends of the Dreaming Dark aren't merely hungry for power; they are fighting for survival.": "在睡与醒之间的空间里，恶梦用抓取的爪子等待着。统治Dal Quor的Quori精神花了一千年的时间来夺取对Sarlona大陆的控制。现在，他们已经将他们众多的目光转向了霍瓦伊尔。梦幻黑暗的最终目标是控制世界上的所有国家。达尔-库尔平面经历着光明与黑暗的循环，而当前的时代即将结束。统治这个位面的恶梦之灵相信，通过夺取对凡人文明的控制，通过强迫艾伯伦的所有人做他们设计的梦，他们可以无限期地维持目前这个黑暗的时代。因此，做梦的黑暗世界的恶魔们不仅仅是对权力的渴望；他们是在为生存而战。",
	"The quori can't manifest physically in Eberron, but they have other options. They can possess willing humanoids, creating agents known as the {@creature Inspired|ERLW} (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}). They can also manipulate the dreams of mortals. The Dreaming Dark can trick a priest by sending dreams that appear to be divine visions, or inspire a soldier to rebel against their lord.": "在Eberron，Quori不能以身体形式出现，但他们有其他选择。他们可以附身于有意愿的人类，创造出被称为（%0%）的代理人（见（%1%））。他们还可以操纵凡人的梦。黑暗造梦者可以通过发送看似神圣的梦境来欺骗牧师，或者激励士兵反叛他们的领主。",

Its agents are scattered across the world and have no obvious connection to one another, until they reveal their true nature and purpose.": "做梦的黑暗组织最大的武器是其渗透到其他组织的能力。任何人都可能成为受启发的容器，或者被梦境促使采取愚蠢的行动。它的代理人分散在世界各地，彼此之间没有明显的联系，直到他们暴露出自己的真实性质和目的。",
	"The chaos that reigned during the Last War enabled the agents of the Dreaming Dark to move and act with absolute freedom throughout Khorvaire. Any direct conflict among Eberron's humanoid populations is a boon to this group, which wants to destabilize all of them. Many of the intense battles near the end of the war might have been avoided, if not for Dreaming Dark agents fanning the flames of fear and hate—often by invading the dreams of soldiers and rulers alike.": "最后一次战争期间的混乱，使得梦幻黑暗的代理人能够在整个Khorvaire自由地行动和行事。Eberron的类人种群之间的任何直接冲突都是这个组织的福音，他们想要破坏所有的稳定。如果不是造梦的黑暗代理人煽动恐惧和仇恨的火焰--通常是通过入侵士兵和统治者的梦境，许多接近战争末期的激烈战斗可能已经避免了。",
	"The feelings of mistrust and festering animosity between the nations that linger after the Treaty of Thronehold provide the Dreaming Dark with countless points of possible infection.

	"If you plan to use the Dreaming Dark as a major villain in your campaign, it can be helpful to establish the role of dreams early on. If dreams feel like a regular part of the story, it will be less obvious when the Dreaming Dark starts manipulating the characters' dreams. For example, you might establish a pattern of picking one adventurer and discussing their dreams each time the group takes a long rest. Consider these ideas for the basic seed of a dream:": "如果你打算在你的活动中使用做梦的黑暗作为一个主要的反派，那么在早期建立梦的作用会很有帮助。如果感觉梦境是故事的一个常规部分，那么当梦境黑客开始操纵人物的梦境时，就不会那么明显了。例如，你可以建立一种模式，在每次小组休息的时候挑选一个冒险者并讨论他们的梦。请考虑这些关于梦的基本种子的想法。",

	"All dreams occur in the plane of Dal Quor. When mortals sleep, their minds touch the plane and shape a shard of it. Normally, a dream is shaped by the memories and emotions of the dreamer.

The quori are masters of using the {@spell dream} spell as a weapon to terrorize their foes.": "所有的梦都发生在达尔-库尔平面。当凡人睡觉时，他们的思想会接触到这个平面，并塑造它的一个碎片。通常情况下，梦是由做梦者的记忆和情绪塑造的。但{@spell dream}法术和类似的效果（如夜行者的噩梦萦绕）可以从外部影响一个梦，达到一个特定的、通常是邪恶的目的。科里人是使用(1%)咒语作为武器来恐吓他们的敌人的大师。",

Then, when the destruction of the old kingdoms was complete, a group of bold champions—Inspired vessels of the Dreaming Dark—formed a new nation from the ashes of the old.

Though monstrous workers of these sorts are still rare in many nations, their numbers are growing.": "具有文明倾向的Droaamish怪物可能出现在Khorvaire的任何地方。萨拉什克家族为整个大陆的德罗阿米什怪兽提供中介服务。其中一些怪物可以以传统的攻击性角色出现，如雇佣兵、犯罪大王的保镖，或在沙恩的阴影中的刺客。但塔拉什克也提供不太暴力的服务。食人魔劳动者在大陆的许多城市中把他们的力量用于实际用途。巨妖快递员的需求量很大。尽管这类怪物工人在许多国家仍很罕见，但他们的数量正在增加。",
	"Conversely, a visit to Droaam gives adventurers a chance to explore a land untethered by the laws of the treaty nations, a realm where they are the outsiders and the monsters are at home.

	"Droaam is home to a vast array of creatures. Many of these races maintain isolated enclaves: the medusa city of Cazhaak Draal, the harpy flights of the Byeshk Mountains, the scattered minotaur clans, the mysterious changeling city known as Lost. But other creatures have long been commingled. The ogres, orcs, trolls, hill giants, goblins, and kobolds of Droaam have never had distinct cultures; they have always been blended. Although enclaves made up of a single kind of creature do exist, most communities contain a mix of creatures.": "德罗亚姆是众多生物的家园。其中许多种族保持着孤立的飞地：卡扎克-德拉尔（Cazhaak Draal）的美杜莎城、拜什克山脉的鹞子飞翔、分散的牛头人氏族、被称为 \"迷失 \"的神秘变异人城市。但其他生物也早已混杂其中。卓雅姆的食人魔、兽人、巨魔、山丘巨人、地精和哥布林从来没有独特的文化；他们一直都是混合的。虽然确实存在由单一种类的生物组成的飞地，但大多数社区都包含生物的混合体。",
	"In bygone days, many of these groups of creatures lived in transient communities, ruled by the most powerful among them and constantly in conflict with neighboring forces.

Several flights across the nation—including the Stormsinger, Last Dirge, and Rotwing—have pledged themselves to the Daughters of Sora Kell. Other flights remain in isolation in the mountains.

	"{@b Kethelrax the Cunning}. The kobold lord Kethelrax has laid claim to Shaarat Kol in the south of Droaam and leads host of kobolds and goblins—creatures that have been traditionally enslaved and oppressed by the larger and more powerful inhabitants of the region. Though his epithet, \"the Cunning,\" is used mockingly by other warlords, Kethelrax has the favor of Sora Katra and has proven to be clever in his own right.

	"{@b Rhesh Turakbar}. The minotaur warlord Rhesh Turakbar has united the small clans of his people into a deadly force.

	"{@b Sheshka, the Queen of Stone.} The medusas have long held the ancient citadel of Cazhaak Draal.

	"Droaam emerged as a nation in the final decade of the Last War.

Others think that either of those assumptions gravely underestimates the abilities of the Daughters and their subjects.": "在最后一次战争的最后十年，Droaam作为一个国家出现了。布雷兰国王Boranel与Droaam达成了不安的休战协议，但霍尔韦尔的其他国家拒绝承认女儿国的主权。大多数领导人认为Droaam很快就会崩溃，陷入混乱，或者Breland会集结力量粉碎女儿国。其他人则认为，这两种假设都严重低估了女儿国及其臣民的能力。",
	"In the aftermath of the war, the fighting forces of Droaam have become a significant resource for other nations of Khorvaire.

	"When involving the Daughters of Sora Kell in your campaign, the first question you need to answer is: what are their goals for Droaam?": "当让索拉-凯尔的女儿们参与你的活动时，你需要回答的第一个问题是：他们对德罗阿姆的目标是什么？",
	"One possibility is that the Daughters believe in their nation—that it is important to them to unite the monsters of Droaam and to give their charges a voice in the world. In this case, the Daughters can be ultimately sympathetic figures. They are fighting against the fears and prejudices of the people of the Five Nations, and also the selfish ambitions of many of their own power-hungry warlords. Once the adventurers learn that the Daughters truly want peace and prosperity, they could become envoys of the Daughters in the Five Nations or help to fight their enemies in Droaam. A character of a monstrous race could even become a warlord of Droaam. Even if the adventurers don't work directly with the Daughters, they could have need of their assistance; Sora Teraza might hold the answer to a vital mystery, or the adventurers might need an artifact hidden in the vaults of the Great Crag.": "一种可能性是，女儿们相信她们的国家--对她们来说，团结Droaam的怪物并让她们的指控在世界范围内有发言权是很重要的。在这种情况下，女儿们最终可以成为令人同情的人物。他们正在与五国人民的恐惧和偏见作斗争，也在与许多渴望权力的军阀们的自私野心作斗争。一旦冒险者了解到女儿会真正想要和平与繁荣，他们就可以成为女儿会在五国的特使，或者帮助打击他们在德罗阿姆的敌人。一个畸形种族的角色甚至可以成为德罗阿姆的军阀。即使冒险者不直接与女儿会合作，他们也可能需要女儿会的帮助；索拉-泰拉扎可能掌握着一个重要谜团的答案，或者冒险者可能需要一个隐藏在大峭壁的金库中的神器。",
	"If you'd rather use the Daughters as straightforward villains, they could be driven by a thirst for power or a desire to end humanity's dominance over Khorvaire. Sora Teraza's visions enable them to target enemies with unerring precision and reveal enemy plans before they are carried out. Can the adventurers find a way to deal with Sora Teraza and end this threat before the armies of Droaam and agents of Daask make their move?": "如果你愿意把女儿们当作直接的反派，她们可以被对权力的渴求或结束人类对Khorvaire的统治的愿望所驱动。索拉-泰拉扎的幻觉使他们能够准确无误地瞄准敌人，并在敌人的计划实施之前就将其揭露出来。冒险家们能否找到办法对付索拉-泰拉扎，并在德罗阿姆的军队和达斯克的特工行动之前结束这一威胁？",
	"A middle-of-the-road view is that the Daughters are motivated solely by Sora Teraza's visions. They have no interest in gaining power or in maintaining their kingdom; they are fulfilling their role in a story that is still unfolding, and once it's resolved, they will abandon their thrones and return to their hidden haunts. Can Droaam survive without the Daughters, or will the nation dissolve into chaos?": "一种中庸的观点是，女儿们的动机完全是为了索拉-特拉扎的幻觉。她们对获得权力或维持自己的王国没有兴趣；她们正在履行自己在一个仍在展开的故事中的角色，一旦故事得到解决，她们就会放弃她们的王位，回到她们隐藏的地方。在没有女儿们的情况下，Droaam能否生存下去，还是国家会陷入混乱？",
	"Whatever path you choose should also be reflected in the nature of the criminal organization Daask, described later in this chapter. Those monsters are agents of Sora Katra; how do their actions support her agenda? Are they seizing power on behalf of Droaam, or are they pursuing a more mysterious agenda?": "无论你选择什么道路，也应该反映在本章后面描述的犯罪组织Daask的性质上。那些怪物是索拉-卡特拉的代理人；他们的行动如何支持她的议程？他们是代表德罗阿姆夺取权力，还是在追求一个更神秘的议程？",
	"As described in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|4}, Sora Kell herself could be a group patron for a party of adventurers. In this case, the characters' relationship with the sisters is complicated.

	"The Gatekeepers maintain the oldest druidic tradition on Khorvaire. Over fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow Marches and gathered a following from among the orcs of the region. In her studies of the Prophecy, Vvaraak had foreseen a great threat that could be stopped only by the younger races. So she taught the orcs the secret language of the natural world and showed them how to work with stone and soil, and how to read the future in the movement of the Ring of Siberys. She charged her students to remain ever vigilant against the threat that was to come, and to protect nature from those that would corrupt it.": "守门人保持着霍尔韦尔上最古老的德鲁伊传统。一万五千多年前，绿龙Vvaraak来到暗影沼泽，在该地区的兽人中聚集了一批追随者。在对预言的研究中，维瓦拉克预见到了一个只有年轻种族才能阻止的巨大威胁。因此，她教给兽人自然界的秘密语言，告诉他们如何使用石头和土壤，以及如何从西伯利亚之环的运动中解读未来。她要求她的学生对即将到来的威胁保持警惕，并保护自然不被那些人破坏。",
	"Thousands of years later, the daelkyr (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}) opened gates from the plane of Xoriat and unleashed hordes of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul creatures into the world. The conflict that followed destroyed the goblin empire of Dhakaan, and the daelkyr's invasion left scars across Khorvaire. Ultimately, Vvaraak's students sealed the gates and imprisoned the daelkyr in Khyber. Even after this triumph, the orcs couldn't be sure if they had turned back the threat Vvaraak had foreseen, or if a greater danger lay ahead. So, in addition to guarding the seals that bind the daelkyr and keep Xoriat at bay, the Gatekeepers remained vigilant against the possibility of worse to come.": "几千年后，daelkyr（见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}）从Xoriat位面打开了大门，并将成群结队的心魔、beholders和其他肮脏的生物释放到这个世界上。随后的冲突摧毁了达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国，而达尔凯尔（daelkyr）的入侵在整个霍尔韦尔留下了伤痕。最终，维瓦拉克的学生们封住了大门，并将达尔凯尔人囚禁在凯博尔。即使在这次胜利之后，兽人也不能确定他们是否已经击退了瓦拉亚克所预见的威胁，或者说更大的危险还在后面。因此，除了守卫束缚达尔凯尔的封印和阻止索里亚特之外，守门人还对可能出现的更坏情况保持着警惕。",
	"In the millennia since that struggle ended, the Gatekeepers have shared Vvaraak's wisdom and druidic magic with humans, shifters, and others who came to Khorvaire. New interpretations of Vvaraak's teachings gave birth to new druid sects: the Wardens of the Wood, the Greensingers, and the Ashbound. Today, the Gatekeepers are one of the smaller sects, and many of the sites of their long-ago battles have been abandoned and forgotten. But some Gatekeepers still remain in the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches, continuing their vigil to this day.": "在这场斗争结束后的几千年里，守门人与人类、变身者和其他来到霍尔韦尔的人分享了弗瓦拉克的智慧和德鲁伊魔法。对Vvaraak教义的新解释催生了新的德鲁伊教派：森林守护者、绿化者和灰烬束缚者。今天，守门人是较小的教派之一，他们很久以前的战斗遗址很多都已经被遗弃和遗忘。但是一些守门人仍然留在阴影地带和艾尔迪恩河谷，继续他们的守夜工作到今天。",
	"The Last War had only minimal impact on the Gatekeepers, and vice versa. The druids' primary concern was to prevent military activity from disrupting the seals they guarded. Occasionally the Gatekeepers attacked groups of scouts or military patrols, driving them away to ensure that battles didn't erupt in their vicinity. Sometimes the Gatekeepers failed in those efforts, and Xoriat's corruption spread over some remote regions while the war raged around them.": "最后的战争对守门人的影响很小，反之亦然。德鲁伊们最关心的是防止军事活动扰乱他们所守护的封印。守门人偶尔会攻击侦察兵或军事巡逻队，把他们赶走，以确保战斗不会在他们附近爆发。有时守门人在这些努力中失败了，Xoriat的腐败在一些偏远地区蔓延，而战争在他们周围肆虐。",
	"The seals forged by the Gatekeepers have a variety of purposes and forms. Some are tied to specific daelkyr, keeping those individuals bound in Khyber and stripping them of some of their powers. Others ward against aberrations in general, or suppress the influence of the plane of Xoriat. Some seals are amulets, objects that can be carried and stolen. It's said that one of the seals is a druidic bloodline, and it will last until the last member of the line is slain.": "守门人所铸造的封印有各种不同的目的和形式。有些封印与特定的守护者联系在一起，将这些人束缚在开伯尔，并剥夺他们的一些力量。其他的则是为了防止一般的反常现象，或者抑制Xoriat平面的影响。有些封印是护身符，是可以携带和盗窃的物品。据说其中一个封印是德鲁伊的血脉，它将持续到该血脉的最后一个成员被杀。",
	"The most common form of Gatekeeper seal is a great stone slab set into the ground or a cavern wall.

	"Map 4.4 shows what a Gatekeeper seal might look like. A seal is a protected site, usually attended at all times by Gatekeepers who live at or near the seal. The one depicted in the map lies on the edge of a swamp, but it could be located in any kind of terrain. A circle of standing stones serves to focus the magic of the area toward the seal itself, and the stones also serve as a place of worship for the druids' devotions and ceremonies.": "地图4.4显示了守门人封条可能的样子。封印是一个受保护的场所，通常由住在封印处或附近的守门人随时照看。地图中描述的封印位于沼泽地的边缘，但它可以位于任何地形。一圈站立的石头可以将该地区的魔力集中到封印本身，而这些石头也是德鲁伊们的奉献和仪式的崇拜场所。",

	"At certain points in a campaign, the Gatekeepers might seem to be villains. The druids' mission to protect their seals and to oppose the rise of aberrations is of the utmost importance. Anyone who threatens a seal or assists the machinations of the daelkyr, no matter how unwittingly, risks making relentless enemies in the Gatekeepers. A simple shift in circumstances, such as the death of a noble that causes ownership of a trackless parcel of land to change hands, could bring the characters into sudden conflict with the Gatekeepers.": "在战役的某些时候，守门人可能看起来是反派。德鲁伊们的使命是保护他们的封印，反对畸形人的崛起，这是最重要的。任何威胁到封印的人或协助daelkyr的阴谋的人，无论多么不知情，都有可能在守门人那里树起无情的敌人。一个简单的情况变化，例如一个贵族的死亡导致一块无轨土地的所有权易手，都可能使人物与守门人发生突然冲突。",

	"But there is one obstacle to their rise: the Heirs of Dhakaan have no emperor.

And so the champions of Dhakaan continuously compete with each other to prove their right to rule. The Kech Sharaat (Bladebearers) believe that leadership is best achieved through force of arms. The Kech Volaar (Wordbearers) believe that knowledge is the greater weapon, and they seek to recover artifacts and weapons that were lost when the empire fell. These and several less influential clans are competing for overall leadership, while the spies and assassins of the Khesh'dar (Silent Folk) remain neutral in the struggle, gathering information on the modern world and serving every clan.": "但他们的崛起有一个障碍：达卡安的继承者们没有皇帝。妖精们被分为几个部族，每个部族，或者说{@i kech}，都认为其领袖有权控制所有其他部族。因此，达卡安的冠军们不断相互竞争，以证明他们的统治权。Kech Sharaat（持刀人）认为，领导权最好通过武力来实现。Kech Volaar (Wordbearers)相信知识是更大的武器，他们寻求恢复帝国灭亡时丢失的文物和武器。这些部族和几个影响力较小的部族正在争夺整体领导权，而Khesh'dar（沉默的民族）的间谍和刺客在这场斗争中保持中立，收集关于现代世界的信息并为每个部族服务。",

The truth of the matter is gradually spreading within Darguun, but no one yet realizes the power of the force that lies beneath their nation.": "目前，达卡安的继承者们保持着低调。他们的大部分战斗都是在地下进行的，偶尔也会派遣小队到地面上执行任务。人类通常对地精没有足够的了解，无法分辨达卡尼人和达尔古恩人的区别。这件事的真相正在达尔古恩内部逐渐传播，但还没有人意识到隐藏在他们国家下面的力量的力量。",
	"The Last War caused the Heirs of Dhakaan to finally stir and emerge from their deep vaults. They recognize that humanity has been weakened by its self-inflicted wounds. The rise of Darguun and the proliferation of that nation's Ghaal'dar mercenaries enables the Dhakaani to move around Khorvaire without drawing undue attention. And the Mourning, ultimately, demonstrated that the races of the Five Nations could not be trusted with ruling Khorvaire. It was time for the Dhakaani to return and subjugate the other races to their firm hand once again.": "最后的战争使达卡安的继承人终于蠢蠢欲动，从他们深藏的地窖中走了出来。他们认识到，人类已经被自己造成的创伤所削弱了。达尔古恩的崛起和该国Ghaal'dar雇佣兵的激增，使达卡尼人能够在霍尔韦尔周围活动而不引起不必要的注意。而哀伤，最终证明了五国的种族不能被信任来统治Khorvaire。现在是达卡尼人回来的时候了，他们要再次将其他种族征服在他们坚定的手中。",
	"The Heirs of Dhakaan are devoted to war, with an unmatched focus on sheer martial skill. Their weaponry and artillery are of the highest quality, and they place their trust in strength of arms, not on magic. The Dhakaani don't worship gods, and no clerics or paladins are among them. The Kech Volaar have picked up some of the elven traditions of wizardry, and all clans have bards known as {@i duur'kala} (dirge singers), but in general the Dhakaani don't rely on magic on the battlefield.": "达卡安的继承人专注于战争，对纯粹的武术技巧有着无与伦比的关注。他们的武器和大炮是最高质量的，他们信任武器的力量，而不是魔法。达卡尼人不崇拜神灵，他们中没有神职人员或圣骑士。凯奇-沃拉尔（Kech Volaar）继承了一些精灵族的巫术传统，所有部族都有被称为（%0%）（哀歌者）的吟游诗人，但总的来说，达卡尼人在战场上并不依赖魔法。",

	"Alliances shifted during the war, and almost every nation has grievances with every other one. Some of these postwar feuds rage more fiercely than others. One of these sources of tension could play a role in a character's back story, the plot of an adventure, or the reactions of an NPC. Although the nations are afraid to return to all-out war, any of these feuds could escalate.": "战争期间，联盟发生了变化，几乎每个国家都对其他国家心怀不满。这些战后的恩怨，有些比其他的更激烈。这些紧张的来源之一可以在角色的背景故事、冒险的情节或NPC的反应中发挥作用。尽管各国都害怕回到全面战争中，但任何这些争斗都可能升级。",
	"Forty years ago, the farmers of western Aundair joined with the druids of the Towering Woods in seceding from the kingdom and founding the Eldeen Reaches. Most Aundairians consider this an unforgivable act of treason committed at a time of national weakness. The Reachers say their actions were precipitated by the neglect and corruption of the Aundairian nobles. Now that the war is over, many Aundairians believe Queen Aurala should reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force.": "四十年前，昂代尔西部的农民与塔林的德鲁伊一起脱离了王国，建立了艾尔迪恩河谷。大多数昂代尔人认为这是在国家衰弱时犯下的不可饶恕的叛国行为。猎手们说他们的行动是由于昂代尔贵族的忽视和腐败而促成的。现在战争结束了，许多昂代尔人认为奥拉拉女王应该收回艾尔迪恩河谷，无论是通过外交还是武力。",
	"Monstrous raiders from the western wilderness have plagued Breland for centuries. A decade ago, the Daughters of Sora Kell united the scattered warlords of the region under the flag of Droaam. Furious clashes erupted between Breland and Droaam, centering on the fortress of Orcbone and Brelish settlers in the west. Breland led the opposition to recognizing Droaam as a nation under the Treaty of Thronehold, and some Brelish believe King Boranel should take dramatic action to end this threat.": "几个世纪以来，来自西部荒野的怪物突袭者一直困扰着布雷兰。十年前，索拉-凯尔的女儿们将该地区分散的军阀们联合在德罗阿姆的旗下。布雷兰和德罗阿姆之间爆发了激烈的冲突，主要集中在西部的奥克邦要塞和布雷利什定居者。布雷兰带头反对根据《王权条约》承认德罗阿姆是一个国家，一些布雷利什人认为博拉内尔国王应该采取戏剧性的行动来结束这种威胁。",
	"Cyrans maintain that they alone were in the right during the Last War, which began when the other nations refused to acknowledge the Cyran queen's rightful claim to the throne of Galifar. Proud until the end, Cyre clashed with all the other nations. Now Cyre is destroyed, and Cyran refugees everywhere are dependent on the kindness of their former enemies. But many of those people believe that Cyre deserves no mercy, and that the refugees should be treated as enemy combatants rather than offered charity and compassion.": "赛尔人坚持认为，在最后一次战争中，只有他们才是正确的，这场战争是在其他国家拒绝承认赛尔女王对加利法尔王位的合法要求时开始的。骄傲的是直到最后，赛尔与所有其他国家发生了冲突。现在，赛尔被摧毁了，各地的赛尔人难民要依靠他们以前的敌人的善意。但这些人中有许多人认为赛尔不值得怜悯，难民应该被当作敌方的战斗人员，而不是得到慈善和同情。",
	"The enmity between these two nations runs far deeper and longer than what was wrought by the Last War. Thrane is the bastion of the Church of the Silver Flame, while Karrnath resorted to necromancy in the course of the war. Thranes accuse Karrns of being morally bankrupt; Karrns say that the Thranes are arrogant and naive. This long-standing rivalry led to intense conflict in the early days of the war, and it only grew worse. When Thrane became a theocracy, Karrns seized on this act as proof that the nation had abandoned the traditions of Galifar. When Karrnath integrated undead into its armies, Thrane swore it would never be at peace with those who would use such foul magic. Both nations have accepted the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, and the Karrnathi king has forsworn the creation of new undead soldiers, but the treaty has done nothing to ease the enmity between the two.": "这两个国家之间的敌意远比最后一次战争所造成的更深更久。瑟兰是银焰教会的堡垒，而卡尔纳斯则在战争过程中求助于死灵法术。瑟兰指责卡尔纳斯道德沦丧；卡尔纳斯则说瑟兰人傲慢而天真。这种长期的竞争导致了战争初期的激烈冲突，而且情况只会越来越糟。当瑟兰成为一个神权国家时，卡尔恩斯抓住这一行为作为该国家放弃加利法尔传统的证据。当卡尔纳斯将亡灵纳入其军队时，瑟兰发誓它将永远不会与那些使用这种肮脏魔法的人和平相处。两国都接受了《王座条约》的条款，卡尔纳特国王也放弃了制造新的亡灵士兵，但该条约对缓解两国之间的敌意毫无作用。",
	"The ancient city of Thaliost was once part of Aundair, and it has many proud ties to the history of that nation. It was seized by Thrane during the Last War, and the Treaty of Thronehold ratified its occupation of the place. Thrane placed an Aundairian archbishop, Solgar Dariznu, in charge of the city, and it has become a haven for Aundairian followers of the Silver Flame. But many of its citizens consider themselves to be Aundairians, and many prominent citizens of Aundair are putting great pressure on Queen Aurala to retake the city. The tension has been exacerbated by Archbishop Dariznu, who has taken brutal action to suppress Aundairian opposition to Thrane's occupation of the city.": "塔利奥斯特古城曾经是昂代尔的一部分，它与那个国家的历史有着许多令人骄傲的联系。它在最后一次战争中被瑟兰夺取，《瑟兰条约》批准了其对该地的占领。瑟兰安排了一位昂代尔大主教，索尔加-达里兹努（Solgar Dariznu），负责管理这座城市，它已经成为昂代尔银色火焰追随者的天堂。但它的许多公民认为自己是昂代尔人，而且昂代尔的许多知名公民对奥拉拉女王施加了巨大的压力，要求夺回该城。大主教Dariznu加剧了这种紧张局势，他采取了残酷的行动来镇压昂代尔人对瑟兰占领城市的反对。",
	"The elves of Valenar have broken the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold on several occasions. They regularly antagonize their neighbors, raiding and provoking everyone in reach of their war bands; some independent war bands have even crossed the Talenta Plains to raid across the borders of Karrnath and Q'barra. High King Vadallia insists that these are the actions of individual soldiers, but he refuses to take action against the perpetrators. Some scholars believe Vadallia and the Valenar are trying to provoke a full-scale conflict—by the strictures of their religion they don't want to be conquerors, but they want a powerful enemy to attack their nation. If this hypothesis is true, they might continue to escalate their activity until Karrnath or another powerful nation is forced to react.": "瓦勒纳的精灵们曾多次违反《王权条约》的条款。他们经常与邻国为敌，袭击和挑衅他们的战队所能触及的每一个人；一些独立的战队甚至越过塔伦塔平原，跨越卡尔纳特和Q'barra的边界进行袭击。大国王瓦达利亚坚持认为这些是个别士兵的行为，但他拒绝对肇事者采取行动。一些学者认为，瓦达利亚和瓦勒纳人正试图挑起一场全面的冲突--根据他们宗教的严格规定，他们不想成为征服者，但他们希望有一个强大的敌人来攻击他们的国家。如果这个假设是真的，他们可能会继续升级他们的活动，直到卡尔纳特或其他强大的国家被迫做出反应。",
	"Though the Valenar regularly raid their neighbors, these attacks rarely target civilians. The elves aren't interested in wealth or territory; they are looking for challenging battles. They might attack military outposts, patrols, adventurers, or other brigands—any force that seems like it could put up a good fight.": "虽然瓦勒纳人经常袭击他们的邻居，但这些袭击很少针对平民。精灵们对财富或领土并不感兴趣；他们正在寻找具有挑战性的战斗。他们可能会攻击军事前哨、巡逻队、冒险者或其他强盗--任何看起来可以打一场漂亮仗的力量。",
	"There's no place in Khorvaire that escaped the Last War unscathed. Even villages that were never attacked lost their children to conscription or suffered from shortages.

	"No one knows what caused the Mourning, and the fear of repeating this cataclysm—not the Treaty of Thronehold—is what keeps potential combatants at bay. No one is happy with the outcome of the war, but no one dares to continue fighting, since all believe that renewed full-scale conflict could result in utter destruction. That said, the general belief is that the mystery of the Mourning will eventually be solved. Either someone will learn how to control the power that caused the Mournland, or the precise cause will be determined and people will be able to tell if it still poses a threat.": "没有人知道是什么原因导致了哀悼，对重蹈覆辙的恐惧--而不是《王权条约》--是让潜在的战斗人员望而却步的原因。没有人对战争的结果感到满意，但没有人敢于继续战斗，因为所有人都认为再次发生全面冲突会导致彻底的毁灭。尽管如此，人们普遍认为，\"哀号 \"之谜最终会被解开。要么有人会学会如何控制造成哀牢的力量，要么精确的原因会被确定，人们将能够判断它是否仍然构成威胁。",
	"Many people truly hope that the Last War will live up to its name forever. But others prepare for more war even as they pursue peace. First and foremost, every nation wants to unravel the mystery of the Mourning; a nation that could learn how to use this power would be unstoppable.

	"The characters can stumble into a web of intrigue without seeing the sticky strands. Perhaps a patron hires the adventurers to transport what seems to be an ordinary backpack full of goods, and they don't realize that it has a secret magical compartment until enemy spies come looking for whatever is inside it. Or a dying spy presses an amulet into the hand of one of the adventurers, saying, \"The fate of Breland depends on you getting this to Boranel. Don't trust anyone!\" Assuming the adventurers care about the fate of Breland, they're pressed into an urgent adventure that has implications they might not see or understand.": "角色们可以在没有看到粘性线的情况下误入一个阴谋的网络。也许一个赞助人雇佣冒险者去运送一个看似普通的装满货物的背包，而他们并没有意识到这个背包有一个秘密的魔法隔间，直到敌人的间谍来寻找里面的东西。或者一个垂死的间谍把一个护身符压在一个冒险者的手上，说：\"布雷兰德的命运取决于你把这个东西送到博拉内尔。不要相信任何人！\" 假设冒险家们关心布瑞兰的命运，他们就会被逼着进行一次紧急的冒险，而这个冒险的意义他们可能看不到也不明白。",

	"You might run an introductory session or flashback set during the waning years of the war, bringing the characters' backgrounds to life.

	"A former comrade-in-arms can be a useful hook to draw adventurers into a story—or a compelling villain. Which one of the characters served alongside the villain? Were they equals, or was one of higher rank? Did the villain abandon or betray the adventurer, or was it the adventurer who betrayed the villain? This option can be especially interesting for a warforged villain; while searching for their own identity following the war, they have embraced a dark path. If you use this motif, it's important to develop the story in conjunction with the players whose characters are connected to the villain—either establishing crucial details ahead of time, or developing them together by way of a flashback.": "昔日的战友可以成为吸引冒险者进入故事的一个有用的钩子，或者是一个引人注目的反派。哪一个角色曾与反派并肩作战？他们是平等的，还是有一个人的级别更高？是反派抛弃或背叛了冒险家，还是冒险家背叛了反派？这个选项对于一个被战争锻造的反派来说可能特别有趣；在战争之后寻找自己的身份时，他们拥抱了一条黑暗的道路。如果你使用这个主题，重要的是与那些角色与反派有联系的玩家一起发展故事--要么提前确定关键细节，要么通过倒叙的方式一起发展。",

	"The arcane energies that caused the Day of Mourning and that linger in the remains of Cyre are mysterious and unpredictable, so they can be the cause of any bizarre magical effect you want to bring to bear in your game.": "导致哀悼日和徘徊在赛尔遗体中的奥术能量是神秘和不可预测的，所以它们可以成为你想在游戏中发挥的任何怪异魔法效果的原因。",
	"A magical catastrophe of unknown origin engulfed the nation of Cyre yesterday, bringing a century of war to an explosive climax. Surely when the children of King Jarot began their squabbles over succession a hundred years ago, they could not have foreseen the horror that would engulf the home of Queen Mishann. Our reporters are still sifting through accounts of what has happened, but it is clear at this point that beautiful Cyre, the jewel of Galifar's vast holdings, has disappeared behind a churning cloud of dead-gray mist.": "昨天，一场来历不明的魔法灾难吞噬了赛尔国，将一个世纪的战争推向了爆炸性的高潮。当然，当贾罗特国王的孩子们在一百年前开始为继承权争吵时，他们不可能预见到将吞噬米珊女王的家园的恐怖。我们的记者仍在对所发生的事情进行筛选，但现在很清楚的是，美丽的赛尔城，加利法尔庞大财产中的一颗明珠，已经消失在一片死灰色雾气的汹涌背后。",
	"Maps of Cyre from before the Day of Mourning are of limited use nowadays. The land beyond the gray mist has been twisted and warped, and distances seem to expand and shrink even as one treks across the wastes. As a result, any Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check or any check using navigator's tools made to negotiate the Mournland is made with disadvantage.": "哀悼日之前的赛尔地图，如今用处有限。灰雾之外的土地已经被扭曲了，距离似乎也在扩大和缩小，甚至当人们在荒原上跋涉的时候。因此，任何智慧({@skill Survival})检查或任何使用导航工具进行的检查都是不利于在哀伤之地进行谈判的。",
	"As if the difficulties of navigation weren't bad enough, explorers must bring their own provisions into the Mournland, unless they want to risk the danger of ingesting tainted food and water.": "如果航行的困难还不够糟糕的话，探险家们必须自己带着食物进入哀牢地，除非他们想冒着摄入受污染的食物和水的危险。",
	"The Day of Mourning redefined the geography of Cyre. The cataclysm raised land, swallowed lakes, and moved whole cities. In some areas, the earth has been torn and gouged as if by some colossal beast. In others, it has become iridescent glass or semiliquid sludge. Trees in one place turned to crystalline onyx; the flowers in another place begin eerily buzzing when touched by a breeze. Nothing in the Mournland is as it was; the entire land is a scar left by the catastrophe of the Mourning.": "哀悼日重新定义了赛尔的地理环境。大灾变抬高了土地，吞噬了湖泊，并移动了整个城市。在一些地区，大地被撕裂和挖掘，仿佛被一些巨大的野兽所吞噬。在其他地区，它已经变成了五彩玻璃或半液体的淤泥。一个地方的树木变成了晶莹剔透的玛瑙；另一个地方的花朵在被微风触及时开始发出可怕的嗡嗡声。哀伤之地的一切都不是原来的样子；整个土地是哀伤灾难留下的伤疤。",
	"The borders of the Mournland are defined by a wall of thick, gray mist that rises thousands of feet into the air and forms a canopy that hides the ruined realm even from above.": "哀牢地的边界由一堵厚厚的灰色雾气墙界定，雾气墙升到数千英尺高的空中，形成一个天幕，即使从上面看也能看到废墟的境界。",
	"The area covered by the mist is a shadowy, muffled region devoid of life, sunlight, and sound. The wall of mist ranges in thickness from a few hundred feet to as much as five miles. Travelers who linger in the mist suffer a growing sense of claustrophobia and despair. It's easy to get lost in the impenetrable fog, and some travelers have wandered in circles, unable to find their way either through the mist or back outside it, until their food or water ran out or they blundered into the path of some mutated terror. The DC for Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) checks to avoid getting lost in the mists is 15. (See \"{@book Becoming Lost|DMG|5|Becoming Lost}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.)": "雾气覆盖的区域是一个阴暗的，没有生命，没有阳光，没有声音的闷热区域。雾墙的厚度从几百英尺到五英里不等。徘徊在雾中的旅行者遭受着越来越强烈的幽闭恐惧症和绝望感。在无法穿透的雾中很容易迷失方向，一些旅行者绕着圈子徘徊，既找不到穿过雾的路，也找不到回到雾外的路，直到他们的食物或水耗尽，或者他们误入一些变异的恐怖之路。为了避免在迷雾中迷路，智慧（（%0%））检查的DC是15。",
	"Patches of mist and less oppressive fog dot the interior of the Mournland, but the worst effects of the mist are confined to the border region.": "成片的薄雾和不太压抑的雾气点缀着哀牢地的内部，但薄雾的最坏影响仅限于边境地区。",
	"The northern part of the Mournland is dominated by a great crack in the ground that emits a cold purple light. This supernatural glow emanates from deep within the Glowing Chasm, so far beneath the surface that its source hasn't been identified. The mutated monsters that roam the Mournland seem drawn to this location, and those that spend any significant time near the Glowing Chasm mutate further, becoming more twisted and misshapen than before.": "哀牢地的北部以地面上的一个巨大裂缝为主，它发出寒冷的紫色光芒。这种超自然的光芒来自发光鸿沟的深处，在地表之下如此之远，以至于它的来源还没有被确定。在哀伤之地游荡的变异怪物似乎被吸引到了这个地方，那些在发光鸿沟附近呆了很久的怪物会进一步变异，变得比以前更加扭曲和畸形。",
	"Before the Mourning, a spring in the eastern part of Cyre fed the Rushing River as it traced a short but fertile path south to Kraken Bay. The bed of the Rushing River is now as dry and barren as the rest of the Mournland, and the location of the spring is marked by the Crimson Water, a stagnant lake of blood-colored liquid.": "在哀伤之前，赛尔东部的一个泉眼为拉辛河提供水源，它沿着一条短小但肥沃的道路向南到达克拉肯湾。现在，拉辛河的河床和哀伤之地的其他地方一样干燥贫瘠，泉水的位置被深红之水所标示，这是一个血色液体的死水湖。",
	"The shores of the Crimson Water are littered with the remains of animals and travelers that have strayed into the Mournland and sought to slake their thirst with a drink from the lake. At the lake bottom is the ruined town of Eastwood Springs, which once served as a resort for the leisure classes of Cyre. As yet, no one has been brave or foolish enough to search for lost treasures in the depths of the Crimson Water.": "绯红之水的岸边堆满了动物和旅行者的遗骸，他们曾误入哀伤之地，试图用湖水来解渴。湖底是废墟般的东木泉镇，它曾经是赛尔城休闲阶层的度假胜地。到目前为止，还没有人有足够的勇气或愚蠢到在深红之水的深处寻找丢失的宝藏。",
	"At places smaller in scale than the major features described above, explorers in the Mournland might encounter any kind of terrain feature with bizarre magical properties. The Unusual Locations table offers some ideas.": "在规模小于上述主要特征的地方，哀牢地的探险者可能会遇到任何具有奇异魔法属性的地形特征。不寻常的地点表提供了一些想法。",
	"A pool of glowing water sits in the middle of a ruined and abandoned village. Anyone who looks into the water sees brief reflections of the long-dead villagers going about their lives in harmony and joy.": "在一个废墟和废弃的村庄中间有一池发光的水。任何人只要往水里看，就能看到早已死去的村民们在和谐和欢乐中生活的短暂倒影。",
	"In the middle of the wreckage of a carnival stands a perfectly preserved carousel. If the carousel is ridden, the characters doing so see visions of Cyre as it was before the Last War.": "在一个狂欢节的残骸中，矗立着一个保存完好的旋转木马。如果乘坐旋转木马，乘坐的人就会看到赛尔城在上次战争前的景象。",
	"All the trees and plants in a forest have been turned to objects of glossy white stone with blood-red flecks.": "一片森林中的所有树木和植物都变成了带有血红色斑点的白色光亮石头的物体。",
	"The battlefield before the characters contains no bodies, only the clothing and weapons of thousands of missing soldiers.": "人物面前的战场上没有尸体，只有成千上万失踪士兵的衣服和武器。",
	"The broken bodies of soldiers lie scattered across a battlefield, refusing to decompose.": "士兵们破碎的尸体散落在战场上，拒绝腐烂。",
	"The characters find a fallen warforged colossus (described later in this section).": "角色们找到了一个倒下的战神巨像（在本节后面描述）。",
	"Many creatures were slain outright by the Mourning. Others were mutated as the land was transformed. Sometimes the result was an entirely new life form; any previously unseen monster could appear as a spawn of the Mourning. Other creatures retained a semblance of their original physiology while taking on some sort of alteration. The Monstrous Mutations table has options for altering existing monsters to reflect this phenomenon.": "许多生物被哀伤直接杀死了。其他的则随着土地的改变而发生变异。有时，结果是一种全新的生命形式；任何以前未见过的怪物都可能作为哀伤的产儿出现。其他生物则保留了它们原来的生理结构，同时进行了某种改变。畸形变异表有改变现有怪物的选项，以反映这种现象。",
	"Most warforged were unaffected by the Mourning, and the race as a whole seems immune to many of the lingering effects that plague the Mournland. As such, the warforged who follow {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW} constitute the closest thing to a humanoid society that can be found in the Mournland. Similarly, golems and other constructs were largely unaffected by the Mourning.": "大多数战神没有受到哀伤的影响，而且整个种族似乎对困扰哀伤之地的许多挥之不去的影响免疫。因此，跟随{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}的战锻人构成了在哀伤之地可以找到的最接近人形社会的东西。同样地，巨兽和其他构造物也基本上没有受到哀伤的影响。",
	"The Mourning had no effect on existing undead, and a large number of new undead came into being when the cataclysm occurred. Various spirits (such as ghosts and specters) linger near the places where they died, and the corpses that litter an abandoned battlefield might rise up to continue fighting whenever a living creature comes near. Some of these entities are similar to undead that might be encountered outside the Mournland, but others have alterations that are tied to the unusual manner of their deaths. You can use the {@book Monstrous Mutations table|ERLW|10|Monstrous Mutations} to generate some details. Many of the mutations on this table might increase a creature's challenge rating by 1 or 2. Use the guidelines in {@book chapter 9|DMG|9} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to determine whether its challenge rating should increase and by how much, or you can simply increase it by 1 or 2 as you see fit.": "哀悼对现有的亡灵没有影响，大灾变发生后，大量新的亡灵出现了。各种精神（如鬼魂和幽灵）在他们死亡的地方附近徘徊，而在废弃的战场上，只要有生物靠近，那些尸体就可能会站起来继续战斗。这些实体中有些类似于在哀伤之地之外可能遇到的亡灵，但有些实体的改变与他们死亡的不寻常方式有关。你可以用（%0%）来生成一些细节。这张表上的许多变异都可能使一个生物的挑战等级增加1或2。使用{@book chapter 9|DMG|9}中的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}准则来决定它的挑战等级是否应该增加以及增加多少，或者你可以根据你的想法简单地增加1或2。",
	"Many Mournland creatures have mutations that are purely cosmetic and don't change their stat blocks. For example, one might have eyes that look like gemstones or might display glowing patterns on its skin or fur.": "许多哀牢地的生物都有纯粹的外观变异，并不改变它们的状态块。例如，一个人可能有一双像宝石一样的眼睛，或者在其皮肤或皮毛上显示发光的图案。",
	"The creature has grown to an unusual size. You can either set its new size and alter its statistics using the guidelines in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, or apply the enlarge effect of the {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell to it.": "这个生物已经长到一个不寻常的大小。你可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的准则来设定它的新尺寸并改变它的统计数据，或者对它应用{@spell enlarge/reduce}法术的放大效果。",
	"The creature has developed magical camouflage. It gains proficiency in the {@skill Stealth} skill, and it has the Chameleon Skin trait: it has advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks made to hide.": "该生物已经发展出神奇的伪装术。它获得了熟练的{@skill Stealth}技能，并具有变色龙皮肤的特性：它在灵巧({@skill Stealth})检查中对隐藏有优势。",
	"The creature's body has been infused with one kind of energy: acid, cold, fire, or lightning (your choice, or determine randomly). Its melee attacks deal an extra {@dice 1d6} damage of that type, and it has the Elemental Body trait: a creature that touches it or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) damage of that type. You can adjust these damage numbers to suit the creature's challenge rating.": "该生物的身体被注入了一种能量：酸、冷、火或雷电（你选择，或随机决定）。它的近战攻击会造成该类型的额外（%0%）伤害，并且它具有元素之体的特性：在它周围5英尺范围内，接触它或用近战攻击击中它的生物会受到该类型的5（{@dice 1d10}）伤害。你可以调整这些伤害数字以适应生物的挑战等级。",
	"The creature has the Magic Resistance trait: it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.": "该生物具有魔力抵抗的特性：它在对抗法术和其他魔法效果时有优势。",
	"The creature has a supernatural ability to heal its wounds. It has the Regeneration trait: it regains hit points at the start of its turn equal to the maximum value of one of its Hit Dice. If it takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the creature's next turn. (A particular creature might be susceptible to different damage types.) The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.": "该生物有一种超自然的能力来治疗其伤口。它具有再生特性：在其回合开始时恢复的命中率等于其一个命中率的最大值。如果它受到酸或火的伤害，这个特性在该生物的下一回合开始时不会发挥作用。(一个特定的生物可能对不同的伤害类型敏感。）该生物只有在其回合开始时命中率为0并且没有再生时才会死亡。",
	"The creature has two heads. If it has a bite attack, it can use Multiattack as an action to make two bite attacks. (If it already has Multiattack, it adds a bite attack to its attack routine.) It also gains the Two Heads trait: it has advantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks and on saving throws against being {@condition blinded}, {@condition charmed}, {@condition deafened}, {@condition frightened}, {@condition stunned}, and knocked {@condition unconscious}.": "该生物有两个头。如果它有咬人攻击，它可以使用多重攻击作为一个动作来进行两次咬人攻击。(如果它已经有多重攻击，它会在它的攻击程序中增加一次咬人攻击。)它也获得了双头的特性：它在智慧({@skill Perception})检查和对被{@condition blinded}、{@condition charmed}、{@condition deafened}、{@condition frightened}、{@condition stunned}和被击倒{@condition unconscious}的拯救动作上具有优势。",
	"The catastrophe of the Mourning altered more than the landscape and living creatures. The devastation caused localized alterations in the way magic functions. In some places, magic barely functions, or certain magical functions are warped. In other places, spells persist past the instant of their casting and start behaving as if they were independent, living creatures.": "哀悼的灾难改变的不仅仅是景观和生物。破坏造成了魔法运作方式的局部改变。在一些地方，魔法几乎没有功能，或者某些魔法功能被扭曲了。在其他地方，法术在施放的瞬间仍然存在，并开始表现得好像它们是独立的、活的生物。",
	"A common misunderstanding about the Mournland is that healing spells refuse to work. The fact is that healing spells are impeded within the dead-gray mist, and occasionally in other areas, making it harder for someone to cast them effectively. Because so few expeditions make it far past the mist, the inability to heal is widely assumed to be a property of the Mournland as a whole.": "对哀伤之地的一个常见误解是，治疗法术拒绝发挥作用。事实是，治疗法术在死灰色的迷雾中受到阻碍，偶尔也会在其他地区受到阻碍，这使得某人更难有效地施展法术。因为很少有探险队能远远越过迷雾，所以人们普遍认为无法治疗是整个哀牢地的特性。",
	"The Environmental Effects table provides suggestions for weird magic that might pervade a small or large area of the Mournland. Effects might shift from day to day or even hour to hour.": "环境效应表提供了关于可能弥漫在哀牢地一小片或一大片区域的怪异魔法的建议。这些影响可能会从一天到一天，甚至从一小时到一小时发生变化。",
	"Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points.": "治疗性法术在此受到阻碍。任何恢复命中率的法术都是在比所使用的法术槽低一个等级的情况下施放的。使用1级法术槽施展的法术不会恢复命中率。",
	"A character who casts a spell must make a Constitution saving throw against the character's own spell save DC. On a failed save, the character takes psychic damage equal to the spell's level and gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "施放法术的角色必须对角色自己的法术保全DC进行宪法保全投掷。在救赎失败的情况下，该角色会受到相当于该法术等级的精神伤害，并获得一个等级的（%0%）。",
	"Any Medium humanoid that dies in the area reanimates as a {@creature zombie} at the start of its next turn. The zombie is under the DM's control.": "任何在该区域内死亡的中型人形生物在其下一回合开始时都会以（%0%）的方式重新复活。该僵尸在DM的控制之下。",
	"The area is affected by a {@spell silence} spell.": "该区域受到（%0%）法术的影响。",
	"Each creature that enters the area is affected by an {@spell enlarge/reduce} spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area.": "每个进入该区域的生物都会受到一个{@spell enlarge/reduce}的法术影响，每个效果的几率相同。效果持续到该生物离开该区域。",
	"The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight.": "地心引力被减弱。生物可以在任何方向上跳出正常距离的两倍，而且所有东西的重量都是其实际重量的一半。",

	"Of all the bizarre and horrific spectacles of the Mournland, perhaps the greatest tragedy is represented by the ruins of the once-glittering cities of Cyre. Some have been reduced to rubble, while others are eerily preserved, devoid of life but otherwise unharmed. In some of them, treasures left behind by the former inhabitants await discovery, and many people across Khorvaire are eager to get their hands on such spoils for a wide variety of reasons.": "在哀伤之地的所有怪异和恐怖的景象中，也许最大的悲剧是由曾经闪闪发光的赛尔城的废墟所代表。一些城市已经变成了瓦砾，而其他城市则保存得很好，没有生命，但其他方面没有受到伤害。在其中一些城市中，以前的居民留下的宝藏正等待着人们去发现，而整个霍尔韦尔的许多人出于各种原因都急于得到这些战利品。",
	"Cyre was the site of incessant battles during the Last War, from the first extended campaign—the siege of Eston in 895 YK—to the running battle on the Saerun Road that was cut short when the Mourning occurred. Battlefields across the Mournland, both ancient and recent, stand like open graves as evidence of the horrors of the war. In some places, armies that were fighting on the Day of Mourning became stone statues anchored in position. Others were crystallized or reduced to ash.": "赛尔是最后一次战争期间不断发生战斗的地方，从第一次长期战役--895 YK时对埃斯顿的围攻，到哀伤发生时被切断的赛伦路的奔袭战。遍布哀伤之地的战场，无论是古代的还是最近的，都像敞开的坟墓，作为战争恐怖的证据。在一些地方，在哀悼日作战的军队变成了锚定在位置上的石像。其他人则被结晶化或化为灰烬。",
	"On the Field of Ruins—around the Saerun Road in the southwest part of the Mournland, where allied forces of Thrane and Breland battled an outnumbered Cyran army on the Day of Mourning—the fallen soldiers are preserved just as they fell, with no sign of rot or decay. Thousands upon thousands of corpses lie scattered across the field, facedown in the dirt or staring lifelessly at the gray sky. Even seasoned bands of treasure hunters are loath to enter the Field of Ruins.": "在废墟上--位于哀伤之地西南部的赛伦路周围，在哀伤之日，瑟兰和布雷兰的联军在这里与人数众多的赛伦军队作战--阵亡的士兵就像他们倒下时一样被保存下来，没有腐烂或衰落的迹象。成千上万的尸体散落在战场上，或面朝黄土背朝天，或毫无生气地盯着灰色的天空。即使是经验丰富的寻宝者也不愿意进入废墟之地。",
	"House Cannith was born in Eston, and the house's labors transformed the city into a place of wonders. Clockwork birds perched and sang in silvery trees covered in steel bark. Skycoaches carried smiths and magewrights from forge to forge, and an iridescent dome protected the city from storms and harsh winds. On the proving grounds of the Cannith creation forges, cadres of newborn warforged learned the combat skills that would prepare them for active duty.": "坎尼斯家族诞生于埃斯顿，该家族的劳作将这座城市变成了一个充满奇迹的地方。发条鸟在覆盖着钢皮的银色树木上栖息和歌唱。天车将铁匠和魔法师从一个锻造厂运到另一个锻造厂，一个彩虹色的圆顶保护城市免受风暴和恶劣的风的影响。在坎尼斯创建的锻造厂的试验场上，新生的战争锻造者们学习战斗技能，为他们的现役做准备。",
	"Eston began as a successful mining settlement, extracting iron and rare ores from the nearby hills. Drawing on these resources, the Cannith artificers in Eston spent decades researching all sorts of artificial creatures, which eventually gave rise to the warforged.": "埃斯顿最初是一个成功的采矿定居点，从附近的山丘中提取铁和稀有矿石。利用这些资源，埃斯顿的坎尼斯工匠们花了数十年时间研究各种人造生物，最终产生了战争锻造者。",
	"Because of these wonders, Eston is an irresistible attraction for treasure hunters hoping to access the vaults of House Cannith. Reports suggest, however, that it has become a strange and deadly place. It's said that the city is overrun by living spells. In addition to the remnants of damaging spells (see \"{@book Living Spells|ERLW|13|Living Spells}\" in {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}), there are stranger phenomena: living {@i continual flames} that crawl along the streets, cling to lampposts, and flee from strangers, and living {@i scrying} spells that shift and shimmer, displaying distant scenes on their amorphous skin.": "由于这些奇迹的存在，埃斯顿对希望进入坎尼斯家族金库的寻宝者来说是一个不可抗拒的吸引力。然而，报告显示，这里已经成为一个奇怪而致命的地方。据说这座城市被活体法术所占据。除了破坏性法术的残余（见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}中的\"{@book Living Spells|ERLW|13|Living Spells}\"），还有一些更奇怪的现象：活着的{@i continual flames}沿着街道爬行，依附在灯柱上，并从陌生人面前逃走，还有活着的{@i scrying}法术，它们在无定形的皮肤上变换和闪烁，显示出遥远的场景。",
	"Eston was renowned for its clockwork menagerie and its steel gardens, a showcase that chronicles House Cannith's centuries of work developing constructs and homunculi. These creatures have been twisted by the Mourning and have become deadly monsters. Stories tell of an enormous gorgon golem, of razor-winged swarms of silver songbirds, and many other equally strange things.": "埃斯顿以其钟表动物园和钢铁花园而闻名，这个陈列室记录了坎尼斯家族几个世纪以来开发构装体和同形体的工作。这些生物被哀伤所扭曲，变成了致命的怪兽。故事讲述了一个巨大的戈尔贡巨兽，银色鸣禽的剑翼群，以及其他许多同样奇怪的东西。",
	"Many people believe that the city of Making was at the epicenter of whatever caused the Mourning. The cataclysm reshaped the terrain around the city, creating the great highland formation known as the Glass Plateau.": "许多人认为，Making城是造成哀伤的震中。大灾变重塑了城市周围的地形，形成了被称为玻璃高原的巨大高地。",
	"The Glass Plateau is mostly smooth and flat, though jagged spikes and spires jut up from the ground in seemingly random places. The central portion of the highland plain is obsidian, and bursts of fiery light can sometimes be seen in its dark depths. Toward the edges of the plateau, the glass becomes lighter in color and more transparent, appearing almost pale white along the jagged cliffs at the edge. Nothing grows on the plain of glass, and few creatures haunt its jagged peaks and flat expanse.": "玻璃高原大部分是光滑平坦的，尽管在看似随意的地方有锯齿状的尖峰和尖顶从地面伸出来。高原的中央部分是黑曜石，在其黑暗的深处有时可以看到迸发的火光。在高原的边缘，玻璃的颜色变得更浅，更透明，沿着边缘的锯齿状悬崖看起来几乎是苍白色的。玻璃平原上没有任何东西生长，也没有什么生物在其锯齿状的山峰和平坦的大地上出没。",
	"The ruins of Making still peek through the obsidian flats of the Glass Plateau. Those who believe that the Mourning started here also expect that Making is where the mystery of its origin will be unraveled. A secret Cannith facility is supposed to lie in the city's subterranean depths.": "Making的废墟仍然透过玻璃高原的黑曜石平地窥视着。那些相信 \"哀伤 \"从这里开始的人也期望 \"制造 \"是揭开其起源之谜的地方。一个秘密的坎尼斯设施应该就在这个城市的地下深处。",
	"This city was once the capital of Cyre. Now it lies empty, seemingly waiting along the Cyre River for its people to return. Parts of Metrol have been shattered, their buildings crushed and tumbled by whatever force destroyed the nation. Other portions of the city escaped with superficial damage; aside from the absence of people and the shroud of mist that hangs over the area, it looks much as it did before Cyre fell. The days in Metrol are quiet, but the nights bring a cacophony of chaos and violence to the streets—at night, misshapen monsters emerge from their lairs to prowl and wail as they hunt each other for food.": "这座城市曾经是赛尔的首都。现在它空空如也，似乎在赛尔河畔等待着它的人民回来。梅特罗尔的部分地区已经支离破碎，它们的建筑物被摧毁国家的任何力量压碎和翻滚。城市的其他部分只受到了表面上的损害；除了没有人和笼罩在该地区的雾气之外，它看起来和赛尔城陷落之前差不多。梅特罗尔的白天是安静的，但夜晚给街道带来了混乱和暴力的喧嚣--晚上，畸形的怪物从它们的巢穴里出来，一边游荡一边哀嚎，互相捕食。",
	"Few people have reason to spend time anywhere near the Mournland. Among the exceptions are those who seek to plunder the riches of lost Cyre, such as Ikar's Salvage (described below).

	"Mere weeks before the Day of Mourning, House Cannith unleashed its mightiest creations: the warforged colossi. Hundreds of feet tall, these gargantuan warriors thundered across Cyre, crushing everything in their path and leaving ruin in their wake. Meant to end the war decisively, these arcane war machines could pulverize soldiers beneath their feet and incinerate entire legions with beams of red light radiating from their mouths. But as the colossi were beginning to turn to the lands outside Cyre, the Mourning came, and the colossi perished. Now their remains lie, like mountains, in the Mournland, filled with secrets and waiting to be explored.": "在哀悼日的前几周，坎尼斯家族释放了它最强大的造物：战争锻造的巨兽。这些巨大的战士有几百英尺高，他们以迅雷不及掩耳之势横扫赛尔城，碾碎了沿途的一切，留下一片废墟。为了果断地结束战争，这些神秘的战争机器可以将士兵踩在脚下，用嘴里放射出的红光束焚烧整个军团。但当巨兽们开始转向赛尔城外的土地时，丧礼来临，巨兽们也随之灭亡。现在，他们的遗体像山一样躺在哀伤之地，充满了秘密，等待着我们去探索。",
	"House Cannith spent much of the war working on various kinds of constructs that could serve as soldiers, siege engines, or other weapons of war. Their earliest efforts, which lumbered onto Cyran battlefields in the late 930s YK, were barely more than golems with limited sentience, difficult to command in the field. The warforged titans were developed over the next twenty years, and the modern warforged—often perceived as the pinnacle of Cannith engineering—first saw battle in 965.": "坎尼斯家族在战争的大部分时间里都在研究各种可以作为士兵、攻城器械或其他战争武器的建筑。他们最早的努力是在930年代末在赛兰的战场上蹒跚而行，不过是一些智力有限的傀儡，在战场上难以指挥。在接下来的20年里，战争锻造的泰坦被开发出来，现代战争锻造--通常被认为是坎尼斯工程的巅峰--在965年首次参加战斗。",
	"Successful as the warforged were, though, House Cannith never lost interest in building a better titan. Cyre didn't lose its desire for deadly weapons that could give it an edge over its enemies, and tremendous amounts of gold flowed from Cyre's coffers into the vaults of House Cannith as research and development continued, working toward a new kind of warforged that would bring an end to the war once and for all, and establish Cyre's martial supremacy for centuries to come.": "尽管战争锻造者取得了成功，但坎尼斯家族从未失去对制造更好的泰坦的兴趣。赛尔并没有失去对致命武器的渴望，这些武器可以让它在敌人面前获得优势，随着研究和开发的继续，大量的黄金从赛尔的国库流入坎尼斯家族的金库，致力于开发一种新的战争锻造者，以彻底结束战争，并在未来的几个世纪里确立赛尔的武术优势。",
	"With Cyre's immense wealth fueling its effort, House Cannith called upon the ingenuity of its best artificers and magewrights. Construction began on enormous new creation foundries, hundreds of feet tall, carved into the sides of mountains or secretly nestled within remote canyons.": "在赛尔的巨大财富的推动下，坎尼斯家族召集了其最好的工匠和魔法师的聪明才智。巨大的新造物铸造厂开始建造，高达数百英尺，被雕刻在山的两侧，或秘密地依偎在偏远的峡谷中。",
	"The project succeeded beyond Cyre's wildest dreams. When the original warforged colossus took its first thunderous footsteps, it was met with a reaction of equal parts awe and horror—and it was almost immediately sent north toward Metrol, where armies from Karrnath were menacing the Cyran capital.": "这个项目的成功超出了赛尔最疯狂的梦想。当最初的战争锻造巨像迈出它的第一个雷鸣般的脚步时，它受到了敬畏和惊恐并存的反应--它几乎立即被送往北面的梅托尔，那里来自卡尔纳特的军队正威胁着赛伦的首都。",
	"A warforged colossus is part warforged and part vehicle. It stands between 200 and 300 feet tall. For optimal performance, a colossus required an active crew including a captain with the Mark of Making, a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm, and a helmsman with the Mark of Passage. When absolutely necessary, though, the colossus could direct itself but at diminished power. A colossus also carried a sizable contingent of elite troops, who could ride in safety within the colossus while it crushed through enemy lines or smashed through a wall, then pour out through hatches once the colossus was in position.": "战神巨像是部分战神和部分车辆。它的高度在200到300英尺之间。为了获得最佳性能，巨像需要一个活跃的船员，包括一个拥有制造印记的船长，一个拥有风暴印记的武器官，以及一个拥有穿越印记的舵手。不过，在绝对必要的时候，巨像可以自己指挥，但力量会有所减弱。巨像还可以携带相当数量的精锐部队，他们可以在巨像内安全地骑行，而巨像则碾压敌人的防线或击穿墙壁，然后在巨像就位后从舱门中涌出。",
	"Controlling a construct of such size proved to be a great challenge for the Cannith artificers. The solution entailed creating a large number of {@item docent|ERLW} nodes and joining them together in a single network distributed throughout the body of the colossus. Docent nodes are modeled after the ancient {@i docents} found in Xen'drik (described in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), and though they lack the full sentience or functionality of a true {@item docent|ERLW}, collectively they can guide and control a colossus. The network converged at one place, where the captain could stand and control the colossus's every movement through the use of a mithral helmet with hundreds of semi-organic tendril-wires attached. By way of the central master {@item docent|ERLW}—a true {@item docent|ERLW} recovered from Xen'drik—the whole network fed information back to the operator. Several smaller \"hubs\" of the network gave other operators access to the relevant parts of that information and enabled them to control parts of the colossus as well. The techniques and tools used to create {@item docent|ERLW} nodes were lost in the Mourning. The various branches of House Cannith are sending adventurers into the Mournland in hopes of salvaging some or all of the network inside a fallen colossus.": "事实证明，控制一个如此巨大的建筑对坎尼斯的工匠来说是一个巨大的挑战。这个解决方案需要创建大量的{@item docent|ERLW}节点，并将它们连接成一个单一的网络，分布在巨像的整个身体里。讲师节点是仿照在Xen'drik发现的古老的{@i docents}（在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中描述），虽然它们缺乏真正的{@item docent|ERLW}的完整智力或功能，但它们可以共同引导和控制巨像。这个网络汇聚在一个地方，队长可以站在那里，通过使用一个连接着数百根半有机卷须线的密特拉尔头盔来控制巨像的每一个动作。通过中央主控器（4%）--一个从Xen'drik恢复的真正的（5%）--整个网络将信息反馈给操作员。网络中几个较小的 \"枢纽 \"使其他操作员能够获得这些信息的相关部分，并使他们也能控制巨像的一部分。用于创建{@item docent|ERLW}节点的技术和工具在哀悼中丢失了。坎尼斯家族的各个分支都在向哀伤之地派出冒险者，希望能在一个倒下的巨像内抢救出部分或全部网络。",
	"The power source of a colossus is a Khyber dragonshard of unusually large size, cut into a specific pattern that allows the dragonshard to contain raw magical energy without exploding. A single power core is about the size of a wine barrel, hooked up to an elaborate harness that distributes power throughout the colossus.": "巨像的动力源是一个异常大的凯博龙石，被切割成特定的图案，使龙石能够容纳原始的魔法能量而不爆炸。一个动力核心大约有一个酒桶那么大，与一个精心设计的线束相连，将能量分配给整个巨像。",
	"Warforged colossi were physically powerful, but their principal weaponry involved the use of bound elementals. Some expelled blasts of elemental fire from their hands or mouths; others wielded adamantine swords they could wreathe in flame. Some colossi also used bound elementals for defense: manifesting shields of elemental rock, blasting out elemental air to deflect ranged attacks, and so on. The captain of the colossus could control all this weaponry through the {@item docent|ERLW} network, but for optimal performance the captain relied on a weapons officer with the Mark of Storm to employ this elemental weaponry.": "战神巨兽的身体很强大，但他们的主要武器涉及到使用绑定的元素。有些人从手中或口中喷出元素之火；另一些人则挥舞着金刚剑，可以在火焰中环绕。有些巨像还使用绑定的元素进行防御：显现出元素岩石的盾牌，喷射出元素空气来抵御远程攻击，等等。巨像的舰长可以通过{@item docent|ERLW}网络控制所有这些武器装备，但为了获得最佳性能，舰长要依靠一个拥有风暴标志的武器官来使用这些元素武器。",
	"When adventurers discover a colossus, it might be in any state. Some have fallen or collapsed and become overgrown with vegetation to the point where one could be mistaken for a small hill. One was engulfed when the rock under its feet turned to liquid and swallowed it up, encasing it in a stone prison when the rock hardened. Some are buried—except for the head, perhaps, or a hand, which serves as a clear indicator that something lies underneath.": "当冒险者发现一座巨石时，它可能处于任何状态。有的已经倒下或坍塌，变得杂草丛生，以至于有的可以被误认为是一座小山。有一个被吞没了，因为它脚下的岩石变成了液体，把它吞没了，当岩石变硬时把它包裹在一个石牢里。有些被埋葬了--除了头部，也许，或者一只手，作为一个明确的指标，表明下面有东西。",

	"Map 4.8 shows a fallen colossus. The mostly hollow interior of a colossus is large enough for the crew and soldiers to travel in safety. The area features tunnels, ladders, hallways and crawlways, control rooms, storage rooms, arbalest turrets, and observation decks. With comfort a low priority, only minimal crew quarters are provided, and the inside has no kitchen or dining areas. Normal operating procedure called for the crew to exit the colossus at night and camp outside it.": "地图4.8显示了一个倒下的巨像。巨像的内部大多是空心的，足以让船员和士兵安全地旅行。该区域有隧道、梯子、走廊和爬行道、控制室、储藏室、arbalest炮塔和观察台。由于舒适度不高，只提供了最低限度的船员宿舍，里面没有厨房和用餐区。正常的操作程序要求工作人员在晚上离开巨像，在巨像外面扎营。",
	"A colossus usually has multiple hatches to allow entrance and egress: on the legs, on the back, in the chest, in the mouth or on the back of the head, and so on. But entering the remains of a warforged colossus is not a task to be taken lightly, since the Mournland can have bizarre effects on the colossus's {@item docent|ERLW} network, power core, and weaponry, as well as its mind.": "一个巨像通常有多个舱口可以进出：在腿上，在背上，在胸口，在嘴里或在脑后，等等。但是，进入战神巨像的遗体并不是一件轻而易举的事，因为哀伤之地会对巨像的{@item docent|ERLW}网络、动力核心和武器装备以及它的思想产生奇怪的影响。",
	"Even though a colossus has fallen, its {@item docent|ERLW} nodes and elemental defenses might still be active. The dragonshards that once bound the elemental that powered the colossus's main weapon might have been broken, allowing the elemental to escape from its bondage and roam the body of the colossus, which has become its lair. Or perhaps it has come under the control of the master {@item docent|ERLW} and now does its twisted will, defending the interior of the colossus and giving voice and form to the {@item docent|ERLW}'s otherwise disembodied intelligence.": "即使巨像已经倒下，它的{@item docent|ERLW}节点和元素防御可能仍在活动。曾经束缚着为巨像的主要武器提供动力的元素的龙鳞可能已经被打破，允许元素摆脱束缚，在巨像的身体里游荡，而这已经成为它的巢穴。也可能它已经被主人（1%）控制，现在按照它扭曲的意志行事，保卫巨像的内部，并为（2%）原本没有实体的智慧提供声音和形式。",
	"House Cannith's artisans lined the interior of each colossus with magic wards and traps in case enemy soldiers breached its defenses. As long as the primary operator remained connected to the master {@item docent|ERLW} and in control, the traps were inactive, but if the operator gave an alert (or simply left their station, or died), the master {@item docent|ERLW} would send a signal through the network to seal the doors, activate the arcane wards, and arm the traps in any area that was under attack.": "坎尼斯家族的工匠们在每个巨像的内部都设置了魔法屏障和陷阱，以防敌方士兵攻破其防御。只要主要操作者与主人（%0%）保持联系并处于控制状态，这些陷阱就不会被激活，但如果操作者发出警报（或者干脆离开他们的岗位，或者死亡），主人（%1%）就会通过网络发送信号，封住大门，激活魔法防护，并在任何受到攻击的区域设置陷阱。",
	"Most colossi are tombs, filled with the bodies of the crews that perished in the cataclysm. But the Mourning affected everything in bizarre ways, so a venture inside a colossus is often terrifying. A horrific monster might have made its lair in a colossus's interior in the years since the Mourning. The master {@item docent|ERLW} in another one might speak through the brass horns that the crews used to communicate, growing increasingly incoherent and/or sinister. The crew of a colossus might be undead—zombies lumbering through the colossus's interior, or spirits doomed to haunt it until they can find blessed release.": "大多数巨像都是坟墓，里面堆满了在大灾变中丧生的船员的尸体。但哀悼以奇怪的方式影响了一切，所以进入巨像内部的冒险往往是可怕的。在哀悼之后的几年里，一个可怕的怪物可能已经在巨像的内部筑起了巢穴。另一个巨像中的主人（%0%）可能会通过船员们用来交流的铜制喇叭说话，越来越语无伦次和/或阴险。巨像的工作人员可能是在巨像内部蹒跚而行的亡灵--僵尸，或者是注定要在巨像上纠缠的灵魂，直到他们找到祝福的释放。",
	"What arose as an order of militant knights within the nation of Karrnath fell into disgrace and became a shattered remnant. The Order of the Emerald Claw now operates as a collection of cells of fanatical warriors, necromancers, and spies. On the surface, its members seem to be driven by Karrnathi patriotism, and they purport to be adherents of the Blood of Vol. The most cursory investigation reveals that claim to be a facade.": "作为卡尔纳斯国家的一个激进骑士团，它陷入了耻辱，成为一个破碎的残余。翡翠之爪骑士团现在是一个由狂热的战士、死灵法师和间谍组成的小组。从表面上看，其成员似乎是受卡尔纳特爱国主义的驱使，他们声称是沃尔之血的信徒，但最粗略的调查显示，这种说法是假的。",
	"The truth behind the Emerald Claw is that they serve the lich {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}, and in her name they carry out acts of destruction, murder, and necromantic terrorism. They have been linked to the theft of powerful items imbued with necromancy magic, and they often employ vicious undead minions that make even other Karrns uncomfortable. Most worshipers of the Blood of Vol are quick to point out that they don't accept the order's claim to membership in their faith, and those true worshipers vehemently reject the Emerald Claw's violent fanaticism.": "翡翠之爪背后的真相是，他们为巫师（%0%）服务，并以她的名义进行破坏、谋杀和死灵恐怖主义的行为。他们与盗窃被灌注了死灵魔法的强大物品有关，他们经常雇佣凶恶的亡灵爪牙，甚至让其他卡尔人感到不舒服。大多数沃尔之血的崇拜者都很快指出，他们不接受该组织对其信仰成员的要求，而那些真正的崇拜者则强烈反对翡翠之爪的暴力狂热主义。",
	"During the Last War, Karrnath was forced to embrace the practice of necromancy to bolster the ranks of its army. At the same time, a number of chivalric orders were founded by devoted worshipers of the Blood of Vol. These groups included necromancers and bone knights that were trained to raise and command the undead troops used during the war. The Order of the Emerald Claw was one of the most infamous of these groups, renowned for its fighting skills but often sanctioned for its brutal treatment of enemy soldiers. The Emerald Claw were also accused of slaughtering civilians so they could be raised as skeletons or zombies—behavior that was strictly forbidden by the Karrnath commanders.": "在最后的战争中，卡尔纳特被迫接受死灵法术，以加强其军队的力量。同时，一些骑士团由沃尔之血的忠实崇拜者成立，这些团体包括死灵法师和骨骑士，他们被训练成在战争中养育和指挥亡灵部队。翡翠之爪骑士团是这些团体中最臭名昭著的一个，以其战斗技巧而闻名，但常常因其残酷对待敌方士兵而受到制裁。翡翠之爪还被指控屠杀平民，以便将他们培养成骷髅或僵尸--这种行为是被卡尔纳特指挥官严格禁止的。",
	"When King Kaius III came to power near the end of the war, he turned against the Blood of Vol. The orders were disbanded, and many members of the Emerald Claw were condemned as war criminals. While the other orders complied with the king's edict, many knights of the Emerald Claw refused to surrender. The order fragmented as its original members scattered, but a number of those rebellious knights started their own cells, rallying all who wanted to see Karrnath achieve its rightful glory. The order experienced a surge in membership following the Treaty of Thronehold because many Karrns thought that Kaius III had betrayed their nation by embracing peace.": "当战争接近尾声时，凯乌斯三世上台，他转而反对沃尔之血。骑士团被解散，翡翠之爪的许多成员被判处为战犯。虽然其他骑士团遵守了国王的命令，但许多翡翠之爪的骑士拒绝投降。骑士团因原有成员分散而四分五裂，但其中一些反叛的骑士成立了自己的小组，召集所有希望看到卡尔纳特实现其应有的荣耀的人。在《王权条约》之后，骑士团的成员数量激增，因为许多卡尔纳斯人认为凯厄斯三世因拥护和平而背叛了他们的国家。",
	"Six years ago, shortly after Kaius's accession, a figure known as {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW} emerged as the leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Few of her followers know anything about her, other than her great skill as a necromancer; many members of the Order refer to her as Queen of the Dead. Some members of the order believe she will ultimately raise Karrnath above all other nations. Others simply trust that she will grant them personal power. They believe that she is poised to become a god of death, and that when she ascends to divinity, they will be granted immortality or at least the eternal life of undeath.": "六年前，在凯厄斯登基后不久，一个被称为{@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}的人物作为翡翠之爪骑士团的领袖出现了。除了她作为死灵法师的伟大技能之外，她的追随者很少有人知道她的情况；许多骑士团的成员称她为死灵女王。骑士团的一些成员相信她最终会使卡尔纳特超越所有其他国家。其他人只是相信她会赋予他们个人力量。他们相信她已经准备好成为死亡之神，当她升为神时，他们将被授予不朽之身，或者至少是不死之身的永生。",

	"Eberron is part of the Great Wheel of the multiverse, as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} and the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. At the same time, it is fundamentally apart from the rest of the Great Wheel, sealed off from the other planes even while it's encircled by its own wheeling cosmology. Eberron's unique station in the multiverse is an important aspect of the world: its planes have profound and shifting influences on the Material Plane, and it is sheltered from the influences and machinations of gods and other powers elsewhere on the Great Wheel.": "Eberron是多元宇宙大轮回的一部分，正如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}和{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所描述的那样。同时，它又从根本上与大轮回的其他部分分开，即使被自己的轮回宇宙学所包围，也与其他位面隔绝。Eberron在多元宇宙中的独特地位是这个世界的一个重要方面：它的位面对物质界有着深远而多变的影响，而且它不受大轮盘上其他地方的神灵和其他力量的影响和阴谋的庇护。",
	"The planet of Eberron is the heart of its own Material Plane. It is surrounded by the Ring of Siberys. Beyond this band of dragonshards, twelve moons orbit the world.

	"The Material Plane is enfolded by thirteen planes of existence. Many of these have aspects of both Outer Planes and Inner Planes. All of them overlap with Eberron in some way, and they influence and are influenced by the Material Plane. The intensity of this influence waxes and wanes; scholars often depict the planes as orbiting Eberron—sometimes coming close, other times far away—though this manner of expression is merely a metaphor for their shifting influence. When another plane's influence on the Material Plane is especially strong, the plane is said to be coterminous. When its influence is weak, a plane is remote. The state of a plane can be important for performing epic rituals, creating of eldritch machines, or interacting with extraplanar entities. Whether or not a plane is remote or coterminous at a given time depends entirely on the needs of your story.": "物质界被13个存在的平面所包围着。其中许多都有外部世界和内部世界的一面。它们都以某种方式与Eberron重叠，并影响着物质界，也被物质界影响着。这种影响的强度忽高忽低；学者们经常把这些位面描绘成绕着Eberron运行--有时很近，有时很远--尽管这种表达方式只是对其影响变化的一种隐喻。当另一个位面对物质界的影响特别大时，这个位面就被称为 \"同位素\"。当它的影响很弱时，一个平面是遥远的。一个位面的状态对于进行史诗般的仪式、创造长生机或与星外实体互动来说可能很重要。一个平面在某一特定时间是否是遥远的或同源的，完全取决于你的故事需要。",
	"At certain places in the Material Plane, the barriers between worlds are thin, and some characteristics of another plane can bleed through into the material world. These places are called manifest zones, and the nature of each one is strongly shaped by the plane it connects to. The city of Sharn is located in a manifest zone linked to Syrania that keeps its towers reaching toward the sky and aids flight. Ghosts might linger in a manifest zone associated with Dolurrh, while a manifest zone tied to Lamannia might have wild vegetation and enhance druidic magic. A manifest zone might include a portal that allows free passage from either plane to the other. The descriptions of other planes in this section offer some other possible effects. Most manifest zones have reliable, persistent effects. Some have only weak connections to their planes, and their properties influence the world only when the plane is coterminous.": "在物质界的某些地方，世界之间的壁垒很薄，另一界的一些特性可以渗入物质界。这些地方被称为显化区，每个显化区的性质都被它所连接的位面所强烈塑造。沙恩城位于一个与西拉尼亚相连的显化区，它的塔楼一直伸向天空，有助于飞行。鬼魂可能会在与Dolurrh相关的显化区徘徊，而与Lamannia相关的显化区可能会有野生植被并增强德鲁伊的魔法。一个显灵区可能包括一个传送门，允许从任何一个位面自由通行到另一个位面。本节中对其他位面的描述提供了一些其他可能的效果。大多数显灵区都有可靠、持久的效果。有些则与它们的位面只有微弱的联系，它们的属性只有在位面相通时才会影响世界。",

Some districts are governed by a justice system based in goodness, where laws help to maintain harmony. In more oppressive locations, harsh laws are imposed on the suffering populace by tyrannical devils.": "Daanvi体现了绝对的秩序，以及法律和纪律的理想和它们对文明的影响。飞机上完美的秩序、无暇的区域代表了法律的不同方面：精确维护的领域、法律主义的法庭，以及成群结队的modrons汇编有史以来每一条规则或条例的档案。有些地区由基于善良的司法系统管理，法律有助于维持和谐。在更多的地方，暴虐的魔鬼将严厉的法律强加给受苦的民众。",

The primary inhabitants of Dal Quor are the quori, enigmatic master manipulators that can inhabit the dreams of others.": "凡人生物在做梦的时候会接触到达尔-库尔（除了精灵、卡拉什塔和战神，他们不做梦）。这个平面的外围是由做梦者的记忆和经历塑造的。飞机中心的黑暗核心是由被称为 \"梦幻黑暗 \"的梦魇力量塑造的。达尔-库尔的主要居民是库里，神秘的操纵者，可以居住在他人的梦中。",
	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the quori fought a bitter war with the giants of Xen'drik. The giants ended the war by severing the connection between Dal Quor and Eberron and disrupting the cycle of the planes. As a result, Dal Quor is always remote in relation to the Material Plane, and no manifest zones are tied to Dal Quor. The only way to reach Dal Quor from the Material Plane is through the psychic projection of dreaming, and the quori are forced to possess mortal hosts to work their will on Eberron.": "数万年前，库里人与Xen'drik的巨人进行了一场激烈的战争。巨人通过切断达尔-库尔和艾伯伦之间的联系，扰乱了各位面的循环，从而结束了这场战争。因此，达尔-库尔相对于物质世界来说总是很遥远，没有任何显化区与达尔-库尔相联系。从物质世界到达达尔-库尔的唯一途径是通过梦境的精神投射，而库里则被迫拥有凡人的宿主来实现他们在伊贝隆的意志。",
	"When a mortal soul dies, it is drawn to Dolurrh, a place defined by despair and apathy. Over time, memories are leached out of these trapped spirits until only husks remain. Although this seems a bleak fate, most religions maintain that Dolurrh isn't the end of a soul's journey; it is a gateway to whatever lies beyond. They assert that what appears to be dissolution is the natural process of the soul moving to a higher plane of existence that mortals can never realize: joining with the Sovereigns, merging with the Silver Flame, or simply rejoining the cycle of life in a new form. That claim notwithstanding, Dolurrh is a gloomy plane filled with the lingering traces of the dead.": "当一个凡人的灵魂死亡时，它被吸引到Dolurrh，一个由绝望和冷漠定义的地方。随着时间的推移，这些被困的灵魂的记忆被浸出，直到只剩下躯壳。虽然这似乎是一个暗淡的命运，但大多数宗教坚持认为，Dolurrh并不是一个灵魂旅程的终点；它是通向其他地方的大门。他们断言，看似解体的东西是灵魂走向凡人永远无法实现的更高存在层面的自然过程：与主宰者结合，与银色火焰融合，或者只是以新的形式重新加入生命的循环。尽管有这样的说法，多鲁尔是一个阴暗的位面，充满了死者的残余痕迹。",

	"This plane encompasses both the raw elemental power of fire and its versatility: flame used as a weapon, as a force that holds darkness at bay, or as a destroyer and a force for change.

	"Thelanis is the home of the fey and a realm where narrative and metaphor shape the nature of reality. Its many dominions are governed by the archfey, and the denizens of each realm reflect the nature and the story of their lord. For instance, the realm of the Prince of Frost is trapped in endless winter, and pale eladrin lead packs of winter wolves in their hunts. It's not the same environment as on Risia, because the prince's realm isn't an embodiment of the idea of cold—rather, it's a domain frozen by its prince's broken heart. If the prince's story were changed, the realm would change with it.": "Thelanis是精灵的故乡，也是一个由叙事和隐喻塑造现实本质的领域。它的许多领地都由大帝管辖，每个领地的居民都反映了他们的领主的性质和故事。例如，冰霜王子的王国被困在无尽的冬天里，苍白的艾拉德林带领成群的冬狼进行狩猎。这和里西亚的环境不一样，因为王子的王国并不是寒冷理念的化身--相反，它是一个被王子破碎的心冻结的领域。如果王子的故事被改变，这个领域也会随之改变。",
	"Time and space are both malleable in the Faerie Court, and a mortal who wanders into Thelanis might never return—or might leave after a few days to discover that weeks, months, or years have passed back home.": "时间和空间在精灵王庭都是可塑的，一个误入Thelanis的凡人可能再也回不来了，或者在几天后离开时发现家乡已经过了几周、几个月或几年。",

	"In your campaign, you might decide that the barrier formed by the Ring of Siberys is intact, and contact between Eberron and the worlds and planes beyond its cosmology is impossible. This is the default assumption of this book. On the other hand, you might want to incorporate elements from other realms. Perhaps you want to use a published adventure that involves Tiamat or the forces of the Abyss meddling in the affairs of the world. In such a case, it could be that the protection offered by the Ring of Siberys has begun to fail. You might link the weakening of Siberys to the Mourning—perhaps whatever magical catastrophe caused the Mourning also disrupted the Ring of Siberys, or perhaps a disruption of the Ring of Siberys actually caused the Mourning!": "在你的战役中，你可能会决定由西伯利亚之环形成的屏障是完整的，Eberron和其宇宙观之外的世界和位面之间的联系是不可能的。这是本书的默认假设。另一方面，你可能想加入其他领域的元素。也许你想使用一个已发表的涉及提亚马特或深渊力量插手世界事务的冒险。在这种情况下，可能是西伯利亚之环提供的保护已经开始失效。你可以将Siberys的衰弱与哀伤联系起来--也许造成哀伤的魔法灾难也扰乱了Siberys之环，或者也许Siberys之环的扰乱实际上造成了哀伤！\"。",
	"If contact between Eberron and the wider multiverse is recent and limited, consider the implications for everyone involved. In the Great Wheel, Asmodeus is an ancient threat, with well-established cults, lines of tieflings, and a long history of meddling that sages might uncover in dusty old tomes hidden in remote libraries. But if Asmodeus has only just discovered Eberron and begun to influence it for the first time, there is no lore about him to be discovered on Eberron. He has no power base and needs to recruit new followers. Unusual alliances might form against him, as celestials and fiends join forces to expel this hostile outsider.": "如果Eberron和更广泛的多元宇宙之间的接触是最近的和有限的，请考虑对每个人的影响。在大轮回中，阿斯莫德是一个古老的威胁，他有完善的邪教，有铁皮人的血统，还有很长的干涉历史，贤者们可能会在藏在偏远图书馆的尘封的旧书中发现。但如果阿斯莫德刚刚发现埃伯龙并开始第一次影响它，那么在埃伯龙上就没有关于他的传说可以发现。他没有权力基础，需要招募新的追随者。不寻常的联盟可能会形成来反对他，因为天人和魔族会联合起来驱逐这个敌对的外来者。",
	"The people of Eberron believe their gods are omnipresent—not bound to a single coherent form, but present in all places. If you revere the Silver Flame, its power is always with you. The Sovereign Onatar guides the hand of every smith who knows how to listen for his voice, and Dol Arrah and Dol Dorn are active on every battlefield, guiding every soldier. This outlook means that religion is driven by faith, as opposed to the concrete actions of deities. The faithful believe that their triumphs reflect the assistance of a divine influence. They don't expect a god to physically show up and solve their problems.": "Eberron的人们相信他们的神是无所不在的--不受限于单一的连贯形式，而是存在于所有地方。如果你崇敬银色火焰，它的力量就会一直伴随着你。主宰者奥纳塔引导着每一个知道如何倾听他声音的铁匠的手，多尔-阿拉和多尔-多恩活跃在每一个战场上，指导着每一个士兵。这种观点意味着宗教是由信仰驱动的，而不是由神灵的具体行动驱动的。信徒们相信，他们的胜利反映了神的影响的帮助。他们并不期望神明会亲自出现并解决他们的问题。",
	"Fiends and celestials certainly do have physical form, however. Fortunately for the folk of the Material Plane, these extraplanar creatures are deeply invested in their own affairs and have little interest in Eberron. Demons and angels battle one another in Shavarath, but they've been doing this since before humanity existed, and they dare not leave their posts to fool around elsewhere. Exceptions do exist, such as the daelkyr and the Dreaming Dark, but by and large these natives of other planes are exclusively concerned with where they live. As such, player characters are more likely to encounter celestials and fiends that are native to Eberron, spawned by Khyber or Siberys, rather than extraplanar entities.": "然而，恶魔和天人当然也有身体形态。对物质世界的人们来说，幸运的是，这些星外生物对他们自己的事情投入很大，对Eberron兴趣不大。恶魔和天使在沙瓦拉斯互相争斗，但他们在人类存在之前就已经开始这样做了，他们不敢离开自己的岗位去其他地方胡闹。例外的情况确实存在，例如daelkyr和Dreaming Dark，但总的来说，这些其他星球的土著只关心他们生活的地方。因此，玩家角色更有可能遇到Eberron本土的天人和魔物，它们是由Khyber或Siberys催生的，而不是星外实体。",
	"Couatls are a celestial race born from Siberys at the dawn of time. Along with the dragons, they battled the fiendish overlords of Khorvaire and Sarlona. Ultimately, the couatls sacrificed most of their number and combined their souls to form a prison to hold the overlords. Scholars have theorized that their combined souls eventually became the force that is worshiped by the Church of the Silver Flame. The church is ambivalent on the topic, preaching that regardless of how the Flame was first kindled, there is a place within the Flame for all noble souls.": "Couatls是一个在时间之初从Siberys诞生的天体种族。他们与龙一起，与霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳的恶魔霸主作战。最终，库阿特人牺牲了他们中的大部分人，并将他们的灵魂结合在一起，形成了一个关押霸主的监狱。学者们推测，他们结合的灵魂最终成为银焰教会所崇拜的力量。教会在这个问题上是矛盾的，宣扬无论火焰最初是如何被点燃的，在火焰中都有一个位置给所有高贵的灵魂。",
	"The few couatls that remain on Eberron are devoted servants of the light. They are most often found guarding the prison of the ancient fiendish overlords, and individuals sometimes act directly to aid adventurers who fight the forces of darkness.": "留在艾伯伦的少数库拉特斯是光明的忠实仆人。他们最常被发现守卫在古代恶魔霸主的监狱里，个别的人有时会直接帮助那些与黑暗势力作斗争的冒险者。",
	"The mightiest of the fiends born from Khyber are creatures of immense power known as the overlords. Dozens of overlords were imprisoned by the Silver Flame at the dawn of time; two of them, {@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW} and {@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}, are detailed in {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}. Another—Bel Shalor, the Shadow in the Flame—is bound within the Silver Flame itself in the great cathedral in Flamekeep in Thrane. You can adapt other evil gods or archfiends for an Eberron campaign (assuming you don't want Eberron to be connected to the wider multiverse) by recasting them as overlords. For example, Tiamat could be an overlord embodying the pride and potential for evil within dragons, Lolth could be an overlord who preys on the elves, and Asmodeus the insidious maker of profane bargains.": "从开伯尔诞生的最强大的恶魔是具有巨大力量的生物，被称为霸主。在时间之初，数十位霸主被银色火焰所囚禁；其中两个，{@creature Rak Tulkhesh|ERLW}和{@creature Sul Khatesh|ERLW}，详见{@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}。另一个--贝尔-沙洛，火焰中的影子--被束缚在银色火焰本身中，位于瑟兰的火焰镇大教堂中。你可以为Eberron战役改编其他邪神或大恶魔（假设你不希望Eberron与更广泛的多元宇宙相联系），把他们改编为霸主。例如，提亚马特（Tiamat）可以是一个体现龙的骄傲和潜在邪恶的霸主，洛尔思（Lolth）可以是一个掠夺精灵的霸主，而阿斯摩德（Asmodeus）则是阴险的亵渎交易的制造者。",
	"Any fiend—whether devil, demon, yugoloth, or something else—could be spawned by Khyber if it suits your story.

	"Night hags have been around since the Age of Demons, when they often served as ambassadors and carried messages between the fiends and the dragons. Today, they remain impartial mediators, and adventurers who are about to deal with outsiders or other planes of existence might want to seek the advice of a night hag—although one can be quite difficult to find.": "夜魔女从恶魔时代就开始存在了，当时她们经常充当大使，在恶魔和龙之间传递信息。今天，她们仍然是公正的调解人，那些即将与外来者或其他存在的星球打交道的冒险者可能想寻求夜行者的建议--尽管她们可能很难找到。",
	"As the primary agents of the fiendish overlords, rakshasas once dominated Khorvaire and Sarlona. When the overlords were defeated in the first age of the world by the combined might of the dragons and the couatls, the rakshasas largely disappeared into Khyber as well. The Lords of Dust are made up largely of rakshasas, scheming in the shadows—many trying to free their imprisoned overlords, others looking for a way to claim their masters' power for their own.": "作为恶魔霸主的主要代理人，拉克萨人曾经主宰了霍尔韦尔和萨洛纳。当霸主在世界的第一个时代被龙和库拉特斯的联合力量击败后，拉克萨斯也基本消失在开伯尔。尘土领主主要由罗刹人组成，他们在暗中策划--许多人试图释放他们被囚禁的霸主，其他人则在寻找一种方法，将他们主人的权力据为己有。",
	"Thanks to the industrious innovation of multiple dragonmarked houses and workshops full of magewrights, the people of Khorvaire can cross the continent in a week or less using magical means.

	"As described in {@book chapter 5|DMG|5} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, it's up to you whether you gloss over travel in your campaign or narrate it in more detail. If the point is to get the characters to their destination so they can get the adventure underway, it's fine to assume that their journey (whether it's by lightning rail, airship, or more mundane means) passes without incident. After all, the people of Khorvaire make such trips every day, and most of them reach their destinations safely.": "正如{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所描述的那样，在你的活动中是掩盖旅行，还是更详细地叙述它，这取决于你。如果重点是让人物到达目的地，以便他们能够开始冒险，那么假设他们的旅程（无论是通过闪电般的铁路、飞艇，还是更平凡的手段）顺利通过就可以了。毕竟，Khorvaire的人们每天都在进行这样的旅行，而且他们中的大多数人都能安全到达目的地。",
	"The alternative is to make the journey an important part of the adventure. Travel can play a crucial role in a story, and when it does, you should give it as much time at the game table as it needs.": "另一个办法是让旅行成为冒险的重要部分。旅行可以在故事中发挥关键作用，当它发生时，你应该在游戏桌上给它尽可能多的时间。",
	"Long ago, gnome artificers and specialists from House Cannith discovered and developed a means of magical travel. The heart of the process is a set of techniques for binding elementals that uses Khyber dragonshards. This closely guarded procedure requires delicate engineering, arcane skill, and rare materials from around the world, and different workshops employ varying esoteric techniques. Building a new vehicle can occupy a workshop for months while magical energy is painstakingly inlaid into the vessel's hull. Such work is a complicated task requiring the labor of many; it is not something that can be undertaken by a lone wizard for any amount of compensation.": "很久以前，坎尼斯家族的地精工匠和专家发现并开发了一种神奇的旅行方式。这个过程的核心是一套使用开伯尔龙石的元素绑定技术。这个被严密保护的程序需要精致的工程、奥术技能和来自世界各地的稀有材料，不同的工场采用不同的深奥技术。建造一辆新车可能会占用一个车间几个月的时间，而魔法能量会被不遗余力地镶嵌在船体上。这样的工作是一项复杂的任务，需要许多人的劳动；这不是一个孤独的巫师可以承担的，没有任何报酬。",
	"The construction of elemental vessels requires the use of two kinds of dragonshards. A Khyber dragonshard of the largest size and finest quality is required to bind the elemental to the vessel, and a Siberys dragonshard is needed to craft the vehicle's helm. Production of new vessels grinds to a halt without a steady supply of both kinds of dragonshards, and a workshop with an order to fill will pay a handsome fee to adventurers who can find them.": "建造元素船需要使用两种龙石。一块最大尺寸和最优质的凯博尔龙石需要用来将元素束缚在船上，而西伯利亚龙石则需要用来制作船只的头盔。如果没有这两种龙碎片的稳定供应，新船只的生产就会停滞不前，有订单的工场会向能找到它们的冒险者支付一笔丰厚的费用。",
	"Every elemental vessel is imbued with an {@condition invisible}, arcane matrix. This magical essence extends from the containment chamber at the core of the vehicle to the binding struts, then through the rest of the vehicle's hull. When a Khyber dragonshard holding a bound elemental is placed in the containment chamber, the matrix comes alive. The unsuppressed elemental emerges from the shard and flows along the matrix in the way that blood moves through the arteries and veins of a living creature.": "每个元素容器都被注入了一个{@condition invisible}，奥术矩阵。这种魔法精华从车辆核心的容纳室延伸到束缚支柱，然后穿过车体的其他部分。当持有束缚元素的开伯尔龙碎片被放置在容纳室中时，矩阵就会活跃起来。未受压制的元素从碎片中出现，并沿着矩阵流动，就像血液在生物的动脉和静脉中流动一样。",
	"The binding struts force the elemental into a ring shape and give every elemental vessel its distinctive appearance. From there, the elemental continues to flow along the matrix through the hull, appearing as jagged, snaking lines of living energy that pulse and shift. These conduits of elemental energy take on an appearance associated with the type of elemental bound into the vessel. A fire elemental, for example, sends tendrils of flame along the hull of its ship.": "捆绑的支柱迫使元素形成一个环形，并使每个元素容器具有独特的外观。从那里，元素继续沿着基体流经船体，表现为锯齿状的、有生命力的能量线，并有脉冲和变化。这些元素能量的管道呈现出与绑定在容器中的元素类型相关的外观。例如，火元素会沿着其船体发出火焰卷轴。",
	"At the command of the vehicle's dragonmarked pilot, the bound elemental can be suppressed, causing its essence to flow back into the containment chamber and the matrix to disappear from view. A vehicle whose elemental is suppressed ceases to be propelled.": "在车辆的龙纹驾驶员的指挥下，被束缚的元素可以被压制，使其精华流回封闭室，矩阵从视野中消失。元素被压制的车辆将不再被推动。",
	"Piloting an elemental vessel requires effective communication between the pilot and the bound elemental. The elemental controls the vehicle's movement, and everything from basic propulsion to delicate maneuvering is dependent on the ability of the pilot to control the elemental. If the elemental is uncontrolled and not suppressed, the vehicle moves according to the elemental's whim until a pilot asserts control again.": "驾驶元素船需要飞行员和被约束的元素之间的有效沟通。元素控制着车辆的运动，从基本的推进力到微妙的操纵都取决于飞行员控制元素的能力。如果元素不受控制，也没有被压制，那么车辆就会按照元素的意愿移动，直到飞行员再次主张控制。",
	"A dragonmarked heir at the helm of a vessel can command the elemental easily. Without such a pilot, it's very difficult to control the vessel. A character who is touching either the Khyber dragonshard where the bound elemental is housed or the magic item at the vessel's helm can try to communicate with the elemental, but with no guarantee of success.": "掌舵船只的龙纹继承人可以轻松指挥元素。没有这样的驾驶员，就很难控制船只。一个角色如果接触到放置绑定元素的凯博龙石或船只舵手的魔法物品，可以尝试与元素沟通，但不能保证成功。",
	"A character can make a DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion} or {@skill Intimidation}) check to persuade the elemental to cooperate or demand its obedience. On a successful check, the elemental obeys the character for 1 minute.": "角色可以进行DC20魅力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查，以说服元素合作或要求其服从。如果检定成功，元素体将在1分钟内服从该角色。",
	"The {@spell dominate monster} spell can also enable a character without a dragonmark to control an elemental vessel, even wresting control away from a dragonmarked pilot. The {@spell charm monster|XGE} spell (found in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) also makes the elemental compliant to the caster's wishes, but the elemental remains obedient to the commands of a dragonmarked pilot at the helm.": "{@spell dominate monster}法术也可以使没有龙纹的角色控制元素船，甚至从有龙纹的驾驶员手中夺取控制权。{@spell charm monster|XGE}法术（见{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}）也能使元素船顺从施法者的意愿，但元素船仍然听从掌舵的龙纹驾驶员的命令。",
	"Shattering the Khyber dragonshard that binds it can free an elemental, preventing the vehicle from moving. On most elemental vessels, the shard is sealed in a protective metal chest with 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points, usually made of iron (AC 19) but sometimes of mithral (AC 21) or adamantine (AC 23). The chest is often guarded with a {@spell glyph of warding} and housed in a room behind locked and possibly trapped doors. The shard itself has AC 17 and 10 ({@dice 3d6}) hit points.": "打碎束缚它的开伯尔龙石可以释放一个元素，阻止车辆的移动。在大多数元素船中，龙碎片被封存在一个具有10（%0%）命中率的保护性金属箱中，通常由铁（AC19）制成，但有时由密特拉（AC21）或金刚砂（AC23）制成。箱子通常有一个{@spell glyph of warding}的守卫，并被放置在一个上了锁的房间里，可能还有陷阱的门。碎片本身有AC17和10{@dice 3d6}的命中率。",
	"The airship is the most advanced elemental-powered vehicle on Eberron, the pride of House Lyrandar and the forerunner of the magical advances that many hope will become commonplace in the aftermath of the Last War.

For now, though, they remain rare, because the soarwood required for their construction is exceedingly scarce and tightly controlled.": "飞艇是Eberron上最先进的元素动力交通工具，是Lyrandar家族的骄傲，也是许多人希望在最后一次战争之后变得普遍的魔法进步的先行者。第一艘飞艇出现在坎尼斯和齐拉尔戈的工场，并在八年前（990 YK）出现在利兰达尔家族的服务中。不过现在，它们仍然很罕见，因为建造它们所需的翱翔木非常稀少，而且受到严格控制。",
	"Soarwood is a form of buoyant timber found only on the island of Aerenal, and the elves who live there limit their annual harvest of the precious wood. As a result, production of new airships proceeds at a snail's pace, unable to satisfy the fervent demand for new vessels. The discovery of a new supply of soarwood could literally change the world, and even convincing the elves of Aerenal to part with more of it would be an achievement worth a handsome reward from House Lyrandar.": "翱翔木是一种只有在Aerenal岛上才能找到的浮力木材，而生活在那里的精灵们每年都会限制对这种珍贵木材的收获。因此，新飞艇的生产以蜗牛的速度进行，无法满足人们对新船的狂热需求。发现新的翱翔木供应可以改变世界，甚至说服Aerenal的精灵们放弃更多的翱翔木也是一项值得Lyrandar家族给予丰厚奖励的成就。",
	"A standard airship (at least as far as standards have been defined for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship but is rigged with control fins and rudders rather than sails. An air or fire elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, which is suspended on four struts jutting outward. Most airships are outfitted with the finest amenities, including many decorative flourishes and creature comforts.": "一艘标准的飞艇（至少就这种相对较新的创造物所定义的标准而言）看起来类似于一艘远洋船，但装有控制鳍和舵，而不是风帆。一个空气或火元素被束缚在船体周围的一个环中，船体被悬挂在四个向外突出的支柱上。大多数飞艇都配备了最好的设施，包括许多装饰性的装饰品和生物舒适度。",
	"A dragonmarked heir of House Lyrandar must pilot a Lyrandar airship, channeling the power of the Mark of Storm through the {@item wheel of wind and water|ERLW} that controls the vessel. The helm is typically situated near the rear of the ship, inside the shelter of a wheelhouse. Controlling the vessel (without the benefit of something like the {@i conductor stones} that dictate a lightning rail route) requires constant attention, so at least two pilots typically travel on every journey.": "一个拥有龙纹的利兰达家族的继承人必须驾驶利兰达飞艇，通过控制船只的{@item wheel of wind and water|ERLW}引导风暴印记的力量。舵手通常位于船尾附近，在驾驶室的庇护下。控制这艘船（如果没有像(1%)那样的支配闪电轨道路线的东西）需要持续的关注，所以每次旅行通常至少有两名飞行员。",
	"Only a dragonmark heir with the Mark of Storm can use the wheel and command the bound elemental. House Lyrandar pilots train for months to gain a deep understanding of the ship's powers and limitations. Because of this training, a skilled pilot can execute acrobatic maneuvers in the sky.": "只有拥有风暴印记的龙印继承人才能使用轮子并指挥被束缚的元素。Lyrandar家族的飞行员经过几个月的训练，对飞船的能力和限制有了深刻的了解。因为这种训练，一个熟练的飞行员可以在天空中执行杂技动作。",
	"Airships can move in all three dimensions, with or without the aid of the wind. Unlike most flying creatures, they don't rely on wings for lift thanks to their soarwood hulls. They are able to fly equally well on their sides or even upside down (notwithstanding the risks that such maneuvers present to passengers and crew).": "飞艇可以在所有三个维度上移动，无论是否有风的帮助。与大多数飞行生物不同的是，由于它们的翱翔木船体，它们不依靠翅膀来获得升力。它们同样能够侧身飞行，甚至倒立飞行（尽管这种操作对乘客和船员有风险）。",
	"Airships cannot actually land, because the struts that hold the elemental ring in place protrude 10 feet from the bottom of the vessel. Thus, passengers and cargo are lifted in elevators and loaded at towers in major cities. Each ship carries rope ladders for use at smaller stations, in open terrain, or in cases of dire emergency.": "飞艇实际上不能降落，因为固定元素环的支柱从船底伸出10英尺。因此，乘客和货物用电梯提升，并在主要城市的塔楼上装载。每艘船都携带绳梯，以便在较小的站点、开阔的地形或在严重的紧急情况下使用。",
	"A typical airship can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in clear skies carrying up to 30 tons of cargo. Airships are most often employed by explorers and by wealthy travelers who demand luxury—clients who have a need to move quickly to places that might not be served by the lightning rail.": "一艘典型的飞艇在晴朗的天空中可以达到每小时20英里的速度，携带多达30吨的货物。飞艇最常被探险家和要求豪华的富裕旅行者所雇用--他们有需要快速移动到可能没有闪电般的铁路服务的地方。",
	"Although the elemental bound to the airship is essential for propulsion, the vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. When the elemental is suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can't move. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking, then uses ropes to maneuver the vessel into position.": "虽然绑定在飞艇上的元素对推进力至关重要，但飞艇的翱翔木船体提供了比空气更轻的浮力。当元素被压制时，飞船仍在高空但不能移动。飞行员总是在停靠前压制住元素，然后用绳索将船只操纵到位置。",
	"A House Lyrandar galleon, also called an elemental galleon, resembles a Lyrandar airship except that it has a water elemental ring that propels it across oceans and seas instead of through the air. This vessel has a speed of 10 miles per hour but otherwise is similar to a Lyrandar airship.": "Lyrandar家族的大帆船，也被称为元素大帆船，与Lyrandar飞艇相似，只是它有一个水元素环，推动它穿越海洋，而不是通过空气。这种船的速度为每小时10英里，但其他方面与Lyrandar飞艇相似。",
	"The wondrous lightning rail system once linked the far reaches of the Kingdom of Galifar, prior to the Last War. Now the system is divided, split into eastern and western circuits. Reestablishing the {@i conductor stone} paths across Scions Sound and the Mournland is often discussed in the halls of power in the Five Nations, but formidable challenges are involved.": "在最后一次战争之前，奇妙的闪电铁路系统曾经连接着加利法尔王国的远方。现在这个系统被分割开来，分成了东部和西部的线路。在五国的权力大厅里，人们经常讨论重建横跨塞恩斯湾和哀牢地的{@i conductor stone}路径，但这涉及到艰巨的挑战。",
	"A lightning rail train is made up of an elemental vessel linked to a series of connected carts, all of which float about 5 feet off the ground. Each cart, similar in form to a large wagon with no wheels, has a {@i conductor stone} embedded in its underside. A corresponding set of {@i conductor stones} laid out in a line on the ground interacts with the stones in the carts to form a rail for the train to follow. Lightning arcs between the two sets of stones, accounting for the system's name.": "一辆闪电轨道列车是由一艘元素船与一系列相连的小车组成的，所有的小车都漂浮在离地面约5英尺的地方。每辆小车的形式类似于一辆没有轮子的大马车，在其底部嵌入了一个（%0%）。一组相应的{@i conductor stones}在地面上排成一排，与小车中的石块相互作用，形成一条轨道，供火车行驶。闪电在两组石头之间划出弧线，这就是该系统的名称。",
	"The elemental vessel at the front of the train, called a crew cart, holds a bound air elemental that propels the train along its route at a speed of about 30 miles per hour. The elemental appears as a ring of lightning encircling the crew cart while the train is in motion. A bound air elemental can move a train of up to ten carts without obvious strain, and most trains are configured accordingly.": "列车前部的元素容器，称为乘务车，持有一个绑定的空气元素，推动列车以每小时约30英里的速度行驶。在火车行驶过程中，空气元素以闪电环的形式出现，包围着乘务车。一个绑定的空气元素可以在没有明显压力的情况下移动多达十辆车的火车，而且大多数火车都是这样配置的。",
	"The other carts that make up the train have various purposes. A typical train has a crew cart at each end, with two cargo carts, four passenger carts, and two lounge carts in between. Doors at both ends of each cart enable crew and passengers to walk from one to the next, even while the train is in motion. Both crew carts are identical, except that the bound elemental in one is suppressed. On the return trip, the roles of the carts and the states of their elementals are reversed.": "组成列车的其他小车有不同的用途。一辆典型的火车在两端各有一辆乘务车，中间有两辆货运车、四辆客运车和两辆休息车。每个车的两端都有门，使乘务员和乘客能够从一个车走到另一个车，甚至在列车行驶中也是如此。两辆乘务车都是一样的，只是其中一辆车的绑定元素被压制了。在回程中，小车的角色和它们的元素的状态是相反的。",
	"Specialized carts of other sorts vary in configuration depending on their purpose and the degree of luxury afforded to them. Some have solid sides and roofs, while others are covered only with canvas.": "其他种类的专用车在配置上也有不同，这取决于它们的用途和对它们的豪华程度。有些有坚固的侧面和屋顶，而有些则只用帆布覆盖。",
	"Map 4.10 shows the different carts that comprise most lightning rail trains.": "地图4.10显示了组成大多数闪电铁路列车的不同车种。",
	"The vessel's pilot, a House Orien dragonmarked heir, stands at the helm, high atop the crew cart, beneath the elemental binding struts. The pilot controls the elemental and communicates with it during the trip, watching the path ahead through broad windows that encircle the helm platform.": "这艘船的驾驶员，一位奥瑞恩家族的龙纹继承人，站在舵手的位置上，高高在上的船员车，在元素束缚的支柱下面。驾驶员控制着元素，并在旅途中与它交流，通过环绕舵手平台的宽大窗户观察前方的道路。",
	"The placement of {@i conductor stone} lines dictates where a lightning rail train can travel, but the pilot still must make operational decisions as the coach moves from one city to the next. The pilot controls the vessel's speed based on conditions around the train. When {@i conductor stone} lines split, as they do at various hubs along the way, the pilot selects the intended route and directs the elemental down the correct line.": "{@i conductor stone}线的布置决定了闪电式铁路列车可以行驶的位置，但在车厢从一个城市到另一个城市的过程中，驾驶员仍然必须做出操作决定。驾驶员根据列车周围的条件控制船只的速度。当(1%)线路分裂时，就像它们在沿途的各个枢纽所做的那样，驾驶员会选择预定的路线，并引导元素沿着正确的线路前进。",
	"The crew of a train includes handful of chief stewards overseeing a number of lesser stewards who are charged with seeing to the needs of passengers and keeping cargo secured.": "火车上的乘务员包括几名首席乘务员，他们负责监督一些较小的乘务员，以满足乘客的需要并保证货物的安全。",
	"Lightning rail stations, where passengers and cargo can be disembarked or loaded, are located in or just outside villages, towns, and cities along the conductor stone paths. There are no stations in the expanses between these settlements, and House Orien rules prohibit lightning rail pilots from stopping anywhere but at a station.": "可供乘客和货物下船或装货的闪电铁路站，位于村庄、城镇和城市沿线的指挥石道内或外。在这些定居点之间的广袤地带没有车站，奥瑞恩家族的规则禁止闪电铁路飞行员在车站以外的任何地方停留。",
	"Stations throughout Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold {@i everbright lanterns} continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side of the train and the passengers from the other.": "整个霍尔韦尔的站台都有类似的外观和感觉，以确保每个站台不辜负奥瑞恩家族顾客的高度期望。白色和金色（%0%）不断地照亮着每个车站。当火车驶入车站时，装载坡道被移到每个货物车旁边的位置，而每个乘客车旁边的楼梯。货物从火车的一侧卸下，乘客从另一侧卸下。",
	"Individual stations do have distinct touches that reflect local features. For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house.": "个别车站确实有反映当地特色的独特触觉。例如，位于塔伦塔平原的加瑟霍德（Gatherhold）车站，以传统的半身人图案为装饰，并为离开恐龙的旅行者提供专门的马厩。在更大的范围内，帕萨奇的车站是奥瑞恩家族的权力所在地，它是一个多层的结构，被设计成一个纪念碑，以纪念该家族的威严和传奇的历史。",
	"Lightning rails and airships are good places to encounter a broad sample of Khorvaire's diverse population. You can use the Mysterious Passengers table to bring curious characters in contact with an adventuring party on any kind of journey. Each of these characters might spark an entire new adventure, or might be little more than a momentary diversion. Determine details about these travelers are, and the stories behind them, as you see fit.": "闪电轨道和飞艇是很好的地方，可以广泛地接触到霍尔韦尔的不同人口样本。你可以使用 \"神秘乘客 \"表，让好奇的角色在任何类型的旅行中与冒险队伍接触。这些人物中的每一个都可能引发整个新的冒险，也可能只是一个短暂的转移而已。你可以决定这些旅行者的细节，以及他们背后的故事，只要你认为合适。",

	"Every city, most towns, and even some villages have a Gold Dragon Inn, and a large city might boast several. Every major road through the countryside has Gold Dragon Inns along much of its length, spaced roughly a day's travel apart. Sometimes an inn is the nucleus of a small community whose industry is focused on providing for the needs of travelers.

	"Every Gold Dragon Inn provides a standard menu of reliable services at reasonable rates. Prices are fixed (equal to those given in {@book chapter 5|PHB|4} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), and the quality of services is reliably modest, with some comfortable upgrades available.

	"The size and number of guest rooms can vary from inn to inn: a small roadside inn has four rooms and a moderately sized common room, while a thriving inn in a large city has forty rooms, a restaurant, and a separate common room, with two stages for entertainment. Because the inns are owned by House Ghallanda, the buildings all include accommodations for halfling-sized guests as well as taller folk.": "每家旅馆的规模和客房数量都不尽相同：路边的小旅馆有四个房间和一个规模适中的公共房间，而大城市里繁荣的旅馆有四十个房间、一个餐厅和一个独立的公共房间，还有两个娱乐舞台。因为这些客栈都属于加兰达家族，所以这些建筑都包括半身人大小的客人和高大的民工的住宿。",
	"Because travelers often carry valuables with them, each inn has a heavy strongbox secured with an {@spell arcane lock} spell. To make a traveler's stay more enjoyable, perhaps even memorable, House Ghallanda has arranged with House Thuranni and House Phiarlan to employ guild-licensed entertainers at almost every Gold Dragon Inn.": "因为旅行者经常携带贵重物品，所以每家旅馆都有一个沉重的保险箱，用{@spell arcane lock}的法术固定。为了使旅行者的住宿更加愉快，甚至是令人难忘，加兰达家族与图兰尼家族和菲亚兰家族安排，在几乎每家金龙客栈都雇佣有公会许可的艺人。",

	"Sharn can be a grim place that makes good people bad and bad people worse. In its mean streets, gritty detectives contend with corrupt law officers while trying to foil the efforts of merciless gangs and monstrous thugs. In the highest towers, wealthy barons from the dragonmarked houses make shady deals with crime bosses, each of them making profits by exploiting both the ordinary folk and the well-heeled upper crust alike. Corruption can be found among the ranks of government, the watch, the temples, and large businesses. This atmosphere makes Sharn a perfect location for adventures inspired by the noir genre.": "沙恩是一个残酷的地方，它使好人变坏，坏人变坏。在卑鄙的街道上，狡猾的侦探与腐败的法律官员抗争，同时试图挫败无情的帮派和畸形的暴徒的努力。在最高的塔楼里，来自龙纹屋的富有的男爵与犯罪头目进行着不光彩的交易，他们每个人都通过剥削普通人和富裕的上层人士而获利。在政府、监察部门、寺庙和大型企业中都能发现腐败现象。这种氛围使沙恩成为受黑色流派启发的冒险的完美地点。",
	"Sharn can also be a place of unrelenting action, ranging from soarsleds speeding between the towertops to confrontations in the dungeon depths far beneath the city's lowest tier. Fallen angels, sinister shapeshifters, and monstrous mercenaries do battle with heroes from all walks of life, while unscrupulous collectors and smugglers carry on a brisk trade in artifacts brought back from the cyclopean ruins of Xen'drik. All these factors make Sharn an equally ideal location for adventures inspired by pulp action.": "沙恩也可以是一个充满无情行动的地方，从塔顶之间的飙车到城市最底层的地牢深处的对峙。堕落的天使、阴险的变形金刚和畸形的雇佣兵与来自各行各业的英雄进行战斗，而无良的收藏家和走私者则在从Xen'drik的环形废墟带回的文物上进行着活跃的交易。所有这些因素使沙恩成为一个同样理想的冒险地点，其灵感来自纸浆行动。",

	"Work with the players to develop the connections that each character has to the site. If the location is a tavern, for instance, a bard character might perform there two nights a week. A fighter could be a regular who has a drink named after them. A ranger could be the undefeated champion of the local darts league. If the players enjoy this creative exercise, you could also allow each player to add a physical detail to the place or to describe one of the location's NPCs—the stuffed gorgon head over the hearth, another regular among the customers, and so on. This is a way to make this location truly feel like home, and to give each player a personal investment in it. This location becomes an automatic starting point for adventures, the place where the adventurers will meet with patrons and conduct business.": "与玩家合作，发展每个角色与该地点的联系。例如，如果该地点是一个酒馆，一个吟游诗人角色可能每周有两个晚上在那里表演。一个战士可能是一个常客，他的饮料以他的名字命名。一个游侠可以是当地飞镖联盟的不败冠军。如果玩家喜欢这种创造性的练习，你还可以让每个玩家为这个地方添加一个物理细节，或者描述这个地方的一个NPC--壁炉上的毛绒高竿头，顾客中的另一个常客，等等。这是一种使这个地点真正有家的感觉的方法，并使每个玩家对它有个人投资。这个地方自动成为冒险的起点，是冒险家们与顾客见面和开展业务的地方。",

You can expand on an entry to make it the start of an encounter or adventure, though not every event needs to draw the characters into a longer story. Each table is meant to be used on a different level of Sharn: the lower wards, middle wards, upper wards, and Skyway. You can choose results from the tables, or randomly determine what happens, and you can modify results as you please, tailoring the details of an event to be a better fit for a particular district.

In addition, the characters could meet with a Boromar Clan or House Tarkanan patron in Sharn heights.": "沙恩历险记》的高度是纸浆动作场面的最佳选择。狭窄的桥梁、移动的平台和巨大的高度汇集在一个公共场所，它是一个完美的地点，可以进行挥霍性的战斗、紧张的人质谈判和超常的抢劫。沙恩高地历险表提供了你的角色可能需要访问这样一个地点的理由。此外，角色们还可以在沙恩高地与波洛玛家族或塔卡南家族的赞助人会面。",
	"Pose as House Tarkanan operatives to capture a wanted criminal with an aberrant dragonmark. The criminal is waiting on a bridge for his House Tarkanan escort to arrive.": "冒充Tarkanan家族的特工，抓捕一名拥有反常龙纹的通缉犯。该罪犯正在桥上等待塔卡南家族的护卫队到来。",
	"Obtain a satchel of evidence obtained by a goblin who has infiltrated Daask. The goblin, who is working with the Boromar Clan or the Sharn Watch to take down key Daask operatives, is waiting on a bridge.": "获得一个由潜入达斯克的地精获得的证据书包。这个地精与博洛玛家族或沙恩观察站合作，拿下达斯克的关键人物，他在一座桥上等着。",

	"Crime is part of everyday life in Sharn, and just as in any other city, sometimes such acts are carried out by people who have no ties to organized crime. An upstanding citizen could be driven to murder by passion. A refugee could become a cutpurse out of desperation. The rowdy Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don't think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any larger organization.": "在沙恩，犯罪是日常生活的一部分，就像在其他城市一样，有时这种行为是由与有组织犯罪没有关系的人实施的。一个正直的公民可能被激情所驱使而去杀人。一个难民可能会因为绝望而成为一个砍刀手。那些自称 \"布罗肯布里奇斗士\"（Brokenbridge Brawlers）的布雷利什老兵们不认为自己是罪犯，他们与任何大型组织都没有联系。",
	"Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.": "然而，在沙恩，任何职业罪犯都可能隶属于四个组织之一。波罗玛家族是四个组织中最根深蒂固和最广泛的，几个世纪以来一直主宰着沙恩的犯罪事业。被称为达斯克（Daask）的组织正在崛起，直接挑战波洛玛家族。暴君（Tyrants）和塔卡南（House Tarkanan）是规模较小的组织，有更专业的运作领域。这些组织在 \"沙恩的犯罪组织 \"表中进行了总结，并在后面的章节中进行了描述。",
	"Each of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of secondary relationships.": "这些组织中的每一个都有一个由其领导人直接控制的核心人员和企业。但每个组织也有一个次要的关系网络。",
	"For example, the Little Fingers are a group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. They aren't directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of criminals throughout the city.": "例如，\"小手指 \"是一群在中杜拉的集市上工作的扒手和小偷。他们与波洛玛家族没有直接联系。但是，该团伙的主人向波洛玛家族支付什一税，如果波洛玛家族向他们传话说要避开某些目标，小手指就会这样做。作为回报，Boromars家族确保中杜拉的沙恩守望者基本上不干涉小手指。因此，尽管波罗马氏族本身只有几百名成员，但它与整个城市的数千名罪犯有互动。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|ERLW|8} provides an overview of the four major criminal organizations and a body of information about them that's more or less common knowledge in Sharn. This section explores the roles that each one could play in a Sharn-based campaign.": "{@book Chapter 3|ERLW|8}提供了四个主要犯罪组织的概况，以及关于他们的信息，这些信息在沙恩或多或少都是常识。本节探讨了每个组织在基于沙恩的战役中可能发挥的作用。",

	"{@b Dragon's Blood}. Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a {@spell fireball} in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.": "{@b Dragon's Blood}. 龙血是由达斯克引入沙恩的，是一种强效的、高度成瘾的兴奋剂。除了诱发欣快感外，它还能增强施法能力，甚至暂时赋予使用者施展巫师法术的能力。这种药物的效果有潜在的危险性，而且总是无法预测。这不是一个玩家角色应该想使用的东西；冒险家们更有可能去干扰达斯克的走私者，或者去对付一个在拥挤的街道上不小心施展了（%1%）的瘾君子。龙血的具体效果由你决定，但你可以从{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB}表中获得灵感。",
	"{@b Dreamlily}. A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly.": "{@b Dreamlily}. 一种精神活性液体，闻起来和尝起来都像你最喜欢的饮料，梦百合的精华是一种萨隆的鸦片制剂。在最后一次战争期间，它首次被进口以帮助控制疼痛，现在它是沙恩最常被滥用的物质。虽然梦百合如果用于医疗目的并不违法，但它被征收重税，因此大多数梦百合被走私到黑市上出售。梦百合的窝点可以在下层病房中找到。吸食梦百合会导致迷失方向的兴奋感，并带来对疼痛的显著抵抗。受梦百合影响的生物在1小时内会有{@condition poisoned}。当（%2%）这种方式时，该生物对恐惧免疫，并且在它第一次下降到0命中率而不被彻底杀死时，它反而下降到1命中率。一剂Dreamlily的价格约为1戈比，如果通过合法渠道购买，则高达10倍。然而，这种药物有很多种类，持续时间或价格可能会相应地变化。",

	"The most powerful criminal organization in Sharn started as a family of halfling immigrants from the Talenta Plains. Operating out of its headquarters and key holdings in the Little Plains district of Middle Menthis, the Boromar Clan controls gambling, smuggling, and theft in Sharn.

	"The Boromars' influence extends beyond criminal enterprises into many legitimate circles of power. Ilyra Boromar sits on the city council, and a number of other councilors are close allies of the clan. The family has ties by marriage to House Jorasco. A Boromar attends every Skyway party. The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.": "波洛玛家族的影响力超出了犯罪企业的范围，延伸到许多合法的权力圈。伊里拉-波罗马是市议会的成员，其他一些议员也是该家族的亲密盟友。该家族与乔拉斯科家族有联姻关系。每一个天威派对都有一个博罗玛人参加。该家族在整个沙恩拥有房产，并投资于航运业，将合法货物和违禁品都储存在普雷森斯和科格斯门的许多仓库中。在许多地区，地方官员和沙恩守望官员世代都在接受波洛玛家族的贿赂。",
	"The criminal nature of the Boromar Clan is an open secret, and in some districts the Boromars are seen as hometown heroes. They are immigrants who've made good, common people who've risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it's untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don't prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it's not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.": "波洛马氏族的犯罪性质是一个公开的秘密，在一些地区，波洛马氏族被视为家乡的英雄。他们是做好事的移民，是上升到与男爵和国王匹敌的普通人。他们给人们提供他们想要的东西，无论是不征税的赌博、廉价的烈酒，还是梦幻般的。该部族的活动在一定程度上不受惩罚，因为它的特工人员遵守一个潜规则：只要有可能，针对个人的犯罪行为应该针对游客和旅行者。Boromar扒手并不以他们每天看到的人为目标。相反，他们寻找的是那些一直在城市里活动的许多陌生人。因此，对扒手视而不见的观察官觉得自己有理，因为受害的不是沙恩的市民。",
	"Boromar's longstanding status at the head of Sharn's criminal enterprises has recently come under challenge.

Boromar specializes in three fields of activity: gambling, smuggling, and thievery.": "波洛马氏族与沙恩的各种犯罪行为都有牵连。大多数Boromar家族的领导人鄙视不必要的暴力，但该家族有许多执法者和少数有能力的刺客。该部族的勒索网是如此彻底地交织在社会中，以至于许多居民仅仅认为这是另一种形式的税收。博罗玛擅长三个领域的活动：赌博、走私和偷窃。",
	"Gambling isn't illegal in Sharn, but all legal games are taxed by the Brelish crown and are required to follow regulations that spoil the experience for many. Boromar's operations are cheaper to participate in and offer the lure of greater profits.": "赌博在沙恩并不违法，但所有合法的游戏都由布雷利什王室征税，并需要遵守相关规定，这让很多人的体验大打折扣。Boromar的业务参与起来比较便宜，并提供更大的利润诱惑。",

Under Boranel's law, it's forbidden to sell Aundairian wine in Breland, so if you want the good stuff, you'll need to work with the Boromars.": "自从上次战争扰乱了许多传统的贸易路线后，走私已成为一项日益重要的业务。该部族的主要进口产品是一种被称为梦百合的麻醉品。但博罗玛人贩运的货物范围很广，从奥术和炼金武器到因禁运和制裁而变得稀缺的外国奢侈品。根据Boranel的法律，禁止在Breland销售Aundairian葡萄酒，所以如果你想要好东西，你需要和Boromars合作。",
	"Boromar-sanctioned acts of thievery include the activities of the ubiquitous pickpockets that can be found across the city as well as the well-planned jobs of professional burglars. As mentioned earlier, Boromar thieves focus their attention on visitors to Sharn, thus avoiding friction with local law enforcement. When appropriate, stolen goods are transported out of the city by the fences and porters that drive the clan's smuggling operations.": "Boromar认可的偷窃行为包括城市中无处不在的扒手的活动，以及职业窃贼的精心策划的工作。如前所述，波罗马盗贼的注意力集中在来到沙恩的游客身上，从而避免了与当地执法部门的摩擦。在适当的时候，赃物会由推动该部族走私活动的栅栏和搬运工运出城外。",

	"Councilor Ilyra Boromar is the eldest daughter of Mala and Saidan and a member of the city council.

The Boromars claim they had nothing to do with it, but some Sharn Watch members use the incident as an excuse to go after the organization.": "一位受人爱戴的Sharn Watch队长公开反对Boromar部族，他失踪了。波罗玛人声称他们与此无关，但一些沙恩守望的成员利用这一事件作为借口，对该组织下手。",

	"Formed by monstrous immigrants from Droaam, Daask has been building its power in the Khyber's Gate and Malleon's Gate districts of Sharn for the last decade. It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn't paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon's blood.": "Daask由来自Droaam的畸形移民组成，在过去的十年中一直在沙恩的Khyber's Gate和Malleon's Gate地区建立自己的势力。它最臭名昭著的是它的畸形执法者，但该组织也从沙恩的贫困人口中吸纳成员--主要是地精和变身者，但也包括人类、矮人，以及任何其他觉得现行制度让他们失望的类人。达斯克通过暴力行动赚钱，从抢劫到武装抢劫，再到彻底的掠夺。近年来，该组织已经多样化，建立了一个敲诈勒索团伙--如果不支付贡品就威胁使用暴力，并进入了毒品贸易，出售梦幻花和一种叫做龙血的神秘物质。",
	"From the outside, Daask appears to be interested solely in fomenting violence and chaos. The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren't merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.": "从外面看，达斯克似乎只对煽动暴力和混乱感兴趣。其成员的怪异性质强化了这种印象；大多数人认为达斯克的成员是野蛮的野兽。事实要复杂得多。组成Daask核心的卓尔人不仅仅是罪犯；他们是卓尔的精英士兵，为索拉-卡特拉工作，是在整个霍尔韦尔较大城市扎根的行动的一部分。达斯克看似随意的攻击是一个更大的计划的一部分，如果它成功了，最终将使索拉-卡特拉在霍尔韦尔的中心地带有一个立足点。",
	"Over the last two years, the Daask cell in Sharn has been waging a slowly escalating war against the holdings of the Boromar Clan. The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf. Though the Boromars still control much of criminal activity in the middle and upper parts of Sharn, Daask is gaining ground in the lower level of the city and controls crime in the Cogs.": "在过去的两年里，沙恩的达斯克细胞一直在对波洛玛尔部族的持有地发动缓慢升级的战争。波罗玛人对这些攻击的暴力感到惊讶，并遭受了重大损失。达斯克更倾向于采用游击战术，只使用必要的战斗人员来完成任务，从不在一个地方停留太久，并迅速退回到他们的地盘。虽然波罗马人仍然控制着沙恩中上层的大部分犯罪活动，但达斯克在城市下层的地位越来越高，并控制着科格区的犯罪。",
	"Violence and intimidation are Daask's most used tools. Rather than using bribery, Daask manipulates the Sharn Watch through displays of force and brutal reprisals against officers who dare to stand in the way. Coupled with the fact that Daask primarily targets businesses with ties to the Boromars, this means that many of the Watch officers of the lower wards will step aside and allow a Daask raid to run its course.": "暴力和恐吓是达斯克最常用的工具。达斯克不使用贿赂，而是通过展示武力和对敢于阻挠的官员进行残酷的报复来操纵沙恩守望。再加上达斯克的目标主要是与波洛玛人有联系的企业，这意味着许多下层区的守望官员会靠边站，让达斯克的突袭行动顺利进行。",
	"As Daask has seized territory from the Boromar Clan, it has also begun taking over a few of the clan's traditional businesses. In addition to dreamlily, Daask sells a highly addictive drug called dragon's blood.": "随着Daask从Boromar部族手中夺取领土，它也开始接管该部族的一些传统业务。除了梦兰，达斯克还销售一种叫做龙血的高成瘾性药物。",
	"Daask has another, perhaps surprising area of operation: religion. The organization has brought priests of the Dark Six to Sharn and has restored a ruined temple to the Dark Six in Khyber's Gate. Followers of the Dark Six have few other opportunities to practice their faith, and providing this new facility for them has made many allies for Daask across the city.": "达斯克还有一个也许令人惊讶的行动领域：宗教。该组织将黑暗六神的牧师带到了沙恩，并在开伯尔之门修复了一座破败的黑暗六神庙。黑暗六神的追随者很少有其他机会来实践他们的信仰，而为他们提供这个新的设施使达斯克在整个城市中结成了许多盟友。",
	"Daask's lower ranks are made up of goblinoids, humans, shifters, and other humanoids recruited from the population of Sharn. The Droaamish soldiers that make up the core of the organization include changelings, gnolls, harpies, ogres, minotaurs, medusas, trolls, and other monstrous beings. Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, and similar monsters are kept by Daask, though these creatures are usually used only within the Cogs.": "达斯克的下层人员由地精、人类、变种人和其他从沙恩人口中招募的人形生物组成。构成该组织核心的德罗阿米什（Droaamish）士兵包括变种人、地精、哈皮人、食人魔、牛头人、梅杜莎人、巨魔和其他畸形生物。Basilisks, cockatrices, death dogs, displacer beasts, 和类似的怪物由Daask饲养，尽管这些生物通常只在Cogs内部使用。",

	"Daask members congregate in safe houses that are hard to find and easy to defend or escape from. The most popular gathering location is a Cog hub. The dark, twisting halls of these underworld hot spots are familiar to Daask members and confusing to their enemies.

Daask also uses Cog hubs to stash bodies, drugs, or prisoners.": "达斯克成员聚集在安全屋中，这些安全屋很难找到，而且容易防守或逃离。最受欢迎的聚集地点是Cog中心。这些地下世界热点的黑暗、扭曲的大厅对达斯克成员来说是熟悉的，而对他们的敌人来说则是混乱的。科格中心的狭窄通道有很多堵塞点，迫使一对一的对抗，在这种情况下，达斯克的强大怪物往往具有优势。达斯克还利用 \"齿轮中心 \"来藏匿尸体、毒品或囚犯。",
	"Trying to find a Daask hub in the Cogs is an adventure in itself. Most members are understandably tight-lipped about the location of their meeting and hiding places.

	"The Cog hub shown in map 4.13 could be a Daask location, or it could be any Sharn underworld location you need it to be. Several crafted and natural labyrinthine passages no more than 10 feet wide lead to the main chamber.

	"These passages converge into a single large chamber that can hold a large group for meetings and serve as a temporary safe house or a place to stash contraband. When criminals occupy the area, at least one guard is always on duty, and typically there is one guard at every entrance to the chamber.": "这些通道汇聚成一个大密室，可以容纳一大群人开会，也可以作为临时安全屋或藏匿违禁品的地方。当犯罪分子占据该区域时，至少有一名警卫一直在值班，通常在密室的每个入口都有一名警卫。",

	"On the surface, Daask appear to be nothing more complicated than a gang of violent monsters wreaking havoc in the worst parts of the city. If you want, this can be the only role they play in a campaign: a ready source of sudden violence. Low-level characters might work with the Sharn Watch or the Boromar Clan to curtail Daask muggings and raid dreamlily houses. This crusade against Daask will escalate as the adventurers become more powerful; Daask will unleash ever more powerful monsters, and its forces might start targeting the adventurer's allies and loved ones. Those attacks won't end until the adventurers delve deep into the Cogs and defeat Cavallah herself.": "从表面上看，达斯克似乎没有什么更复杂的东西，只是一帮暴力的怪物在城市最糟糕的地方肆意破坏。如果你愿意，这可能是他们在战役中扮演的唯一角色：一个随时可能发生的暴力源头。低级别的角色可能会与沙恩守望者或博洛玛氏族合作，遏制达斯克的抢劫行为，并突击检查梦幻之屋。这种对达斯克的讨伐会随着冒险者变得更加强大而升级；达斯克会释放出更加强大的怪物，它的力量可能开始针对冒险者的盟友和亲人。这些攻击不会结束，直到冒险家们深入到科加斯，打败卡瓦拉本人。",
	"Monsters are infiltrating our city! Though the Sharn Watch acts as though Daask is a problem only for Malleon's Gate, and not a threat to law-abiding citizens, there is clear cunning in the criminal cabal's actions.

Once these monsters control the city's crime, what will they do next?": "怪物们正在渗透到我们的城市中! 尽管沙恩守望者表现得好像达斯克只是马利翁之门的问题，而不是对守法公民的威胁，但犯罪集团的行动显然是狡猾的。他们最近的攻击目标是整个下层区的财产，都是某个半身人家族的，就好像达斯克试图暴力接管沙恩的地下世界一样。一旦这些怪物控制了城市的犯罪，他们接下来会做什么？",
	"Another option is to delve deeper into the motives of Daask, to explore the idea that these monsters aren't as savage as they appear. The elite members of Daask are spies, soldiers, and saboteurs using their criminal activities as a cover for their true agenda. What is Sora Katra really trying to accomplish in Sharn? This question ties to how you decide to use the Daughters of Sora Kell, described earlier in this chapter. Do the Daughters simply want to ravage their enemies? Or, guided by the oracular visions of Sora Teraza, are they actually working toward some greater good? For instance, Daask agents could break into the vaults and workshops of dragonmarked houses and discover secret projects forbidden by the Treaty of Thronehold. They could clash with spies of foreign powers in Sharn, or pursue ancient artifacts in the ruins below the city to keep them out of others' hands.": "另一个选择是深入研究Daask的动机，探讨这些怪物并不像他们看起来那么野蛮。达斯克的精英成员是间谍、士兵和破坏者，用他们的犯罪活动作为他们真正议程的掩护。索拉-卡特拉在沙恩真正想要实现的是什么？这个问题与你决定如何使用索拉-凯尔的女儿们有关，本章前面已经描述过。女儿们是否只是想蹂躏他们的敌人？或者，在索拉-泰拉扎的神谕指引下，她们实际上是在为一些更大的利益而努力？例如，达斯克的特工可以闯入有龙纹的房子的金库和车间，发现《王权条约》所禁止的秘密项目。他们可以与沙恩的外国势力的间谍发生冲突，或者在城市下面的废墟中追寻古代文物，不让它们落入他人之手。",
	"Dreamlily is relatively safe; dragon's blood is not. Its effects are intentionally unpredictable, and you can take this idea wherever you like. Could drinking dragon's blood cause someone to develop a dragonmark? Could it turn addicts into crazed, draconic creatures? Is Daask simply selling it to make money, or is the drug's introduction part of a grander plan? Neither the Boromar Clan or the dragonmarked houses have been able to learn anything important about dragon's blood.": "梦百合是相对安全的；龙血则不是。它的影响是故意不可预测的，你可以把这个想法带到你喜欢的地方。喝龙血会不会导致某人出现龙纹？它能不能把上瘾者变成疯狂的龙族生物？达斯克只是为了赚钱而出售它，还是该药物的引入是一个更宏大的计划的一部分？无论是博罗玛家族还是有龙纹的家族，都没能了解到关于龙血的任何重要信息。",

	"Long ago, the dragonmarked houses sought to exterminate the bearers of {@book aberrant dragonmarks|ERLW|2|Aberrant Dragonmarks}. Today, those who carry aberrant dragonmarks are still treated with fear and suspicion. During the Last War, the King's Dark Lanterns of Breland trained a team of covert operatives who all bore aberrant marks. Considered expendable, this group was sent on one suicide mission after another. After half its members died in the field, the survivors turned on their masters. Six years ago, they fled to Sharn and founded House Tarkanan.

	"The smallest of the four criminal organizations described here, House Tarkanan has no interest in claiming territory or dominating the criminal underworld. The house takes neither side in the war between the Boromar Clan and Daask, and it will not assassinate high-ranking members of either organization. In other matters, it sells its services to all who have the gold to pay for them. House Tarkanan's top priority is using its wealth to protect, train, and care for people who have aberrant marks. The leaders of the house are pragmatists and soldiers, and they train their recruits to be warriors and thieves.": "塔卡南家族是这里描述的四个犯罪组织中最小的一个，它对争夺领土或支配黑社会犯罪没有兴趣。该组织在波洛玛家族和达斯克之间的战争中不站队，也不会刺杀任何一个组织的高级成员。在其他方面，它向所有有金币支付的人出售其服务。塔卡南家族的首要任务是利用其财富来保护、训练和照顾那些拥有反常标记的人。该家族的领导人是实用主义者和士兵，他们将新兵训练成战士和盗贼。",
	"Despite its name, House Tarkanan is not a dragonmarked house; it has taken the name to mock its enemies, and it doesn't have the recognition, power, or resources of a dragonmarked house. In fact, many members of House Tarkanan hate the dragonmarked houses for being prejudiced against their kind and fear that they will instigate a second purge of aberrant marks. Others are more idealistic, and see the growing power of the houses as a threat to all of the nations of Khorvaire.": "尽管它的名字，Tarkanan家族并不是一个龙纹家族；它取这个名字是为了嘲笑它的敌人，而且它没有龙纹家族的认可、权力或资源。事实上，Tarkanan家族的许多成员憎恨龙纹家族，因为他们对自己的同类有偏见，并担心他们会煽动第二次对反常的龙纹进行清洗。另一些人则更加理想化，他们认为龙印家族不断增长的力量对霍尔韦尔的所有国家都是一种威胁。",
	"House Tarkanan provides two basic services to clients: theft and murder. Fees for jobs are based on the task's complexity and riskiness; a simple cutpurse contract costs far less than the assassination of a Sharn Watch captain in Skyway.": "塔卡南家族为客户提供两项基本服务：偷窃和谋杀。工作的费用基于任务的复杂性和风险性；一份简单的割礼合同的费用远远低于在天路刺杀一名沙恩守望者队长。",

Conversely, anyone with enough gold can hire House Tarkanan's assassins, but they take jobs only within Sharn.": "塔卡南家族的刺客与皮亚伦家族和瑟兰尼家族的刺客不同之处在于他们的可及性。有龙纹的家族只把他们的服务卖给特定的有钱有势的客户，而且他们可以在霍尔韦尔的任何地方追求合同。相反，任何有足够金币的人都可以雇佣塔卡南家族的刺客，但他们只在沙恩境内接活。",

	"To use House Tarkanan as a recurring villain, you can stress its ruthlessness and emphasize its hatred of the dragonmarked houses. If any of the adventurers have ties to one of the houses, this confrontation could begin with a number of small attacks against the adventurer or their friends. Over time, these actions could escalate. In addition, you could build a story around Thora Tarkanan's quest to discover the secrets of aberrant dragonmarks. Long ago, Halas Tarkanan and the Lady of the Plague possessed marks so powerful that they could destroy cities. Can Thora find a way to amplify her own power in the ruins of Old Sharn?": "要把塔卡南家族作为一个反复出现的反派，你可以强调它的无情，强调它对龙纹家族的仇恨。如果任何一个冒险者与其中一个家族有联系，这种对抗可以从对冒险者或他们的朋友的一些小攻击开始。随着时间的推移，这些行动可能会升级。此外，你可以围绕索拉-塔卡南探索反常龙印的秘密建立一个故事。很久以前，哈拉斯-塔卡南和瘟疫之女拥有强大的印记，它们可以摧毁城市。索拉能在旧沙恩的废墟中找到放大自己力量的方法吗？",

	"No criminal guild in Sharn is more shrouded in mystery than the Tyrants. This organization of changelings deals in secrets and lies, selling forgeries, running long cons, and treating identities as a commodity. The Tyrants have spies throughout the city, even in places where they have no current plans or contracts. The organization gathers as many secrets as possible, then sells that information to the highest bidder, uses it for blackmail, or stores it for a time when it becomes useful.": "在沙恩，没有哪个犯罪团伙比 \"暴君 \"更加神秘了。这个由变种人组成的组织以秘密和谎言为交易对象，出售赝品，进行长期欺骗，并将身份视为商品。暴君们的间谍遍布整个城市，甚至在他们目前没有计划或合同的地方也有间谍。该组织收集尽可能多的秘密，然后将这些信息卖给出价最高的人，用于敲诈，或将其储存起来，等待有用之时。",
	"The Tyrants have been operating in Sharn for over three hundred years from a base of operations in the Dragoneyes district, in Lower Tavick's Landing. They have agents spread across the city.

	"The Tyrants are master grifters, conducting a host of short and long cons throughout the city. Much like the Boromar Clan, they have a general live-and-let-live relationship with the Sharn Watch. As long as the Tyrants focus their crimes on foreigners and tourists—and donate generously to the local Watch—the officers will look the other way. In addition to pursuing their own schemes for gold, Tyrant charlatans offer a host of services to their clients; they can help to frame innocents for crimes, or make it possible for a criminal to seem to be in two places at once, providing an ironclad alibi.": "暴君们是行骗高手，在整个城市里进行着大量的短线和长线骗局。与博洛玛家族一样，他们与沙恩守望相安无事。只要暴君们把他们的罪行集中在外国人和游客身上，并且慷慨地捐赠给当地的守望者，官员们就会睁一只眼闭一只眼。除了追求自己的黄金计划外，暴君骗子还为他们的客户提供大量的服务；他们可以帮助诬陷无辜者犯罪，或者让罪犯看起来同时出现在两个地方，提供一个铁的不在场证明。",

	"The primary theme of the Tyrants is mystery. In dealing with the Tyrants, there is always a question of what is real and what the true objective actually is. With the Tyrants, anything could be a long con, and both allies and enemies may not be who they appear to be.": "暴君》的主要主题是神秘。在与暴君打交道时，总是有一个问题，即什么是真实的，真正的目标到底是什么。对暴君来说，任何事情都可能是一个漫长的骗局，盟友和敌人都可能不是他们表面上的样子。",
	"The Tyrants have three objectives: acquiring gold, gathering secrets, and protecting the changelings of Sharn. In working the Tyrants into a campaign, the first question is which of these objectives will take precedence.

Or are they most concerned with helping other changelings, who are often with the objects of fear and suspicion?": "暴君们有三个目标：获取黄金、收集秘密和保护沙恩的变种人。在战役中使用暴君的时候，第一个问题是这些目标中的哪一个将被优先考虑。他们是否主要是行贿者，试图尽可能多地榨取利润？他们是否主要致力于收集秘密，并利用这些秘密来操纵他人？或者他们最关心的是帮助其他变化者，而这些变化者往往是与恐惧和猜疑的对象？",
	"The Tyrants offer an easy way to provide adventurers with information. The Spider can be a strong ally for adventurers, and you can always arrange for an agent of the Tyrants to step out of the shadows with and offer to sell a secret.": "暴君们提供了一个向冒险者提供信息的简单方法。蜘蛛可以成为冒险者的强大盟友，你可以随时安排暴君的代理人走出阴影，并提出出售一个秘密。",
	"The Tyrants could also have a long-term sinister agenda—something they've been working on for generations, which is only coming to fruition now.

	"A common viewpoint among the citizens of Sharn is that in the upper wards, the Sharn Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they're just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.": "沙恩市民的一个普遍观点是，在上层区，沙恩守望为富人服务；在中层区，它为波罗马家族服务；而在下层区，它根本不工作。这种评估已经很接近事实了。然而，在这种情况下，有一股重要的暗流。虽然大多数守望先锋的官员都收受贿赂，但这并不意味着他们所有人都不关心自己的城市，不会努力维护社区的安全；他们这样做是因为他们认为他们的恩人是社区持续健康发展的重要组成部分。例如，那些从Boromar氏族那里拿金子的官员认为，Boromar氏族帮助维持城市的运行，给人们提供他们想要的东西。但是，如果城里的一些陌生人违反了法律，他们只是麻烦制造者，应该被撞死。",
	"As another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.": "再比如，杜拉巴扎的守卫与被称为小指头的扒手团伙达成了共识。只要这些小偷只针对游客和外国人，守卫就会驳回对他们提出的任何指控。为什么沙恩观察站的官员要关心某个金币多于理智的昂达尔人是否被抢劫了？但是，如果小指头们找本地人的麻烦，他们就会自找麻烦。这种关系是双向的；扒手们知道一些守望官员不知道的事情，而且他们经常警告守望官员他们所看到的可疑人物或活动。",
	"Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.": "确实存在着一些完全不择手段、对法律漠不关心的观察人员。在另一个极端，有些官员是完全光荣的，他们把法律置于一切之上，其中大多数人愿意冒着生命危险，从横冲直撞的达斯克巨魔手中拯救无辜的旁观者。但大多数守望者成员都是实用主义者，他们把客户的需求放在首位，把公民的需求放在第二位，一般不会对当地人采取行动。",
	"The upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick's Landing, or Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch's reponse is typically very slow.": "这一切的结果是，根据犯罪性质和犯罪地点的不同，守望先锋对犯罪的反应会有很大不同。通常，当犯罪发生在Skyway、任何一个上层或中层区、下层中央区、下层Tavick's Landing或Precarious时，守望先锋成员会尽快赶到现场进行干预和调查。在Cliffside、Lower Menthis和Lower Northedge，这些地方的少数守望者按照优先顺序处理犯罪。在下杜拉和科格斯，守望先锋的反应通常非常缓慢。",
	"The discussion above primarily concerns the rank and file of the Sharn Watch, the guards who walk the streets day in and day out and the officers who supervise them. The Watch also includes a few special divisions that could cross the paths of the adventurers.": "上面的讨论主要是关于沙恩守望的官兵，那些日复一日走在街上的卫兵和监督他们的军官。守夜人还包括一些可能与冒险者擦肩而过的特殊部门。",
	"{@b The Blackened Book} is an elite core of abjurers and diviners, charged with investigating and containing magical threats. These wizards are highly dedicated to their work and their city, and generally don't take bribes. It's up to the higher-ups, however, to decide what missions to assign to the Blackened Book; if there's a case that a noble doesn't want investigated, it probably won't be.": "{@b The Blackened Book}是一个精英核心的驱魔师和占卜师，负责调查和遏制魔法威胁。这些巫师对他们的工作和他们的城市高度敬业，而且一般不接受贿赂。不过，要由上级来决定分配给黑化书的任务；如果有一个贵族不希望调查的案件，可能就不会被调查。",
	"{@b The Guardians of the Gate} came into being during the Last War to monitor the activities of foreign nationals and immigrants. Their duties have expanded since the surge of refugees into Sharn following the Mourning, and the Guardians of the Gate closely supervise the district of High Walls. The Guardians are chosen from among the best soldiers of the Watch and are devoted to their city. Many of them, however, place the safety of the city ahead of strict adherence to the law, and complaints are raised against them from time to time for unnecessary violence against refugees.": "{@b The Guardians of the Gate}是在最后一次战争期间成立的，目的是监督外国国民和移民的活动。他们的职责在哀悼之后难民涌入沙恩之后有所扩大，大门的守护者密切监督着高墙区的情况。守护者是从守望先锋的优秀士兵中挑选出来的，他们对自己的城市充满热情。然而，他们中的许多人将城市的安全置于严格遵守法律之上，并不时对他们对难民的不必要的暴力提出投诉。",
	"{@b The Redcloak Battalion} is an exceptional unit of soldiers that is called upon if a situation calls for extreme military force. The Redcloaks are heroes of the Last War, and now that the fighting is over most of them don't appreciate being used as local police. The Redcloaks are absolutely faithful to Breland: they are willing to lay down their lives in the service of their nation. Trying to bribe a Redcloak is a good way to lose a hand. Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the interests of the Boromar Clan. The Redcloak Battalion is described in more detail in {@book chapter 3|ERLW|8|The Redcloak Battalion}.": "{@b The Redcloak Battalion}是一支特殊的士兵部队，在需要极端军事力量的情况下被调用。红斗篷人是最后一次战争的英雄，现在战斗结束了，他们中的大多数人并不欣赏被当作地方警察使用。红环党人对布雷兰绝对忠诚：他们愿意为国家服务而牺牲自己的生命。试图贿赂红十字会的人是失去一只手的好办法。然而，和黑化书一样，红斗篷人是精英部队，只有在被守望者队长召集时才会行动；通常情况下，如果不符合博洛玛氏族的利益，他们不会被要求应对某种情况。红斗篷营在{@book chapter 3|ERLW|8|The Redcloak Battalion}中有更详细的描述。",
	"The Sharn Watch includes people from all walks of life: veterans of the Last War, retired adventurers, lifelong residents of the city, and immigrants who have become Brelish citizens. You can select from or roll on the Sharn Watch Races and Sharn Watch Personalities tables to generate a Watch NPC. There is a {@chance 75|75 percent} chance the NPC is taking bribes from the Boromar Clan or another wealthy patron. This doesn't necessarily mean that the officer is willing to take a bribe from one of the adventurers.": "沙恩守望包括各行各业的人：最后战争的老兵，退休的冒险家，城市的终身居民，以及已经成为布莱里什公民的移民。你可以从沙恩守望的种族和沙恩守望的性格表中选择或滚动来生成一个守望NPC。该NPC有{@chance 75|75 percent}的机会接受Boromar家族或其他富有的赞助人的贿赂。这并不一定意味着该官员愿意接受某个冒险者的贿赂。",
	"Brelish folk often forget that the Guardians of the Gate have a civilian branch that handles administrative issues and special customs investigations. Tethyn Olar has led that arm of the Sharn Watch for more than a decade.": "布雷利什人经常忘记，大门的守护者有一个民事部门，负责处理行政问题和特殊的海关调查。泰恩-奥拉领导沙恩守望的这一部门已经超过十年了。",
	"Many immigrants owe their safe and comfortable lives in our city to this man, but claims have surfaced recently charging him with corruption, saying that he took money from immigrants in exchange for a faster path into Sharn. Olar has refuted those claims with this statement: \"Look at the lower wards to see the vast number of poor immigrants the Gate allows to enter in the city. Those with wealth tend to be more responsible and quicker to put their paperwork together, but none with worthy cause to be here are barred.\"": "许多移民把他们在我们城市的安全和舒适的生活归功于这个人，但最近出现了指控他腐败的说法，说他从移民那里拿钱来换取进入沙恩的更快途径。奥拉尔用这个声明驳斥了这些说法。\"看看下面的病房就知道，城门允许进入的贫穷移民数量庞大。那些有财富的人往往更负责任，更快地把他们的文件放在一起，但没有一个有价值的理由在这里被禁止。\"",

	"Commander Belew Yorgan is a male dwarf who leads the Sword Point garrison in Middle Central. He does his best to serve the interests of the nobles and wealthy patrons in the Central Plateau, and as a result these wards are among the safest in Sharn. But Yorgan's loyalties are first and foremost to his purse, and the troops under his command serve whoever's paying the most.": "指挥官Belew Yorgan是一个男性矮人，他领导着中原地区的剑尖驻军。他尽力为中央高原的贵族和富有的赞助人的利益服务，因此，这些区是沙恩最安全的地方之一。但约根的忠诚度首先是对他的钱包，他手下的部队为谁付钱多就为谁服务。",
	"Commander Silaena Cazal is a female elf who runs the Warden Towers garrison in Middle Menthis. Over a century of service, she has woven a net of graft and extortion across Menthis Plateau; she looks after those who pay their dues.

Because of that treatment, Silaena harbors deep resentment for the dragonmarked houses and will occasionally take actions to inconvenience them. Thora Tavin of House Tarkanan is working to strengthen her relationship with Commander Cazal.": "Silaena Cazal指挥官是一名女精灵，负责管理中Menthis的Warden Towers驻军。在一个多世纪的服务中，她在整个Menthis高原编织了一张贪污和敲诈的网；她照顾那些支付了会费的人。她的母亲在长出异常的龙纹时被赶出了Phiarlan家族。因为这种待遇，Silaena对有龙纹的家族怀有深深的怨恨，偶尔会采取一些行动给他们带来不便。塔卡南家族的索拉-塔文正在努力加强她与卡扎尔指挥官的关系。",
	"Commander Iyanna ir'Talan is a female human who commands the Black Arch garrison in Lower Tavick's Landing. The daughter of the Lord Commander, Iyanna is idealistic and honorable. She fights for the good of the common people. If the adventurers need an honest ally in the Watch, Iyanna is perhaps their best hope. Despite her father's best efforts to keep her from getting entangled in the criminal underworld, her actions have won her no friends among Sharn's crime lords, and her life could be in danger despite her parentage.": "指挥官Iyanna ir'Talan是一名女性人类，指挥下塔维克城的黑拱门驻军。作为司令官大人的女儿，伊扬娜是个理想主义者，也是个可敬的人。她为普通人的利益而战。如果冒险家们在守夜人中需要一个诚实的盟友，伊扬娜也许是他们最好的希望。尽管她的父亲竭力不让她卷入黑社会犯罪，但她的行为在沙恩的犯罪集团中没有赢得任何朋友，尽管她有父母之命，但她的生命可能会受到威胁。",

Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component).

	"{@b Khyber dragonshards} are found deep in the earth, often near layers of magma. These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.": "{@b Khyber dragonshards}是在地球深处发现的，通常在岩浆层附近。这些晶体通常生长在洞壁上，迷信的说法是它们在有大量恶魔活动的地区盛行。开伯尔龙石是深蓝色或深紫色的，带有闪亮的脉络。开伯尔龙纹石对束缚魔法有一种亲和力。元素束缚--这是在飞艇、闪电轨道和元素大帆船的背后--需要开伯尔龙纹石来固定元素。Khyber碎片用于法器、平面束缚以及其他困住或操纵精神的效果。开伯尔龙碎片也可用于亡灵仪式。",

Dimensional seals are usually found in the Eldeen Reaches and the Shadow Marches—reminders of the conflict between the Gatekeepers and the daelkyr. The techniques used to create these seals have been long lost. It's said that as a whole, the dimensional seals keep the daelkyr bound in Khyber and prevent Xoriat from becoming coterminous with Eberron.

The adventure ideas and encounter tables in chapter 4 offer abundant examples of monsters behaving in ways that aren't traditionally monstrous.": "请记住，Eberron中很少有智慧生物是天生邪恶的。即使是龙，在其他世界中也是与某些结盟相关的，它们会选择自己的道路。第4章中的冒险想法和遭遇表提供了大量的例子，说明怪物的行为方式并不是传统意义上的怪兽。",
	"The daelkyr are the lords of madness and the emissaries of Xoriat, who invaded Eberron with a host of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul aberrations.

	"The goblinoid champions of Dhakaan fought fiercely. But in the end, it was the orc Gatekeeper druids who closed the portals to Xoriat and drove the daelkyr into Khyber. The Gatekeepers crafted seals to hold both the power of Xoriat and the daelkyr at bay, and as long as those seals remain intact, the lords of madness can't rise from the depths. Today, those seals are thousands of years old and the Gatekeepers are all but forgotten.

	"The daelkyr have lairs within Khyber, but these are no mere caverns. Each daelkyr's domain is a demiplane reflecting the twisted vision of its master. These realms are connected to the surface by tunnels and chasms, but they defy conventional geography.

Adventurers can potentially cross great distances quickly by passing through a daelkyr's domain.": "daelkyr在开伯尔有巢穴，但这些巢穴不是单纯的洞穴。每个daelkyr的领地都是一个半位面，反映了其主人的扭曲的视野。这些领域通过隧道和裂缝与地表相连，但它们违背了传统的地理学。通往{@creature Belashyrra|ERLW}之域的通道可以在阴影地带找到，但隧道也将其境界与Xen'drik连接起来。冒险家们可以通过daelkyr的领域迅速跨越遥远的距离。",
	"The daelkyr are utterly alien, and their physical forms can't be fully perceived by mortals. Viewers perceive the same general impression of a daelkyr, but the details vary in ways that can't be controlled.

	"Player characters might manifest connections to the daelkyr in many ways. The Great Old One warlock patron is an excellent match to {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} or {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}, but other classes can just as easily reflect a connection to this darkness.

	"When a character has a tie to a daelkyr, consider whether that tie was chosen or thrust upon them. Is the character a cultist who embraces their dark path, believing that a world transformed by the daelkyr will be a better place? Or is the character a victim of the daelkyr, consumed by the fear of what they might become?": "当一个角色与达尔凯尔有联系时，要考虑这种联系是选择的还是强加给他们的。这个角色是一个拥抱黑暗道路的邪教徒，相信一个被达尔凯尔改变的世界将是一个更好的地方？或者，这个角色是daelkyr的受害者，被他们可能成为的恐惧所吞噬？",
	"The touch of the daelkyr might be purely mental, or it might be accompanied by a physical transformation. A barbarian touched by {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} might serve as an eye of the All-Seer but remain physically unchanged, even as a barbarian tied to {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} takes on aberrant features while raging. When a warlock character gains the Devil's Sight invocation, they might literally gain the fiery red eyes of a devil.": "daelkyr的触摸可能是纯粹的精神上的，也可能伴随着身体的转变。一个被{@creature Belashyrra|ERLW}触动的野蛮人可能会成为全能者的眼睛，但身体却没有变化，甚至一个被{@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}触动的野蛮人在狂怒时也会出现反常的特征。当一个术士角色获得恶魔之眼的召唤时，他们可能真的会获得恶魔的火红色眼睛。",

	"Today, beholders are solitary, egocentric creatures. Some have remained among the daelkyr and dolgaunts (presented later in this chapter), while others have accumulated their own followings among the Cults of the Dragon Below.

A beholder philosopher might manipulate events in a humanoid city not to gain power or wealth, but to stimulate and then study a particular social or economic situation.": "今天，持咒者是孤独的、以自我为中心的生物。一些人留在了daelkyr和dolgaunts中（本章后面会介绍），而另一些人则在下面的龙教中积累了自己的信徒。少数人放弃了侵略的道路，而选择了孤独的哲学和思考。一个哲学家可能会操纵一个人形城市的事件，不是为了获得权力或财富，而是为了刺激，然后研究一个特定的社会或经济状况。",
	"The daelkyr {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} the Corruptor enhanced the latent psychic abilities of changelings to develop doppelgangers, while implanting a desire to cause chaos in the communities around them.—even when there's no benefit in it for the doppelganger.

	"Many people believe that shifters are descended from lycanthropes, but shifter druids often assert the opposite—that the abilities of the shifters are a gift from Eberron or Lamannia, but the gift was corrupted by the daelkyr to create the curse of lycanthropy.": "许多人认为变身者是狼人的后裔，但变身者德鲁伊经常断言，变身者的能力是来自Eberron或Lamannia的礼物，但这种礼物被daelkyr腐蚀，造成了狼人的诅咒。",
	"Whatever the origin of lycanthropy, in the ninth century YK, the power of the curse surged dramatically, and all lycanthropes were drawn toward evil.

Most mind flayers on Eberron dwell in Khyber with their daelkyr masters, commanding cities of dolgaunts and dolgrims.

	"Of all the anomalies that emerged from the magical cataclysm that created the Mournland, the appearance of living spells might be the most mysterious.
