	"From the beginning, I've approached all these Plane Shift projects as if I were tinkering in a workshop like the inventors of Kaladesh. I believe that some of the great beauty of Dungeons & Dragons comes from its tremendous flexibility, which includes not just the ability to make stuff up out of whole cloth, but also the ease with which you can take the existing pieces of the game apart and reassemble them into something new.": "从一开始，我就像对待卡拉兹的发明者一样，在工作室里修修补补，处理所有这些 \"空间转移 \"项目。我相信《龙与地下城》的巨大魅力来自于其巨大的灵活性，这不仅包括无中生有的能力，还包括你可以轻松地将游戏的现有部分拆开，重新组装成新的东西。",
	"That approach of combining pieces of different rules to form new rules continues for Kaladesh. As one of the designers of the artificer class for Eberron back in 2003, I tinkered for a long time with possible designs for such a class in Kaladesh, but I ultimately came to a couple of important conclusions. First, invention on Kaladesh is fundamentally democratic—it's a skill anyone can learn, and it shouldn't be restricted to a single character class. And more importantly, designing an entirely new class is far beyond the scope of what I've set out to do in these articles.": "这种将不同规则的碎片组合成新规则的方法在卡拉什继续使用。作为2003年为Eberron设计工匠类的设计师之一，我为Kaladesh的工匠类设计了很长时间，但我最终得出了几个重要的结论。首先，Kaladesh上的发明从根本上来说是民主的--它是任何人都可以学习的技能，而且它不应该被限制在一个单一的角色类别中。更重要的是，设计一个全新的等级远远超出了我在这些文章中所设定的范围。",
	"The D&D team works like the Consulate: they take a serious approach to the job of crafting a class, testing it for balance, sharing it for public playtest, and finetuning it before final publication. I'm more like a renegade inventor (having left the D&D team for the Magic team a couple of years ago), fiddling around in my workshop and unleashing my inventions on the public without the same degree of safety testing. But with that said, the D&D team has just released an artificer class for playtesting, and you should feel free to tinker with that class to adapt it for your Kaladesh campaign.": "D&D团队的工作方式就像领事馆一样：他们以严肃的态度来制作一个等级，测试它的平衡性，分享给公众进行游戏测试，并在最终出版前对其进行微调。我更像是一个叛逆的发明家（几年前离开D&D团队去了魔法团队），在我的工作室里摆弄着我的发明，没有经过同样程度的安全测试就向公众发布。不过话说回来，D&D团队刚刚发布了一个用于游戏测试的工匠类，你可以随意修改该类，使其适合你的卡拉什活动。",
	"Of course, you'll find a lot of information about aether-powered devices and invention in this document, in keeping with the spirit of Kaladesh. But it's more along the lines of rearranging the building blocks and altering the appearance of existing magic items, rather than creating a lot of new things. If you want your character to look like the guy on the Dispersal Technician card, just give him a {@item ring of the ram}.": "当然，在这份文件中你会发现很多关于乙太动力装置和发明的信息，这与卡拉德什的精神是一致的。但这更多的是沿着重新排列构件和改变现有魔法物品的外观的思路，而不是创造大量的新东西。如果你想让你的角色看起来像驱散技师卡上的那个人，只要给他一个{@item ring of the ram}。",
	"As always, the starting point for this document was The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Kaladesh. This document is designed to help you turn that book's adventure hooks and story seeds into a resource for your campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition of the D&D rules, which you can find here. And even without the book, you can find lore about Kaladesh on the Magic web site.": "一如既往，本文档的出发点是《魔法的艺术：集会--卡拉德什》。本文档旨在帮助你将该书的冒险钩子和故事种子转化为你的战役资源，只需对第五版D&D规则做最少的修改，你可以在这里找到。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于Kaladesh的传说。",
	"Happy inventing!": "快乐的发明!",
	"Kaladesh is a living work of art—a vibrant, beautiful plane where anything is possible. Optimism, innovation, and the spirit of creativity fuel an intoxicating renaissance of invention and artifice across Kaladesh. Its inhabitants frequently assert that \"anything can be built,\" and brilliant inventors seem to prove that saying every day.": "卡拉德是一件活生生的艺术品--一个充满活力的、美丽的平面，在这里一切皆有可能。乐观主义、创新和创造精神为整个卡拉德斯的发明和创造带来了令人陶醉的复兴。这里的居民经常断言 \"任何东西都可以建造\"，而杰出的发明家们似乎每天都在证明这句话。",
	"Clockwork automatons walk the streets, acting as servants and bodyguards, soldiers and sentries, mounts, and even pets. Soaring airships provide transport both within and between the cities and villages of the plane, and carry prospectors high into the sky to draw on limitless reserves of magical aether. Intricate and ornate whirling thopters flit over marketplaces, carrying messages, gathering information, and driving away gremlin infestations. Elegant interlocking gear mechanisms raise and lower bridges over canals. Exquisite tools gleam like jewelry, incorporated into the bright and colorful fashions of artisans, prospectors, and inventors alike. In all these fabulous constructions, intricate design and graceful beauty are prized almost as much as efficient function. The artifice that produces these works is viewed as the ultimate form of creative and intellectual expression—both stemming from and further feeding the inventive spirit of the plane.": "发条自动机走在街上，充当仆人和保镖、士兵和哨兵、坐骑，甚至是宠物。翱翔的飞艇为飞机上的城市和村庄提供内部和之间的运输，并将勘探者带到高空，以获取无限的魔法乙醚储备。复杂而华丽的旋翼飞机在市场上飞来飞去，传递信息，收集信息，并驱赶小精灵的侵扰。优雅的联锁齿轮装置在运河上升起和放下桥梁。精致的工具像珠宝一样闪闪发光，被纳入工匠、勘探者和发明家们明亮而多彩的时装中。在所有这些神话般的建筑中，复杂的设计和优雅的美感几乎与有效的功能一样受到重视。创作这些作品的工匠被视为创造性和智力表达的最终形式--既源于飞机的发明精神，又进一步滋养了飞机的发明精神。",
	"Kaladesh is bright and hopeful, and its people are inspired. Every invention is an astonishing work of art, holding the potential to dramatically improve quality of life. The natural world mirrors the beauty and harmony of the plane's cities, with gracefully curving trees, eddying streams, sculpted mountains, and sapphire skies punctuated with brilliant blue streams of aether.": "卡拉德什是光明的、充满希望的，它的人民也受到鼓舞。每一项发明都是惊人的艺术作品，都有可能极大地提高生活质量。自然界反映了这个星球城市的美丽与和谐，有优雅的树木、蜿蜒的溪流、雕刻的山峰，以及蓝宝石般的天空和灿烂的蓝色乙太流的点缀。",
	"Kaladesh owes its bright existence to the tangible presence of aether—a raw form of magical energy that fills the space between planes. Aether seeps into Kaladesh, and has become a critical part of the environment as well as the foundation of contemporary civilization. The skies are full of it, the plants and trees bend and twist to be closer to it, and flowing waterways trace patterns beneath it. The ingenious inventor Avaati Vya developed a way to refine volatile aether into a potent and safe fuel, a process that has made all the inventions and contrivances of society possible. For six decades, Kaladesh's greatest minds have been devising ever more wondrous ways to put aether to use. From airships to animal-like constructs, from cogwork trains to musical artifacts, from medical devices to full-body mechanized suits, the creative possibilities are endless.": "卡拉德斯的光明存在归功于乙太的有形存在--一种充斥在各位面之间的原始形式的魔法能量。乙太渗入Kaladesh，成为环境的重要组成部分，也是当代文明的基础。天空中充满了它，植物和树木为了接近它而弯曲和扭曲，流动的水路在它的下面描画着图案。聪明的发明家Avaati Vya开发了一种方法，将挥发性的乙醚提炼成一种强大而安全的燃料，这一过程使社会的所有发明和装置成为可能。六十年来，卡拉迪斯最伟大的思想家们一直在设计更多奇妙的方法来使用乙太。从飞艇到动物模型，从齿轮火车到音乐工艺品，从医疗设备到全身机械化服，创造的可能性是无穷的。",
	"The city of Ghirapur and the towns and villages of the surrounding region are like an enormous, precise cogwork machine, managed and supported by the Consulate. The eleven consuls and countless bureaucrats who make up the Consulate maintain the order of society and ensure that all its interlocking cogs turn in harmony. An important part of this work, of course, is facilitating the sanctioned distribution of aether and maintaining the aether-powered infrastructure that undergirds civilized life on Kaladesh. The Consulate believes that the wonders and conveniences of an aether-based society should be accessible to all. Thus, the consuls hold that the process of obtaining and distributing aether, as well as the construction and sale of aether-based inventions, must be standardized and regulated.": "吉拉普尔市和周边地区的城镇和村庄就像一台巨大的、精确的齿轮工作机器，由领事馆管理和支持。组成领事馆的11名领事和无数的官僚维持着社会秩序，并确保其所有连锁的齿轮和谐地转动。当然，这项工作的一个重要部分是促进乙醚的合法分配，并维持乙醚驱动的基础设施，以支撑卡拉德斯的文明生活。执政官认为，一个以乙太为基础的社会的奇迹和便利应该让所有人都能享受到。因此，执政官们认为，获取和分配乙醚的过程，以及基于乙醚的发明的建造和销售，必须标准化和规范化。",
	"The Consulate employs hundreds of theorists and engineers to design machines, devices, and infrastructure. True innovations are valued and rewarded. But the value of any invention is tempered by the need to make the conveniences of an aether-driven society available to all citizens. Thus, efficient construction is more important than any artistic expression of individuality, so that inventions can be mass-produced in Consulate foundries and made widely available.": "领事馆雇用了数百名理论家和工程师来设计机器、设备和基础设施。真正的创新是受到重视和奖励的。但是，任何发明的价值都会受到使所有公民都能享受到乙太驱动的社会的便利的需要的制约。因此，有效的建设比任何艺术性的个性表达更重要，这样，发明可以在领事馆的铸造厂里大规模生产，并广泛使用。",
	"Standing to various degrees in opposition to the Consulate is a disparate group of inventors, tinkers, thieves, and artists collectively designated as \"renegades.\" By portraying the renegades as a monolithic entity resembling a criminal gang, the Consulate tries to sway public opinion against them. But in reality, the so-called renegades have a wide range of goals and motivations, different methods, and varying degrees of disdain or loathing for the Consulate. The only thing all renegades share is a record of some past subversive activity viewed as criminal action under Consulate law. This \"subversion,\" though, is often as innocuous as bypassing the strict regulations governing invention and the distribution of aether.": "在不同程度上与领事馆对立的是一个由发明家、工匠、小偷和艺术家组成的不同群体，他们被统称为 \"叛徒\"。通过将叛逆者描绘成一个类似犯罪团伙的整体，领事馆试图动摇公众对他们的看法。但实际上，所谓的叛徒有广泛的目标和动机，不同的方法，以及对领事馆不同程度的蔑视或厌恶。所有叛徒唯一的共同点是，过去有一些颠覆活动的记录，根据领事馆的法律被视为犯罪行为。不过，这种 \"颠覆 \"往往是无害的，就像绕过管理发明和分配乙醚的严格规定一样。",
	"Depending on the theme and flavor of your campaign, player characters might be associated with either the Consulate or the renegades, or they might be independent of both. A character's background can be a good indication of where his or her loyalties might lie.": "根据你活动的主题和风味，玩家角色可能与领事馆或叛徒有关，或者他们可能独立于两者。一个角色的背景可以很好地表明他或她的忠诚度可能在哪里。",
	"Because religion is not part of everyday life on Kaladesh, this {@background acolyte||background} is not well suited for a Kaladesh campaign.": "因为宗教不是卡拉德斯日常生活的一部分，所以这个（%0%）不太适合卡拉德斯战役。",
	"Almost by definition, a {@background charlatan||character} who lives by deception is treated as a renegade by the Consulate, whether the character associates with other renegades or not.": "几乎根据定义，靠欺骗生活的{@background charlatan||character}被领事馆视为叛徒，无论该人物是否与其他叛徒有联系。",
	"Criminals of any stripe are considered renegades under Consulate law. Some characters with this {@background criminal||background} will be considered criminals as a result of being a renegade (associated with anti-Consulate agitators). Others will be considered renegades by default despite their criminal interests having nothing to do with renegade activity. A character with this background could also be a Consulate spy, perhaps working to infiltrate a renegade group.": "根据领事馆法律，任何类型的罪犯都被视为叛徒。一些有这种情况的人物（%0%）将被视为罪犯，因为他们是叛徒（与反领事馆的煽动者有关）。其他人则会被默认为叛徒，尽管他们的犯罪利益与叛徒活动毫无关系。有这种背景的人物也可能是领事馆的间谍，也许是为了渗透到一个叛逆团体中去。",
	"{@background entertainer||Entertainers} have no necessary leanings one way or the other. Popular entertainers on Kaladesh include quicksmiths—who engage in competitions to invent and build devices at a breakneck pace—and racers of wheeled or flying vehicles.": "{@background entertainer||Entertainers}没有必要倾向于某一方面。卡拉德什上受欢迎的艺人包括流星锤（quicksmiths）--他们参与竞赛，以极快的速度发明和建造设备--以及轮式或飞行器的赛车手。",
	"A {@background folk hero||folk hero} on Kaladesh is probably a renegade, viewed as heroic because of opposition to some particularly oppressive Consulate policy or decree.": "卡拉德什上的{@background folk hero||folk hero}可能是一个叛徒，因为反对某些特别压迫性的领事馆政策或法令而被视为英雄。",
	"A character with this {@background guild artisan||background} is probably a career inventor. A guild artisan might be employed in a Consulate inquirium or be a member of an inventor society—many of which have Consulate loyalty or renegade leanings.": "具有这种能力的人物（%0%）可能是一个职业发明家。一个公会的工匠可能受雇于一个领事馆的调查室，或者是一个发明家协会的成员--其中许多人都有领事馆的忠诚或叛逆的倾向。",
	"The best reason to become a hermit is to escape from Consulate restrictions, particularly those concerning aether harvesting and refinement. Thus, a character with this {@background hermit||background} is probably a renegade.": "成为隐士的最好理由是逃避领事馆的限制，特别是那些关于乙太收获和提炼的限制。因此，拥有这个（%0%）的角色很可能是个叛徒。",
	"This {@background noble||background} best represents a bureaucrat associated with the Consulate. However, such a character could easily use his or her position to secretly aid the renegade cause.": "这（%0%）最能代表与领事馆有关的官僚。然而，这样的人物可以很容易地利用他或她的地位来暗中帮助叛逆者的事业。",
	"The hinterlands beyond Ghirapur harbor both pro- and anti-Consulate sympathies. But a {@background outlander||character} from far enough away might have no opinion of the Consulate simply from lack of real knowledge.": "吉拉普尔以外的腹地既有支持领事馆的，也有反对领事馆的。但从足够远的地方来的{@background outlander||character}可能仅仅因为缺乏真正的知识而对领事馆没有看法。",
	"A {@background sage||sage} character is more likely to be associated with a Consulate inquirium than to be self-employed. Some sages are associated with the Aetherological Society, which is fiercely independent from Consulate control but not opposed to Consulate rule.": "一个{@background sage||sage}的人物更有可能与领事馆的调查委员会有联系，而不是自营职业。一些圣人与太阴学会有联系，该学会激烈地独立于领事馆的控制，但不反对领事馆的统治。",
	"The harbor district of Ghirapur, called Bomat, is home to a number of traditional sailors. This {@background sailor||background} might also reflect the life of a skyship pilot—or a pirate of the air. Many pilots are loyal to the Consulate, and some even serve as officers on Consulate vessels. Pirates include both unlicensed aether harvesters and true pirates who steal from other airships.": "吉拉普尔的港口区被称为博马特，是一些传统水手的家。这{@background sailor||background}可能也反映了天船飞行员的生活--或空中海盗的生活。许多飞行员忠于领事馆，有些甚至在领事馆的船上担任官员。海盗既包括无证的乙醚收割者，也包括从其他飞艇上偷窃的真正海盗。",
	"Most characters with this {@background soldier||background} are connected to the Honorable—the military watch of Ghirapur—and are thus closely tied to the Consulate.": "大多数拥有这个（%0%）的人物都与 \"荣誉\"--吉拉普尔的军事观察有关，因此与领事馆关系密切。",
	"Most {@background urchin||urchins} have no close ties to the Consulate, and life on the streets leads easily to renegade activity such as aether smuggling or petty theft.": "大多数人（0%）与领事馆没有密切联系，街头生活很容易导致叛逆活动，如乙醚走私或小偷小摸。",
	"Invention and artifice are the cornerstones of life and culture on Kaladesh. Inventors are significant cultural figures, from the {@condition invisible} functionaries creating the conveniences of civilized life in the Consulate's foundries, to the renowned free artisans who attract groups of admirers when they walk the streets of Ghirapur. Societies of inventors and artisans are a key social unit, uniting people who share similar interests, and providing the basis for social interaction and the exchange of ideas.": "发明和工匠是卡拉德斯生活和文化的基石。发明家是重要的文化人物，从在领事馆的铸造厂创造文明生活便利的(%0)职能人员，到走在吉拉普尔大街上吸引一群崇拜者的著名自由工匠。发明家和工匠协会是一个重要的社会单位，它将有类似兴趣的人联合起来，并为社会互动和思想交流提供基础。",
	"Mages who can cast actual spells—without the assistance of aether-powered devices—are a rarity on Kaladesh. Under the Consulate's rule, mages have always been regarded as dangerous and unstable, to the point that a special Consulate force is tasked with protecting the world from them. Led by Inspector-General Baral, this force seeks mages out, learns their secrets, disrupts their plans, and brings them to justice for their crimes—whether actual or potential.": "在卡拉德什，能够真正施展法术的法师--不借助于乙太驱动的设备--在卡拉德什是非常罕见的。在领事馆的统治下，法师一直被认为是危险和不稳定的，以至于有一支特别的领事馆部队负责保护世界免受他们的影响。在巴拉尔总督察的领导下，这支部队寻找法师，了解他们的秘密，破坏他们的计划，并将他们的罪行--无论是实际的还是潜在的--绳之以法。",
	"Because actual spellcasting ability is rare on Kaladesh, you might wish to restrict the classes available to characters in your campaign. At the same time, though, you should feel free to alter or ignore these restrictions to suit your players and your particular vision of Kaladesh.": "由于卡拉德什的实际法术能力很稀少，你可能希望限制活动中的角色所能使用的等级。但与此同时，你也可以根据你的玩家和你对卡拉德的特殊看法，自由地改变或忽略这些限制。",
	"{@class barbarian||Barbarians} might be found in the outland regions, beyond even Peema and Lathnu. Such characters would likely seem out of place in Ghirapur—but that can be an excellent opportunity for character development. An elf barbarian (probably a member of the Tirahar, who forsake the aether-based technology of the city folk) might be a particularly appropriate choice. The Path of the Berserker is an easier fit in Kaladesh than the Path of the Totem Warrior.": "{@class barbarian||Barbarians}可能会在外围地区被发现，甚至超出了皮马和拉斯努。这样的角色很可能在吉拉普尔显得格格不入--但这可能是一个发展角色的绝佳机会。一个精灵野蛮人（可能是Tirahar的成员，他们放弃了城市居民的基于乙太的技术）可能是一个特别合适的选择。与图腾战士之路相比，狂战士之路更容易适合卡拉德什。",
	"{@class bard||Bards} on Kaladesh would probably be seen as a particular form of mage, akin to a pyromancer. As such, they would be subject to the persecution of the Consulate.": "{@class bard||Bards}在卡拉迪斯可能会被视为一种特殊形式的法师，类似于火法师。因此，他们会受到领事馆的迫害。",
	"{@class cleric||Clerics} do not exist on Kaladesh. {@skill Religion} is not a significant force in the lives of the plane's people, and magic derived from the power of the gods is unknown.": "{@class cleric||Clerics}在卡拉迪斯不存在。{@skill Religion}在这个星球上的人们的生活中不是一个重要的力量，来自于神力的魔法是未知的。",
	"{@class druid||Druids} are elves who harness the power of the Great Conduit to create magical effects. Non-elves can't be druids, and the Circle of the Moon is not available.": "{@class druid||Druids}是精灵，他们利用大导管的力量来创造魔法效果。非精灵不能成为德鲁伊，月亮之环也不能使用。",
	"{@class fighter||Fighters} are common on Kaladesh, though eldritch knights are unknown. Fighters might be Consulate enforcers, renegade skirmishers, or ordinary (if hardy) citizens.": "{@class fighter||Fighters}在卡拉德什上很常见，但长老骑士不为人知。战斗人员可能是领事馆的执法者、叛逆的小兵或普通（如果是坚韧的）公民。",
	"{@class monk||Monks} are unknown on Kaladesh, unless you want to create a monastic order found in one of the remote regions of the plane.": "{@class monk||Monks}在卡拉德斯是不存在的，除非你想创建一个在飞机的某个偏远地区发现的僧侣团。",
	"{@class paladin||Paladins} are unknown for the same reasons as clerics. It might be possible for a warrior to derive magical power from the strength of devotion to an oath, but such a character would probably be viewed as a mage.": "{@class paladin||Paladins}是未知的，原因与牧师相同。战士有可能从对誓言的虔诚度中获得魔力，但这样的人物可能会被视为法师。",
	"{@class ranger||Rangers}, like druids, must be {@race elf||elves} on Kaladesh.": "{@class ranger||Rangers}，如德鲁伊，在卡拉什上必须是{@race elf||elves}。",
	"{@class rogue||Rogues} are common, but arcane tricksters would be viewed and persecuted as mages. Most rogues are renegades, in the sense that they live on the wrong side of the law for a wide variety of reasons.": "{@class rogue||Rogues}是很常见的，但奥术师会被视为法师并受到迫害。大多数流氓都是叛徒，在这个意义上，他们因为各种各样的原因生活在法律的错误一边。",
	"{@class sorcerer||Sorcerers} are the most common form of mage on Kaladesh, and are frequently hunted down by Consulate forces. They are familiar enough that many people will have an inkling of what a \"{@class sorcerer||pyromancer|pyromancer (PSK)|PSK}\" is when they encounter one—but are still rare enough that most people greet a sorcerer with fear. Sorcerers don't claim draconic bloodlines, but wild mages and storm sorcerers exist. A pyromancer like Chandra Nalaar could have a distinct sorcerous origin.": "{@class sorcerer||Sorcerers}是卡拉德斯最常见的法师形式，并且经常被领事馆的人追杀。他们非常熟悉，以至于很多人在遇到\"{@class sorcerer||pyromancer|pyromancer (PSK)|PSK} \"的时候都会有所了解，但他们仍然非常罕见，以至于大多数人都对巫师抱有恐惧。巫师们并不宣称有龙族血统，但野生法师和风暴巫师是存在的。像钱德拉-纳拉尔这样的火法师可能有明显的巫师血统。",
	"{@class warlock||Warlocks}, if they exist, are not widely known or understood. A warlock could begin as an inventor fascinated by the Dark Schematic—the pattern used to create demons—eventually leading to a pact with the Fiend. Pacts with other entities would be even more unusual. However, Kaladesh's proximity to the aether-filled Blind Eternities might allow some alien consciousness akin to the Eldrazi to project into the world and form warlock pacts. Moreover, the Great Conduit could itself be personified as a being with the traits of an archfey.": "{@class warlock||Warlocks}，如果它们存在的话，也没有被广泛了解或理解。一个术士开始时可能是一个发明家，他对黑暗图式很着迷--用来创造恶魔的图式--最终导致与恶魔的契约。与其他实体的契约就更不寻常了。然而，卡拉德什靠近充满乙太的 \"盲目的永恒\"，可能会让一些类似于埃尔德拉兹的外星意识投射到这个世界并形成术士契约。此外，大导管本身也可以化身为具有大帝特质的存在。",
	"{@class wizard||Wizards} are extremely rare on Kaladesh. However, a vedalken aether scientist might gain sufficient mastery over aether's flow to channel it into spell effects.": "{@class wizard||Wizards}在卡拉什上极为罕见。不过，维达肯的乙太科学家可能会获得对乙太流动的充分掌握，将其转化为法术效果。",
	"The citizens of the Consulate enjoy what is perhaps the most exciting and inspiring period in Kaladesh's history. In the sixty years since Avaati Vya discovered the process of aether refinement, aether has transformed virtually all day-to-day activities and reshaped the way people think about their lives. Over the course of the last half century, hundreds of thousands of new devices, machines, vehicles, constructs, and even weapons have sprung from the minds of talented inventors—all powered by the wonders of aether.": "领事馆的公民享受着也许是卡拉什历史上最激动人心的时期。自Avaati Vya发现乙太提炼过程以来的60年里，乙太几乎改变了所有的日常活动，重塑了人们对生活的思考方式。在过去的半个世纪里，成千上万的新设备、机器、车辆、建筑，甚至武器都从天才发明家的头脑中涌现出来--所有这些都是由乙太的奇迹驱动的。",
	"The tremendous variety of aether-powered devices on Kaladesh can be represented by many of the magic items in the Dungeon Master's Guide. These items are far more common on Kaladesh than they are in most D&D worlds, and are readily available for purchase (see \"Buying and Selling Devices\"). A DM should feel free to be generous in allowing characters access to magic items, in the spirit of Kaladesh.": "卡拉德上种类繁多的乙太动力装置可以用《地下城主指南》中的许多魔法物品来表示。这些物品在卡拉德斯比在大多数D&D世界中要常见得多，而且很容易买到（见 \"买卖设备\"）。根据卡拉德什的精神，DM可以自由地允许角色获得魔法物品。",
	"The following guidelines—plus a healthy dash of inventor's ingenuity—can be used to adapt D&D magic items to the world of Kaladesh. Additionally, the captions that appear beside some of the art in this document offer examples of how you might translate Kaladesh's aether-powered wonders into the magic items of D&D.": "下面的准则--加上发明家的聪明才智--可以用来将D&D的魔法物品改编到卡拉德什世界。此外，本文件中一些艺术作品旁边的说明提供了如何将卡拉德什的乙太动力奇迹转化为D&D魔法物品的例子。",
	"Magic item charges represent aether fuel in Kaladesh, but charges do not replenish automatically. Instead, an item's owner must secure aether and refill the item to replenish its charges. As long as normal aether supplies are available, refilling an item is no problem—and a major principle of the Consulate is ensuring that aether is fairly distributed among its citizens. In the case of an item that normally regains a random number of charges automatically, that random roll can represent the amount of aether that is available to a character on a particular day. A character can purchase additional aether (at a night market, perhaps) at a cost of 50 gp per charge. If an item's charges don't replenish automatically, the item can't be refueled.": "在卡拉兹，魔法物品的充能代表乙太燃料，但充能不会自动补充。相反，物品的拥有者必须获得乙太并重新填充物品以补充其费用。只要有正常的乙醚供应，补充物品是没有问题的--领事馆的一个主要原则是确保乙醚在其公民中公平分配。如果一个物品通常会自动恢复一个随机数的电荷，那么这个随机数可以代表一个角色在某一天可用的乙醚数量。角色可以购买额外的乙醚（也许是在夜市），每次充电的费用为50戈比。如果一个物品的电荷不能自动补充，那么这个物品就不能被加油了。",
	"Some aether-powered devices are designed to create one-time short-term effects that duplicate the effects of potions, scrolls, and similar magic items. These don't take the form of actual elixirs or spells on paper, but they have the same effect.": "一些以乙醚为动力的设备被设计用来创造一次性的短期效果，复制药水、卷轴和类似魔法物品的效果。这些并不采取实际的灵药或纸上咒语的形式，但它们具有相同的效果。",
	"The process of attuning to an aether-powered device represents a few different aspects of working with the invention. Many devices must be carefully modified to fit and function for a particular user, which can be accomplished as part of the attunement process. The limitation on the number of A {@item spell scroll} of sleep might take the form of a fumigating device attached to a thopter. Fumigate Svetlin Velinov items a character can attune to reflect the basic supplies of aether that are available to and transportable by a single character. Items that require attunement by a cleric, paladin, or other class that does not exist in your campaign have no aether-powered equivalent.": "与乙太动力装置相适应的过程代表了与本发明合作的几个不同方面。许多设备必须仔细修改，以适合特定的用户并发挥其功能，这可以作为调谐过程的一部分来完成。对睡眠的A{@item spell scroll}数量的限制可能采取的形式是将熏蒸装置连接到一个thopter上。熏蒸斯维特林-维利诺夫的物品，一个角色可以调整，以反映一个角色可以使用和运输的乙太的基本供应。需要由牧师、圣骑士或其他在你的战役中不存在的阶级来调整的物品，没有以乙太为动力的对应物。",
	"Items that allow travel to different planes of existence have no aether-powered equivalents. In the Magic Multiverse, travel from world to world is the exclusive province of Planeswalkers.": "允许旅行到不同存在平面的物品，没有以乙太为动力的对应物。在魔法多元宇宙中，从一个世界到另一个世界的旅行是行者的专属领域。",

	"Cursed items that appear in your campaign could be malfunctioning inventions. It's also possible that a character who intends to make a particular item might make a cursed version of that item instead, but such a thing should be extremely rare.": "在你的活动中出现的被诅咒的物品可能是发生故障的发明。也有可能一个打算制造某种特定物品的角色会制造出该物品的诅咒版本，但这样的事情应该极为罕见。",
	"Sentient magic items can't be created with the use of aether.": "有生命的魔法物品不能用乙醚来创造。",
	"Aether-powered devices are created by inventors. Some are mass-produced in Consulate foundries, but all spring from the minds of creative, ingenious thinkers. Player characters can invent and manufacture their own devices using the rules for crafting magic items in chapter 6 of the Dungeon Master's Guide, with a few modifications to the requirements.": "乙太动力设备是由发明家创造的。有些是在领事馆的铸造厂里大量生产的，但所有的都是来自于有创造力的、聪明的思想家的头脑。玩家角色可以使用《地下城主指南》第6章中的魔法物品制作规则来发明和制造自己的设备，并对要求进行一些修改。",
	"Crafting a known kind of device requires a schematic plan (the equivalent of a formula for crafting a magic item). The crafter need not be a spellcaster, but must have an ample supply of refined aether, which is included in the cost of crafting the item. If crafting the equivalent magic item would require an expensive material component, that cost represents additional aether that must be purchased to make the device.": "制作一种已知的装置需要一个计划书（相当于制作魔法物品的公式）。制作者不需要是施法者，但必须有充足的精炼乙太供应，这包括在制作物品的成本中。如果制作同等的魔法物品需要昂贵的材料成分，该成本代表必须购买额外的乙醚来制作该装置。",
	"If a character does not possess a schematic plan, it is possible to invent one. A character who is inventing a device rather than following a schematic must make a successful Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check each day of crafting. The difficulty of the check is determined by the rarity of the item: {@dc 10} for a common or uncommon item, {@dc 15} for a rare or very rare item, or {@dc 20} for a legendary item. On a failed check, the character still spends the 25 gp for that day's work, but that day does not count toward completing the item.": "如果一个角色不拥有一个示意图，那么就有可能发明一个。一个正在发明设备而不是按照示意图的角色必须在制作的每一天进行一次成功的智力（（%0%））检查。检查的难度是由物品的稀有程度决定的。普通或不普通的物品为{@dc 10}，稀有或非常稀有的物品为{@dc 15}，或传奇物品为{@dc 20}。如果检查失败，人物仍然要为当天的工作花费25GP，但当天不计入完成物品的费用。",
	"If a group of characters is working together to invent an item, each character who is contributing can attempt the Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. If any character succeeds, the group makes progress toward inventing and completing the item. {@item Wings of flying} in various forms are popular inventions. Aspiring Aeronaut Willian Murai": "如果一组角色一起工作来发明一个物品，每个有贡献的角色都可以尝试智力（（%0%））检查。如果任何一个角色成功了，这个小组就会在发明和完成该物品方面取得进展。各种形式的{@item Wings of flying}是流行的发明。有抱负的飞行员Willian Murai",
	"On Kaladesh, aether-powered devices are available for sale on the open market. Some devices are mass-produced in Consulate foundries, carefully tested for safety and functionality, and sold at prices ordinary citizens can afford. Others are crafted by renegade inventors who bypass the Consulate regulations and sell their devices in night markets or back alleys.": "在卡拉德什，乙太驱动的设备可以在公开市场上出售。有些设备是由领事馆的铸造厂大量生产的，经过严格的安全和功能测试，并以普通人能够承受的价格出售。另一些是由叛逆的发明家制作的，他们绕过领事馆的规定，在夜市或小巷里出售他们的设备。",
	"The DM decides whether a particular item is mass-produced and legally available for purchase. As a rule, weapons and other destructive items fail to pass Consulate safety regulations. A device purchased in a legal market costs 70 to 120 percent ({@dice 1d6 + 6} × 10 percent) of the cost to create the device. (Mass production allows many devices to be manufactured at significant savings.) An illegal device costs 150 to 200 percent ({@dice 1d6 + 14} × 10 percent) of that cost.": "管理部决定一个特定的项目是否是大规模生产的，并且可以合法地购买。一般来说，武器和其他破坏性物品无法通过领事馆的安全规定。在合法市场上购买的装置的成本是制造该装置成本的70%到120%（{@dice 1d6 + 6} × 10%）。(大规模生产使许多设备的制造成本大大降低）。一个非法设备的成本是该成本的150%至200%（(1%) × 10%）。",
	"A character who invents and manufactures a device can sell the item for 150–200 percent of the creation cost. It might also be possible to sell the invention to a Consulate inquirium for further development, so that it can be mass-produced in the future if it passes all required testing.": "一个发明和制造设备的人物可以以创造成本的150-200%的价格出售该物品。也有可能将发明卖给领事馆，以便进一步开发，这样，如果它通过了所有必要的测试，就可以在未来进行大规模生产。",
	"Certain categories of aether-powered inventions are not easily described as magic items, but they can still be created in the same way. An artifact creature such as a battle automaton or a lifecraft animal can be considered a magic item with a rarity determined by its challenge rating:": "某些类别的乙太动力发明不容易被描述为魔法物品，但它们仍然可以以同样的方式被创造。一个神器生物，如战斗自动机或生命动物，可以被视为一个魔法物品，其稀有度由其挑战等级决定。",
	"Common": "普通",
	"Uncommon": "不常见",
	"Very rare": "非常罕见",
	"Legendary": "传说中的",
	"Aether-powered vehicles can be priced as if they were magic items. Simple self-drawn carriages might cost no more than the carriage in the Player's Handbook (100 gp, the equivalent of a common magic item), while the dragsters used in races in Ovalchase can cost five times that amount (as much as an uncommon magic item). Flying vehicles are significantly more expensive. A small sky skiff or copter might be a rare item, and a larger skyship should be considered very rare or even legendary.": "以乙醚为动力的车辆可以像魔法物品一样定价。简单的自拉马车的价格可能不超过《玩家手册》中的马车（100金币，相当于一个普通的魔法物品），而在障碍赛中使用的拖拉机的价格可能是这个数字的五倍（和一个不常见的魔法物品一样多）。飞行器的价格要高得多。小型天空快艇或直升机可能是稀有物品，而较大的天空飞船应该被认为是非常稀有甚至是传奇的。",
	"In campaigns that make use of feats, player characters can gain additional abilities related to aether and invention.": "在利用功勋的活动中，玩家角色可以获得与乙太和发明有关的额外能力。",
	"Kaladesh is not a typical D&D world as far as adventuring and adventurers are concerned. It doesn't lend itself to dungeon exploration, and it's not crawling with evil humanoid monsters for characters to fight. That said, the plane is ripe with opportunities for urbanfocused and intrigue-driven campaigns. Consider the following elements for use in your Kaladesh campaign.": "就探险和冒险者而言，卡拉兹不是一个典型的D&D世界。它不适合地牢探险，也没有邪恶的人形怪物供角色战斗。也就是说，这个平面为以城市为重点的、以阴谋为导向的活动提供了成熟的机会。请考虑在您的卡拉德什战役中使用以下元素。",
	"The main storyline of the Kaladesh block is an out-andout rebellion of renegades when the Consulate government takes an oppressive turn. A campaign focusing on this revolt might put the player characters in the position of renegades trying to capture an aether reservoir or masterminding the sabotage of a Consulate airship. Alternatively, they might be Consulate agents trying to suppress the rebellion—or perhaps infiltrate it. The rebellion could also be the backdrop for a campaign focused more on urban intrigue, or it could interrupt the regular activities of such a campaign. Aether supplies might be significantly constrained in such a campaign, increasing the cost of creating and using aether-powered devices. Acquiring aether could then easily become the focus of a number of adventures.": "卡拉德什区的主要故事情节是，当领事馆政府出现压迫性转变时，反叛者们进行了一次彻底的反叛。一个以叛乱为主题的战役可能会让玩家角色处于叛徒的位置，试图夺取一个乙太储水池，或者策划破坏领事馆的飞艇。或者，他们可能是领事馆的特工，试图镇压叛乱--或许是潜入叛乱。叛乱也可能是一场更注重城市阴谋的战役的背景，或者它可能打断这样一场战役的常规活动。在这样的战役中，乙醚的供应可能会受到很大的限制，增加了创造和使用乙醚驱动的设备的成本。这样一来，获取乙醚就很容易成为一些冒险的重点。",
	"The city of Ghirapur is rife with opportunities for adventure focusing on intrigue and mystery. The player characters might be criminals—perhaps agents of a crime lord seeking to undermine rivals. They could be agents of the law or Dhund spies working to crack down on criminal activity. They could be inventors or investigators looking into allegations of corruption or sabotage during the Inventors' Fair. They might be caught up in power struggles among the Enlightened Keepers, the rulers of the Consulate. Or they could be inventors competing to build the best fighting automata to make money in Remi's arena in Ninth Bridge.": "Ghirapur市充满了以阴谋和神秘为主题的冒险机会。玩家的角色可能是罪犯--也许是寻求破坏对手的犯罪大王的代理人。他们可以是法律的代理人，也可以是打击犯罪活动的杜恩德间谍。他们可能是发明家或调查员，调查发明家博览会期间的腐败或破坏指控。他们可能被卷入开明守卫者（领事馆的统治者）的权力斗争中。或者他们可能是发明家，竞争制造最好的战斗自动装置，在第九桥的雷米竞技场赚钱。",
	"It's somewhat tangential to the core flavor and tone of Kaladesh, but your campaign could take place far from the city of Ghirapur and all its wonders. The adventurers might be explorers seeking to map the farthest reaches of the world, or colonists hoping to establish a New Ghirapur in a distant land. Beyond the reach of Ghirapur's aether pipelines, such characters might need to dig for aether geodes to power their inventions—or they might be traveling on an airship that can collect and refine aether from the aethersphere. The nature of what the characters might find out in the wilds is for you to decide. Such a campaign might even include threats with a more traditional D&D feel, all infused with the magic of aether.": "这与卡拉德什的核心风味和基调有些关系，但你的活动可以发生在远离吉拉普尔城及其所有奇迹的地方。冒险者们可能是寻求绘制世界最遥远的地图的探险家，或者是希望在遥远的土地上建立新吉拉普尔的殖民者。在Ghirapur的乙太管道的范围之外，这些角色可能需要挖掘乙太地轴来为他们的发明提供动力，或者他们可能乘坐一艘可以从乙太球收集和提炼乙太的飞艇旅行。人物在荒野中可能发现的东西的性质由你来决定。这样的活动甚至可能包括具有更多传统D&D感觉的威胁，所有这些都注入了乙太的魔力。"
