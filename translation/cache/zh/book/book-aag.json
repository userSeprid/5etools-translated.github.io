	"In a D&D game, adventures can unfold in any corner of the multiverse—not just in the dungeons and wildernesses of the Material Plane but also on other planes of existence, including what celestial navigators refer to as Wildspace. When you stand on a Material Plane world and look up at the night sky, what you're seeing is Wildspace and, beyond that, the Astral Sea. Exploring these realms and the worlds they surround is the crux of a Spelljammer campaign.": "在D&D游戏中，冒险可以在多元宇宙的任何角落展开--不仅仅是在物质界的地牢和荒野中，还包括其他存在的星球，包括天体导航员所说的威尔兹空间。当你站在物质界的世界上抬头看夜空时，你看到的是荒野空间，再往上是星界之海。探索这些领域和它们周围的世界是法术战士活动的核心。",
	"The {@b Astral Plane} is, quite literally, the plane of stars. More precisely, it is where the stars and portals to the heavens reside—an infinitely vast celestial void that surrounds all the worlds of the Material Plane.": "％0％），从字面上看，是星星的平面。更准确地说，它是星星和通往天堂的门户所在--一个无限广阔的天体虚空，环绕着物质界的所有世界。",
	"Every D&D world—whether round, flat, or some other shape—exists in an airless void known as {@b Wildspace}. A world might be solitary, or it might have neighbors: one or more suns, worlds, moons, asteroids, comets, or other bodies. This neighborhood of celestial and planetary bodies is called a {@b Wildspace system}.": "每个D&D世界--无论是圆形、扁平还是其他形状--都存在于一个被称为{@b Wildspace}的无空气的虚空中。一个世界可能是孤独的，也可能有邻居：一个或多个太阳、世界、卫星、小行星、彗星，或其他天体。这种天体和行星的邻居被称为{@b Wildspace system}。",
	"In Wildspace, the Material Plane and the Astral Plane overlap. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and are effectively on both of those planes at once. If you were to leave your home world and continue outward until you neared the edge of your Wildspace system, you would begin to see a faint, silvery haze. By traveling into this haze, you pass from Wildspace into the {@b Astral Sea}, more colorfully known as the Silver Void. The deeper into the Astral Sea you travel, the thicker and brighter the haze becomes, but the stars that shine through it are always visible. Wildspace and the Astral Sea together comprise the Astral Plane.": "在威尔空间，物质界和星界是重叠的。野生空间的生物和物体会正常老化，并同时有效地处于这两个平面。如果你离开你的母体世界，继续向外走，直到你接近你的野生空间系统的边缘，你会开始看到一个微弱的银色的雾气。通过进入这个阴霾，你就从威尔兹空间进入了{@b Astral Sea}，更多地被称为银色虚空。你在星海中走得越深，雾气就越浓越亮，但透过雾气照耀的星星却始终可见。野生空间和星海共同构成了星界。",
	"The Astral Sea, like Wildspace, is a void; however, it is not an airless one. Here, you can breathe normally and exist indefinitely, never aging and never needing food or drink. You can propel yourself through the Astral Sea with the power of your mind alone, though many astral voyagers wisely travel in well-armed ships, for this place is the home of a host of fearsome creatures. Here travelers might find the petrified hulks of dead gods and swirling pools of color that serve as portals to other planes of existence. (For more information about {@book color pools|DMG|2|Color Pools}, see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.)": "星海，就像威尔兹空间一样，是一个虚空；然而，它并不是一个没有空气的虚空。在这里，你可以正常呼吸，无限期地存在，永远不会衰老，也不需要食物或饮料。你可以仅凭心灵的力量推动自己穿越星海，尽管许多星际航行者明智地乘坐装备精良的船只，因为这个地方是许多可怕生物的家园。在这里，旅行者可能会发现死去的神明的残骸和作为通往其他存在平面的门户的彩色漩涡池。(关于{@book color pools|DMG|2|Color Pools}的更多信息，请参见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。)",
	"Much in the way that oars and strong winds enable travel by sea on terrestrial worlds, magic items called {@item Spelljamming Helm|AAG|spelljamming helms} are used to propel and steer ships through Wildspace and the Astral Sea. A {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} customarily takes the form of an ornate chair in which the ship's pilot sits. To attune to a {@item spelljamming helm|AAG}, one must be a spellcaster. The pilot of a spelljamming ship is called a {@b spelljammer}.": "就像陆地世界的船桨和强风能让人在海上航行一样，被称为{@item Spelljamming Helm|AAG|spelljamming helms}的魔法物品被用来推动和引导船只在野外空间和星海中航行。{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}的形式通常是一把华丽的椅子，船上的驾驶员就坐在上面。要适应{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}，必须是一个施法者。法术干扰船的驾驶员被称为（%3%）。",

	"Using a {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} to move a ship produces a feeling in the spelljammer similar to moving a limb that has fallen asleep—a pins-and-needles sensation, though not as painful as its analog. When the ship approaches something large in space, the spelljammer is usually the first to detect it as the ship slows down. An experienced spelljammer can often sense what caused the ship to slow down a few moments before it can be seen; an asteroid \"feels\" different from a space galleon or a pod of {@creature kindori|BAM}, for example.": "使用{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}移动飞船会在咒语师身上产生一种类似于移动已经睡着的肢体的感觉--一种针刺的感觉，尽管不像其类似物那样痛苦。当飞船接近太空中的大型物体时，当飞船减速时，咒语师通常是第一个发现它的人。一个有经验的咒语师往往能在看到它之前的片刻感觉到是什么导致了飞船的减速；例如，一颗小行星的 \"感觉 \"与一艘太空大帆船或一个{@creature kindori|BAM}的吊舱不同。",
	"A ship can have more than one {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} aboard it, but only one {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} at a time can be used to control the ship.

Resolve this conflict by having each spelljammer make a Constitution check; if the dueling spelljammers tie, have them reroll. The spelljammer with the lowest check result loses the duel and gains {@dice 1d4} levels of {@condition exhaustion}; in addition, their attunement to their {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} ends at once, and they can't attune to any {@item spelljamming helm|AAG} until all levels of {@condition exhaustion} are removed from them.": "一艘船可以有一个以上的{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}，但每次只能用一个{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}来控制船。如果一个法术师试图通过使用第二个{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}来获得对一艘船的控制，就会发生法术师决斗。解决这个冲突的方法是让每个法术师做一个宪法检查；如果决斗的法术师打成平手，就让他们重新投票。检查结果最低的咒术师输掉了决斗，并获得{@dice 1d4}等级的{@condition exhaustion}；此外，他们对自己的{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}的调和立即结束，而且他们不能调和任何{@item spelljamming helm|AAG}，直到他们身上所有等级的{@condition exhaustion}被移除。",
	"When a creature or an object leaves a planet's atmosphere and enters Wildspace, an envelope of breathable air forms around it and lasts until that air is depleted.": "当一个生物或物体离开一个星球的大气层并进入荒野空间时，在它周围会形成一个可呼吸空气的包络，并持续到空气耗尽为止。",

If that ship then merges its fresh air envelope with the deadly air envelope surrounding a derelict ship, the damselfly ship's air quality would change from fresh to deadly.": "例如，如果一艘有污浊空气包络的{@vehicle damselfly ship|AAG}进入一个有新鲜空气的星球的大气层，这两个空气包络就会合并，大马士革飞船的空气质量就会从污浊变为新鲜。如果这艘船再把它的新鲜空气包络层与围绕着一艘废弃船的致命空气包络层合并，那么这艘大鸨船的空气质量就会从新鲜变成致命。",
	"The reason everything pulls its own atmosphere along through space is the force of gravity. It's also the reason why creatures can stand on a spacefaring ship without falling off the deck.": "万物在太空中拉着自己的大气层前进的原因是引力的作用。这也是为什么生物可以站在太空船上而不掉下甲板的原因。",
	"In Wildspace and on the Astral Plane, gravity is an accommodating force, in that the direction of its effect seems to be \"that which is most convenient.\" For an object the size of a planet or moon, gravity pulls everything toward the center of the body, meaning that creatures can stand upright anywhere on the surface, and dropped objects fall perpendicular to the surface they land on.": "在荒野空间和星界，重力是一种包容的力量，因为它的作用方向似乎是 \"最方便的\"。对于一个行星或月球大小的物体来说，重力将一切都拉向身体的中心，这意味着生物可以在表面的任何地方直立起来，而掉落的物体则垂直于它们落下的表面。",
	"For smaller objects, such as spacecraft, gravity doesn't radiate from a point but rather from a plane that cuts horizontally through the object and extends out as far as its air envelope. An object's gravity plane is two-directional: a creature can stand upright on the bottom of a ship's hull—upside down from the perspective of those elsewhere on the ship—and move around as easily as if it were walking on the top deck. {@book Diagram 2.1|AAG|2|Diagram 2.1: Air Envelope and Gravity Plane} shows the location of the gravity plane of a {@vehicle nautiloid|AAG}, by way of example, and indicates the directions in which its gravity operates.": "对于较小的物体，如航天器，重力不是从一个点辐射出来的，而是从一个平面辐射出来的，这个平面水平地穿过物体，并延伸到其空气包络层。一个物体的重力平面是双向的：一个生物可以直立地站在船体的底部，从船上其他地方的人的角度来看，它是倒立的，并且可以像在顶层甲板上行走一样轻松地移动。 举例来说，{@book Diagram 2.1|AAG|2|Diagram 2.1: Air Envelope and Gravity Plane}显示了一个{@vehicle nautiloid|AAG}的重力平面的位置，并指出其重力作用的方向。",
	"One of the unusual properties of a gravity plane is that an object that falls off the side of a ship can end up oscillating back and forth across the gravity plane. It drops in one direction until it crosses the plane, then reverses direction back toward the plane again, continuing until something causes it to stop.": "重力平面的一个不寻常的特性是，一个从船舷上掉下来的物体最终会在重力平面上来回摆动。它向一个方向下降，直到越过平面，然后再扭转方向回到平面，一直持续到有什么东西使它停止。",
	"When gravity planes intersect, such as when two ships pass close to each other and at different angles, the gravity planes of both ships remain in effect until the two ships touch one other (as often happens when they collide or when one ship lands on the other). If that happens, the gravity plane of the ship that has more hit points remaining (regardless of the ships' actual dimensions) overrides the other ship's gravity plane, suppressing it as long as the ships remain in contact, and the first ship's definition of \"up\" becomes the other ship's as well.": "当重力平面相交时，例如当两艘船以不同的角度靠近对方时，两艘船的重力平面仍然有效，直到两艘船相互接触（如经常发生的碰撞或当一艘船降落在另一艘船上时）。如果发生这种情况，剩余命中率较高的那艘船的重力平面（无论船只的实际尺寸如何）就会覆盖另一艘船的重力平面，只要两艘船保持接触，它就会被压制，而第一艘船对 \"上升 \"的定义也会成为另一艘船的定义。",
	"When a ship touches down on a planet (or some other enormous body), the ship's gravity plane is suppressed. If a ship has one or more decks on the ventral side of the ship's gravity plane (rather than its dorsal side), precautions must be taken before the ship lands to secure anyone and anything that might fall when the ship's gravity plane is suppressed.": "当飞船在行星（或其他巨大的天体）上着陆时，飞船的重力平面被抑制。如果一艘飞船在飞船重力面的腹侧（而不是背侧）有一个或多个甲板，那么在飞船降落前必须采取预防措施，以确保在飞船重力面被压制时可能坠落的任何人和物。",
	"When a spelljamming ship moves in space, creatures and objects in its air envelope move with it, pulled along with the ship because of the strength of its gravity plane.": "当咒语干扰船在太空中移动时，在其空气包络中的生物和物体会随着它移动，由于其重力面的强度，它们会被拉着与船一起移动。",
	"However, an unanchored creature or object floating in a ship's air envelope is weightless and drifts toward the edge of the air envelope at a speed of 10 feet per minute. For example, an {@condition unconscious} sailor or a crate that falls off the deck of a spelljamming ship would begin drifting away from the ship along its gravity plane toward the edge of the ship's air envelope. When it exits the air envelope, the sailor or the crate would be left behind as the ship moves away from it.": "然而，漂浮在船的空气包络中的无锚生物或物体是失重的，并以每分钟10英尺的速度向空气包络的边缘漂移。例如，一个{@condition unconscious}的水手或一个板条箱，如果从一艘法术干扰船的甲板上掉下来，就会开始沿着船的重力平面向船的空气包络的边缘漂移。当它离开空气包络层时，水手或板条箱将被抛在后面，因为飞船正在远离它。",
	"A floating creature that enters the air envelope of a larger body is immediately affected by the larger body's gravity (such as that of a planet) or gravity plane (such as that of a spelljamming ship). The creature falls from where it entered the air envelope to the surface of that body, or to the gravity plane of that body, whichever is nearer. Normal damage from the fall applies if the creature hits something solid at the end of the fall. A creature or an object that falls across a gravity plane takes no damage from the fall but begins oscillating from one side of the gravity plane to the other, as described above.": "一个漂浮的生物如果进入一个较大的身体的空气包络，会立即受到较大的身体的重力（比如一个星球的重力）或重力面（比如一个咒语干扰船的重力）的影响。该生物从它进入空气包络层的地方坠落到该体的表面，或者坠落到该体的重力面，以较近者为准。如果该生物在坠落结束时撞到了坚固的东西，那么坠落的正常伤害也适用。一个生物或物体如果跨越重力面下落，不会受到下落的伤害，但会开始从重力面的一侧摆动到另一侧，如上所述。",
	"Every world of the Material Plane is situated in Wildspace, or more precisely, in its own Wildspace system. Wildspace systems are airless oceans teeming with space-dwelling life forms, including spores, space plankton, and larger creatures that resemble fish and aquatic mammals. The ones that need air to survive either generate their own air envelopes or live in the air envelopes of other creatures.": "物质世界的每一个世界都位于荒野空间，或者更准确地说，位于它自己的荒野空间系统。野生空间系统是没有空气的海洋，充斥着空间居住的生命形式，包括孢子、空间浮游生物，以及类似鱼类和水生哺乳动物的大型生物。那些需要空气生存的生物要么产生自己的空气包络体，要么生活在其他生物的空气包络体中。",
	"Wildspace is where the Astral Plane overlaps with the Material Plane. Creatures and objects in Wildspace age normally and exist on both planes simultaneously. This overlap enables creatures to use spells such as {@spell teleport} and {@spell teleportation circle} to travel from Wildspace to a nearby world, or vice versa.": "野生空间是星界与物质界重叠的地方。荒野空间的生物和物体会正常老化，并同时存在于两个位面。这种重叠使生物能够使用诸如{@spell teleport}和{@spell teleportation circle}的法术，从威尔空间旅行到附近的世界，或反之亦然。",
	"Diagram 2.2 illustrates how the Astral Sea surrounds all the Wildspace systems, as well as the astral dominions of gods and the floating remains of dead gods (see the \"Astral Dominions and Dead Gods\" sidebar). Many Wildspace systems have names; for example, Realmspace is a Wildspace system that contains, among other things, the planet Toril—home of the Forgotten Realms setting.": "图2.2说明了星海是如何围绕着所有的荒野空间系统，以及诸神的星空领地和死去的诸神的漂浮遗体（见 \"星空领地和死去的诸神 \"侧边栏）。许多荒野空间系统都有名字；例如，境界空间是一个荒野空间系统，其中包括托里尔星球--《被遗忘的领域》中的设定。",
	"The following sections describe how astral travelers can get from one Wildspace system to another, as well as features of the Astral Plane that are likely to come into play.": "下文描述了星际旅行者如何从一个威尔兹空间系统到另一个威尔兹空间系统，以及有可能发挥作用的星际平面的特征。",
	"Many gods have dominions in the Astral Sea. These locations typically take the form of floating islands or cities of fantastic proportions. Astral travelers might visit these dominions as they would any other ports of call, though a dominion's divine ruler always knows when visitors have arrived and what their intentions are. Because these dominions are part of the Astral Sea, they are timeless; nothing ages there, and creatures can survive there indefinitely without food or drink.": "许多神在星海中拥有统治权。这些地方通常采用漂浮的岛屿或梦幻般的城市的形式。星际旅行者可以像访问其他港口一样访问这些领地，尽管领地的神圣统治者总是知道访客何时到达以及他们的意图是什么。因为这些领地是星海的一部分，所以它们是永恒的；那里没有任何东西会老化，生物可以在没有食物或饮料的情况下无限期地生存。",
	"The Astral Sea is also where one can find the petrified remains of gods who were slain by more powerful entities or who lost all their mortal worshipers and perished as a result. A dead god looks like a gigantic, nondescript stone statue that bears little resemblance to the divine entity it once was. Githyanki, mind flayers, psurlons, and other natives of the Astral Plane sometimes turn these drifting hulks into outposts and cities, many of which are hollowed out beneath the surface.": "星海也是人们可以找到被更强大的实体杀死或失去所有凡人崇拜者并因此而灭亡的神的石化遗体的地方。死去的神看起来就像一个巨大的、不显眼的石像，与它曾经的神灵实体没有什么相似之处。吉特扬基人、心灵传播者、普斯隆人和其他星界的居民有时会把这些漂流的大块头变成前哨站和城市，其中许多是在地表下挖空的。",
	"A typical Wildspace system has a sun plus a number of planets and moons orbiting it. Two examples of Wildspace systems, {@adventure Doomspace|LoX|3|Wildspace System: Doomspace} and {@adventure Xaryxispace|LoX|4|Wildspace System: Xaryxispace}, are described in the accompanying adventure, {@adventure Light of Xaryxis|LoX}. Use them as models when creating your own Wildspace system.": "一个典型的野生空间系统有一个太阳和一些围绕它的行星和卫星。在随附的冒险故事{@adventure Light of Xaryxis|LoX}中描述了两个 \"荒野空间 \"系统的例子：{@adventure Doomspace|LoX|3|Wildspace System: Doomspace}和{@adventure Xaryxispace|LoX|4|Wildspace System: Xaryxispace}。在创建你自己的野生空间系统时，可以用它们作为模型。",
	"World-to-world travel requires a spelljamming ship, a {@spell teleport} spell, or some other kind of magic.": "世界与世界之间的旅行需要法术干扰船、{@spell teleport}法术或其他某种魔法。",
	"Within a Wildspace system, the DM must decide how long it takes a spelljamming ship to travel from one world to another. This task is made easier if the DM has a diagram that shows how far away each world is from the center of the system (the diagrams of {@adventure Doomspace|LoX|3|Wildspace System: Doomspace} and {@adventure Xaryxispace|LoX|4|Wildspace System: Xaryxispace} in {@adventure Light of Xaryxis|LoX} serve as examples). Using such a diagram, you can calculate the shortest possible voyage (when the two worlds are as close to one another as possible) and longest possible voyage (when the two worlds are as far apart as they can be).": "在一个荒野空间系统内，DM必须决定法术干扰船从一个世界到另一个世界需要多长时间。如果DM有一张显示每个世界离系统中心有多远的图，这项任务就会变得更容易（{@adventure Light of Xaryxis|LoX}中的{@adventure Doomspace|LoX|3|Wildspace System: Doomspace}和{@adventure Xaryxispace|LoX|4|Wildspace System: Xaryxispace}的图可以作为例子）。利用这样的图表，你可以计算出最短的可能航程（当两个世界尽可能地靠近对方时）和最长的可能航程（当两个世界尽可能地远离对方时）。",
	"A creature or ship that wants to travel from one Wildspace system to another must cross the Astral Sea unless it has some other magical means of traveling from one world in the multiverse to another.": "想从一个威尔兹空间系统到另一个威尔兹空间系统旅行的生物或飞船必须穿越星海，除非它有其他神奇的手段从多元宇宙的一个世界到另一个世界。",
	"Wildspace systems aren't fixed in certain locations in the multiverse. Because they're constantly in motion, like corks bobbing in water, no reliable devices exist to help plot a course from one Wildspace system to another. Fortunately for travelers, the nature of the Astral Sea makes such journeys relatively easy, as discussed in the next section.": "野生空间系统并不固定在多元宇宙的某个位置。因为它们不断地在运动，就像在水中晃动的木塞，没有可靠的设备可以帮助绘制从一个荒野空间系统到另一个荒野空间系统的路线。对旅行者来说，幸运的是，星海的性质使得这种旅行相对容易，正如下一节所讨论的。",
	"The Astral Sea not only has gravity (see \"{@book Gravity Planes|AAG|2|Gravity Planes}\" above) but also breathable, comfortable air. But is the air real, or does this heavenly realm merely trick creatures into thinking they're breathing? In the Astral Sea, one can never be certain. All that really matters is that a creature can survive indefinitely in the Astral Sea, never aging and never feeling hunger or thirst.": "星海不仅有重力（见上文\"（%0%）\"），还有可呼吸的舒适空气。但这些空气是真实的，还是这个天国只是欺骗生物，让他们以为自己在呼吸？在星海中，人们永远无法确定。真正重要的是，一个生物可以在星海中无限期地生存，永远不会衰老，也不会感到饥饿或口渴。",
	"Local time varies from world to world and from one Wildspace system to the next, depending on rotational periods, custom, and a host of other factors. Astral travelers often rely on what is considered the standard way of keeping time.": "当地的时间在不同的世界和不同的威尔兹空间系统中是不同的，这取决于旋转周期、习俗和其他一系列的因素。星际旅行者经常依赖被认为是标准的计时方式。",
	"A standard day is 24 hours long. A standard week is seven standard days, and a standard month is four standard weeks (28 standard days).": "一个标准日是24小时长。一个标准周是七个标准日，一个标准月是四个标准周（28个标准日）。",
	"The typical method for determining the length of a year—the amount of time that passes during a complete cycle of the seasons—has no meaning or usefulness for individuals who spend most of their time on the Astral Plane. For this reason, astral travelers avoid using years as a measurement of time.": "确定一年长度的典型方法--在一个完整的季节周期中所经过的时间--对于那些大部分时间都在星界的人来说没有任何意义或作用。出于这个原因，星际旅行者避免使用年份作为时间的衡量标准。",
	"A creature doesn't need a vessel to travel through the Astral Sea. In this realm, a traveler has the option of propelling itself by thought alone. The more intelligent a creature is, the faster it can move. A creature that chooses to move in this fashion can move in any direction at a flying speed in feet equal to 5 × its Intelligence score.": "一个生物不需要一个容器就能在星海中旅行。在这个领域，旅行者可以选择仅靠思想来推动自己。一个生物的智慧越高，它的移动速度就越快。选择以这种方式移动的生物可以在任何方向移动，其飞行速度等于5×其智力得分。",
	"One doesn't need a map to navigate the Astral Sea. Here, all creatures are blessed with directional awareness. In other words, a creature can get to where it wants to go by thinking of its destination, at which point it becomes aware of the most direct route to that location. The destination must be somewhere in the Astral Sea or in Wildspace, such as \"the nearest githyanki outpost,\" \"the astral dominion of Hestavar,\" or \"Realmspace.\" This directional awareness doesn't reveal how safe the route is, and the DM decides how far away the destination is and how perilous the trek through the Astral Sea is.": "人们不需要地图就能在星海中航行。在这里，所有的生物都被赋予了方向性的意识。换句话说，一个生物可以通过思考它的目的地到达它想去的地方，这时它就会意识到去那个地方的最直接路线。目的地必须是星海或荒野空间中的某个地方，比如 \"最近的吉特安基前哨\"、\"赫斯塔瓦的星域 \"或 \"境界空间\"。这种方向性意识并不揭示路线的安全程度，DM决定目的地有多远，以及在星海中的跋涉有多危险。",
	"The ambient temperature on the Astral Plane is about the same as on a moderate summer day in the temperate region of most worlds. Since there are no seasons in Wildspace or the Astral Sea, this temperature remains constant at all times. Some Wildspace systems, however, have significantly higher or lower temperatures. Krynnspace, for example, has a very low natural temperature (about 16 degrees Fahrenheit), and clouds of ice particles swirl in the vacuum within its boundaries. Of course, as one approaches a star that puts out heat, the ambient temperature increases.": "星界的环境温度与大多数世界的温带地区的适度夏日差不多。由于威尔兹空间和星界海没有季节之分，这个温度在任何时候都保持不变。然而，有些Wildspace系统的温度明显较高或较低。例如，Krynnspace的自然温度非常低（大约16华氏度），冰粒云在其边界的真空中旋转。当然，当人们接近一颗放出热量的恒星时，周围的温度就会升高。",
	"Fishing is a popular pastime in Wildspace and the Astral Sea, though this activity isn't possible aboard a ship that is moving faster than its flying speed (discussed later in this chapter). Wildspace settlements sell {@item basic fishing equipment|AAG} for 1 sp.

	"Bral is a city built on an asteroid. Its inhabitants, who hail from many worlds, typically refer to Bral as the Rock. There is no other place quite like it in Wildspace. This chapter provides an overview of the asteroid city, which can serve as a hub for campaigns set in Wildspace. The accompanying {@book poster map|AAG|4} shows the topside and underside of the Rock of Bral, which are described later in this chapter.": "布拉尔是一座建立在小行星上的城市。其居民来自许多世界，通常把布拉尔称为岩石。在荒野空间中，没有其他地方能与之相提并论。本章介绍了这个小行星城市的概况，它可以作为在荒野空间开展活动的中心。附图{@book poster map|AAG|4}显示了布拉尔岩石的顶部和底部，本章后面将对其进行描述。",
	"The Rock traces its roots back to roughly 170 years ago, when the eponymous Captain Bral established a pirate refuge here. The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral's death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership of the city.": "岩石的根源可以追溯到大约170年前，当时同名的布拉尔船长在这里建立了一个海盗避难所。这颗小行星成为盗贼和杀手的天堂，其中有一些商人和企业家在这里开店。即使在无法无天的环境下，这个地方也演变成了类似于公民定居点的东西。布拉尔船长死后，为了纪念他，这个新兴的城市被称为布拉尔，其所在地被称为布拉尔岩石。在接下来的几十年里，不同的海盗船长在这个城市拥有影响力，但他们都没有表现出试图接管这个城市的唯一领导权的兴趣。",
	"Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock—that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock's first overlord. Under Prince Cozar's long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.": "最终，在岩石上谋生的商人和酒馆老板变得和在那里寻求庇护的海盗和强盗一样多。其中一位海盗船长科扎尔感觉到岩石上的时代正在发生变化--无法无天的日子即将结束。通过一系列的战略联盟和精明的商业交易，他巩固了自己的政治权力，并称自己为科扎尔王子，岩石的第一个霸主。在科扎尔王子的长期统治下，这个城市从一个海盗的藏身之处发展成为一个主要城市，吸引了追求利润的人、冒险家和其他更受尊敬的类型。",
	"Upon Cozar's death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.": "科扎尔去世后，布拉尔的统治权传给了他的儿子和继承人弗伦。弗伦远不是一个能干的政治家。相反，他是一个享乐主义者，他的过度放纵损害了他的权威。商业领袖和其他有影响力的类型在他们能做到的地方攫取权力，到他统治结束时，弗伦不过是个傀儡。他唯一值得注意的成就是翻新了王宫和建造了以他名字命名的竞技场。",
	"Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space just beyond the asteroid's air envelope. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar's younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.": "弗伦由他的儿子卡拉尔继承，他的气质和品味与他父亲相似，但他作为霸主的时间只持续了几天。六年前，卡拉在夺取王位后不久就在神秘的情况下去世了；他的尸体被发现漂浮在小行星的空气包络层之外的太空中。岩石的领导权传给了卡拉尔的弟弟安德鲁，安德鲁让一群不满的人被捕，并在几天内因犯罪被处决。",
	"Though his place on the throne is secure for now, Prince Andru is merely one player in a maze of political intrigue. He has a host of agents and forces loyal to him, but he must act with consideration, since he has opponents who would rather see Bral ruled by a more ineffectual leader or by a council that could more easily be influenced. Andru maintains his strong base of support because he is a serious and intelligent person—often likened to his grandfather, Prince Cozar, in this regard—and he isn't easily intimidated.": "虽然他在王位上的位置暂时是安全的，但安德鲁王子只是政治阴谋迷宫中的一个角色。他有一大批忠于他的代理人和势力，但他必须谨慎行事，因为他的对手宁愿看到布拉尔被一个更无能的领导人统治，或者被一个更容易受影响的议会统治。安德鲁保持着强大的支持基础，因为他是一个严肃而聪明的人--在这方面经常被比作他的祖父科扎尔王子，而且他不容易被吓倒。",
	"Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs. Generally, law enforcement is sporadic, which means that order is an elusive concept. Most folks who call the Rock home adhere to two principles: mind your own business whenever possible, and enough gold can fix anything.": "布拉尔的居民是由商人、流氓、雇佣兵、海盗、贵族和企业家组成的怪异集合。一般来说，执法是零星的，这意味着秩序是一个难以捉摸的概念。大多数以岩石为家的人坚持两个原则：尽可能地管好自己的事，足够的黄金可以解决任何问题。",
	"General lawlessness prevails in much of the city, but that's not to say that order doesn't exist. Simply put, most citizens police themselves. No city watch patrols the streets. Tavernkeepers hire muscular folks to break up fights and toss out drunkards. Market vendors trust their own eyes to spot shoplifters. Every person on the Rock is expected to have enough sense to hang onto their purse and not be taken in by a swindler.": "该市大部分地区普遍存在无法无天的现象，但这并不是说秩序不存在。简而言之，大多数市民都是自警。没有城市守望者在街上巡逻。酒馆老板雇用肌肉发达的人去制止打架，把醉汉扔出去。市场小贩相信他们自己的眼睛能发现偷窃者。岩石上的每一个人都应该有足够的理智，抓住他们的钱包，不要被骗子骗了。",
	"Serious crimes, such as arson, can be reported to one of the city's three magistrates, who preside over the Low City, the Middle City, and the High City, respectively. If the magistrate concludes that the situation warrants their attention, the Magistrate's Watch is dispatched to investigate and take offenders into custody, if necessary. Most members of the Magistrate's Watch use the {@creature veteran} stat block.": "严重的犯罪行为，如纵火，可以向城市的三位地方法官之一报告，他们分别主持低城、中城和高城的工作。如果治安官认为情况值得他们关注，就会派出治安官的观察团进行调查，并在必要时将犯罪者拘留。县长观察团的大多数成员都使用（%0%）的状态块。",
	"Reporting crimes is voluntary, and many folks don't bother to do so, since the resulting investigation and legal proceedings are likely to take up too much of their time.": "报告犯罪是自愿的，许多人不屑于这样做，因为由此产生的调查和法律程序可能会占用他们太多的时间。",
