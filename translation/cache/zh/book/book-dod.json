	"Domains of Delight are to the Feywild what Domains of Dread are to the Shadowfell: sequestered realms governed by powerful beings. Whereas a Domain of Dread is ruled by a Darklord, a Domain of Delight is ruled by an archfey—the most powerful of Fey creatures. An archfey gives form to their Domain of Delight, shaping it in ways unique to their personality. Some Domains of Delight are bright and cheery, while others are gloomy, but each one reflects the emotional state of its ruler. A Domain of Delight can be as small as a few acres or as big as a country.": "欢乐之域对于费城来说，就像恐惧之域对于影城一样：由强大的生物统治的封闭领域。恐惧之域由黑暗领主统治，而快乐之域则由大精灵统治--最强大的费伊生物。大主教为他们的欢乐之域赋予形式，以他们独特的方式塑造它。有些快乐之域是明亮的，有些则是阴郁的，但每一个都反映了其统治者的情绪状态。一个快乐之域可以小到几英亩，大到一个国家。",
	"This accessory helps you create Domains of Delight and the archfey who rule them, building on the information about the Feywild that appears in the Dungeon Master's Guide. The ideas, tips, and tables in this chapter are meant to spark your imagination. Use what excites and intrigues you, discard what doesn't, and make up the rest!": "这个附件可以帮助你创建快乐之域和统治它们的大法官，它建立在《地下城主指南》中出现的关于Feywild的信息之上。本章中的想法、提示和表格是为了激发你的想象力。使用那些让你兴奋和感兴趣的东西，放弃那些不感兴趣的东西，然后补上余下的部分。",
	"The Feywild responds to unfettered emotion. It's not uncommon for flowers to turn and tremble if there's a heated argument nearby. If someone is filled with malice, their footprints might wither the grass under their feet or cause underground insects and worms to burrow to the surface. Birds chirp merrily in the presence of those who are joyous and squawk angrily at those who are perpetually dour. Nosy trees lean in to overhear whispers of conspiracy, eager for delicious tidbits they can gossip about later, and a rock might reshape itself to look like the creature that's happily sunning itself on the rock's surface.": "翡冷翠对无拘无束的情绪有反应。如果附近有激烈的争论，花儿转身颤抖是很常见的。如果有人充满恶意，他们的脚印可能会使脚下的草枯萎，或使地下的昆虫和虫子钻到地面。鸟儿在那些快乐的人面前欢快地鸣叫，而对那些长期沉闷的人则愤怒地鸣叫。多管闲事的树木靠过来偷听阴谋的低语，渴望得到他们以后可以八卦的美味花絮，而一块岩石可能会重塑自己，看起来像在岩石表面快乐地晒太阳的生物。",
	"Time and distance in the Feywild are mutable, as is the plane's geography. Roads are uncommon, and those that exist are as likely to change as the land around them. Because the distance between locations is not fixed and dilations in time are commonplace, a journey that took one hour yesterday might take three days tomorrow. Feywild natives are accustomed to the plane's mutability. For them, it's no more peculiar than the sun rising and setting on a Material Plane world.": "妖怪世界的时间和距离是可变的，飞机的地理环境也是如此。道路并不常见，那些存在的道路就像它们周围的土地一样可能会发生变化。由于地点之间的距离并不固定，时间的扩张也很常见，昨天花了一个小时的旅程，明天可能需要三天。翡冷翠的当地人已经习惯了飞机的易变性。对他们来说，这并不比物质世界的太阳升起和落下更奇特。",
	"Other features of the Feywild are described in the sections that follow. Think of them as a sampling of what the Feywild has to offer, for like the Material Plane, the Feywild is vast and diverse.": "翡冷翠的其他特征将在后面的章节中描述。把它们看作是仙界所提供的一个样本，因为和物质世界一样，仙界也是广阔而多样的。",
	"Seelie Fey and Unseelie Fey are two groups that often find themselves at odds. Seelie Fey cling to the trappings of civilization, value protocol, and uphold traditions. Unseelie Fey indulge their primal instincts, abhor adherence to protocol, and shun conformity. The two groups are not opposites morally or ethically; good and evil Fey can be found in both.": "Seelie Fey和Unseelie Fey是两个经常发现自己不和的群体。Seelie Fey依附于文明的外衣，重视礼节，并坚持传统。非塞利人放纵他们的原始本能，厌恶遵守礼节，并回避一致性。这两个群体在道德上或伦理上并不对立；在这两个群体中都可以找到善良和邪恶的费伊人。",
	"Seelie and Unseelie Fey gather in courts. The Seelie court is called the Summer Court, and the Unseelie court is called the Gloaming Court. Both courts stretch to the far corners of the Feywild, so their representatives can be encountered almost anywhere on this plane of existence. The Summer Court and the Gloaming Court are by no means the only great Fey courts, but they're the most wellknown to creatures on the Material Plane and the most widespread.": "Seelie和Unseelie Fey聚集在法庭上。Seelie的法庭被称为夏季法庭，Unseelie的法庭被称为阴暗法庭。这两个法庭都延伸到了精灵世界的各个角落，所以他们的代表几乎可以在这个存在平面上的任何地方遇到。夏季宫廷和阴阳宫廷绝不是唯一伟大的费伊宫廷，但它们是物质界的生物最熟悉的，也是最广泛的。",
	"How the Summer Court and the Gloaming Court came to be is a mystery. Perhaps some Fey felt a deeper affinity with the natural world and chose to emulate it, while other Fey began to control nature, using magic to invent new ways of living. Whatever the case, innumerable Fey pursued these two paths, which became the two courts, and there have been squabbles between them ever since.": "夏季法庭和阴暗法庭是如何形成的是一个谜。也许有些费伊人对自然界有更深的亲近感，并选择模仿它，而其他费伊人则开始控制自然，用魔法来发明新的生活方式。不管是什么情况，无数的费伊人追求这两条道路，这就成了两个法庭，从那时起，他们之间一直在争吵。",
	"Each court tries to destabilize and demoralize the other. Both Fey courts have spies who dig up dirt, sow seeds of dissent, and cause mischief. Captured spies are either ransomed or made examples of in various humiliating, nonlethal ways.": "每个法庭都试图破坏对方的稳定，打击对方的士气。两个费伊法庭都有间谍，他们挖掘污点，播下异议的种子，并造成恶作剧。被抓获的间谍要么被赎回，要么以各种羞辱性的、非致命的方式成为例子。",
	"Much of the gossip and chatter within the Feywild is fueled by the intrigue and drama between the two queens that rule the courts. Titania, the Summer Queen, is the regal and charismatic ruler of the Summer Court. Her court enjoys a tenuous peace with the unearthly ruler of the Gloaming Court, the Queen of Air and Darkness, who allows her kin to dabble in magic forbidden by the Seelie Court.": "仙界的许多八卦和唠叨都是由统治宫廷的两位女王之间的阴谋和戏剧所推动的。泰坦尼亚，夏日女王，是夏日法庭的统治者，威严而富有魅力。她的宫廷与阴暗宫廷的不世出的统治者--空气和黑暗女王享有脆弱的和平，后者允许她的亲属涉足塞利宫廷所禁止的魔法。",
	"Conflicts between the Fey courts are often ritualized. Representatives of both courts gather in an amphitheater or field to have heated debates or energetic dance competitions that simulate combat, and these events are often laced with bawdy insults and lewd gestures. Only on rare occasions do things get physical, and even then, the Fey do little more than bite, scratch, and hurl mud at each other.": "菲族法庭之间的冲突往往是仪式化的。两个法庭的代表聚集在露天剧场或野外，进行激烈的辩论或模拟战斗的精力充沛的舞蹈比赛，这些活动往往带有粗俗的侮辱和猥亵的手势。只有在极少数情况下才会发生肢体冲突，即使如此，费伊人也只是互相咬、抓和扔泥巴。",
	"Every now and then, the two queens lock horns, causing tensions to rise throughout the Feywild. If only one of them can get her way, what would normally be a squabble can turn to bloodshed. But only the Fey queens can declare all-out war against each other, and it would take something extreme to have them abandon their relative peace and hurl their courts into violence and chaos.": "每隔一段时间，这两位女王就会交恶，导致整个精灵世界的紧张局势加剧。如果她们中的一个能达到自己的目的，通常的争吵就会变成流血事件。但是，只有费伊女王能向对方宣布全面战争，要让她们放弃相对的和平，将她们的法庭投入暴力和混乱之中，需要一些极端的事情。",
	"The Summer Court and the Gloaming Court have nothing akin to a mutual defense pact, and the very thought of one is greeted by jeers on both sides. If a rising army of fomorians or some other threat endangers one court, it's widely understood that the other court will not intervene unless it, too, is threatened by the same enemy.": "夏季法庭和阴暗法庭没有任何类似于共同防御的协议，一想到有这样的协议，双方都会发出嘲笑声。如果一支崛起的福摩瑞人军队或其他威胁危及一个法院，人们普遍认为，另一个法院不会干预，除非它也受到同一个敌人的威胁。",
	"If you choose to align your domain and its archfey with one of the two courts, guidelines for how they're differentiated are given below.": "如果你选择将你的域名和它的拱卫与这两个法院之一相一致，下面给出了如何区分它们的准则。",
	"Favors sunshine, butterflies, flowers, music, and singing birds": "喜欢阳光、蝴蝶、花朵、音乐和唱歌的鸟儿",
	"Values ceremony and refinement (for example, proper ways of speaking, formal etiquette, and extravagant dinner parties)": "重视仪式和精致（例如，适当的说话方式、正式的礼仪和奢侈的晚宴）。",
	"Favors elaborate, manufactured costuming with immaculate tailoring": "倾向于精心制作的服装和完美的剪裁",
	"Harshly judges those who don't exhibit the proper etiquette (adventurers who commit social blunders make fools of themselves, might be labeled buffoons, and might be laughed out of court)": "严厉评判那些没有表现出适当礼仪的人（犯了社交错误的冒险家会让自己出丑，可能会被贴上小丑的标签，还可能被嘲笑出庭。）",
	"Favors gloom, twilight, cobwebs, fireflies, hooting owls, and croaking frogs": "喜欢阴暗、黄昏、蜘蛛网、萤火虫、猫头鹰的叫声和青蛙的呱呱叫。",
	"Values the intuitive and instinctual (for example, mystical rituals, visionaries, and firelit parties)": "重视直觉和本能（例如，神秘的仪式、幻想家和火光派对）",
	"Shuns the constraints of civilization (instead wearing only unfinished natural materials and sleeping under the stars)": "避开文明的约束（而只穿未完成的天然材料，睡在星空下）。",
	"Dabbles in mysterious magic and rituals (adventurers can run afoul of curses if they don't follow the Unseelie ways)": "涉足神秘的魔法和仪式（如果冒险者不遵循Unseelie的方式，就会触犯诅咒）。",
	"Spells that manifest one way in the Material Plane might do so differently in the Feywild. A {@spell magic missile} spell might take the form of a giggling sprite that materializes next to the caster, fires off a barrage of tiny, glowing arrows, and disappears in a puff of sparkling fairy dust. Here are some other examples of how spells can be cosmetically reinterpreted in the Feywild:": "在物质世界以一种方式表现的法术，在精灵世界可能会有不同的表现。一个{@spell magic missile}的法术可能会变成一个傻笑的精灵，在施法者身边出现，射出一连串发光的小箭，然后在一蓬闪亮的仙尘中消失。下面是一些其他的例子，说明法术如何在仙境中被重新诠释的外观。",
	"The crown is made from gingerbread with icing filigree and candy gems.": "皇冠是由姜饼制成的，上面有结冰的丝线和糖果宝石。",
	"A pixie-like spirit appears and guides the caster to the desired location. The spirit can't be harmed.": "一个类似精灵的灵魂出现，引导施法者到所需的地点。该精灵不会受到伤害。",
	"The wind carries the scent of flowers.": "风中带着花的香味。",
	"The demiplanar labyrinth created by the spell resembles a thorny hedge maze.": "咒语所创造的半平面迷宫类似于荆棘丛生的篱笆迷宫。",
	"The steed looks like a giant, fuzzy caterpillar.": "这匹骏马看起来像一只巨大的、毛茸茸的毛虫。",
	"A creature restored to life by this spell wakes up wondering if their entire life was all just a dream.": "被这个咒语恢复生命的生物醒来后会怀疑他们的整个生命是否只是一场梦。",
	"Strolling across a meadow or walking across a desert in the Feywild is often no different than doing the same on the Material Plane, but sometimes the Feywild needs to feel otherworldly. Playing with something as simple as the weather is an easy way to remind your players that their characters are not on the Material Plane.": "在Feywild的草地上漫步或在沙漠中行走，通常与在物质世界中做同样的事情没有什么不同，但有时Feywild需要给人以另类的感觉。用天气这样简单的东西来提醒你的玩家，他们的角色不在物质界，这是一个简单的方法。",
	"The Feywild Weather table helps you determine fun weather effects. A weather effect such as this usually lasts no more than an hour or three.": "费城天气表帮助你确定有趣的天气效果。像这样的天气效果通常持续时间不超过一到三个小时。",
	"Flower blossoms rain from a sky filled with sparkling, pastel-colored clouds.": "花朵从充满闪光的粉色云彩的天空中飘落。",
	"A grand fairy drama plays in the sky as a stylistically rendered illusion or a swirling aurora.": "一场宏大的童话剧在天空中上演，作为一种风格化的幻觉或旋转的极光。",
	"It rains tiny fruit tarts. They fall slowly and disappear just before they hit the ground. If caught from the air and eaten, they're delicious.": "下起了小小的水果馅饼。它们慢慢落下，在落地前就消失了。如果从空中接住并食用，它们是很美味的。",
	"Fog rolls in and plays harmless tricks on the characters, giving them fog mustaches, fog eyebrows, and fog wigs of many styles—perhaps even fog cloaks or fog companions.": "雾气滚滚而来，对人物进行无害的捉弄，让他们拥有雾状的胡子、雾状的眉毛和多种样式的雾状假发--也许甚至是雾状的斗篷或雾状的同伴。",
	"Snow begins to fall, and the flakes grow bigger over time. Flakes as big as dinner plates, wagon wheels, and even a waterwheel fall, but they're light as a feather.": "雪开始落下，随着时间的推移，雪片越来越大。雪片大如餐盘、马车车轮，甚至是水车，但它们却轻如鸿毛。",
	"The sky fills with iridescent bubbles that lazily fall to the ground. Giggling pixie children chase and pop the bubbles but turn {@condition invisible} and flee if spoken to or approached.": "天空中充满了五彩缤纷的泡泡，懒洋洋地落在地上。咯咯笑的小精灵孩子们追赶着泡泡，但如果有人跟他们说话或接近他们，他们就会转身（%0%）逃走。",
	"A silvery rain lifts the spirits and brings a song to each heart that it touches.": "一场银色的雨使人精神振奋，并为它所触及的每颗心带来一首歌。",
	"A howling wind blows through the party, and each party member must roll a {@dice d8}. Anyone who rolls an 8 has a trinket or some other tiny, nonmagical item (such as a coin) stolen from them by weather spirits.": "一阵呼啸的风吹过，每个党员必须掷出（%0%）。任何掷出8分的人都有一个饰品或其他一些微小的非魔法物品（如硬币）被天气精灵偷走。",
	"As an archfey's power waxes or wanes, their Domain of Delight can grow or shrink. If their domain grows big enough to abut or overlap another archfey's domain, a territorial dispute can arise. Until this dispute is resolved, other Fey denizens of the overlapping domains must defer to both rulers. Such disputes rarely last long; in the end, one archfey is given sufficient incentive to move elsewhere, or the two archfey learn to live with each other (and other denizens of the region must answer to both).": "随着大主教权力的消长，他们的快乐之域可以增长或缩减。如果他们的领域增长到足以与另一个大主教的领域相邻或重叠，就会产生领土争端。在争端解决之前，重叠领域的其他费伊居民必须服从两个统治者的安排。这样的争端很少持续很久；最后，一个大公爵被给予足够的激励搬到其他地方，或者两个大公爵学会彼此相处（该地区的其他居民必须对两者负责）。",
	"An archfey whose Domain of Delight doesn't overlap with another archfey's domain can surround their domain's border with walls of shimmering mist or some other magical effect that hides the domain from view and, if the archfey wishes, prevents creatures from entering or leaving the domain without a key, a guide, a password, the answer to a riddle, the archfey's consent, or magic.": "一个大法师的快乐之域不与另一个大法师的领域重叠，他可以用闪亮的雾墙或其他魔法效果包围他们的领域边界，将领域隐藏起来，如果大法师愿意，在没有钥匙、向导、密码、谜语的答案、大法师的同意或魔法的情况下，阻止生物进入或离开该领域。",
	"The Feywild has its own illogical logic that visitors from other planes can never fully grasp. A guide who is well-versed in the ways of the Feywild can save travelers time and frustration, possibly even their freedom and their lives—by helping them avoid or get around the illogical logic. While visitors are easily vexed by roads that lead nowhere and forest trails that double back on themselves, a capable guide can see the road through the road and the trail beneath the trail. In doing so, the guide sidesteps the confusion and leads charges safely to their intended destination. Conversely, a bad guide can easily get an adventuring party into trouble.": "翡冷翠有自己不合逻辑的逻辑，来自其他星球的游客永远无法完全掌握。一个精通Feywild方式的向导可以为旅行者节省时间和挫折，甚至可能是他们的自由和生命--帮助他们避免或绕过不合逻辑的逻辑。虽然游客们很容易被不知通往何处的道路和反反复复的森林小径所困扰，但一个有能力的导游可以通过道路看到道路，在小径下看到小径。这样一来，导游就能避开混乱的局面，带领游客安全到达预定的目的地。相反，一个糟糕的向导很容易使冒险队伍陷入困境。",

	"Afraid of something commonplace, such as heights, enclosed spaces, or bare hands and feet": "害怕一些司空见惯的东西，如高度、封闭的空间或赤裸的手和脚。",
	"Carries around a suitcase full of wigs, forks, ashes, glass orbs, left shoes, or something else strange": "带着一个装满假发、叉子、灰烬、玻璃球、左脚鞋或其他奇怪东西的箱子。",
	"Full of folksy wisdom that usually starts with, \"Papa always said...\" or \"Mama always said...\"": "充满了乡土气息的智慧，通常以 \"爸爸总是说...... \"或 \"妈妈总是说...... \"开头。",
	"A Fey creature's outlook can be whatever you want it to be, but rarely do Fey ignore the importance of reciprocity, hospitality, and gifts. These concepts are discussed in the sections that follow.": "一个费伊生物的观念可以是你想要的任何东西，但费伊人很少忽视互惠、好客和礼物的重要性。这些概念将在下面的章节中讨论。",
	"By and large, Fey feel strongly about quid pro quo and balance. If something is taken, then something of equal value must be given, and what a Fey considers to be of equal value is the big question. A Fey might steal a human's beloved pet and leave in its place a brightly painted wooden effigy, or the Fey might take some gold and leave a bundle of bright, yellow buttercups. These exchanges satisfy the agreement of reciprocity, and a Fey who makes them sleeps soundly at night, content that the exchanges were fair.": "总的来说，费伊人对交换和平衡有强烈的感觉。如果东西被拿走了，那么必须给予同等价值的东西，而费伊人认为什么是同等价值是个大问题。一个费伊人可能偷了一个人类的心爱的宠物，然后留下一个画得很亮的木雕，或者费伊人可能拿走一些黄金，然后留下一束明亮的黄毛茛。这些交换符合互惠协议，做这些交换的费伊人晚上睡得很香，满足于交换的公平。",
	"Hospitality is a pillar of Fey society. Treating a visitor to one's home with with courtesy and generosity is important to most Fey, but the visitor must show their Fey host the same courtesy and not act boorishly or demonstrate blatant impropriety. Rudeness breaks the bond of reciprocity and frees a Fey host from the obligation to be hospitable. But each Fey has different ideas about what constitutes rudeness; even an ill-conceived gift to a Fey host might be regarded as an insult and cause a hubbub, if not a revocation of the Fey host's hospitality. A trusty Fey guide can provide invaluable assistance in navigating such delicate situations.": "好客是费伊社会的一个支柱。对大多数费伊人来说，以礼貌和慷慨对待来访者是很重要的，但来访者必须向费伊人的主人表示同样的礼貌，不能表现得粗野或公然不妥。无礼破坏了互惠的纽带，使费伊族主人摆脱了好客的义务。但每个费伊人对什么是无礼有不同的看法；即使是给费伊人主人的一份拙劣的礼物，也可能被视为一种侮辱，并引起骚动，甚至取消费伊人主人的款待。一个可靠的费伊族向导可以在处理这种微妙的情况时提供宝贵的帮助。",
	"Connected to both hospitality and reciprocity is the giving of gifts. Fey are avid gift-givers (partially because they like receiving gifts), and their gifts are usually very thoughtful. Good gifts have sentimental value to the giver. For example, a beloved heirloom makes a fine gift to a Fey creature. A throwaway gift is an insult that flies in the face of reciprocity and hospitality.": "与好客和互惠相联系的是赠送礼物。费伊人是狂热的送礼者（部分原因是他们喜欢接受礼物），他们的礼物通常是非常周到的。好的礼物对送礼者有感情上的价值。例如，一个心爱的传家宝对费伊生物来说是一个很好的礼物。扔掉的礼物是一种侮辱，违背了互惠和好客的原则。",
	"Gifts provide a kind of balance that many Fey obsess over. If there is a perceived imbalance, a carefully chosen gift can set things right; this is why refusing a gift from a Fey creature can cause them consternation, as they're trying to right a perceived imbalance by giving the gift. But accepting a gift from a Fey can cause problems for the uninitiated traveler, as it can indebt them to the Fey creature: \"I gave you a gift, so now you must give me one in return.\" It can also lead to the formation of an accidental fey contract, as discussed in the next section.": "礼物提供了一种平衡，许多费伊人都执着于此。如果存在感知上的不平衡，精心挑选的礼物可以纠正一切；这就是为什么拒绝费伊生物的礼物会让他们感到惊愕，因为他们正试图通过赠送礼物来纠正感知上的不平衡。但接受费伊人的礼物会给没有经验的旅行者带来问题，因为这会使他们对费伊生物产生亏欠。\"我给了你一个礼物，所以现在你必须给我一个礼物作为回报。\" 这也可能导致意外的费伊契约的形成，正如下一节所讨论的。",

The gift can be almost anything, and the contract forms as soon as the gift is received.": "当一个生物收到一个费伊人的礼物（或礼物的承诺），并被期望给费伊人一些回报时，费伊人契约就形成了。礼物几乎可以是任何东西，而且一旦收到礼物，契约就会形成。",
	"A creature can accidentally stumble into a fey contract in a number of ways. The one bit of good news for the novice Feywild explorer is that most fey contracts can be broken with a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. Only the most powerful fey contracts are hard to break—ones woven by ancient hags, the queens of the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, and other powerful archfey. Such contracts usually require a {@spell wish} spell or an elaborate ritual to negate.": "一个生物可以通过多种方式意外地撞上一个费伊族的契约。对于新手来说，有一个好消息是，大多数的费伊契约都可以用{@spell remove curse}咒语或类似的魔法打破。只有最强大的费伊契约是很难打破的--由古老的女巫、塞里和非塞里法庭的女王以及其他强大的大法官编织的契约。这样的契约通常需要一个1%的法术或一个精心设计的仪式来否定。",
	"Here are a few ways one might become unwittingly bound to a fey contract:": "以下是一些可能在不知不觉中被精灵契约所束缚的方式。",
	"Accepting a gift from a Fey (prompting the Fey to expect something of perceived equal value in return)": "接受费伊人的礼物（促使费伊人期望得到感知到的同等价值的东西作为回报）",

	"Some Feywild guides recommend never accepting gifts from a Fey and, more importantly, never expressing thanks.": "一些Feywild指南建议永远不要接受Fey的礼物，更重要的是，永远不要表示感谢。",
	"To accept a gift from a Fey is to enter into a contract with it, especially if the gift is received with gratitude. Effusive thanks increase the gift's perceived value, and the Fey will expect something more in return.": "接受费伊人的礼物就是与它签订合同，特别是如果礼物是带着感激之情收到的。滔滔不绝的感谢会增加礼物的感知价值，而且费伊人会期望得到更多的回报。",
	"Even if a Fey creature is unaware something has been stolen from them, they sense that they have been deprived of something. This nagging sense doesn't go away until the Fey figures out what they lost and who has the stolen item. Moreover, the Fey might not want the stolen thing back, but rather something of equal or greater perceived value.": "即使费伊生物不知道他们的东西被偷了，他们也会感觉到他们被剥夺了什么。这种唠叨的感觉不会消失，直到费伊人弄清楚他们失去了什么以及谁拥有被盗物品。此外，费伊人可能并不想要回被盗的东西，而是想要同等或更大的感知价值的东西。",
	"Before taking the life of a creature in the Feywild, a wise individual makes sure that creature has no outstanding debts to Fey. Any Fey the creature was indebted to look to the killer to make good on the creature's unfulfilled debts.": "在取走精灵世界中的生物的生命之前，明智的人要确保该生物没有欠下精灵的债务。该生物所欠的任何费伊都希望凶手能偿还该生物未完成的债务。",
	"Fey are understandably cautious when collecting debts from a person who is prone to violence. They usually make their demands at times when it's safest for them to do so, such as when the killer is bathing or in a crowded place.": "在向一个容易使用暴力的人讨债时，费氏的谨慎是可以理解的。他们通常在最安全的时候提出要求，例如在杀手洗澡或在拥挤的地方。",
	"Fey contracts can be divided into two categories: greater contracts and lesser contracts. Greater contracts are made with archfey, ancient hags, and other powerful Fey spellcasters. Lesser contracts are made with Fey of all other sorts. Here are some examples of gifts Fey can bestow as part of a greater or lesser contract:": "费氏契约可分为两类：大契约和小契约。大契约是与大法师、古代女巫和其他强大的费伊族施法者签订的。较小的契约是与所有其他类型的费伊人签订的。下面是一些费伊人可以作为大契约或小契约的一部分授予的礼物的例子。",

A gift could be anything from a trinket that grants safe passage through the archfey's domain to a magic item that can be used to defeat a powerful monster. As the DM, you decide whether such a gift is warranted. To randomly determine what kind of gift your archfey might bestow on a character, roll on the Magical Gifts table.": "有些大法官有能力给他们认为值得的人送上魔法礼物。礼物可以是任何东西，从授予安全通过大主教领地的饰品到可以用来击败强大怪物的魔法物品。作为管理人，你要决定这样的礼物是否有必要。要随机决定你的大主教可能赐予一个角色什么样的礼物，请在魔法礼物表上滚动。",

	"Once your archfey is fleshed out, you can create the Domain of Delight that serves as the archfey's home in the Feywild.

	"Geographical features on one side of a fey crossing tend to be similar to those on the other side, to the extent that some travelers might be unaware they've left one plane of existence and entered another. For example, if one stumbles upon a fey crossing in a cave, a similar cave might lie on the other side of that fey crossing, as if the caves were near-perfect reflections of each other.": "费伊通道一侧的地理特征往往与另一侧的相似，以至于一些旅行者可能不知道他们已经离开了一个存在的平面，进入了另一个存在的平面。例如，如果一个人在一个山洞里偶然发现了一个费伊通道，那么在这个费伊通道的另一边也可能有一个类似的山洞，就好像这些山洞是彼此的近乎完美的反射。",
	"{@b Altar.} This stone altar might be found atop a lonely plateau, behind a waterfall, inside a cave, or in some other remote location. When certain stars align and the proper ritual is performed, the fey crossing appears as a portal above the altar.": "{@b Altar.}这个石制祭坛可能在一个孤独的高原之上、瀑布后面、山洞里或其他一些偏远的地方被发现。当某些星体排列整齐，并进行适当的仪式时，精灵的渡口就会在祭坛上方出现，成为一个入口。",

	"Visitors to a Domain of Delight are often confounded by the Feywild's power to distort distance, time, and reality. A traveler might see a hilltop that appears to be a mile away and march toward it, only to find the hilltop getting farther away. Similarly, a wanderer who asks for directions might be told to follow a particular trail, only to discover the trail changes course depending on the mood of those who travel along it. Determining how far one has traveled in a particular amount of time can be a headscratcher.": "欢乐之域的游客常常被精灵世界扭曲距离、时间和现实的力量所迷惑。一个旅行者可能会看到一个看起来有一英里远的山顶，于是向它行进，却发现山顶越来越远。同样，一个问路的流浪者可能被告知要沿着一条特定的小路走，却发现这条小路会根据沿路人的心情而改变路线。确定一个人在特定的时间内走了多远可能是一个令人头疼的问题。",
	"Domain denizens and guides know some of the tricks to navigating a Domain of Delight, including magical shortcuts. A shortcut can also be found by accident or learned in some other way.

	"To take advantage of a magical shortcut, one must spend 1 minute performing a routine; the Shortcut Routines table provides examples. At the end of this routine, the performer and any creatures traveling with them find themselves closer to their intended destination. How much closer is up to the DM, but a shortcut routine usually reduces the travel time to the intended destination by at least half.": "要利用一个神奇的捷径，必须花1分钟的时间执行一个程序；捷径程序表提供了例子。在表演结束后，表演者和与他们同行的任何生物都会发现自己更接近预定的目的地。至于有多近，则由DM决定，但捷径程序通常会将到达预定目的地的旅行时间减少至少一半。",
	"A shortcut routine allows for safe, expeditious travel from one location in the Feywild to a specific destination in the Feywild, and that's all. For example, it might expedite travel from the edge of an archfey's domain to the entrance of the archfey's lair but not the other way around, and it wouldn't shorten the travel time to other locations in the domain.": "捷径程序允许安全、快速地从仙境中的一个地点旅行到仙境中的一个特定目的地，仅此而已。例如，它可能会加快从大主教领地的边缘到大主教巢穴的入口的旅行，但不会反过来，它也不会缩短到领地内其他地点的旅行时间。",
