	"The D&D game consists of a group of characters (controlled by the players) embarking on an adventure that the DM presents. The adventure is the heart of the game. An adventure unfolds as a story that the DM and the other players tell together using the material in the adventure book, in another published adventure, or in a setting of the DM's creation.

	"Often the action of an adventure takes place wholly in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene.

	"Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or bounce off its iron-hard scales? Does the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Does a character avoid the main blast of a fireball or take full damage from the blaze? When the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on the roll of a {@dice d20} to determine success or failure. Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of {@dice d20} rolls. For each one, you roll a {@dice d20}, add any bonuses or penalties, and compare the total to a target number. If the total equals or exceeds it, you succeed. Here are those steps in more detail:": "冒险家的剑挥舞是否会伤害到龙，或者从它坚硬的鳞片上弹开？食人魔会相信一个离谱的虚张声势吗？一个角色能游过一条汹涌的河流吗？一个角色是要避开火球的主要爆炸，还是要承受烈焰的全部伤害？当一个行动的结果不确定时，游戏依靠掷出（%0%）来决定成功或失败。能力检查、攻击卷和蓄力投掷是三种主要的（%1%）卷。对于每一种，你都要掷出一个（%2%），加上任何奖励或惩罚，然后将总数与一个目标数字相比较。如果总数等于或超过它，你就成功了。以下是这些步骤的更多细节。",
	"Roll a {@dice d20}, then add the modifier of the ability score used for the roll. A Dexterity saving throw, for instance, uses your Dexterity modifier.": "掷一个{@dice d20}，然后加上用于掷的能力分数的修正值。例如，一个灵巧的救赎，使用你的灵巧修饰。",
	"A spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the roll.": "咒语、特殊情况或其他一些效果可能会给卷轴带来奖励或惩罚。",
	"If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the roll is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The target number for an ability check or saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC). For an attack roll, it's the Armor Class (AC) of the target being attacked. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.": "如果总数等于或超过目标数，则掷骰子成功。否则，就是失败。能力检查或自救的目标数字被称为难度等级（DC）。对于攻击卷，它是被攻击目标的装甲等级（AC）。DM通常是决定目标数字的人，并告诉玩家他们的能力检查、攻击卷和自救动作是成功还是失败。",

	"Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on a {@dice d20} roll. When that happens, you roll a second {@dice d20} when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.": "有时，一个特殊的能力或咒语会告诉你，你在一个（%0%）的卷轴上有优势或劣势。当这种情况发生时，你在掷骰子时要再掷一次（%1%）。如果你有优势，就用这两个卷子中较高的那个，如果你有劣势，就用较低的那个。例如，如果你有劣势，并掷出17和5，你就使用5；如果你有优势并掷出这些数字，你就使用17。",
	"If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don't roll more than one additional {@dice d20}. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional {@dice d20}.": "如果有多种情况影响一个卷轴，并且每一种情况都给予优势或施加劣势，你就不会卷出超过一个额外的（%0%）。例如，如果有两个有利的情况给予优势，你仍然只能滚出一个额外的（%1%）。",
	"If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one {@dice d20}. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.": "如果情况导致一个卷子同时具有优势和劣势，你被认为既没有优势，也没有劣势，你卷一个（%0%）。即使有多种情况造成劣势，而只有一种情况给予优势，或者反之亦然，这也是如此。在这种情况下，你既没有优势也没有劣势。",

	"An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge.

	"Often, the adventure book tells the DM what kind of check a character can make, the DC of the check, and what happens if the character succeeds or fails. Since characters often try unpredictable things, though, the adventure book also provides advice to help the DM decide what kind of ability check and DC to use in a particular situation.": "通常，冒险书会告诉DM一个角色可以做什么样的检查，检查的DC，以及如果角色成功或失败会怎样。不过，由于角色经常尝试不可预知的事情，冒险书也会提供建议，帮助DM决定在特定情况下使用哪种能力检查和DC。",
