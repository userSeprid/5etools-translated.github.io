	"The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.": "龙与地下城 \"角色扮演游戏是关于在剑与魔法的世界中讲故事。它与童年的虚构游戏有着共同的元素。像那些游戏一样，D&D是由想象力驱动的。它是关于想象暴风雨的夜空下高耸的城堡，想象一个幻想中的冒险家会如何应对这个场景带来的挑战。",
	"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.": "{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} 穿过峭壁的山峰后，道路突然向东转弯，雷文洛夫特城堡在你面前耸立。摇摇欲坠的石塔静静地守望着这条路。它们看起来像废弃的警卫室。在这些塔楼之外，有一条宽阔的鸿沟，消失在下面的深雾中。一座放下的吊桥横跨鸿沟，通向城堡庭院的一个拱形入口。吊桥的铁链在风中吱吱作响，被锈蚀的铁器因重量而变得紧张。从高大坚固的墙顶上，石像鬼从空洞的口袋里盯着你，露出狰狞的笑容。一个腐烂的木制门闩，长满了绿色，挂在入口处的通道上。除此之外，雷文洛夫特城堡的大门敞开着，浓郁的暖光洒进院子里。",
	"{@b Phillip (playing Gareth):} I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they're not just statues.": "{@b Phillip (playing Gareth):}我想看看那些石像鬼。我有一种感觉，他们不仅仅是雕像。",
	"{@b Amy (playing Riva):} The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?": "{@b Amy (playing Riva):}吊桥看起来很不稳定？我想看看它有多结实。我认为我们可以越过它，还是它将在我们的重量下坍塌？",
	"Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.": "与虚构的游戏不同，D&D为故事提供了结构，一种决定冒险者行动后果的方式。玩家通过掷骰子来决定他们的攻击是否命中，或者他们的冒险者是否能爬上悬崖，滚开魔法闪电的攻击，或者完成一些其他的危险任务。任何事情都有可能，但骰子使一些结果比其他结果更有可能。",
	"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} OK, one at a time. Phillip, you're looking at the gargoyles?": "{@b Dungeon Master (DM):}好，一次一个。菲利普，你在看石像鬼？",
	"{@b Phillip:} Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?": "{@b Phillip:}是的，有什么提示他们可能是生物而不是装饰品吗？",
	"{@b DM:} Make an Intelligence check.": "{@b DM:}做一个智力检查。",
	"{@b Phillip:} Does my Investigation skill apply?": "{@b Phillip:} 我的调查技能是否适用？",
	"{@b DM:} Sure!": "{@b DM:} 当然!",
	"{@b Phillip (rolling a d20):} Ugh. Seven.": "{@b Phillip (rolling a d20):}唉。七个。",
	"{@b DM:} They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?": "{@b DM:}对你来说，它们看起来像装饰品。而艾米，里瓦正在检查吊桥？",
	"In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).": "在龙与地下城游戏中，每个玩家创建一个冒险者（也叫角色），并与其他冒险者（由朋友扮演）组成团队。",
	"Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.": "大家一起努力，可能会探索一个黑暗的地牢、一个破败的城市、一个闹鬼的城堡、一个丛林深处的失落的寺庙，或者一个神秘的山下充满熔岩的洞穴。冒险家们可以解决谜题，与其他角色交谈，与神奇的怪物战斗，并发现美妙的魔法物品和其他宝藏。",
	"One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game's lead storyteller and referee.": "然而，有一个玩家扮演了地下城主（DM）的角色，他是游戏的主要讲故事者和裁判员。",
	"The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.": "DM为角色创造冒险，他们在冒险中穿梭于危险之中，决定探索哪条道路。DM可能会描述Ravenloft城堡的入口，而玩家则决定他们的冒险者要做什么。他们会走过危险的风化的吊桥吗？用绳子把自己绑在一起，以减少吊桥让路时有人掉下去的机会？还是施展法术将他们带过鸿沟？然后，DM决定冒险者行动的结果，并叙述他们的经历。因为DM可以对玩家的任何尝试做出即兴反应，所以D&D具有无限的灵活性，每次冒险都可以是令人兴奋和意想不到的。",
	"The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.": "游戏没有真正的结束；当一个故事或任务结束后，另一个故事可以开始，创造一个持续的故事，称为活动。许多玩这个游戏的人将他们的活动持续数月或数年，每隔一周左右与他们的朋友见面，在他们离开的地方重新开始故事。随着战役的继续，冒险者的力量也在增长。每一个被打败的怪物，每一次完成的冒险，以及每一次寻获的宝藏，不仅为持续的故事增添了色彩，而且还为冒险者赢得了新的能力。这种能力的提高反映在冒险者的等级上。",
	"There's no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.": "在龙与地下城游戏中没有输赢--至少不是人们通常理解的那种方式。管理员和玩家一起创造了一个令人兴奋的故事，大胆的冒险家们面对致命的危险。有时，冒险者可能会有一个可怕的结局，被凶猛的怪物撕碎或被邪恶的恶棍干掉。即便如此，其他冒险者可以寻找强大的魔法来使他们死去的同伴复活，或者玩家可以选择创建一个新的角色来继续下去。这群人可能无法成功地完成一次冒险，但如果每个人都玩得很开心，并创造了一个令人难忘的故事，他们就都赢了。",
	"The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.": "龙与地下城游戏的许多世界是魔法和怪物的地方，有勇敢的战士和壮观的冒险。它们以中世纪的幻想为基础，然后加入生物、地方和魔法，使这些世界变得独一无二。",
	"The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the {@b multiverse}, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and 10 other planes or existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.": "龙与地下城游戏的世界存在于一个被称为{@b multiverse}的巨大宇宙中，以奇怪而神秘的方式彼此相连，并与其他10个存在的平面，如火元素平面和无边的深渊相连。在这个多元宇宙中，有无穷无尽的各种世界。",
	"Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.": "其中许多已经作为D&D游戏的官方设定出版。被遗忘的国度、龙之谷、灰鹰、黑暗太阳、神秘之地和埃伯龙等设定的传说在多元宇宙的结构中交织在一起。除了这些世界之外，还有几十万个世界，由几代D&D玩家为他们自己的游戏所创造。在多元宇宙的所有丰富内容中，你可能会创造一个属于你自己的世界。",
	"All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are Jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron's war-forged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they're all D&D worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.": "所有这些世界都有共同的特点，但每个世界都因其自身的历史和文化、独特的怪物和种族、奇妙的地理环境、古老的地牢和阴险的反派而与众不同。一些种族在不同的世界里有不同的特征。例如，黑暗太阳设定中的半身人是居住在丛林中的食人族，而精灵是沙漠游牧民族。有些世界的特点是在其他设定中不为人知的种族，例如Eberron的战争锻造者，他们创造并注入生命以在最后的战争中作战。有些世界由一个伟大的故事主导，比如在《龙之谷》设定中起核心作用的长枪战争。但它们都是D&D世界，你可以使用本书中的规则来创建一个角色，并在其中任何一个世界中游戏。",
	"Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play or the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.": "你的管理员可能会把活动设置在这些世界中的一个或他或她创造的一个世界上。由于D&D世界的多样性，你应该向你的DM了解任何会影响你的游戏或游戏的内部规则。归根结底，地下城管理人是活动和其设定的权威，即使该设定是一个已出版的世界。",
	"The Player's Handbook is divided into three parts.": "玩家手册》分为三个部分。",
	"{@b Part 1} is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don't understand, consult the book's index.": "{@b Part 1}是关于创建角色的，提供了你需要的规则和指导，以制作你将在游戏中扮演的角色。它包括关于各种种族、等级、背景、装备和其他可供选择的定制选项的信息。第一部分中的许多规则依赖于第二和第三部分的材料。如果你在第一部分中遇到不理解的游戏概念，请查阅本书的索引。",
	"{@b Part 2} details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game; exploration, interaction, and combat.": "{@b Part 2}详细介绍了如何玩这个游戏的规则，超出了本介绍中描述的基本内容。这一部分涵盖了你为决定你的角色所尝试的任务的成败而进行的各种掷模，并描述了游戏中的三大类活动：探索、互动和战斗。",
	"{@b Part 3} is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.": "{@b Part 3}是关于魔法的。它涵盖了D&D世界中魔法的本质、施法的规则以及游戏中使用魔法的角色（和怪物）可使用的大量法术。",
	"{@b 1. The DM describes the environment.} The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).": "{@b 1. The DM describes the environment.} DM告诉玩家他们的冒险者在哪里，以及他们周围有什么，提出基本的选择范围（一个房间有多少扇门，桌子上有什么，谁在酒馆里，等等）。",
	"{@b 2. The players describe what they want to do.} Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \"We'll take the east door,\" for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.": "{@b 2. The players describe what they want to do.}有时一个玩家代表整个队伍说话，比如说，\"我们要走东门\"。其他时候，不同的冒险者做不同的事情：一个冒险者可能会搜索一个宝箱，而第二个冒险者会检查刻在墙上的深奥符号，第三个冒险者会留意怪物的情况。玩家不需要轮流做，但是DM会倾听每个玩家的意见，并决定如何解决这些行动。",
	"Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.": "有时，解决一个任务很容易。如果一个冒险者想走过一个房间并打开一扇门，DM可能只是说门开了，并描述门外是什么。但是，门可能是锁着的，地板可能隐藏着致命的陷阱，或者其他一些情况可能会使冒险者完成任务面临挑战。在这些情况下，DM决定会发生什么，通常依靠掷骰子来决定行动的结果。",
	"{@b 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.} Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.": "{@b 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.}描述结果往往会导致另一个决策点，这使游戏的流程直接回到了第1步。",
	"This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.": "无论冒险者是在谨慎地探索一个废墟，与一个狡猾的王子交谈，还是与一条强大的龙进行殊死搏斗，这种模式都是成立的。",
	"In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.": "在某些情况下，特别是战斗，行动更有条理，玩家（和DM）确实轮流选择和解决行动。但大多数时候，游戏是流动和灵活的，适应冒险的环境。",
	"Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.": "通常情况下，冒险的行动是在玩家和DM的想象中进行的，依靠DM的口头描述来设置场景。有些DM喜欢用音乐、艺术或录制的声音效果来帮助设置气氛，许多玩家和DM都为他们在游戏中扮演的各种冒险者、怪物和其他角色采用不同的声音。有时，管理员可能会布置一张地图，用代币或微型人物来代表场景中涉及的每个生物，以帮助玩家追踪每个人的位置。",
	"The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.": "该游戏使用多面体骰子，有不同的面数。你可以在游戏商店和许多书店里找到这样的骰子。",
	"In these rules, the different dice are referred to by the letter {@b d} followed by the number of sides - d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use).": "在这些规则中，不同的骰子以字母{@b d}来表示，后面是面数--d4、d6、d8、d10、d12和d20。例如，d6是一个六面的骰子（许多游戏使用的典型立方体）。",
	"Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9.": "百分位数骰子，或称d100，工作方式有点不同。你通过掷两个不同的十面骰子，从0到9，产生一个1到100之间的数字。",
	"One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two 0s represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100.": "一个骰子（在你掷骰子之前指定）给出十位数，另一个给出一位数。例如，如果你掷出一个7和一个1，掷出的数字就是71。两个0代表100。有些十面骰子是以十为单位编号的（00，10，20，等等），这样更容易区分十位数和个位数。在这种情况下，掷出的70和1是71，00和0是100。",
	"When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, \"3d8 + 5\" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total.": "当你需要掷骰子时，规则告诉你要掷多少个某种类型的骰子，以及要加什么修饰。例如，\"3d8+5 \"意味着你要掷三个八面骰子，把它们加在一起，然后在总数上加上5。",
	"The same d notation appears in the expressions \"1d3\" and \"1d2.\" To simulate the roll of 1d3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of 1d2, roll any die and assign a 1 or 2 to the roll depending on whether it was odd or even. (Alternatively, if the number rolled is more than half the number of sides on the die, it's a 2.)": "同样的d符号出现在 \"1d3 \"和 \"1d2 \"的表达中。为了模拟1d3的掷法，掷一个d6，然后用掷出的数字除以2（四舍五入）。要模拟1d2，可以掷任何一个骰子，然后根据骰子是奇数还是偶数，给它一个1或2。(或者，如果掷出的数字超过了骰子上边数的一半，那就是2）。",
	"Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the Dungeons & Dragons game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.": "冒险家的挥剑是否会伤害到龙，或者只是从它坚硬的鳞片上弹开？食人魔会相信一个离谱的虚张声势吗？一个角色能游过一条汹涌的河流吗？一个角色可以避开火球的主要爆炸，还是要承受火焰的全部伤害？在行动结果不确定的情况下，龙与地下城游戏依靠滚动20面的骰子，即D20，来决定成功或失败。",
	"Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six {@b ability scores}. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they typically range from 3 to 18 for most adventurers. (Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30.) These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.": "游戏中的每个角色和怪物都有由六个（%0%）定义的能力。这些能力是力量、灵巧、体质、智力、智慧和魅力，对于大多数冒险者来说，它们的范围通常是3到18。(怪物的分数可能低至1或高至30。)这些能力分数，以及由此产生的能力修正值，是玩家为角色或怪物所做的几乎每一个D20卷的基础。",
	"Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps.": "能力检查、攻击卷和蓄力投掷是三种主要的D20卷，构成了游戏规则的核心。所有这三种都遵循这些简单的步骤。",
	"{@b 1. Roll the die and add a modifier.} Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill. (See chapter 1 for details on each ability and how to determine an ability's modifier.)": "{@b 1. Roll the die and add a modifier.} 掷一个D20，然后加上相关的修正值。这通常是来自六个能力分数之一的修正值，有时还包括一个熟练度奖励，以反映一个角色的特殊技能。(关于每种能力的细节以及如何确定能力的修正值，请参见第一章）。",
	"{@b 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.} A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check.": "{@b 2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties.}一个类别特征、一个咒语、一个特殊情况或其他一些效果可能会给检查带来奖励或惩罚。",
	"{@b 3. Compare the total to a target number.} If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure. The DM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail.": "{@b 3. Compare the total to a target number.}如果总数等于或超过目标数字，能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力是成功的。否则，就是失败。DM通常是决定目标数字的人，并告诉玩家他们的能力检查、攻击卷和自救术是成功还是失败。",
	"The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a {@b Difficulty Class} (DC). The target number for an attack roll is called an {@b Armor Class} (AC).": "能力检查或自救的目标数字被称为（%0%）（DC）。攻击卷的目标数字被称为（%1%）（AC）。",
	"This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in D&D play. Chapter 7 provides more detailed rules for using the d20 in the game.": "这个简单的规则制约着D&D游戏中大多数任务的解决。第7章提供了在游戏中使用d20的更详细规则。",
	"Sometimes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is modified by special situations called advantage and disadvantage. Advantage reflects the positive circumstances surrounding a d20 roll, while disadvantage reflects the opposite. When you have either advantage or disadvantage, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.": "有时，一个能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力投掷会被称为优势和劣势的特殊情况所改变。优势反映了围绕d20卷的积极情况，而劣势则反映了相反的情况。当你有优势或劣势的时候，你在掷骰子的时候要再掷一个D20。如果你有优势，就使用这两个骰子中较高的一个，如果你有劣势，就使用较低的一个骰子。例如，如果你有劣势，并掷出17和5，你就用5；如果你有优势并掷出这些数字，你就用17。",
	"More detailed rules for advantage and disadvantage are presented in chapter 7.": "更详细的优势和劣势规则见第七章。",
	"This book contains rules, especially in parts 2 and 3, that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins.": "本书包含的规则，尤其是第二和第三部分，规定了游戏的玩法。也就是说，许多种族特征、等级特征、法术、魔法物品、怪物能力和其他游戏元素都以某种方式打破了一般规则，为游戏的其他部分的运作创造了例外。请记住这一点。如果一个具体的规则与一个一般的规则相矛盾，那么具体的规则就赢了。",
	"Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with longbows, but every wood elf does because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.": "规则的例外情况往往是小事。例如，许多冒险家都不精通长弓，但每个木精灵都精通，因为有一个种族特性。这种特性在游戏中创造了一个小的例外。其他破坏规则的例子则更为明显。例如，一个冒险家通常不能穿墙，但一些法术使之成为可能。魔法在规则的主要例外中占了大多数。",
	"There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.": "还有一条一般规则，你需要在一开始就知道。每当你在游戏中除以一个数字时，如果你最后得到的是一个分数，即使这个分数是二分之一或更大，也要向下取整。",
	"The Dungeons & Dragons game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the Dungeon Master presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions. The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.": "龙与地下城游戏由一群角色组成，他们开始了由地下城管理员介绍的冒险。每个角色都以能力分数和技能、等级特征、种族特征、装备和魔法物品的形式为冒险带来特殊能力。每个角色都是不同的，有不同的长处和短处，所以最好的冒险者队伍是角色之间相互补充并弥补同伴的短处的队伍。冒险者们必须合作才能成功地完成冒险。",
	"The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the Dungeon Master or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it's an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city. It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as nonplayer characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action.": "冒险是游戏的核心，是一个有开始、有中间、有结束的故事。一个冒险可能是由地下城管理员创建的，也可能是现成的，经过调整和修改以适应管理员的需要和愿望。无论是哪种情况，冒险都有一个奇妙的环境，无论是地下的地牢、破败的城堡、一片荒野，还是一个繁华的城市。它的特点是有丰富的人物阵容：由同桌的其他玩家创造和扮演的冒险者，以及非玩家角色（NPCs）。这些角色可能是赞助人、盟友、敌人、雇佣者，或者只是冒险中的背景角色。通常情况下，其中一个NPC是一个反派，他的议程推动了冒险的大部分行动。",
	"Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next.": "在冒险的过程中，人物会遇到各种生物、物体和情况，他们必须以某种方式处理。有时，冒险者和其他生物会在战斗中尽力杀死或捕获对方。在其他时候，冒险家们带着一个目标与另一个生物（甚至是一个神奇的物体）交谈。而很多时候，冒险家们会花时间去解决一个难题，绕过一个障碍物，找到一些隐藏的东西，或者解开当前的局面。同时，冒险家们探索世界，决定走哪条路，以及接下来要尝试做什么。",
	"Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors.": "冒险的长度和复杂性各不相同。一个短的冒险可能只提出几个挑战，它可能不需要超过一个游戏会话就能完成。一个长的冒险可能涉及数百次战斗、互动和其他挑战，需要几十次游戏会话来完成，延伸到几周或几个月的实际时间。通常，冒险结束的标志是冒险者回到文明社会休息，享受他们的劳动成果。",
	"But that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series—a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish.": "但这并不是故事的结束。你可以把冒险看成是电视剧的一集，由多个精彩的场景组成。一个战役就是整个系列--一连串的冒险连接在一起，由一群冒险者从头到尾跟随叙事。",
	"Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat.": "冒险家可以尝试做他们的玩家所能想象的任何事情，但把他们的活动分成三大类来谈论可能会有帮助：探索、社会互动和战斗。",
	"{@b Exploration} includes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the Dungeon Master telling the players what happens as a result.": "{@b Exploration}包括冒险者在世界中的移动以及他们与需要他们注意的物体和情况的互动。探索是玩家描述他们想要他们的角色做什么，而地下城管理员则告诉玩家会发生什么。",
	"On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.": "从大的方面来说，这可能涉及到人物花一天时间穿越起伏的平原，或者花一小时穿过地下的洞穴。在最小的范围内，它可能意味着一个角色在一个地牢房间里拉动一个杠杆，看看会发生什么。",
	"{@b Social-interaction} features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding that a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an orc chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers.": "{@b Social-interaction}的特点是冒险者与其他的人（或东西）交谈。这可能意味着要求被俘的侦察员透露地精巢穴的秘密入口，从获救的囚犯那里获得信息，向兽人首领求情，或者说服一个健谈的魔镜向冒险者展示一个遥远的位置。",
	"The rules in chapters 7 and 8 support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features in chapter 3 and personality traits in chapter 4.": "第7章和第8章的规则支持探索和社会互动，第3章的许多类特征和第4章的个性特征也是如此。",
	"{@b Combat,} the focus of chapter 9, involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on-all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.": "{@b Combat,}是第九章的重点，涉及到角色和其他生物挥舞武器、施展法术、操纵位置等等，都是为了击败对手，无论这意味着杀死每一个敌人、俘虏或迫使对方溃败。战斗是D&D会议中最有条理的元素，生物们轮番上阵，确保每个人都有机会行动。即使是在激烈的战斗中，冒险者仍然有很多机会尝试古怪的特技，比如骑着盾牌从楼梯上冲下来，检查环境（也许是通过拉动一个神秘的杠杆），并与其他生物互动，包括盟友、敌人和中立方。",
	"Few D&D adventures end without something magical happening. Whether helpful or harmful, magic appears frequently in the life of an adventurer, and it is the focus of chapters 10 and 11.": "在D&D的冒险中，很少有不发生魔法的情况。不管是有帮助的还是有害的，魔法经常出现在冒险者的生活中，这也是第10章和第11章的重点。",
	"In the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons, practitioners of magic are rare, set apart from the masses of people by their extraordinary talent. Common folk might see evidence of magic on a regular basis, but it's usually minor—a fantastic monster, a visibly answered prayer, a wizard walking through the streets with an animated shield guardian as a bodyguard.": "在《龙与地下城》的世界里，魔法从业者是很罕见的，他们因其非凡的天赋而与广大人民群众区分开来。普通人可能会经常看到魔法的证据，但这通常是小事一桩--一个神奇的怪物，一个明显应验的祈祷，一个带着动画盾牌守护者走过街道的巫师。",
	"For adventurers, though, magic is key to their survival. Without the healing magic of clerics and paladins, adventurers would quickly succumb to their wounds. Without the uplifting magical support of bards and clerics, warriors might be overwhelmed by powerful foes. Without the sheer magical power and versatility of wizards and druids, every threat would be magnified tenfold.": "不过，对于冒险者来说，魔法是他们生存的关键。如果没有牧师和圣骑士的治疗魔法，冒险者很快就会在伤口上屈服。如果没有吟游诗人和牧师的振奋人心的魔法支持，战士们可能会被强大的敌人所压倒。如果没有巫师和德鲁伊纯粹的魔法力量和多功能性，每个威胁都会被放大十倍。",
	"Magic is also a favored tool of villains. Many adventures are driven by the machinations of spellcasters who are hellbent on using magic for some ill end. A cult leader seeks to awaken a god who slumbers beneath the sea, a hag kidnaps youths to magically drain them of their vigor, a mad wizard labors to invest an army of automatons with a facsimile of life, a dragon begins a mystical ritual to rise up as a god of destruction—these are just a few of the magical threats that adventurers might face. With magic of their own, in the form of spells and magic items, the adventurers might prevail!": "魔法也是恶棍们喜欢的工具。许多冒险都是由那些一心想利用魔法达到某种不良目的的施法者的阴谋所驱动。一个邪教领袖试图唤醒沉睡在海底的神，一个巫婆绑架了年轻人，用魔法耗尽他们的活力，一个疯狂的巫师努力为自动机军队注入生命的模样，一条龙开始了一个神秘的仪式，作为一个毁灭之神崛起--这些只是冒险者可能面临的少数魔法威胁。有了自己的魔法，以法术和魔法物品的形式，冒险家们可能会取得胜利!",
	"Your first step in playing an adventurer in the Dungeons & Dragons game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of various statistics, roleplaying hooks, and your imagination. You choose a race (such as human or halfling) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the Dungeons & Dragons world.": "你在《龙与地下城》游戏中扮演冒险家的第一步是想象和创造一个属于你自己的角色。你的角色是各种统计数据、角色扮演的钩子和你的想象力的结合。你选择一个种族（如人类或半身人）和一个等级（如战士或魔法师）。你还可以发明你的角色的个性、外观和背景故事。一旦完成，你的角色就成为你在游戏中的代表，你在龙与地下城世界的化身。",
	"Before you dive into step 1 below, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brave rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those races. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. If you don't know where else to begin, take a look at the illustrations in this book to see what catches your interest.": "在你进入下面的第1步之前，想一想你想扮演什么样的冒险家。你可能是一个勇敢的战士，一个偷偷摸摸的流氓，一个狂热的牧师，或者一个张扬的巫师。或者你可能对一个非传统的角色更感兴趣，比如一个喜欢徒手搏斗的勇敢的流氓，或者一个从远处挑衅敌人的神枪手。你喜欢以矮人或精灵为主题的幻想小说吗？试着建立一个这些种族中的一个角色。你想让你的角色成为餐桌上最强悍的冒险家吗？可以考虑野蛮人或圣骑士这样的类别。如果你不知道还能从哪里开始，看看这本书中的插图，看看什么能引起你的兴趣。",
	"Once you have a character in mind, roll on these steps in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.": "一旦你心中有了一个角色，就按顺序滚动这些步骤，做出反映你想要的角色的决定。你对你的角色的概念可能会随着你的每一个选择而变化。重要的是，你要带着一个你很想扮演的角色来参加会议。",
	"Throughout this chapter, we use the term {@b character sheet} to mean whatever you use to track your character, whether it's a formal character sheet (like the one at the end of this book), some form of digital record, or a piece of notebook paper. An official D&D character sheet is a fine place to start until you know what information you need and how you use it during the game.": "在本章中，我们使用的术语（%0%）是指你用来跟踪你的角色的任何东西，无论是正式的角色表（如本书末尾的那个）、某种形式的数字记录，还是一张笔记本纸。正式的D&D角色表是一个很好的开始，直到你知道你需要什么信息以及你在游戏中如何使用它。",
	"Each step of character creation includes an example of that step, with a player named Bob building his dwarf character, Bruenor.": "角色创建的每一步都包括该步骤的一个例子，一个叫鲍勃的玩家建立了他的矮人角色布鲁诺。",
	"Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have {@b subraces}, such as mountain dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races.": "每个角色都属于一个种族，即D&D世界中众多智能类人物种中的一个。最常见的玩家角色种族是矮人、精灵、半身人和人类。有些种族也有（%0%），如山地矮人或木精灵。第二章提供了关于这些种族的更多信息。",
	"The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters.": "你所选择的种族以一种重要的方式对你的角色的身份做出了贡献，它确立了一般的外观以及从文化和祖先那里获得的自然才能。你的角色的种族赋予特定的种族特征，如特殊的感觉、对某些武器或工具的熟练程度、对一种或多种技能的熟练程度，或使用小法术的能力。这些特征有时与某些类别的能力相吻合（见步骤2）。例如，光脚半身人的种族特征使他们成为出色的流氓，而高精灵往往是强大的巫师。有时反类型游戏也很有趣。例如，半身人圣骑士和山地矮人巫师，可以成为不寻常但令人难忘的角色。",
	"Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.": "你的种族也会增加你的一个或多个能力分数，这是你在第3步决定的。注意这些增加的分数，并记住以后要应用它们。",
	"Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well.": "在你的角色表上记录你的种族所赋予的特性。一定要注意你的起始语言和你的基本速度。",

He notes all the racial traits of dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages he knows: Common and Dwarvish.": "鲍勃正坐下来创造他的角色。他决定，一个粗暴的山地矮人适合他想扮演的角色。他在人物表上记下了矮人的所有种族特征，包括他25英尺的速度和他懂得的语言：普通话和矮人语。",
	"Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation. The character classes are described in chapter 3.": "每个冒险者都是一个等级的成员。类别大致描述了一个角色的职业，他或她拥有哪些特殊的才能，以及他或她在探索地牢、与怪物战斗或进行紧张的谈判时最可能采用的战术。第3章描述了角色等级。",
	"Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are {@b class features}-capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of {@b proficiencies:} armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.": "你的角色从你选择的阶级中获得了许多好处。这些好处中有许多是{@b class features}能力（包括法术），使你的角色与其他等级的成员不同。你还获得了一些{@b proficiencies:}盔甲、武器、技能、蓄力术，有时还有工具。你的专长定义了许多你的角色可以做得特别好的事情，从使用某些武器到说一个令人信服的谎言。",

	"Starting off at 1st level marks your character's entry into the adventuring life.

His high Strength and Constitution suggest a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.": "鲍勃填写了布鲁诺的一些基本信息：他的名字，他的性别（男性），他的身高和体重，以及他的取向（合法的好）。他的力量和体质较高，说明他有一个健康的、运动的身体，而他的智力较低，说明他有一定程度的健忘症。",
	"Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny—to reclaim his homeland—so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him.": "鲍勃决定布鲁诺来自一个贵族家庭，但他的家族在布鲁诺很小的时候就被驱逐出了家乡。他从小就在冰风谷的偏远村庄里当铁匠。但是布鲁诺有一个英雄的命运--夺回他的祖国，所以鲍勃为他的矮人选择了民间英雄的背景。他注意到这个背景赋予他的能力和特殊功能。",
	"Bob has a pretty clear picture of Bruenor's personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring, sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is above the law.": "鲍勃对布鲁诺的个性已经有了相当清晰的认识，所以他跳过了民间英雄背景中建议的个性特征，而是指出布鲁诺是一个富有爱心、敏感的矮人，他真正爱他的朋友和盟友，但他将这颗柔软的心隐藏在粗暴、咆哮的举止背后。他从背景列表中选择了公平的理想，指出布鲁诺认为没有人可以凌驾于法律之上。",
	"Given his history, Bruenor's bond is obvious: he aspires to someday reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves out.": "鉴于他的历史，布鲁诺的羁绊是显而易见的：他渴望有一天能从赶走矮人的影子龙手中夺回他的故乡米特拉厅。",
	"His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature—he has a soft spot for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not be warranted.": "他的缺陷与他的关怀、敏感的天性有关，他对孤儿和落魄的灵魂有一种柔软的感觉，导致他即使在可能没有理由的情况下也会施以仁慈。",

Things that contribute to your AC include the armor you wear, the shield you carry, and your Dexterity modifier. Not all characters wear armor or carry shields, however.": "你的{@b Armor Class}(AC)代表你的角色在战斗中避免受伤的程度。对你的攻击力有贡献的东西包括你穿的盔甲、你携带的盾牌和你的灵巧修正值。然而，并不是所有的角色都穿戴盔甲或携带盾牌。",

	"For Bruenor's weapons, Bob chooses a battleaxe and two handaxes. His battleaxe is a melee weapon, so Bruenor uses his Strength modifier for his attacks and damage. His attack bonus is his Strength modifier (+3) plus his proficiency bonus (+2), for a total of +5.": "对于布鲁诺的武器，鲍勃选择了一把战斧和两把手斧。他的战斧是一种近战武器，所以布鲁诺使用他的力量修改器来进行攻击和伤害。他的攻击奖励是他的力量修改器（+3）加上他的熟练度奖励（+2），总共是+5。",
	"The battleaxe deals 1d8 slashing damage, and Bruenor adds his Strength modifier to the damage when he hits, for a total of 1d8 + 3 slashing damage.

	"Most D&D characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role within a {@b party,} a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose.

A character who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is called {@b gaining a level}.": "当你的角色进行冒险和克服挑战时，他或她会获得经验，用经验值表示。一个角色如果达到了指定的经验值总数，其能力就会提高。这种进步被称为（%0%）。",
	"When your character gains a level, his or her class often grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.": "当你的角色获得一个等级时，他或她的等级通常会授予额外的功能，详见等级描述。其中一些特征允许你增加你的能力分数，要么是将两个分数各增加1分，要么是将一个分数增加2分，你不能将能力分数增加到20分以上。此外，每个角色的熟练度奖励在某些级别都会增加。",
	"Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1) to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up).": "每当你获得一个等级，你就获得一个额外的命中率。掷出该命中率骰子，在该骰子上加上你的体质修饰，然后将总数（最小为1）加入你的最大命中率。或者，你也可以使用你的等级条目中显示的固定值，即掷骰子的平均结果（四舍五入）。",
	"When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases by 8.": "当你的宪法修改器增加1时，你每达到一个等级，你的最大命中率就增加1。例如，当布鲁诺达到8级战士时，他的体质分数从17分提高到18分，从而使他的体质修正值从+3提高到+4。他的最大命中率就会增加8。",

	"{@b In the first tier (levels 1-4),} characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard's Arcane Tradition or a fighter's Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages.": "{@b In the first tier (levels 1-4),}的角色实际上是学徒冒险家。他们正在学习定义他们为特定阶级成员的特征，包括随着他们的进步而影响其阶级特征的主要选择（例如巫师的奥术传统或战士的武术类型）。他们所面临的威胁相对较小，通常对当地的农庄或村庄构成危险。",
	"{@b In the second tier (levels 5-10),} characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as {@spell fireball} and {@spell lightning bolt}. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms.": "{@b In the second tier (levels 5-10),}的角色开始进入自己的行列。许多施法者在本层开始时获得了三级法术，通过{@spell fireball}和{@spell lightning bolt}等法术跨越了魔法力量的新门槛。在这一层，许多使用武器的等级获得了在一个回合内进行多次攻击的能力。这些角色已经变得很重要，面临着威胁到城市和王国的危险。",
	"{@b In the third tier (levels 11-16),} characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents.": "{@b In the third tier (levels 11-16),}的角色已经达到了一种力量水平，使他们高于普通民众，甚至在冒险者中也很特别。在11级时，许多施法者获得了6级法术的能力，其中一些法术创造了以前玩家角色无法实现的效果。其他角色则获得了允许他们进行更多攻击或用这些攻击做更多令人印象深刻的事情的特性。这些强大的冒险家经常面对整个地区和大陆的威胁。",
	"{@b At the fourth tier (levels 17-20),} characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.": "{@b At the fourth tier (levels 17-20),}的角色达到了他们等级特征的巅峰，成为他们自己的英雄（或反派）原型。在他们的冒险过程中，世界的命运甚至是多元宇宙的基本秩序都可能悬于一线。",
	"A visit to one of the great cities in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons—Waterdeep, the Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants.": "参观《龙与地下城》世界中的一个伟大的城市--水底世界、灰鹰自由城，甚至是不可思议的西格尔，门之城，都会让人感觉到不胜其烦。人们用无数种不同的语言喋喋不休。几十种不同菜系的烹饪气味与拥挤的街道和糟糕的卫生状况的气味混杂在一起。各种建筑风格的建筑物显示了其居民的不同起源。",
	"And the people themselves—people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and hues—represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities.": "而这些人本身--大小不一、形状各异、肤色各异的人，穿着令人眼花缭乱的风格和色调--代表了许多不同的种族，从矮小的半身人和粗壮的矮人到威严美丽的精灵，混杂在各种人类种族中。",
	"Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drow—a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. The Player's Handbook has more information about these unusual races.": "在这些比较常见的种族成员中，散布着真正的异类：这里有一个笨重的龙裔，在人群中挤来挤去，那里有一个狡猾的铁弗林，潜伏在阴影中，眼中充满恶作剧。一群地精笑着说，他们中的一个人启动了一个聪明的木制玩具，它自己会动。半精灵和半兽人与人类一起生活和工作，不完全属于他们父母的种族。在那里，远离阳光的地方，有一个孤独的乌鸦--一个来自地下世界的逃亡者，试图在一个害怕他的种族的世界里闯出一片天地。玩家手册》中有更多关于这些不寻常种族的信息。",
	"The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this list are uncommon. They don't exist in every world of D&D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren't accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly.": "龙裔和本列表中的其他种族都是不常见的。他们并不存在于D&D的每一个世界，即使在他们被发现的地方，他们也没有矮人、精灵、半身人和人类那么普遍。在D&D多元宇宙的国际大都市中，大多数人对最奇特的种族成员都不会多看两眼。但遍布乡村的小城镇和村庄则不同。普通人不习惯看到这些种族的成员，他们会做出相应的反应。",
	"It's easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.": "人们很容易认为龙裔是个怪物，尤其是当他或她的鳞片暴露出色泽的遗产时。不过，除非龙裔开始喷火并造成破坏，否则人们可能会谨慎应对，而不是直接恐惧。",
	"Gnomes don't look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.": "地精看起来并不像个威胁，而且可以用良好的幽默感迅速解除人们的怀疑。普通人常常对地精感到好奇，他们可能从未见过地精，但他们很少有敌意或恐惧。",
	"Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger's arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity.": "尽管许多人从未见过半精灵，但几乎所有人都知道他们的存在。一个半精灵陌生人的到来会引起半精灵背后的闲言碎语和公共房间里的偷瞄，而不是任何对抗或公开的好奇心。",
	"It's usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon.": "通常可以认为半兽人好战，而且很快就会发怒，所以人们在陌生的半兽人身边会小心谨慎。当半兽人进来时，店主可能会偷偷藏起贵重或脆弱的货物，人们慢慢地离开酒馆，以为很快就会发生战斗。",
	"Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.": "半兽人受到了实际的谨慎对待，但铁弗林则是超自然的恐惧对象。在他们的特征中可以清楚地看到他们的遗产的邪恶，就大多数人而言，一个铁弗林很可能是一个直接来自九层地狱的魔鬼。人们可能会在铁弗林靠近时做出防护标志，过马路以避免靠近，或者在铁弗林进入商店之前把门堵上。",
	"Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples.": "人类是D&D世界中最常见的民族，但他们与矮人、精灵、半身人和无数其他神奇物种一起生活和工作。你的角色属于这些民族中的一个。",
	"Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Other races and subraces are less common as adventurers.": "并非多元宇宙的每个智慧种族都适合玩家控制的冒险者。矮人、精灵、半身人和人类是最常见的种族，他们产生的冒险者组成了典型的派对。其他种族和亚种族作为冒险者则不太常见。",
	"Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career.": "你对种族的选择会影响你角色的许多不同方面。它确立了存在于你的角色的整个冒险生涯中的基本品质。",
	"When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic.": "在做这个决定的时候，要记住你想扮演的角色的种类。例如，半身人可以成为一个狡猾的游荡者的好选择，矮人可以成为一个坚韧的战士，而精灵可以成为一个奥术魔法大师。",
	"Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story.

It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality.": "这些细节是帮助你思考你的角色的建议；冒险家可以广泛地偏离他们种族的标准。值得考虑的是，为什么你的角色会与众不同，这是思考你的角色的背景和个性的一个有用的方法。",

	"Every race increases one or more of a character's ability scores.": "每个种族都会增加一个或多个角色的能力分数。",
	"The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.": "年龄条目指出了该种族成员被认为是成年人的年龄，以及该种族的预期寿命。这些信息可以帮助你决定你的角色在游戏开始时是多大年龄。你可以为你的角色选择任何年龄，这可以为你的一些能力分数提供解释。例如，如果你扮演一个年轻或非常老的角色，你的年龄可以解释一个特别低的力量或体质分数，而高龄可以解释一个高的智力或智慧。",
	"Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall.": "大多数种族的角色都是中型，这个尺寸类别包括大约4到8英尺高的生物。",
	"Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 5.": "有几个种族的成员是小个子（身高在2至4英尺之间），这意味着游戏的某些规则对他们的影响不同。这些规则中最重要的是，小个子角色在挥舞重武器方面有困难，这一点在第5章中有所解释。",
	"Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9).": "你的速度决定了你在旅行（第8章）和战斗（第9章）时能移动多远。",
	"By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the D&D multiverse.": "根据你的种族，你的角色可以说、读、写某些语言。第四章列出了D&D多元宇宙中最常见的语言。",
	"Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms, they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively.": "有些种族有亚种族。子种族的成员除了具有母种族的特征外，还具有为其子种族规定的特征。亚种族之间的关系因种族和世界的不同而大不相同。例如，在《龙之谷》的战役设定中，山地矮人和丘陵矮人作为同一民族的不同部族生活在一起，但在《被遗忘的领域》中，他们在不同的王国中生活得很远，并分别自称为盾牌矮人和黄金矮人。",
	"Adventurers are extraordinary people, driven by a thirst for excitement into a life that others would never dare lead. They are heroes, compelled to explore the dark places of the world and take on the challenges that lesser women and men can't stand against.": "冒险家是不寻常的人，在对刺激的渴求驱使下，过着别人永远不敢过的生活。他们是英雄，被迫探索世界上的黑暗之地，接受较小的女人和男人无法抵挡的挑战。",
	"Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It's more than a profession; it's your character's calling. Class shapes the way you think about the world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god's unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith.": "等级是对你的角色能做什么的主要定义。它不仅仅是一种职业；它是你的角色的召唤。等级塑造了你思考世界和与之互动的方式，以及你与多元宇宙中其他人和力量的关系。例如，一个战士可能从战略和机动的角度来看待这个世界，并把自己看作是一个更大的游戏中的小卒子。相比之下，牧师可能会把自己看成是神的计划中的一个自愿的仆人，或者是各种神灵之间酝酿的冲突。斗士在佣兵公司或军队中有联系，而牧师则可能认识一些与他信仰相同的牧师、圣骑士和信徒。",
	"Your class gives you a variety of special features, such as a fighter's mastery of weapons and armor, and a wizard's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve.": "你的等级赋予你各种特殊功能，例如战士对武器和盔甲的掌握，以及巫师的法术。在低级别的时候，你的等级只给你两到三个特征，但随着你等级的提高，你会获得更多的特征，你现有的特征往往会得到改善。",

Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously. Optional rules for combining classes in this way, called multiclassing, can be found in the Chapter 6.": "冒险者有时会在一个以上的等级中前进。一个流氓可能在生活中转换方向，涉足牧师类，同时继续作为一个流氓前进。众所周知，精灵会将武术掌握与魔法训练结合起来，同时作为战士和巫师晋级。以这种方式组合类别的可选规则，称为多类，可以在第六章中找到。",

	"Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They're individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points of personality and alignment.": "角色的定义远远超过他们的种族和阶级。他们是独立的个体，有自己的故事、兴趣、联系和能力，超越了阶级和种族的定义。本章阐述了区分角色的细节，包括名字和身体描述的基础知识、背景和语言的规则，以及个性和排列的细微差别。",
	"Your character's name and physical description might be the first things that the other players at the table learn about you. It's worth thinking about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind.": "你的角色的名字和身体描述可能是同桌的其他玩家最先了解你的事情。值得思考的是，这些特征如何反映你心中的角色。",
	"Your character's race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list.": "你的角色的种族描述包括该种族成员的名字样本。即使你只是从列表中挑选一个，也要对你的名字进行一些思考。",
	"You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave society and come to the surface.": "你可以扮演一个男性或女性角色而不获得任何特殊的好处或阻碍。想一想你的角色如何符合或不符合更广泛的文化对性、性别和性行为的期望。例如，一个男性乌鸦教士违背了乌鸦社会的传统性别划分，这可能是你的角色离开社会并来到地面的一个原因。",
	"You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide.": "你不需要局限于性和性别的二元概念。例如，精灵之神科雷隆-拉雷蒂安（Corellon Larethian）经常被视为雌雄同体或雌雄同体，多元宇宙中的一些精灵是按照科雷隆的形象制造的。你也可以扮演一个把自己表现为男人的女性角色，一个感觉被困在女性身体里的男人，或者一个讨厌被误认为男性的大胡子女矮人。同样，你的角色的性取向也由你决定。",
	"The details in this chapter make a big difference in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following two human fighters.": "本章中的细节在将你的角色与其他所有角色区分开来方面有很大的不同。请考虑以下两个人类战士的情况。",
	"Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from home and practiced her father's trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragon armies laid waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into adventure alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood. Her skill as a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.": "蒂卡-韦兰来自《龙之谷》的背景，她是一个粗鲁的少年，有一个艰难的童年。作为一个小偷的女儿，她离家出走，在索拉斯的街头从事她父亲的生意。当她试图抢劫 \"最后的家 \"旅馆的老板时，他抓住了她，并将她收归麾下，给了她一份酒吧女郎的工作。但是，当龙族军队浪费了索拉斯镇并摧毁了旅馆时，必要性迫使蒂卡与她从小就认识的朋友一起冒险。她作为一个战士的技能（煎锅仍然是她最喜欢的武器之一）与她在街头的经历相结合，使她的技能在她的冒险生涯中非常宝贵。",
	"Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Cailmport in the Forgotten Realms. He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one of the city's hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted the notice of one of the most powerful thieves' guilds in the city, and he ascended the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored assassin of one of the city's pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to recover some stolen gems. He's a professional killer, constantly challenging himself to improve his skills.": "阿特米斯-恩崔立在被遗忘的领域中的凯尔波特的街道上长大。他利用自己的智慧、力量和敏捷性，在这个城市的数百个贫穷的棚户区中开辟了自己的领地。几年后，他吸引了该市最强大的盗贼公会之一的注意，尽管他很年轻，但他很快就在公会里升职了。阿特米斯成为了城市中一个帕夏的宠儿，帕夏派他去遥远的冰风谷找回一些被盗的宝石。他是一个职业杀手，不断挑战自己以提高自己的技能。",
	"Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity scores, but there the similarity ends.": "蒂卡和阿尔特弥斯都是人类，都是战士（有一些当流氓的经验），拥有类似的高力量和灵巧得分，但相似之处也就到此为止。",
	"You can decide your character's height and weight, using the information provided in your race description or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy.": "你可以使用你的种族描述中提供的信息或随机高度和体重表来决定你的角色的身高和体重。想一想你的角色的能力分数可能说明他或她的身高和体重。一个弱小但敏捷的角色可能很瘦。一个强壮而坚韧的角色可能很高，或者只是很重。",
	"If you want to, you can roll randomly for your character's height and weight using the Random Height and Weight table.": "如果你愿意，你可以用随机身高和体重表来随机滚动你的角色的身高和体重。",
	"The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.": "身高修改器一栏中的骰子决定了角色在基本身高之外的额外高度（英寸）。同样的数字乘以骰子的掷法或重量修改栏中给出的数量，决定了角色在基本重量之外的额外重量（以磅为单位）。",
	"For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches. Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds. Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 × 3) on top of her base 110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds.": "例如，作为一个人类，蒂卡的身高是4英尺8英寸，外加2d10英寸。她的玩家掷出2d10，得到的总数是12，所以蒂卡站在5英尺8英寸高。然后，玩家用同样的12的卷子，乘以2d4磅。她的2d4卷是3，所以蒂卡在她的基本体重110磅的基础上又增加了36磅（12×3），总重量为146磅。",
	"You choose your character's age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo.": "你可以选择你的角色的年龄以及他或她的头发、眼睛和皮肤的颜色。为了增加与众不同的感觉，你可能想给你的角色一个不寻常的或令人难忘的身体特征，如一个疤痕、一个跛脚或一个纹身。",
	"Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities. Tika is a young woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more, and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an exotic land and carries a more mysterious name. Tika is nineteen years old at the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems in need of a shave. His raven black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are gray and lifeless—betraying the emptiness of his life and soul.": "考虑一下蒂卡-韦兰和阿特米斯-恩崔立这两个名字是如何将这些人物区别开来并反映出他们的个性的。蒂卡是一个年轻的女人，决心证明她不再只是一个孩子，她的名字使她听起来年轻而普通。阿特米斯-恩崔立来自异国他乡，带着一个更加神秘的名字。蒂卡在冒险生涯开始时有19岁，有一头乌黑的头发，绿色的眼睛，皮肤白皙，有雀斑，右臀部有一颗痣。阿特米斯是一个小个子男人，身材紧凑，浑身是毛的肌肉。他有棱角分明的五官和高颧骨，而且他似乎总是需要刮胡子。他的乌鸦黑发浓密而饱满，但他的眼睛是灰色的，毫无生气--掩盖了他生命和灵魂的空虚。",
	"A typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral).": "在《龙与地下城》的世界中，一个典型的生物有一个排列组合，大致描述了其道德和个人态度。结盟是两个因素的组合：一个是确定道德（善、恶、或中立），另一个是描述对社会和秩序的态度（合法、混乱、或中立）。",
	"Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.": "因此，九个不同的排列组合定义了可能的组合。",
	"These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.": "这些关于九种排列组合的简要总结描述了具有该排列组合的生物的典型行为。个人的行为可能与这种典型的行为有很大的不同，很少有人能完美地、持续地忠实于他们的排列组合的戒律。",
	"{@b Lawful good} (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons and paladins are typically lawful good.": "{@b Lawful good} (LG)生物可以被指望按照社会的期望做正确的事情。金龙和圣骑士是典型的合法善人。",
	"{@b Neutral good} (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials are neutral good.": "{@b Neutral good}(NG)的民间人士根据自己的需要，尽力帮助他人。许多天人都是中立的好人。",
	"{@b Chaotic good} (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons and unicorns are typically chaotic good.": "{@b Chaotic good} (CG)生物按照他们的良心指示行事，很少考虑其他人的期望。铜龙和独角兽是典型的混沌善良。",
	"{@b Lawful neutral} (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Modrons and many wizards and monks are lawful neutral.": "{@b Lawful neutral} (LN)个人按照法律、传统或个人守则行事。莫德隆和许多巫师和僧侣都是合法中立的。",
	"{@b Neutral} (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Druids are traditionally neutral, as are typical townsfolk.": "{@b Neutral} (N)是那些喜欢避开道德问题，不偏袒任何一方，做当时看起来最好的事情的人的排列组合。德鲁伊在传统上是中立的，典型的镇民也是如此。",
	"{@b Chaotic neutral} (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many rogues and bards are chaotic neutral.": "{@b Chaotic neutral}(CN)生物遵循他们的奇思妙想，将个人自由置于一切之上。许多流氓和吟游诗人是混乱中立的。",
	"{@b Lawful evil} (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils and blue dragons are typically lawful evil.": "{@b Lawful evil} (LE)生物在传统、忠诚或秩序准则的限制下，有条不紊地夺取他们想要的东西。魔鬼和蓝龙通常是合法的邪恶。",
	"{@b Neutral evil} (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Yugoloths are typically neutral evil.": "{@b Neutral evil}(NE)是那些为所欲为，没有同情心和顾虑的人的取向。裕固族是典型的中性邪恶。",
	"{@b Chaotic evil} (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons and red dragons are typically chaotic evil.": "{@b Chaotic evil}(CE)生物在贪婪、仇恨或嗜血的刺激下，会任意采取暴力行动。恶魔和红龙是典型的混沌邪恶。",
	"For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other people can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the gods who created these folk gave them free will to choose their moral paths.": "对于许多有思想的生物来说，结盟是一种道德上的选择。人类、矮人、精灵和其他人可以选择是否遵循善或恶、法律或混乱的道路。根据神话，创造这些民俗的神明给了他们自由意志来选择他们的道德道路。",
	"Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. Both types of creatures are associated with metaphysical planes of existence—specifically the Outer Planes—that embody certain alignments. For example, most devils hail from the Nine Hells, a plane of lawful evil. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil or tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceases to be lawful evil, it changes into something new—a transformation worthy of legend.": "结盟是天人和魔人本质的一个重要部分。这两种类型的生物都与存在的形而上学平面有关--特别是外部平面--体现了某些排列组合。例如，大多数恶魔来自九层地狱，一个合法的邪恶平面。魔鬼不会选择成为合法的邪恶或倾向于合法的邪恶，而是在其本质上是合法的邪恶。如果它在某种程度上不再是合法的邪恶，它就会变成新的东西--值得传说的转变。",
	"Generally, evil alignments are for villains and monsters.": "一般来说，邪恶派是为恶棍和怪物准备的。",
	"A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.": "魔鬼不会选择成为合法的恶，它也不会倾向于合法的恶，而是在本质上是合法的恶。如果它在某种程度上不再是合法的邪恶，它就不再是一个魔鬼。",
	"Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are {@b unaligned}. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.": "大多数缺乏理性思维能力的生物都没有排列组合，它们是（%0%）。这样的生物没有能力做出道德或伦理的选择，而是按照其兽性行事。例如，鲨鱼是野蛮的捕食者，但它们并不邪恶；它们没有结盟。",
	"Tika Waylan is neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but at least professional in his approach to murder. As an evil character, Artemis is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates with heroes when he must—and when it's in his own best interests. In most games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don't share their interests and objectives.": "蒂卡-韦兰是中立的善，从根本上说是心地善良，并努力在她能做到的地方帮助他人。阿特米斯是合法的邪恶，不关心有生命的价值，但至少在谋杀方面很专业。作为一个邪恶的角色，阿特米斯不是一个理想的冒险家。他的职业生涯是从反派开始的，只有在必要时才与英雄合作--而且是在符合他自己的最佳利益时。在大多数游戏中，邪恶的冒险者在与其他不认同他们的利益和目标的人一起的团体中会造成问题。",
	"Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.": "你的种族表明你的角色默认能说的语言，而你的背景可能让你获得一种或多种你选择的额外语言。在你的角色表上注明这些语言。",

Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.": "充实你的角色的个性--赋予一个人独特身份的一系列特征、举止、习惯、信仰和缺陷--将帮助你在玩游戏时把他或她带入生活。这里介绍了四类特征：个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷。除了这些类别之外，还可以考虑你的角色最喜欢的单词或短语、抽搐和习惯性动作、恶习和小毛病，以及其他你能想象到的东西。",

	"Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. \"I'm smart\" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. \"I've read every book in Candlekeep\" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition.": "赋予你的角色两个个性特征。个性特征是帮助你将你的角色与其他角色区分开来的小而简单的方法。你的个性特征应该告诉你关于你的角色的一些有趣的和好玩的东西。它们应该是自我描述，具体说明是什么让你的角色脱颖而出。\"我很聪明 \"并不是一个好的特征，因为它描述了很多人物。\"我读过Candlekeep的每一本书 \"告诉你关于你的角色的兴趣和性格的具体内容。",
	"Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.": "性格特征可能描述你的角色喜欢的东西，他或她过去的成就，你的角色不喜欢或害怕的东西，你的角色的自我态度或举止，或他或她的能力分数的影响。",
	"A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score.": "思考人格特质的一个有用的起点是看一下你的最高分和最低分，然后定义一个与之相关的特质。任何一个都可以是积极的或消极的：例如，你可能会努力工作以克服低分，或者对你的高分感到狂妄。",
	"Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system.": "描述驱动你性格的一个理想。你的理想是你最坚信的东西，是迫使你如此行事的基本道德和伦理原则。理想包括从你的生活目标到你的核心信仰系统的一切。",

	"You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives.": "你可以选择任何你喜欢的理想，但你的角色定位是一个开始定义它们的好地方。本章的每个背景都包括六个建议的理想。其中五个与结盟方面有关：法律、混乱、善、恶和中立。最后一项与特定的背景有关，而不是与道德或伦理观点有关。",
	"Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals.": "为你的角色创建一个纽带。纽带代表一个人物与世界上的人、地方和事件的联系。它们将你与你的背景事物联系起来。它们可能会激励你达到英雄主义的高度，或者在你的利益受到威胁时导致你采取违背自己利益的行动。它们的作用非常类似于理想，推动人物的动机和目标。",

	"Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What are your vices?": "最后，为你的角色选择一个缺陷。你的角色的缺陷代表了某种恶习、强迫症、恐惧或弱点--特别是别人可以利用的任何东西，使你走向毁灭或使你的行为违背你的最佳利益。比起消极的个性特征，缺陷可能会回答这些问题中的任何一个。什么会激怒你？什么是你所害怕的人、概念或事件？你的恶习是什么？",
	"Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves with quick, precise confidence.": "蒂卡和阿尔特弥斯有明显的个性特征。蒂卡-韦兰（Tika Waylan）不喜欢夸夸其谈，而且由于她在做贼的过程中摔了一跤，所以有恐高症。阿特米斯-恩崔立（Artemis Entreri）总是做好最坏的打算，行动迅速、准确自信。",
	"Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent, almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect. Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased \"I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.\"Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, might have led a life more like the heroic drow's. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as \"I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do'Urden.\"Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago.

At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.": "只有在你有弹药可以发射的情况下，你才能使用具有弹药属性的武器进行远程攻击。每次你用该武器进行攻击，你都要消耗一块弹药。从箭筒、箱子或其他容器中提取弹药是攻击的一部分（你需要一只空手来装载单手武器）。在战斗结束时，你可以通过花一分钟时间搜索战场来恢复你消耗的一半弹药。",

	"Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver.

Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.": "被网击中的大型或小型生物会受到（%0%）的影响，直到它被释放。网对无形的生物或巨大或更大的生物没有影响。一个生物可以用它的行动来进行DC10力量检查，如果成功，就可以释放它自己或在它范围内的另一个生物。对网造成5次砍击伤害（AC10）也能释放生物而不伤害它，结束效果并摧毁网。当你使用行动、奖励行动或反应来用网进行攻击时，你只能进行一次攻击，而不考虑你通常可以进行的攻击次数。",

For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses.

Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.": "你可以把你在吟游诗人、牧师、德鲁伊、巫师和魔法师等级中的所有等级加在一起，把你在圣骑士和游侠等级中的一半等级（四舍五入）加在一起，如果你有长生骑士或奥术术士的特征，则把你的战士或无赖等级的三分之一（四舍五入）加在一起。用这个总数来确定你的法术槽，参考多类法术师表。",

So a character who has proficiency in the {@skill Stealth} skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.": "例如，灵巧检查可能反映了一个角色试图完成一个杂技特技，掌击一个物体，或保持隐藏。灵巧的每个方面都有一个相关的技能。(分别是（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。所以一个精通{@skill Stealth}技能的人物特别擅长与潜行和隐藏有关的灵巧检查。",
	"The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this chapter for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.": "与每个能力分数相关的技能在下面的列表中显示。(关于如何使用与能力相关的技能的例子，请参见本章后面章节中的能力描述。",
	"Sometimes, the DM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, \"Make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.\" At other times, a player might ask the DM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.": "有时，管理员可能会要求使用特定的技能进行能力检查--例如，\"进行智慧（（%0%））检查\"。在其他时候，玩家可能会问DM，某个特定技能的熟练度是否适用于检查。在这两种情况下，精通某项技能意味着一个人可以在涉及该技能的能力检查中加入他或她的熟练度奖励。如果没有熟练掌握该技能，个人就会进行正常的能力检查。",
	"For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the Dungeon Master might ask for a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. If the character is proficient in {@skill Athletics}, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.": "例如，如果一个角色试图爬上一个危险的悬崖，地下城管理员可能会要求进行力量（（%0%））检查。如果该角色精通{@skill Athletics}，那么该角色的熟练度奖励就会加到力量检查中。如果角色缺乏这种熟练度，他或她只是进行力量检查。",
	"Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in {@skill Athletics}, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in {@skill Athletics} and ask for a Constitution ({@skill Athletics}) check. So if you're proficient in {@skill Athletics}, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "通常情况下，你对某项技能的熟练程度只适用于某种特定的能力检查。例如，熟练掌握（%0%），通常适用于力量检查。但在某些情况下，你的熟练度可能合理地适用于不同种类的检查。在这种情况下，管理员可能会要求用不寻常的能力和技能组合进行检查，或者你可能会问你的管理员是否可以将熟练度应用于不同的检查。例如，如果你必须从一个近海岛屿游到大陆，你的管理员可能会要求进行宪法检查，看你是否有足够的耐力游那么远。在这种情况下，你的经理可能会允许你运用你对{@skill Athletics}的熟练程度，并要求你进行宪法({@skill Athletics})检查。因此，如果你精通{@skill Athletics}，你就把你的熟练度加成应用于体质检查，就像你通常对力量({@skill Athletics})检查所做的那样。",
	"Similarly, when your dwarf fighter uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ({@skill Intimidation}) check, even though {@skill Intimidation} is normally associated with Charisma.": "同样地，当你的矮人战士使用原始力量的展示来恐吓敌人时，你的DM可能会要求进行力量（（%0%））检查，尽管（%1%）通常与魅力有关。",
	"A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the DM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.": "被动检查是一种特殊的能力检查，不涉及任何掷骰。这种检查可以代表重复完成的任务的平均结果，比如反复寻找秘密的门，或者可以用于DM想秘密地确定人物是否成功，而不需要掷骰子，比如注意到一个隐藏的怪物。",
	"Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:": "下面是如何确定一个角色的被动检查的总分。",
	"If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.": "如果该角色在检查中具有优势，则加5；如果是劣势，则减5。游戏将被动检查的总数称为分数。",
	"For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in {@skill Perception}, he or she has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 14.": "例如，如果一个1级人物的智慧是15，并且精通（%0%），那么他或她的被动智慧（（%1%））得分是14。",
	"The rules on hiding in the \"Dexterity\" section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules in chapter 8.": "下面 \"灵巧 \"一节中关于藏匿的规则依赖于被动检查，第八章中的探索规则也是如此。",
	"Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the {@action Help} action (see chapter 9).": "有时，两个或更多的角色会联合起来尝试一项任务。领导这项工作的角色--或者能力修饰值最高的角色--可以以优势进行能力检查，反映出其他角色所提供的帮助。在战斗中，这需要（%0%）的行动（见第9章）。",
	"A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.": "一个角色只有在他或她可以单独尝试的任务中才可以提供帮助。例如，试图打开一个锁需要熟练掌握盗贼的工具，所以一个缺乏这种能力的角色不能帮助另一个角色完成这项任务。此外，只有当两个或更多的人一起工作才会有成效时，一个角色才可以帮忙。有些任务，如穿针引线，在帮助下也不会更容易。",
	"When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.": "当一些人试图作为一个团体完成某件事时，DM可能会要求进行团体能力检查。在这种情况下，擅长某项任务的人物会帮助掩护那些不擅长的人。",
	"To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.": "要进行团体能力检查，团体中的每个人都要进行能力检查。如果至少有一半的人成功了，整个团体就成功了。否则，整个团体就会失败。",
	"Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.": "团体检查并不经常出现，当所有角色作为一个团体成功或失败时，它们最有用。例如，当冒险家们在沼泽地里航行时，DM可能会要求进行团体智慧（（%0%））检查，看看角色们是否能避开流沙、天坑和其他环境中的自然危险。如果至少有一半的人成功了，那么成功的人物就能够引导他们的同伴脱离危险。否则，这群人就会绊倒在这些危险中的一个。",
	"Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.": "一个角色或怪物在游戏中可能尝试的每项任务都由六种能力中的一种来涵盖。本节更详细地解释了这些能力的含义以及它们在游戏中的使用方法。",
	"Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.": "力量衡量身体的力量，运动训练，以及你能发挥原始体力的程度。",
	"A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The {@skill Athletics} skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.": "力量检查可以模拟任何试图举起、推、拉、或打破某样东西的行为，迫使你的身体穿过一个空间，或以其他方式将蛮力用于某种情况。{@skill Athletics}技能反映了在某些类型的力量检查方面的能力。",
	"Your Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:": "你的力量({@skill Athletics})检查涵盖你在攀爬、跳跃或游泳时遇到的困难情况。例子包括以下活动。",

	"You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.": "当你使用近战武器（如狼牙棒、战斧或标枪）进行攻击时，你的攻击卷和伤害卷都会加上你的力量修饰。你使用近战武器在徒手搏斗中进行近战攻击，其中一些武器可以被投掷来进行远程攻击。",
	"Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.": "你的力量得分决定了你能承受的重量。以下术语定义了你能举起或携带的东西。",
	"Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.": "你的承载能力是你的力量值乘以15。这是你可以携带的重量（以磅为单位），它足够高，大多数人物通常不必担心这个问题。",
	"You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.": "你可以推、拖或举起以磅为单位的重量，最多是你的承载力的两倍（或你力量得分的30倍）。在推或拖动超过你承载能力的重量时，你的速度会下降到5英尺。",
	"Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.": "较大的生物可以承受更多的重量，而微小的生物可以承受更少的重量。对于中型以上的每一个体型类别，该生物的承载能力和它可以推、拖、举的重量都要加倍。对于微小的生物，这些重量减半。",
	"The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment.

	"If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.": "如果你携带的重量超过你力量值的5倍，你就会被束缚，这意味着你的速度会下降10英尺。",
	"If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.": "如果你携带的重量超过你力量得分的10倍，达到你的最大承载量，你就会被重重地束缚住，这意味着你的速度会下降20英尺，而且你在使用力量、灵巧或体质的能力检查、攻击卷和蓄力时有劣势。",

	"When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check with that creature's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.": "当你藏起来的时候，即使有人没有搜索，也有可能会注意到你。要确定这样的生物是否注意到你，DM将你的灵巧（（%0%））检查与该生物的被动智慧（（%1%））得分相比较，后者等于10+该生物的智慧修正值，以及任何其他奖励或惩罚。如果该生物有优势，则加5；如果有劣势，则减5。",

	"If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.": "如果你的宪法修改器改变了，你的最大命中率也会改变，就像你从第一级开始就有新的修改器一样。例如，如果你在四级时提高了你的体质分数，并且你的体质修改器从+1增加到+2，你就会调整你的最大命中率，就像修改器一直是+2一样。所以你在前三层增加3点命中率，然后在第四层用新的修改器滚动你的命中率。或者，如果你是第7级，而某种效果降低了你的体质分数，从而使你的体质修改器减少了1，那么你的最大命中率就减少了7。",

Such a check can be used to find hidden details or other information and clues that you might otherwise overlook.": "当你的角色寻找一个隐藏的物体，如一个秘密的门或一个陷阱时，DM通常要求你进行智慧（（%0%））检查。这样的检查可以用来发现隐藏的细节或其他你可能会忽略的信息和线索。",
	"In most cases, you need to describe where you are looking in order for the DM to determine your chance of success. For example, a key is hidden beneath a set of folded clothes in the top drawer of a bureau. If you tell the DM that you pace around the room, looking at the walls and furniture for clues, you have no chance of finding the key, regardless of your Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check result. You would have to specify that you were opening the drawers or searching the bureau in order to have any chance of success.": "在大多数情况下，你需要描述你正在寻找的地方，以便让DM确定你的成功机会。例如，一把钥匙藏在办公室最上面的抽屉里的一套折叠的衣服下面。如果你告诉DM，你在房间里走来走去，在墙壁和家具上寻找线索，那么无论你的智慧（（%0%））检查结果如何，你都没有机会找到钥匙。你必须说明你是在打开抽屉或搜查书房，这样才有可能成功。",

	"Your Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.": "你的魅力({@skill Deception})检查决定了你是否能令人信服地隐藏真相，无论是口头上还是通过你的行动。这种欺骗可以包括一切，从通过模棱两可的方式误导他人，到公然撒谎。典型的情况包括：试图与卫兵快速交谈，欺骗商人，通过赌博赚钱，伪装自己，用虚假的保证来消除别人的怀疑，或者在说公然的谎言时保持坦然。",
	"When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check.

Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.": "当你试图用策略、社交礼仪或善良的天性来影响某人或某群人时，管理员可能会要求你进行魅力（（%0%））检查。通常情况下，当你出于善意行事时，你会使用劝说，以促进友谊，提出亲切的要求，或表现出适当的礼节。说服他人的例子包括说服内侍让你的队伍去见国王，在交战的部落之间进行和平谈判，或者激励一群镇民。",

	"In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important, the DM determines the time a task requires. The DM might use a different time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of minutes. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway, another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall, and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything interesting or valuable.": "在追踪时间流逝很重要的情况下，DM决定一项任务所需的时间。DM可能会根据手头的情况使用不同的时间尺度。在地牢环境中，冒险者的行动是以分钟为单位进行的。他们要花一分钟时间爬下一条长长的走廊，再花一分钟时间检查走廊尽头的门上是否有陷阱，还要花十分钟时间搜索走廊外的房间，寻找任何有趣或有价值的东西。",
	"In a city or wilderness, a scale of hours is often more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.": "在城市或荒野中，以小时为单位的比例往往更合适。渴望到达森林中心的孤塔的冒险家们在不到四个小时的时间内匆匆穿过这15英里。",

	"The DM can summarize the adventurers' movement without calculating exact distances or travel times: \"You travel through the forest and find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.\" Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the DM can summarize movement between encounters: \"After killing the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\" Sometimes it's important, though, to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they're moving over.": "DM可以总结冒险者的行动，而不计算确切的距离或旅行时间。\"你们穿过森林，在第三天的傍晚找到了地牢的入口。\" 即使在地牢中，特别是大型地牢或洞穴网络中，DM也可以总结遭遇之间的运动。\"在杀死古代矮人据点入口处的守护者后，你查阅了地图，它引导你穿过数英里的回声走廊，来到一个由狭窄的石拱门连接的鸿沟。\" 不过有时候，知道从一个地方到另一个地方需要多长时间也很重要，不管答案是以天、小时还是分钟为单位。确定旅行时间的规则取决于两个因素：移动的生物的速度和旅行步伐以及它们所经过的地形。",
	"Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-threatening situation.": "每个角色和怪物都有一个速度，它是角色或怪物在1个回合内可以行走的距离，单位是英尺。这个数字是假设在有生命危险的情况下进行短时间的精力充沛的运动。",
	"The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.": "以下规则决定了一个角色或怪物在一分钟、一小时或一天内可以移动多远。",
	"While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the \"Activity While Traveling\" section later in this chapter for more information).": "在旅行时，一群冒险者可以以正常、快速或缓慢的速度移动，如旅行速度表所示。该表说明了一行人在一段时期内可以走多远，以及步伐是否有任何影响。快步走会使人物的感知力下降，而慢步走则可以潜行，并更仔细地搜索一个区域（更多信息见本章后面的 \"旅行中的活动 \"部分）。",

	"For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.": "在短时间内（最多一个小时），许多动物的行动比人类快得多。一个骑马的角色可以以奔跑的速度骑行约一个小时，以快速的速度覆盖两倍于通常的距离。如果每隔8到10英里就有新的坐骑，角色就可以以这种速度完成更远的距离，但这是非常罕见的，除非在人口稠密的地区。",

	"The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered difficult terrain.": "旅行速度表中给出的旅行速度是假设相对简单的地形：道路、开阔的平原或清晰的地牢走廊。但是冒险者经常会面临密林、深沼泽、充满瓦砾的废墟、陡峭的山脉和冰雪覆盖的地面--所有这些都被视为困难的地形。",
	"You move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.": "你在困难的地形中以半速移动--在困难的地形中移动1英尺需要2英尺的速度--所以你在一分钟、一小时或一天内只能走完正常距离的一半。",
	"Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.": "在危险的地下城或荒野地区的行动往往不只是简单的行走。冒险者可能要通过攀爬、爬行、游泳或跳跃来到达他们需要去的地方。",

You ignore this extra cost if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb, or a swimming speed and use it to swim. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "当你在攀爬、游泳或爬行时，每移动一英尺都要花费1英尺的额外费用（2英尺的额外费用（%0%））。如果你有攀爬速度并且用它来攀爬，或者有游泳速度并且用它来游泳，你就可以忽略这个额外的费用。在DM的选择下，爬上一个滑溜溜的垂直表面或一个几乎没有扶手的表面需要成功地进行力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查。同样地，在波涛汹涌的水面上获得任何距离都需要成功的力量（（%2%））检查。",

	"This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.": "这条规则假设你跳的高度并不重要，比如跳过一条小溪或鸿沟。在你的DM的选择下，你必须通过DC 10力量（（%0%））的检查来清除一个低矮的障碍物（不高于跳跃距离的四分之一），例如树篱或低墙。否则，你就会击中它。",

	"When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to jump higher than you normally can.": "当你做出跳高动作时，如果你在跳之前至少步行了10英尺，你会跃入空中的距离等于3+你的力量修正值（最小为0英尺）。当你进行站立式跳高时，你只能跳出该距离的一半。无论哪种方式，你每跳出一英尺都要花费一英尺的移动。在某些情况下，你的管理员可能会允许你做一个力量（（%0%））检查来跳得比你通常能跳的更高。",
	"You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height.": "在跳跃过程中，你可以将你的手臂伸到你自己上方一半的高度。因此，你能伸到你上方的距离等于跳跃的高度加上你身高的1.5倍。",

	"A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.": "一个角色可能占据前排，一个或多个中排，或后排。前排和后排的角色需要有足够的空间与同级别的其他角色并排前进。当空间太紧时，行军顺序必须改变，通常是将角色移到中间的行列。",
	"If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's considered a front rank.": "如果一个冒险队安排的行军顺序只有两个队伍，那么它们就是一个前排和一个后排。如果只有一个队列，则被认为是前队列。",

However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities instead, or some other activity with the DM's permission.": "这些角色不会将他们的被动智慧（（%0%））得分贡献给团体注意到隐藏威胁的机会。然而，不注意危险的角色可以做以下活动之一来代替，或者在DM的允许下做一些其他活动。",
	"The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules to determine whether the group gets lost.)": "角色可以尝试防止团体迷路，在DM要求时进行智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。(地下城管理员指南》中有确定团体是否迷路的规则）。",
	"The character can draw a map that records the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.": "角色可以画一张地图，记录团队的进展，并在角色迷路时帮助他们回到正轨。不需要检查能力。",
	"A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for tracking.)": "一个角色可以追踪另一个生物的踪迹，在DM要求时进行智慧（（%0%））检查。(地下城管理员指南》中有关于追踪的规则）。",

	"Sometimes, it makes sense to split an adventuring party, especially if you want one or more characters to scout ahead. You can form multiple parties, each moving at a different speed. Each group has its own front, middle, and back ranks.": "有时，将一个冒险队伍分开是有意义的，特别是如果你想让一个或多个角色在前面侦察。你可以组成多个队伍，每个队伍以不同的速度前进。每组都有自己的前队、中队和后队。",
	"The drawback to this approach is that the party will be split into several smaller groups in the event of an attack. The advantage is that a small group of stealthy characters moving slowly might be able to sneak past enemies that clumsier characters would alert. A pair of rogues moving at a slow pace are much harder to detect when they leave their dwarf fighter friend behind.": "这种方法的缺点是，在受到攻击时，队伍会被分成几个小团体。这样做的好处是，一小群行动缓慢的隐身角色可能会悄悄地越过那些笨拙的角色会惊动的敌人。一对缓慢移动的流氓在离开他们的矮人战士朋友后，就更难被发现。",
	"By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored.

	"The most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.": "冒险中最基本的任务--注意到危险、寻找隐藏的物体、在战斗中击中敌人以及瞄准法术，仅举几例--在很大程度上取决于角色的视觉能力。黑暗和其他遮蔽视线的效果可以证明是一个很大的障碍。",
	"A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a {@b lightly obscured} area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks that rely on sight.": "一个特定的区域可能是轻度或重度的遮蔽。在一个{@b lightly obscured}的区域，例如昏暗的光线、斑驳的雾气或适度的树叶，生物在依靠视觉的智慧({@skill Perception})检查上有劣势。",
	"A {@b heavily obscured} area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the {@condition blinded} condition when trying to see something in that area.": "一个{@b heavily obscured}的区域--例如黑暗、不透明的雾，或茂密的树叶--完全阻挡了视觉。当一个生物试图看清该区域的东西时，会有效地受到（%1%）的影响。",
	"The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.": "环境中存在或不存在光，就会产生三类照明：亮光、暗光和黑暗。",
	"{@b Bright light} lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.": "{@b Bright light}让大多数生物都能正常看到。即使是阴暗的日子也能提供明亮的光线，火把、灯笼、火和其他特定半径范围内的照明源也是如此。",
	"{@b Dim light}, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.": "{@b Dim light}，也叫阴影，形成一个轻度遮挡的区域。昏暗的光线区域通常是亮光源（如手电筒）和周围黑暗之间的界限。黄昏和黎明的柔和光线也算作暗光。一个特别灿烂的满月可能使土地沐浴在昏暗的光线中。",
	"{@b Darkness} creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.": "{@b Darkness}创建一个严重遮蔽的区域。角色在夜晚的户外（甚至是大多数月光下的夜晚），在没有灯光的地牢或地下金库的范围内，或在一个有魔法的黑暗区域，都会面临黑暗。",
	"A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.": "拥有盲目性的生物可以在特定的半径范围内，不依靠视觉来感知周围的环境。没有眼睛的生物，比如说乌鸦，以及具有回声定位或增强感官的生物，比如说蝙蝠和真龙，都有这种感觉。",
	"Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in that darkness, only shades of gray.": "奇幻游戏世界中的许多生物，特别是那些居住在地下的生物，都有暗视功能。在指定的范围内，拥有暗视能力的生物可以在昏暗的光线下看东西，就像亮光一样，在黑暗中看东西，就像暗光一样，所以就该生物而言，黑暗的区域只是被轻微遮蔽。然而，该生物在黑暗中无法辨别颜色，只有灰色的阴影。",
	"A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see {@condition invisible} creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.": "拥有真实视力的生物可以在特定范围内看到普通和魔法黑暗，看到{@condition invisible}的生物和物体，自动检测视觉错觉并成功地对其进行拯救，并能感知变身者或被魔法转化的生物的原始形态。此外，该生物可以看到虚空界。",
	"Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of {@condition exhaustion} (see the appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.": "不吃不喝的角色会受到（%0%）的影响（见附录）。因缺乏食物或水而造成的疲惫，在角色吃饱喝足之前是无法消除的。",
	"A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.": "一个角色每天需要一磅的食物，并且可以通过吃一半的口粮来使食物持续更长时间。一天中吃半磅食物算作半天没有食物。",
	"A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "一个角色可以在没有食物的情况下持续数天，等于3+他或她的体质修正值（最低1）。在超过该限制的每一天结束时，角色会自动受到一级（%0%）的影响。",
	"A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.": "一个正常的进食日将没有食物的天数重置为零。",
	"A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion} at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of {@condition exhaustion} at the end of the day.": "一个角色每天需要一加仑的水，如果天气炎热，则每天需要两加仑。一个只喝一半水的角色必须在DC 15宪法救赎中成功，否则在一天结束时遭受一个级别的（%0%）。一个能获得更少水的角色在一天结束时自动遭受一个等级的（%1%）的伤害。",
	"If the character already has one or more levels of {@condition exhaustion}, the character takes two levels in either case.": "如果角色已经有一个或多个级别的（%0%），那么在任何情况下，角色都需要两个级别。",
	"A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that his or her character is doing something, such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything happens.": "在游戏中，角色与环境中的物体的互动往往很容易解决。玩家告诉DM，他或她的角色正在做某事，比如移动一个杠杆，然后DM描述发生了什么，如果有的话。",
	"For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.": "例如，一个角色可能会决定拉动一个杠杆，而这个杠杆可能会升起一个舷窗，导致一个房间被水淹没，或者打开附近墙壁上的一个秘密门。如果杠杆生锈了，角色可能需要强制拉动它。在这种情况下，管理员可能会要求进行力量检查，看看角色是否能将杠杆扳到合适的位置。DM根据任务的难度来设定任何此类检查的DC。",
	"Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves.": "角色也可以用他们的武器和法术伤害物体。物体对毒药和精神伤害是免疫的，但除此之外，它们可以像生物一样受到物理和魔法攻击的影响。DM决定物体的装甲等级和命中率，并可能决定某些物体对某些类型的攻击具有抵抗力或免疫力。(例如，很难用棍子割断绳子。）物体总是在力量和灵巧的救赎中失败，而且它们对需要其他救赎的效果是免疫的。",
	"When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.": "当一个物体下降到0命中率时，它就会断裂。",
	"A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The DM sets the DC for any such check.": "一个角色也可以尝试用力量检查来破坏一个物体。DM设定任何此类检定的DC。",
	"Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.": "探索地下城、克服障碍和杀死怪物是D&D冒险的关键部分。但同样重要的是，冒险者与世界上其他居民的社会互动。",
	"Interaction takes on many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the interaction that don't belong to another player at the table. Any such character is called a nonplayer character (NPC).": "交往的形式有很多。你可能需要说服一个肆无忌惮的盗贼承认某些不法行为，或者你可能试图奉承一条龙，以便它能饶你一命。DM承担参与互动的任何角色的角色，这些角色不属于同桌的其他玩家。任何这样的角色都被称为非玩家角色（NPC）。",
	"In general terms, an NPC's attitude toward you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It's easier to get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.": "一般来说，一个NPC对你的态度被描述为友好、冷漠或敌对。友好的NPC倾向于帮助你，而敌对的NPC则倾向于妨碍你。当然，从一个友好的NPC那里得到你想要的东西会更容易。",
	"Social interactions have two primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.": "社会互动有两个主要方面：角色扮演和能力检查。",
	"Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this case, it's you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and talks.": "角色扮演，从字面上看，是扮演一个角色的行为。在这种情况下，它是你作为一个玩家决定你的角色如何思考、行动和说话。",
	"Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the fore during social interactions. Your character's quirks, mannerisms, and personality influence how interactions resolve.": "角色扮演是游戏各个方面的一部分，它在社会互动中发挥着重要作用。你的角色的怪癖、举止和个性会影响互动的解决方式。",
	"There are two styles you can use when roleplaying your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best for you.": "在扮演你的角色时，你可以使用两种风格：描述性方法和主动性方法。大多数玩家使用这两种风格的组合。使用这两种方式中最适合你的混合方式。",
	"With this approach, you describe your character's words and actions to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character, you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.": "通过这种方法，你向DM和其他玩家描述你的角色的言语和行动。根据你对角色的心理印象，你告诉大家你的角色做了什么，以及他或她是如何做的。",
	"For instance, Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves of the Cloakwood for his family's misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel sits at Tordek's table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.": "例如，克里斯扮演矮人托德克。Tordek脾气急躁，把他家的不幸归咎于Cloakwood的精灵们。在一个酒馆里，一个令人讨厌的精灵吟游诗人坐在托德克的桌子旁，试图与这个矮人进行交谈。",
	"Chris says, \"Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another drink.\" In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood and given the DM a clear idea of his character's attitude and actions.": "克里斯说：\"托德克在地上吐了口唾沫，对吟游诗人咆哮侮辱，然后跺脚走到酒吧。他坐在凳子上，瞪着吟游诗人，然后又点了一杯饮料。\" 在这个例子中，克里斯传达了托德克的情绪，并让DM清楚地了解了他的角色的态度和行动。",
	"When using descriptive roleplaying, keep the following things in mind:": "在使用描述性的角色扮演时，要记住以下事项。",
	"Describe your character's emotions and attitude.": "描述你的角色的情绪和态度。",
	"Focus on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.": "关注你的角色的意图以及其他人可能会如何看待它。",
	"Provide as much embellishment as you feel comfortable with.": "在你觉得合适的情况下，提供尽可能多的点缀。",
	"Don't worry about getting things exactly right. Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what you see in your mind.": "不要担心把事情做得完全正确。只要专注于思考你的角色会做什么，并描述你在脑海中看到的东西。",
	"If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.": "如果描述性的角色扮演告诉你的DM和你的同伴你的角色在想什么和做什么，那么积极的角色扮演则向他们展示。",
	"When you use active roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice, like an actor taking on a role. You might even echo your character's movements and body language. This approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need to describe things that can't be reasonably acted out.": "当你使用主动角色扮演时，你用你的角色的声音说话，就像一个演员在扮演一个角色。你甚至可以呼应你的角色的动作和身体语言。这种方法比描述性的角色扮演更有身临其境的感觉，尽管你仍然需要描述那些不能合理地表演出来的东西。",
	"Going back to the example of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris used active roleplaying:": "回到上面克里斯扮演托德克的例子，如果克里斯使用积极的角色扮演，这一幕可能会如何上演。",
	"Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice, \"I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams.\" In his normal voice, Chris then adds, \"I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.\"": "作为托德克，克里斯用粗暴而低沉的声音说：\"我在想为什么这里突然闻起来很糟糕。如果我想从你嘴里听到什么，我会折断你的手臂，享受你的尖叫声。\" 用他正常的声音，克里斯接着补充说：\"我站起来，瞪了一眼那个精灵，然后走向酒吧。\"",
	"The DM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.": "DM使用你的角色的行动和态度来决定NPC的反应。一个懦弱的NPC在暴力威胁下屈服了。顽固的矮人拒绝让人欺负她。虚荣的龙会接受奉承。",
	"When interacting with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's mood, dialogue, and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's personality traits, ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.": "在与NPC互动时，密切注意DM对NPC的情绪、对话和个性的描绘。你也许能够确定一个NPC的个性特征、理想、缺陷和纽带，然后发挥它们的作用，影响NPC的态度。",
	"Interactions in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand, if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts to convince or deceive will fall short.": "D&D中的互动很像现实生活中的互动。如果你能向NPC提供他们想要的东西，用他们害怕的东西威胁他们，或者利用他们的同情心和目标，你就可以用语言来获得你想要的任何东西。另一方面，如果你侮辱一个骄傲的战士或者说一个贵族盟友的坏话，你说服或欺骗的努力就会落空。",
	"In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining the outcome of an interaction.": "除了角色扮演之外，能力检查是决定互动结果的关键。",
	"Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude, but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example, your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM's discretion.": "你的角色扮演努力可以改变一个NPC的态度，但在这种情况下仍然可能有机会的因素。例如，如果你的DM想让骰子在决定NPC的反应方面发挥作用，他或她可以在互动过程中的任何时候要求进行魅力检查。在某些情况下，其他检查可能是适当的，由你的管理员决定。",
	"Pay attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in {@skill Deception} is the best bet to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage's release, the cleric with {@skill Persuasion} should do most of the talking.": "在考虑如何与NPC互动时，要注意你的技能熟练程度，并通过使用依靠你最好的奖励和技能的方法来堆积对你有利的牌。如果团队需要欺骗一个守卫让他们进入城堡，精通（%0%）的流氓是领导讨论的最佳人选。当为释放人质进行谈判时，拥有（%1%）的牧师应该做大部分的谈话。",
	"Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.": "尽管他们可能是英雄，但冒险者不可能每时每刻都在探索、社会交往和战斗中度过。他们需要休息时间来睡觉和吃饭，照料他们的伤口，恢复他们的思想和精神来施展法术，并为进一步的冒险做好准备。",
	"Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long rest to end it.": "冒险者和其他生物一样，可以在一天之中进行短暂的休息，并在一天结束时进行长时间的休息。",
	"A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.": "短暂休息是指一段至少1小时的休息时间，在此期间，角色除了吃喝、阅读和处理伤口外，不做任何更剧烈的动作。",
	"A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.": "一个角色可以在短时休息结束时花费一个或多个命中率骰子，最高可达角色的最大命中率骰子数，这等于角色的等级。以这种方式花费的每一个命中率骰子，玩家都会掷出骰子，并将角色的体质修饰值加入其中。角色恢复的命中率与总数相等（最低为0）。玩家可以决定在每次掷骰子之后再花一个额外的命中率。角色在完成长期休息后会重新获得一些已花费的命中率，如下文所述。",
	"A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.": "长时间的休息是一段长时间的休息，至少8个小时，期间角色至少睡6个小时，并进行不超过2个小时的轻度活动，例如阅读、交谈、吃饭或站岗。如果休息被一段剧烈的活动打断--至少1小时的行走、战斗、施法或类似的冒险活动--角色必须重新开始休息才能从中获得任何好处。",
	"At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total number of them. You regain at least 1 Hit Die when you finish a long rest.": "在长期休息结束时，角色会恢复所有损失的命中率。该角色也会恢复已消耗的命中率，最多相等于该角色总命中率的一半。当你完成长期休息时，你至少会恢复1个命中率。",
	"For example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.": "例如，如果一个角色有8个命中率，他或她可以在完成长期休息后恢复4个已消耗的命中率。",
	"A character can't benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of the rest to gain its benefits.": "一个角色在24小时内不能从超过一次的长期休息中获益，而且角色在休息开始时必须至少有1点生命值才能获得其好处。",
	"Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.": "在前往地下城和与远古恶魔的战斗之间，冒险者需要时间来休息、休整，并为下一次冒险做准备。许多冒险者还利用这段时间执行其他任务，如制作武器和盔甲，进行研究，或花费他们辛苦赚来的黄金。",
	"In some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.": "在某些情况下，时间的流逝是没有什么大张旗鼓或描述的事情。当开始一个新的冒险时，管理员可能会简单地宣布已经过去了一定的时间，并允许你大致描述你的角色一直在做什么。在其他时候，由于超出你感知范围的事件一直在发生，DM可能想要跟踪时间的流逝。",
	"Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.": "在冒险之间，你选择一种特定的生活质量，并支付维持这种生活方式的费用，如第五章所述。",
	"Living a particular lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.": "生活在一种特定的生活方式中并不会对你的性格产生巨大的影响，但你的生活方式会影响其他个人和团体对你的反应。例如，当你过着贵族式的生活方式时，你可能比生活在贫困中的人更容易影响城市中的贵族。",
	"Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.": "在冒险之间，DM可能会问你，你的角色在停工期间在做什么。闲暇时间的长短不一，但每项闲暇活动都需要一定天数的时间来完成，才能获得任何好处，而且每天必须有至少8个小时花在闲暇活动上，才能算作一天。这些天不需要连续。如果你有超过最低限度的天数，你可以在更长的时间内继续做同一件事，或者换一个新的停工活动。",
	"Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your DM.": "除了下面介绍的这些活动外，其他的停工活动也是可能的。如果你想让你的角色在闲暇时间进行这里没有涉及的活动，请与你的管理员讨论。",
	"You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with {@item smith's tools|phb} needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.": "你可以制作非魔法物品，包括冒险装备和艺术作品。你必须精通与你要制作的物品有关的工具（通常是工匠的工具）。你可能还需要获得创造它所需的特殊材料或地点。例如，精通（%0%）的人需要一个锻造厂来制作一把剑或一套盔甲。",
	"For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.": "你每花一天的停工时间，就可以制作一件或多件总市场价值不超过5戈比的物品，你必须消耗价值为总市场价值一半的原材料。如果你想制作的东西的市场价值大于5GP，你每天都会以5GP为单位取得进展，直到你达到该物品的市场价值。例如，一套板甲（市场价值1,500金币）需要300天才能完成。",
	"Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.": "多个角色可以共同制作一件物品，前提是这些角色都能熟练使用必要的工具，并且在同一个地方工作。每个角色在帮助制作物品的过程中，每花一天时间就贡献5戈比的努力。例如，三个具有必要的工具熟练度和适当设施的人物可以在100天内制作一套板甲，总成本为750GP。",
	"While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses).": "在制作过程中，你可以维持适度的生活方式，而不需要每天支付1个金币，或者以正常费用的一半维持舒适的生活方式（关于生活方式支出的更多信息见第5章）。",
	"You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.": "你可以在两次冒险之间工作，使你能够维持适度的生活方式，而不必每天支付1个金币（关于生活方式支出的更多信息见第五章）。只要你继续从事你的职业，这个好处就会一直持续下去。",
	"If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.": "如果你是一个能够提供有报酬的工作的组织的成员，如寺庙或盗贼公会，你的收入反而足以支持一个舒适的生活。",

	"You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison.": "你可以利用冒险之间的停工期，从衰弱的伤害、疾病或毒药中恢复。",
	"After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:": "在休养三天后，你可以做一个DC15的宪法救赎动作。拯救成功后，你可以选择以下结果之一。",

	"The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.": "冒险之间的时间是进行研究的好机会，可以深入了解活动过程中出现的神秘事件。研究可以包括在图书馆里翻阅尘封的书本和摇摇欲坠的卷轴，或者请当地人喝酒，从他们嘴里撬出谣言和八卦。",
	"When you begin your research, the DM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The DM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to secure someone's aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.": "当你开始研究时，DM会决定这些信息是否可用，需要多少天的停工期才能找到，以及你的研究是否有任何限制（比如需要寻找特定的个人、书本或地点）。DM可能还会要求你进行一次或多次能力检查，比如用智力（%0%）检查来寻找指向你所寻找的信息的线索，或者用魅力（%1%）检查来获得某人的帮助。一旦这些条件得到满足，如果有信息的话，你就可以学到这些信息。",
	"For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses (as discussed in chapter 5).": "每进行一天的研究，你必须花费1戈比以支付你的费用。这笔费用是在你正常的生活方式支出之外的（如第五章所述）。",

	"The clatter of a sword striking against a shield. The terrible rending sound as monstrous claws tear through armor. A brilliant flash of light as a ball of flame blossoms from a wizard's spell. The sharp tang of blood in the air, cutting through the stench of vile monsters.": "剑击盾牌的咔嚓声。怪兽的爪子撕开盔甲时发出可怕的撕裂声。巫师的咒语产生的火焰球闪耀的光芒。空气中尖锐的血腥味，划破了卑鄙的怪物的恶臭。",

	"A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative.

	"If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.": "如果你采取的行动包括一个以上的武器攻击，你可以通过在这些攻击之间移动来进一步分解你的行动。例如，一个可以用额外攻击功能进行两次攻击的战士，如果他的速度是25英尺，可以移动10英尺，进行一次攻击，移动15英尺，然后再次攻击。",
	"If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you've already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move.": "如果你有一个以上的速度，例如你的步行速度和飞行速度，你可以在你的移动过程中来回切换你的速度。每当你切换时，用新速度减去你已经移动的距离。这个结果决定了你可以移动多远。如果结果是0或更少，你就不能在当前的移动中使用新的速度。",
	"For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.": "例如，如果你的速度是30，而飞行速度是60，因为一个巫师对你施了飞翔咒语，你可以飞20英尺，然后走10英尺，然后跃入空中再飞30英尺。",

	"Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.": "在困难地形中每移动一英尺都要多花一英尺。即使一个空间里有多个东西算作困难地形，这条规则也是如此。",
	"Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.": "低矮的家具、瓦砾、矮树丛、陡峭的楼梯、雪和浅水沼泽都是困难地形的例子。另一个生物的空间，无论是否有敌意，也算作困难地形。",
	"Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are {@condition prone}, a condition described in the appendix.": "战斗人员经常发现自己躺在地上，要么是因为他们被击倒，要么是因为他们把自己扔下去了。在游戏中，他们是（%0%），这种情况在附录中描述。",
	"You can drop {@condition prone} without using any of your speed. Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can't stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.": "你可以在不使用任何速度的情况下下降（%0%）。站起来需要更多的努力；这样做要花费相当于你速度一半的移动量。例如，如果你的速度是30英尺，你必须花费15英尺的移动量才能站起来。如果你没有足够的移动量或者你的速度为0，你就不能站起来。",
	"To move while {@condition prone}, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.": "要在{@condition prone}时移动，你必须爬行或使用魔法，如传送术。在爬行时，每移动一英尺就要多花一英尺。因此，在{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的情况下爬行1英尺，需要花费3英尺的移动。",
	"You can move through a nonhostile creature's space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature's space is {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for you.": "你可以在一个非敌对生物的空间内移动。相反地，只有在敌对生物比你至少大或小两个尺寸的情况下，你才能在敌对生物的空间内移动。记住，另一个生物的空间对你来说是（%0%）。",
	"Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can't willingly end your move in its space.": "无论一个生物是朋友还是敌人，你都不能心甘情愿地在它的空间里结束你的行动。",
	"If you leave a hostile creature's reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.": "如果你在移动过程中离开了敌对生物的范围，你就会挑起一次机会攻击，如本章后面所解释的。",
	"Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked {@condition prone}, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the {@spell fly} spell.": "飞行生物享有许多移动的好处，但它们也必须处理掉落的危险。如果一个飞行生物被击倒{@condition prone}，速度降为0，或者被剥夺了移动的能力，这个生物就会坠落，除非它有盘旋的能力，或者它被魔法固定在高空，比如说被{@spell fly}的咒语。",
	"Each creature takes up a different amount of space.": "每种生物占用的空间不同。",
	"The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.": "尺寸分类表显示了一个特定尺寸的生物在战斗中控制的空间。物体有时也使用相同的尺寸类别。",
	"2½ by 2½ ft.": "2½乘2½英尺",
	"Small": "小型",
	"Large": "大型",
	"Gargantuan": "巨大的",
	"20 by 20 ft. or larger": "20乘20英尺或更大",
	"A creature's space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn't 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can't get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.": "一个生物的空间是它在战斗中有效控制的以英尺为单位的区域，而不是其物理尺寸的表达。例如，一个典型的中型生物并不是5英尺宽，但是它确实控制了一个这么宽的空间。如果一个中型妖精站在一个5英尺宽的门口，其他生物就无法通过，除非这个妖精让它们通过。",
	"A creature's space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there's a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.": "一个生物的空间也反映了它需要有效战斗的区域。出于这个原因，在战斗中能围绕另一个生物的生物数量是有限制的。假设是中型战斗人员，八个生物可以在另一个生物周围5英尺的范围内。",
	"Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature.": "由于较大的生物占据了更多的空间，较少的生物可以包围一个生物。",
	"If four Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there's little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.": "如果四个大型生物挤在一个中型或较小的生物周围，就没有什么空间给其他人了。相比之下，多达20个中型生物可以包围一个巨大的生物。",
	"A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space.": "一个生物可以挤过一个足以容纳比它小一号的生物的空间。因此，一个大型生物可以挤过一个只有5英尺宽的通道。当挤过一个空间时，生物每移动一英尺就必须多花一英尺的时间，而且在攻击卷和灵巧救赎上有劣势。当它在较小的空间内时，对它的攻击卷有优势。",
	"If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.": "如果你使用方形网格和迷你模型或其他代币来进行战斗，请遵循这些规则。",
	"Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.": "网格上的每个方格代表5英尺。",
	"Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.": "与其一脚一脚地移动，不如在网格上一格一格地移动。这意味着你以5英尺为单位使用你的速度。如果你把你的速度除以5，转化为方格，这就特别容易。例如，30英尺的速度转化为6个方格的速度。",
	"If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.": "如果你经常使用格子，可以考虑在你的人物表上用方格写上你的速度。",
	"To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in.

The Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)": "要进入一个方格，你必须至少有1个方格的移动空间，即使这个方格与你所在的方格是对角线相邻的。(对角线移动的规则为了流畅的游戏而牺牲了现实主义。地下城管理员指南》提供了关于使用更真实的方法的指导。）",
	"If a square costs extra movement, as a square of {@quickref difficult terrain||3} does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of {@quickref difficult terrain||3}.": "如果一个方块需要额外的移动量，就像{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的方块那样，你必须有足够的移动量来支付进入它的费用。例如，你必须有至少两格的移动量才能进入{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的方格。",
	"Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.": "对角线运动不能越过墙角、大树或其他填补其空间的地形特征。",
	"To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.": "要确定两件东西--无论是生物还是物体--在网格上的范围，就要从其中一个相邻的方格开始数，在另一个方格的空间里停止数。用最短的路线来计算。",
	"When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.": "当你在你的回合中采取你的行动时，你可以采取这里介绍的行动之一，你从你的等级或特殊功能中获得的行动，或者你即兴创作的行动。许多怪物在它们的状态块中都有自己的行动选项。",
	"When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.": "当你描述一个在规则中没有详细说明的行动时，DM会告诉你这个行动是否可能，以及你需要做什么样的卷轴，如果有的话，以确定成功或失败。",
	"Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.": "无论你是用近战武器攻击，还是在远距离发射武器，或者作为法术的一部分进行攻击卷，攻击都有一个简单的结构。",
	"Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.": "在你的攻击范围内选择一个目标：一个生物，一个物体，或一个地点。",
	"The DM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.": "DM决定目标是否有掩护，以及你对目标有优势还是劣势。此外，法术、特殊能力和其他效果可以对你的攻击卷施加惩罚或奖励。",
	"You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.": "你做攻击卷。一旦命中，你就滚动伤害，除非特定的攻击规则另有规定。有些攻击除了造成伤害外还会造成特殊效果，或者代替伤害。",
	"If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.": "如果有任何疑问，你正在做的事情是否算作攻击，规则很简单：如果你在做攻击卷，你就在做攻击。",
	"When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.": "当你进行攻击时，你的攻击卷决定了攻击是命中还是不中。要做一个攻击卷，请掷一个D20，然后加上适当的修正值。如果掷出的分数加上修正值的总和等于或超过目标的护甲等级（AC），则攻击成功。角色的护甲等级是在角色创建时确定的，而怪物的护甲等级则在其状态块中。",
	"When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.": "当一个角色进行攻击卷时，两个最常见的修改器是一个能力修改器和角色的熟练度奖励。当怪物做攻击卷时，它使用它的状态块中提供的任何修改器。",
	"The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.": "用于近战武器攻击的能力修改器是力量，而用于远程武器攻击的能力修改器是灵巧。具有精巧或投掷属性的武器会打破这一规则。",
	"Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster, as explained in chapter 10.": "有些法术也需要一个攻击卷。用于法术攻击的能力修改器取决于施法者的法术能力，如第10章所解释。",
	"You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.": "当你使用你精通的武器进行攻击时，你的攻击卷会加上你的熟练度加成，当你使用法术攻击时也是如此。",

	"When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature's hit points can't exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.": "当一个生物接受任何形式的治疗时，重新获得的命中率会加到它当前的命中率上。一个生物的命中率不能超过它的最大命中率，所以任何超过这个数字的重获的命中率都会丢失。例如，一个德鲁伊给予游侠8点攻击力的治疗。如果游侠目前有14点命中率，而最大命中率为20，那么游侠从德鲁伊那里恢复了6点命中率，而不是8点。",

	"For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.": "例如，一个最大命中率为12点的牧师目前有6点命中率。如果她从一次攻击中受到18点伤害，她的命中率会降至0，但仍有12点伤害。因为剩余的伤害等于她的最大命中率，所以该牧师死亡。",

The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.": "掷一个D20。如果掷出的数字是10或更高，你就成功。否则，你就失败。成功或失败本身没有影响。在你第三次成功时，你会变得稳定（见下文）。在你第三次失败时，你会死亡。成功和失败不需要是连续的；保持对两者的跟踪，直到你收集到三个相同的。当你恢复任何命中率或变得稳定时，两者的数量将被重置为零。",
	"When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.": "当你进行死亡救赎，并在D20上掷出1时，它算作两次失败。如果你在D20上掷出20，你会重新获得1点生命值。",
	"If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead.

	"A stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain {@condition unconscious}. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.": "一个稳定的生物不会进行死亡拯救动作，即使它的命中率为0，但它仍然保持（%0%）。如果它受到任何伤害，它就不再是稳定的了，并且必须重新开始进行死亡挣扎。一个没有被治疗的稳定生物在1d4小时后会恢复1点生命值。",
	"Most DMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall {@condition unconscious} and make death saving throws.": "大多数DM让怪物在下降到0命中率的瞬间死亡，而不是让它下降（%0%）并进行死亡拯救。",

	"Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.": "一些法术和特殊能力赋予生物临时的命中率。临时命中率并不是真正的命中率；它们是对伤害的缓冲，是保护你免受伤害的命中率池。",
	"When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.": "当你有临时命中率并受到伤害时，临时命中率会首先丧失，而任何剩余的伤害都会转到你的正常命中率。例如，如果你有5个临时命中率并受到7次伤害，你会失去临时命中率，然后受到2次伤害。",
	"Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.": "因为临时命中率与你的实际命中率是分开的，它们可以超过你的命中率上限。因此，一个角色可以在满命中率的情况下获得临时命中率。",
	"Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.": "治疗不能恢复临时命中率，也不能将它们加在一起。如果你有临时命中率并获得了更多的临时命中率，你要决定是保留你已有的临时命中率还是获得新的临时命中率。例如，如果一个法术授予你12个临时命中率，而你已经有10个，你可以有12个或10个，而不是22个。",
	"If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore you to consciousness or stabilize you.": "如果你的命中率为0，接受临时命中率并不能使你恢复知觉或稳定。",
	"They can still absorb damage directed at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you.": "当你处于这种状态时，他们仍然可以吸收针对你的伤害，但只有真正的治疗才能拯救你。",
	"Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they're depleted or you finish a long rest.": "除非授予你临时命中率的特征有持续时间，否则它们会持续到它们被耗尽或你完成长时间休息为止。",
	"A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.": "骑着战马冲锋陷阵的骑士，在狮鹫背上施法的巫师，或骑着飞马翱翔天空的牧师，都能享受到坐骑所能提供的速度和机动性的好处。",
	"A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.": "一个自愿的、至少比你大一号的、有适当解剖结构的生物可以作为坐骑，使用以下规则。",
	"Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.": "在你的移动过程中，你可以骑上一个在你5英尺范围内的生物，或者下马。这样做要花费相当于你速度一半的移动量。例如，如果你的速度是30英尺，你必须花费15英尺的移动量才能骑上一匹马。因此，如果你没有剩余的15英尺移动量，或者你的速度为0，你就不能骑上它。",
	"If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing {@condition prone} in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked {@condition prone} while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.": "如果当你在坐骑上时，有一个效果违背你的意愿移动你的坐骑，你必须在DC10的灵巧救赎上成功，或者从坐骑上掉下来，落在它5英尺内的一个空间里。如果你在坐骑上被撞倒（%1%），你必须做同样的蓄力动作。",
	"If your mount is knocked {@condition prone}, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall {@condition prone} in a space within 5 feet it.": "如果你的坐骑被撞倒（%0%），你可以在它倒下时使用你的反应来下马，并落在你的脚上。否则，你会被下马，并在它5英尺范围内的空间跌落（%1%）。",
	"While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.": "当你被安装时，你有两个选择。你可以控制坐骑或允许它独立行动。智能生物，如龙，是独立行动的。",
	"You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training.": "只有当坐骑被训练为接受骑手时，你才能控制它。驯养的马、驴和类似的生物被认为有这样的训练。",
	"The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: {@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, and {@action Dodge}. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.": "当你骑上它时，受控坐骑的主动权会改变，以配合你。它按照你的指示移动，并且只有三个行动选项。{@action Dash}, {@action Disengage}, 和 {@action Dodge}。被控制的坐骑甚至在你骑上它的那一回合也可以移动和行动。",
	"An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.": "一个独立的坐骑在主动权顺序中保留其位置。有一个骑手对坐骑可以采取的行动没有任何限制，它可以按照自己的意愿移动和行动。它可能会在战斗中逃跑，急于攻击和吞噬一个严重受伤的敌人，或者以其他方式违背你的意愿。",
	"In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.": "在这两种情况下，如果坐骑在你身上时挑起了一次机会攻击，攻击者可以将你或坐骑作为目标。",
	"When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following rules apply.": "当冒险家们追寻萨瓦金人回到他们的海底家园，在古老的沉船中与鲨鱼搏斗，或者发现自己在一个被淹没的地牢房间里，他们必须在一个具有挑战性的环境中战斗。水下适用以下规则。",
	"When making a {@b melee weapon attack}, a creature that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.": "当进行（%0%）时，没有游泳速度的生物（无论是自然的还是魔法赋予的）在攻击卷上有劣势，除非武器是匕首、标枪、短剑、长矛或三叉戟。",
	"A {@b ranged weapon attack} automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).": "{@b ranged weapon attack}自动错过武器正常范围以外的目标。即使对正常范围内的目标，攻击卷也有劣势，除非该武器是弩、网或像标枪一样投掷的武器（包括矛、三叉戟或飞镖）。",
	"Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.": "完全浸泡在水中的生物和物体对火灾伤害有抵抗力。",
	"Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often appears in the form of a spell.": "魔法渗透到D&D的世界中，并且最常以法术的形式出现。",
	"This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules here.": "本章提供了施放法术的规则。不同的角色类别有独特的学习和准备法术的方式，怪物也以独特的方式使用法术。无论其来源如何，法术都遵循这里的规则。",
	"A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the span of seconds.": "咒语是一种离散的魔法效果，是对弥漫在多元宇宙中的魔法能量的单一塑造，是一种特定的、有限的表达。在施法过程中，一个角色小心翼翼地拔掉充斥在世界中的无形的原始魔法线，将它们按特定的模式钉在原地，让它们以特定的方式振动，然后释放它们来释放所需的效果--大多数情况下，所有这些都在几秒钟内完成。",
	"Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see {@book appendix A|PHB|12}), drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.": "法术可以是多功能的工具、武器或保护罩。它们可以造成伤害或解除伤害，施加或消除条件（见{@book appendix A|PHB|12}），消耗生命能量，并让死者恢复生命。",
	"Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the multiverse's history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.": "在多元宇宙的历史进程中，有数不清的法术被创造出来，其中许多早已被遗忘。有些可能还记录在隐藏在古代废墟中的破败的法术书中，或者被困在死去的神的头脑中。或者有一天，它们可能被一个积累了足够力量和智慧的角色重新发明。",
	"Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell's level is a general indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive) magic missile at 1st level and the incredible time stop at 9th. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell's level, the higher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.": "每个法术都有一个从0到9的等级。一个法术的等级是它强大程度的一般指标，低级（但仍然令人印象深刻）的魔法飞弹是1级，不可思议的时间停止是9级。咒语（Cantrips）--简单但强大的法术，角色几乎可以通过背诵来施展--是0级。一个法术的等级越高，施法者就必须是高等级才能使用该法术。",
	"Spell level and character level don't correspond directly. Typically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a 9th-level spell.": "法术等级和角色等级并不直接对应。通常情况下，一个角色至少要达到17级，而不是9级，才能施展9级法术。",
	"Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing is true of many magic using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.": "在施法者使用一个法术之前，他或她必须将该法术牢牢地固定在脑海中，或者必须在魔法物品中获得该法术。少数阶级的成员有一个有限的法术清单，他们知道的法术总是固定在头脑中。许多使用魔法的怪物也是如此。其他的施法者，比如牧师和巫师，要经历一个准备法术的过程。这个过程对于不同的等级来说是不同的，详见其描述。",
	"In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character's level.": "在任何情况下，施法者在任何时候都能在心中固定的法术数量取决于角色的等级。",
	"Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class's description includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.": "无论施法者知道多少法术或准备了多少法术，他或她在休息之前只能施放有限的法术。操纵魔法的结构并将其能量导入哪怕是一个简单的法术，都会对身体和精神造成负担，而高等级的法术更是如此。因此，每个法术类的描述中都有一个表格，显示角色在每个角色等级中可以使用的每个法术等级的法术槽数量。例如，三级巫师乌玛拉有四个一级法术槽和两个二级法术槽。",
	"When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell's level or higher, effectively \"filling\" a slot with the spell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So when Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.": "当一个角色施展法术时，他或她会消耗该法术等级或更高的槽，有效地用该法术 \"填充 \"一个槽。你可以把法术槽看作是一个有一定大小的凹槽--小的是1级槽，大的是更高等级的法术。一个1级法术适合任何大小的槽，但9级法术只适合9级槽。因此，当Umara施放魔法飞弹，一个1级的法术时，她花掉了4个1级槽中的一个，剩下3个。",
	"Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots (see chapter 8 for the rules on resting).": "完成一个长时间的休息可以恢复任何已消耗的法术槽（关于休息的规则见第8章）。",
	"Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in such a way.": "有些角色和怪物具有特殊的能力，可以让他们在不使用法术槽的情况下施展法术。例如，遵循四元素之道的僧侣、选择某些长生召唤的术士，以及来自九幽地狱的坑魔，都可以通过这种方式施法。",
	"When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile using one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put into.": "当施法者使用比咒语等级更高的槽来施法时，该咒语在该次施法中假定为更高等级。例如，如果Umara使用她的一个2级槽施放魔法飞弹，那么这个魔法飞弹就是2级的。有效地，法术会扩展以填补它被放入的插槽。",
	"Some spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have more powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell's description.": "有些法术，如魔法飞弹和治愈伤痛，在更高的等级下施放时有更强大的效果，详见法术描述。",
	"A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed the spell in the caster's mind and infused the caster with the magic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip's spell level is 0.": "咒语是一种可以随意施展的咒语，无需使用咒语槽，也无需事先准备。反复的练习使咒语在施法者的脑海中固定下来，并为施法者注入所需的魔力，以便一次又一次地产生效果。一个咒语的法术等级为0。",
	"Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal.": "某些法术有一个特殊的标签：仪式。这样的咒语可以按照正常的施法规则来施放，也可以作为一种仪式来施法。仪式版的法术需要比正常情况下多花10分钟时间来施展。",
	"It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.": "它也不消耗一个法术槽，这意味着一个法术的仪式版不能在更高的级别上施放。",
	"To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character's ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard's does.": "要以仪式的方式施法，施法者必须有一个赋予能力的特征。例如，牧师和德鲁伊就有这样的特征。施法者还必须准备好该法术或在其已知的法术列表中，除非该角色的仪式特征另有规定，如巫师的规定。",
	"When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.": "当一个角色施展任何法术时，都要遵循同样的基本规则，无论该角色的等级或法术的效果如何。",
	"Each spell description in {@book chapter 11|PHB|11} begins with a block of information, including the spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.": "{@book chapter 11|PHB|11}中的每个法术描述都以一个信息块开始，包括法术的名称、等级、魔法流派、施法时间、范围、成分和持续时间。咒语的其余部分描述了该咒语的效果。",
	"Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered by your armor for spellcasting.": "由于施法所需的精神集中和精确的手势，你必须精通你所穿的盔甲才能施法。否则你就会因为盔甲而心神不宁，身体受阻，无法施法。",
	"Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.": "大多数法术需要一个行动来施展，但有些法术需要一个额外的行动，一个反应，或更多的时间来施展。",
	"A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.": "用奖励行动施展的法术特别迅速。你必须在你的回合中使用一个额外行动来施法，只要你在这个回合中还没有采取额外行动。你不能在同一回合内施放另一个法术，除非是施法时间为一个行动的咒语。",
	"Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.": "有些法术可以作为反应来施放。这些法术需要几分之一秒的时间来实现，是对某些事件的回应。如果一个法术可以作为反应施放，法术描述会告诉你何时可以这样做。",
	"Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see \"Concentration\" below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.": "某些法术（包括作为仪式施放的法术）需要更多时间来施放：几分钟甚至几小时。当你施展一个施法时间超过一个行动或反应的法术时，你必须在每一回合用你的行动来施法，而且在施法时你必须保持你的注意力（见下面的 \"注意力\"）。如果你的注意力被打断，则施法失败，但你不会消耗一个法术槽。如果你想再次尝试施法，你必须重新开始。",
	"The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.": "咒语的目标必须在咒语的范围内。对于像魔法飞弹这样的法术，目标是一个生物。对于像火球术这样的法术，目标是空间中火球爆发的点。",
	"Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.": "大多数法术的范围都以英尺为单位。有些法术只能针对你所接触的生物（包括你）。其他法术，例如盾牌法术，只影响你。这些法术的范围是自己。",
	"Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's effect must be you (see \"Areas of Effect\" later in the this chapter).": "创造源自你的锥体或效果线的法术也有自己的范围，表明法术效果的起源点必须是你（见本章后面的 \"效果区域\"）。",
	"Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless the spell's description says otherwise.": "一旦施展法术，其效果不受范围限制，除非法术的描述另有说明。",
	"A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the spell.": "咒语的组成部分是你必须满足的物理要求，以便施展它。每个咒语的描述都指出它是否需要言语（V）、身体（S）或物质（M）成分。如果你不能提供一个或多个法术组件，你就无法施展该法术。",
	"Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can't cast a spell with a verbal component.": "大多数法术需要吟唱神秘的词语。话语本身并不是法术力量的源泉；相反，特定的声音组合，加上特定的音调和共鸣，使魔法的线索开始运动。因此，一个角色如果被堵住嘴或者在一个沉默的区域，比如由沉默咒语创造的区域，就不能施放带有语言成分的咒语。",
	"Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.": "施法手势可能包括一个有力的手势或一套复杂的手势。如果一个法术需要身体的成分，施法者必须至少自由使用一只手来完成这些手势。",
	"Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.": "施放某些法术需要特定的物品，在组件条目中的括号内注明。角色可以使用组件袋或施法焦点（见第5章）来代替为某个法术指定的组件。但如果某个组件有成本，角色就必须在施法前拥有该特定组件。",
	"If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.": "如果一个咒语说明一个物质成分被咒语所消耗，施法者必须为每次施法提供这个成分。",
	"A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.": "施法者必须有一只手空出来以获取法术的物质成分--或者握住法术的焦点--但它可以是他或她用来执行身体成分的那只手。",
	"A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.": "咒语的持续时间是指咒语持续的时间长度。持续时间可以用回合、分钟、小时、甚至是年来表示。有些法术规定其效果持续到法术被驱散或破坏为止。",
	"Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.": "许多法术是瞬时的。咒语以一种无法驱除的方式伤害、治疗、创造或改变一个生物或物体，因为它的魔法只存在于一瞬间。",
	"Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.": "有些法术需要你保持注意力，以保持其魔法的活性。如果你失去注意力，这样的法术就会结束。",
	"If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).": "如果一个法术必须用集中力来维持，这个事实就会出现在它的持续时间条目中，并且法术规定了你可以集中精力在它身上多长时间。你可以在任何时候结束专注（不需要行动）。",
	"Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:": "正常的活动，如移动和攻击，不会干扰注意力。以下因素会破坏注意力。",
	"{@b Casting another spell that requires concentration.} You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.": "{@b Casting another spell that requires concentration.} 如果你施放另一个需要集中注意力的法术，你会失去对一个法术的注意力。你不能同时专注于两个法术。",
	"{@b Taking damage.} Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.": "{@b Taking damage.}每当你在专注于一个法术时受到伤害，你必须做一个宪法救赎来保持你的注意力。攻击力等于10或你所受伤害的一半，以较高的数字为准。如果你从多个来源受到伤害，比如一支箭和龙的呼吸，你要为每个来源的伤害单独做一个蓄力动作。",
	"{@b Being incapacitated or killed.} You lose concentration on a spell if you are {@condition incapacitated} or if you die.": "{@b Being incapacitated or killed.}如果你是{@condition incapacitated}或死亡，你会失去对一个法术的专注。",
	"The DM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.": "DM也可以决定某些环境现象，比如当你在一艘被风暴袭击的船上时，海浪拍打着你，要求你在DC 10宪法救赎中成功，以保持对咒语的专注。",
	"A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).": "一个典型的法术要求你选择一个或多个目标，使其受到法术魔法的影响。一个法术的描述会告诉你该法术是针对生物、物体还是针对一个效果区的原点（如下所述）。",
	"Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.": "除非一个法术有可感知的效果，否则生物可能根本不知道它是法术的目标。像噼里啪啦的闪电这样的效果是显而易见的，但更微妙的效果，比如试图读取一个生物的思想，通常不会被注意到，除非咒语另有说明。",
	"To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be behind total cover.": "要瞄准某样东西，你必须有一条通往它的清晰路径，所以它不可能在完全的掩体后面。",
	"If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.": "如果你在一个你看不见的地方放置一个效果区，而在你和那个点之间有一个障碍物，比如一堵墙，那么原点就会出现在那个障碍物的近旁。",
	"If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.": "如果一个法术的目标是你所选择的生物，你可以选择你自己，除非该生物必须是敌对的或者特别是你以外的生物。如果你处于你所施展的法术的作用范围内，你可以以自己为目标。",
	"spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.": "咒语在本质上是保护性的，尽管其中一些有攻击性的用途。他们创造魔法屏障，否定有害的影响，伤害闯入者，或将生物驱逐到其他存在的星球。",
	"spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.": "咒语涉及将物体和生物从一个地方运送到另一个地方。有些法术将生物或物体召唤到施法者身边，而其他法术则允许施法者传送到另一地点。有些法术会无中生有地创造物体或效果。",
	"spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.": "咒语揭示了信息，无论是被遗忘已久的秘密、对未来的一瞥、隐藏事物的位置、幻觉背后的真相，还是遥远的人或地方的幻觉。",
	"spells affect the minds of others, influencing or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.": "法术影响他人的思想，影响或控制他们的行为。这种法术可以使敌人把施法者视为朋友，强迫生物采取某种行动，甚至像木偶一样控制另一个生物。",
	"spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.": "法术操纵魔法能量以产生预期效果。有的召唤出火焰或闪电的爆炸。其他的则是引导正能量来治愈伤口。",
	"spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.": "咒语会欺骗他人的感官或思想。它们使人们看到不存在的东西，错过存在的东西，听到幽灵般的声音，或记住从未发生的事情。有些幻觉创造出任何生物都能看到的幻影，但最阴险的幻觉则是直接在生物的脑海中植入一个影像。",
	"spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life.": "法术操纵生命和死亡的能量。这种法术可以给予额外的生命力储备，从另一个生物身上耗尽生命能量，创造不死生物，甚至让死者复活。",
	"Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as {@spell animate dead} is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.": "通过使用{@spell animate dead}等亡灵法术创造亡灵并不是一种好的行为，只有邪恶的施法者才会经常使用这种法术。",
	"spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.": "法术改变生物、物体或环境的属性。它们可能会把敌人变成无害的生物，增强盟友的力量，使物体在施法者的命令下移动，或者增强生物的先天治疗能力以迅速从伤害中恢复。",
	"Spells such as {@spell burning hands} and {@spell cone of cold} cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once. A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.": "诸如{@spell burning hands}和{@spell cone of cold}之类的法术覆盖一个区域，使其能够同时影响多个生物。一个法术的描述指定了它的作用区域，它通常有五种不同的形状：圆锥体、立方体、圆柱体、线或球体。每个效应区都有一个原点，即法术能量爆发的地点。每种形状的规则都规定了你如何定位其原点。通常情况下，原点是空间中的一个点，但有些法术有一个区域，其原点是一个生物或一个物体。",
	"A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover, as explained in chapter 9.": "一个法术的效果从起源点以直线扩展。如果没有未被阻挡的直线从起源点延伸到效果区域内的某个位置，那么该位置就不包括在法术的区域内。要阻挡这些虚线中的一条，障碍物必须提供完全的掩护，如第9章所解释的。",
	"A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its maximum length.": "一个圆锥体从它的原点向你选择的方向延伸。一个圆锥体在其长度上某一点的宽度等于该点与原点的距离。一个圆锥体的作用区域规定了它的最大长度。",
	"A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.": "除非你另有决定，否则一个圆锥体的原点不包括在圆锥体的作用范围内。",
	"You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each side.": "你选择一个立方体的原点，它位于立方体效果的一个面上的任何位置。立方体的大小以每条边的长度来表示。",
	"A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.": "除非你另有决定，否则一个立方体的原点不包括在立方体的作用范围内。",
	"A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.": "圆柱体的原点是一个特定半径的圆的中心，如法术描述中所述。这个圆必须在地面上或者在法术效果的高度上。圆柱体中的能量以直线方式从原点扩展到圆的周边，形成圆柱体的底部。然后，法术的效果从底部射出，或从顶部射下，射出的距离等于圆柱体的高度。",
	"A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of effect.": "圆柱体的原点包括在圆柱体的作用范围内。",
	"A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.": "一条线从其原点以直线路径延伸至其长度，并覆盖一个由其宽度定义的区域。",
	"A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.": "一条线的原点不包括在该线的作用范围内，除非你另有决定。",
	"You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.": "你选择一个球体的原点，球体就会从这个点向外延伸。球体的大小表示为从该点向外延伸的半径，单位为英尺。",
	"A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.": "一个球体的原点包括在球体的作用范围内。",
	" Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.": " 许多法术都规定，目标可以通过蓄力来避免部分或全部的法术效果。咒语规定了目标在救赎时使用的能力，以及成功或失败时的情况。",
	"The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.": "抵制你的一个法术的DC等于8+你的法术能力修饰+你的熟练度加成+任何特殊修饰。",
	"Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.": "有些法术要求施法者进行攻击卷，以确定法术效果是否击中预定目标。你的法术攻击的攻击力等于你的法术能力修饰+你的熟练度奖励。",
	"Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't {@condition incapacitated}.": "大多数需要攻击卷的法术都涉及远程攻击。记住，如果你在能看到你的敌对生物的5英尺范围内，而那不是（%0%），你的范围攻击卷就有劣势。",
	"The effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap, or the most recent effect applies if the castings are equally potent and their durations overlap.": "不同法术的效果加在一起，而这些法术的持续时间也会重叠。然而，同一法术多次施放的效果并不合并。相反，当它们的持续时间重叠时，来自这些施法的最有力的效果--例如最高的奖励--适用；如果施法的效力相同，并且它们的持续时间重叠，则适用最新的效果。",
	"For example, if two clerics cast {@spell bless} on the same target, that character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to roll two bonus dice.": "例如，如果两个牧师对同一个目标施放（%0%），该角色只能获得一次法术的好处；他或她没有机会掷出两个奖励骰子。",
	"The words within the D&D multiverse are magical places. All existence is suffused with magical power, and potential energy lies untapped in every rock, stream, and living creature, the mute and mindless will of existence, permeating every bit of matter and present in every manifestation of energy throughout the multiverse.": "D&D多元宇宙中的文字是神奇的地方。所有的存在都充斥着神奇的力量，潜在的能量蕴藏在每一块岩石、溪流和生物中，是存在的无声无息的意志，渗透到每一点物质中，存在于整个多元宇宙的每一种能量表现中。",
	"Mortals can't directly shape this raw magic. Instead, they make use of a fabric of magic, a kind of interface between the will of a spellcaster and the stuff of raw magic. The spellcasters of the Forgotten Realms call it the Weave and recognize its essence as the goddess Mystra, but casters have varied ways of naming and visualizing this interface.": "凡人不能直接塑造这种原始魔法。相反，他们利用的是一种魔法织物，一种施法者的意志和原始魔法之间的接口。被遗忘国度的施法者称其为 \"编织\"，并承认其本质是女神Mystra，但施法者有不同的方式来命名和想象这个界面。",
	"By any name, without the Weave, raw magic is locked away and inaccessible; the most powerful archmage can't light a candle with magic in an area where the Weave has been torn. But surrounded by the Weave, a spellcaster can shape lightning to blast foes, transport hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, or even reverse death itself.": "无论叫什么名字，如果没有织网，原始的魔法就会被锁住，无法进入；最强大的大法师也无法在织网被撕裂的地方用魔法点燃一支蜡烛。但在织网的包围下，施法者可以塑造闪电来轰击敌人，在眨眼间传送数百英里，甚至逆转死亡本身。",
	"All magic depends on the Weave, though different kinds of magic access it in a variety of ways. The spells of wizards, warlocks, sorcerers, and bards are commonly called {@b arcane magic}. These spells rely on an understanding—learned or intuitive—of the workings of the Weave. The caster plucks directly at the strands of the Weave to create the desired effect. Eldritch knights and arcane tricksters also use arcane magic. The spells of clerics, druids, paladins, and rangers are called {@b divine magic}. These spellcasters' access to the Weave is mediated by divine power—gods, the divine forces of nature, or the sacred weight of a paladin's oath.": "所有的魔法都依赖于 \"编织\"，尽管不同种类的魔法以不同的方式获取它。巫师、术士、巫师和吟游诗人的法术通常被称为（%0%）。这些法术依赖于对织网工作原理的理解--学习的或直觉的。施法者直接拨动织网的线，以产生所需的效果。恶魔骑士和奥术师也使用奥术魔法。牧师、德鲁伊、圣骑士和游侠的法术被称为（%1%）。这些施法者对 \"编织 \"的使用是由神圣的力量--诸神、自然界的神圣力量或圣骑士誓言的神圣力量所调解的。",
	"Whenever a magic effect is created, the threads of the Weave intertwine, twist, and fold to make the effect possible.": "每当一个魔法效果被创造出来时，\"编织 \"的线就会交织、扭曲和折叠，使效果成为可能。",
	"When characters use divination spells such as {@i detect magic} or {@i identify}, they glimpse the Weave. A spell such as {@i dispel magic} smooths the Weave. Spells such as {@i antimagic field} rearrange the Weave so that magic flows around, rather than through the area affected by the spell. And in places where the Weave is damaged or torn, magic works in unpredictable ways—or not at all.": "当角色使用诸如{@i detect magic}或{@i identify}的占卜咒语时，他们会瞥见织网的情况。像{@i dispel magic}这样的咒语会使织网变得平滑。诸如{@i antimagic field}这样的法术会重新安排编织，使魔法在周围流动，而不是通过受法术影响的区域。而在编织网被破坏或撕裂的地方，魔法以不可预测的方式发挥作用，或者根本不发挥作用。",
	"This chapter describes the most common spells in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. The chapter begins with the spell lists of the spellcasting classes. The remainder contains spell descriptions, presented in alphabetical order by the name of the spell.": "本章描述了《龙与地下城》世界中最常见的法术。这一章以施法类的法术列表开始。其余部分包含法术描述，按法术名称的字母顺序排列。",
	"The spells are presented in alphabetical order.": "这些咒语是按字母顺序排列的。",
	"Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as {@condition blinded}, are impairments, but a few, such as {@condition invisible}, can be advantageous.": "条件以不同的方式改变生物的能力，可以由一个法术、一个等级特征、一个怪物的攻击或其他效果产生。大多数条件，如{@condition blinded}，都是损害，但也有少数条件，如{@condition invisible}，可以是有利的。",
	"A condition lasts either until it is countered (the {@condition prone} condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.": "一个条件要么持续到它被反击为止（例如，{@condition prone}条件被站起来反击），要么持续到施加该条件的效果所指定的时间。",
	"If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.": "如果多个效果对一个生物施加了相同的条件，则该条件的每个实例都有自己的持续时间，但该条件的效果不会变得更糟。一个生物要么有一个条件，要么没有。",
	"For a full list of the conditions, see the ": "完整的条件清单，请见",
	" page. The conditions are:": " 页。条件是。",
	"Religion is an important part of life in the worlds of the D&D multiverse. When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it's hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.": "在D&D多元宇宙的世界中，宗教是生活的一个重要组成部分。当神灵在世界中行走，牧师引导神力，邪教在地下巢穴中进行黑暗祭祀，而闪亮的圣骑士就像对抗黑暗的灯塔，很难对神灵产生矛盾并否认他们的存在。",
	"Many people in the worlds of D&D worship different gods at different times and circumstances. People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god's ideals. Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM's campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you're playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity's suggested domains when selecting your character's domain.": "在D&D的世界中，许多人在不同的时间和环境下崇拜不同的神。例如，在被遗忘的王国里，人们可能会向苏妮祈祷爱情的好运，在去市场之前向沃肯献上祭品，在暴风雨来临之际祈祷安抚塔洛斯--所有这些都在同一天发生。许多人在诸神中都有自己的最爱，他们把自己的理想和教义作为自己的理想。也有少数人将自己完全奉献给一个神，通常作为牧师或该神的理想的支持者。你的管理员决定在他或她的活动中崇拜哪些神，如果有的话。你可以从现有的神灵中选择一个神灵，让你的角色服务、崇拜或口头服务。或者你可以选择几个你的角色最经常祈祷的神。或者只需在脑海中记下在你的DM活动中受到尊敬的神灵，这样你就可以在适当的时候援引他们的名字。如果你扮演的是牧师或具有圣徒背景的角色，请决定你的神灵服务于哪个神，并在选择你的角色的领域时考虑该神灵建议的领域。",
	"Many deities in this section suggest the Life domain, particularly if they are closely associated with healing, protection, childbirth, nurturing, or fertility. As described in the chapter 3, though, the Life domain is incredibly broad, and a cleric of any non-evil deity can choose it.": "本节中的许多神祗都建议使用生命领域，尤其是当他们与治疗、保护、分娩、养育或生育密切相关时。不过，正如第三章所述，生命领域的范围非常广泛，任何非邪恶神祗的牧师都可以选择它。",
	"A number of other deities, mostly evil ones, suggest the Death domain, which is detailed in the Dungeon Master's Guide. Most clerics who choose this domain are evil NPCs, but if you want to worship a god of death, consult your Dungeon Master.": "其他一些神灵，大多是邪恶的神灵，建议使用死亡领域，这在《地下城主指南》中有详细说明。大多数选择这个领域的神职人员都是邪恶的NPC，但如果你想崇拜一个死神，请咨询你的地下城管理员。",
	"Each world in the D&D multiverse has its own pantheons of deities, ranging in size from the teeming pantheons of the Forgotten Realms and Greyhawk to the more focused religions of Eberron and Dragonlance. Many of the nonhuman races worship the same gods on different worlds—Moradin, for example, is revered by dwarves of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and many other worlds.": "D&D多元宇宙中的每个世界都有自己的神殿，其规模从被遗忘的领域和灰鹰的大量神殿到Eberron和龙之谷的更集中的宗教。许多非人类种族在不同的世界中崇拜相同的神灵--例如，摩拉丁（Moradin）受到了被遗忘的世界、灰鹰和其他许多世界的矮人的敬仰。",

	"The world of Eberron has many different religions, but the most important revolves around a pantheon called the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting voice. Eberron's other religions are very different from the traditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.": "Eberron世界有许多不同的宗教，但最重要的是围绕着一个被称为 \"主神 \"的万神殿和他们邪恶的阴影--黑暗六神。主权之神被认为拥有对存在的各个方面的统治权，并以统一的声音说话。但黑暗六神是原始的、血腥的、残忍的神，他们提供不同的声音。Eberron的其他宗教与传统的D&D万神殿非常不同。一神教的银焰教会致力于打击世界上的邪恶，但却被自己队伍中的腐败所困扰。沃尔之血的哲学认为，神性存在于所有的凡人之中，并敬重那些已经获得不朽的亡灵。各种疯狂的邪教都致力于囚禁在艾伯伦地下世界的恶魔和恐怖（被称为凯伯，地下之龙）。光明之路的追随者相信，世界正在走向一个辉煌的未来，笼罩在这个世界上的阴影将被转化为光明。而两个相关的精灵民族崇尚他们的祖先的精神：以精神甚至不死形态保存下来的不死阁，以及被荣耀的过去之灵，即古代战争中的伟大英雄。",

When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.

The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning longhouse.": "这里的土地从雪山上跌落到冰冷的峡湾中，这里的长船停在海滩上，这里的冰川随着每个秋天和春天向前流动和后退--这就是维京人的土地，北欧神殿的家园。这是一个残酷的气候，也是一个需要残酷生活的气候。为了生存，这片土地上的勇士们不得不适应恶劣的条件，但他们并没有因为环境的需要而变得过于扭曲。考虑到为了食物和财富而突袭的必要性，令人惊讶的是凡人变成了他们所做的那样好。他们的力量反映了这些战士对强有力的领导和果断的行动的需要。因此，他们在河流的每一个转弯处都能看到他们的神灵，在雷声和冰川的轰鸣中听到他们的声音，在长屋燃烧的烟雾中闻到他们的气息。",
	"The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

	"The Material Plane is a richly magical place, and its magical nature is reflected in the two planes that share its central place in the multiverse. The Feywild and the Shadowfell are parallel dimensions occupying the same cosmological space, so they are often called echo planes or mirror planes to the Material Plane. The worlds and landscapes of these planes mirror the natural world of the Material Plane but reflect those features into different forms—more marvelous and magical in the Feywild, distorted and colorless in the Shadowfell.

It is a realm of eternal twilight, with slow lanterns bobbing in the gentle breeze and huge fireflies buzzing through groves and fields. The sky is alight with the faded colors of the setting, or perhaps rising, sun. But, in fact, the sun never truly sets or rises; it remains stationary, dusky and low in the sky. Away from the settled areas ruled by the Seelie Court, the land is a tangle of sharp-toothed brambles and syrupy fens—perfect territory for the Unseelie to hunt their prey. Fey creatures, such as those brought to the world by conjure woodland beings and similar spells, dwell in the Feywild.": "{@b Feywild,}也被称为精灵界，是一个充满柔和灯光和奇迹的地方，是一个拥有巨大欲望的小人物的国家，是一个充满音乐和死亡的地方。这是一个永恒的黄昏王国，缓慢的灯笼在轻柔的微风中晃动，巨大的萤火虫在树林和田野中嗡嗡作响。天空中闪烁着夕阳褪去的色彩，也许是太阳升起的时候。但是，事实上，太阳从未真正落下或升起；它仍然静止不动，在天空中昏暗而低沉。在远离塞里王室统治的定居区的地方，这片土地是由尖齿荆棘和糖浆沼泽组成的纠缠，是非塞里人猎取猎物的完美领地。妖怪生物，比如那些被施展林地生物和类似法术带到世界上的妖怪，就住在妖怪世界里。",
	"The {@b Shadowfell,} also called the Plane of Shadow, is a darkly lighted dimension, a world of black and white where color has been leached from everything. It is a place of toxic darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.": "{@b Shadowfell,}也被称为 \"影子空间\"，是一个黑暗的照明维度，是一个黑与白的世界，色彩已经从一切事物中被浸透。这是一个有毒的黑暗的地方，憎恨光明，那里的天空是一个黑色的穹顶，既没有太阳也没有星星。",
	"Like a dome above the other planes, the {@b Positive Plane} is the source of radiant energy and the raw life force that suffuses all living beings, from the puny to the sublime.

They're not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.": "在物质世界之外，各种存在的平面是神话和神秘的领域。它们不是简单的其他世界，而是不同质量的存在，由从普通世界中抽象出来的精神和元素原则形成和支配。",

	"A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes. And the {@spell astral projection} spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.": "一些法术允许直接或间接进入其他存在的位面。位面转移和门可以将冒险者直接传送到任何其他存在的位面，并有不同程度的精确度。虚空之力（Etherealness）允许冒险者进入虚空位面，并从那里前往它所接触到的任何位面--暗影位面、仙界或元素位面。而{@spell astral projection}法术让冒险者将自己投射到星界，并前往外星界。",
	"A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the interplanar travel. Others are locations—circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).": "门户是一个固定的星际连接的总称，它将一个平面上的特定位置与另一个平面上的特定位置连接起来。有些传送门就像门洞，一扇透明的窗户，或一个被雾气笼罩的通道，只要踏过它就能影响星际旅行。其他的则是一些地点--一圈圈的立石、高耸的塔楼、帆船，甚至是整个城镇--它们同时存在于多个平面中，或者从一个平面依次闪烁到另一个平面。有些是旋涡，通常将一个元素位面与物质位面的一个非常相似的位置连接起来，比如火山的中心（通往火位面）或海洋深处（通往水位面）。",
	"The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as etherealness and astral projection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse them to reach the planes beyond.": "虚空界和星界被称为过渡性平面。它们大多是没有特征的领域，主要作为从一个位面到另一个位面的旅行方式。诸如 \"空灵 \"和 \"星体投射 \"之类的法术可以让角色进入这些位面，并穿越它们到达其他位面。",
	"The Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force. The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.": "虚空界是一个迷雾重重的维度，有时被描述为一个巨大的海洋。它的海岸被称为 \"边界虚无\"，与物质世界和内部世界重叠，因此这些世界上的每个位置在虚无世界上都有一个对应的位置。某些生物可以看到边界虚空，而隐身术和真视术则赋予这种能力。一些魔法效果也能从物质界延伸到边界虚空界，尤其是使用力能的效果，如力笼和力墙。这个平面的深处，即深层虚空，是一个漩涡状的迷雾和彩色雾气的区域。",
	"The {@b Astral Plane} is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the divine and demonic.

Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in midair like spinning coins.

	"At their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth, blazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions are little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example, a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the Elemental Chaos.": "在其最内部的边缘，也就是最接近物质界的地方（如果不是字面地理意义上的概念），四个元素界类似于物质界的一个世界。四种元素像它们在物质界一样混合在一起，形成土地、海洋和天空。但在远离物质界的地方，元素界既陌生又敌对。在这里，各种元素以其最纯粹的形式存在--大面积的坚实土地、炽热的火焰、晶莹剔透的水和不受污染的空气。这些地区鲜为人知，所以当讨论火界时，比如说，发言者通常只指边界地区。在内层世界的最远处，纯粹的元素溶解并流淌在一起，成为能量冲突和物质碰撞的无休止的喧嚣，即元素混沌。",
	"If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction.": "如果内层世界是构成多元宇宙的原始物质和能量，那么外层世界就是这种构建的方向、思想和目的。",

	"When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally \"places\" at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.": "当讨论任何与神灵有关的问题时，所使用的语言必须是高度隐喻的。他们的实际住所根本不是字面上的 \"地方\"，而是体现了外域是思想和精神的领域这一观点。与元素界一样，人们可以把外星界的可感知部分想象成一种边界区域，而广泛的精神区域则位于普通感官经验之外。",
	"Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive. Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill their own needs.": "即使在那些可感知的区域，外表也可能是欺骗性的。起初，许多外星体对物质界的居民来说似乎很好客，很熟悉。但景观会因生活在外星的强大力量的奇思妙想而改变。居住在这些星球上的强大力量的欲望可以完全重塑它们，有效地抹去和重建存在本身，以更好地满足他们自己的需求。",
	"Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can also stretch on to what seems like infinity.

Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.": "在外星球上，距离是一个几乎没有意义的概念。外层世界可感知的区域通常看起来相当小，但它们也可以延伸到似乎是无限大。如果地狱的权力者愿意，也许可以在一天内完成从第一层到第九层的九层地狱的导游之旅。或者，旅行者可能要花几周时间艰苦跋涉，穿越一个层。",

A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there.

	"The Outlands is circular, like a great wheel—in fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes.

Other portals might still exist, marked by the alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around them.": "没有已知的通往远界的传送门，或者至少没有仍然可行的。古老的精灵曾经在一座名为火暴峰的山中用一个巨大的门户刺破了岁月的界限，通往远界，但他们的文明在血腥的恐怖中内爆了，门户的位置--甚至它的母体世界--也早已被遗忘。其他的传送门可能仍然存在，被渗入其中的外星力量标记为腐蚀周围的物质世界。",
	"Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the {@language Primordial||Auran}, {@language Primordial||Aquan}, {@language Primordial||Ignan}, and {@language Primordial||Terran} dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.": "其中一些语言实际上是有许多方言的语言家族。例如，原始语言包括{@language Primordial||Auran}、{@language Primordial||Aquan}、{@language Primordial||Ignan}和{@language Primordial||Terran}方言，四个元素位面各有一种。讲同一语言的不同方言的生物可以相互交流。",
	"A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. {@spell Plane shift} and {@spell gate} can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—the Shadowfell, the Feywild, or the Elemental Planes. And the {@spell astral projection} spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.": "一些法术允许直接或间接进入其他存在的位面。{@spell Plane shift}和{@spell gate}可以将冒险者直接传送到任何其他存在的位面，并有不同程度的精确度。虚空之力（Etherealness）允许冒险者进入虚空位面，并从那里前往它所接触到的任何位面--暗影位面、仙界或元素位面。而(2%)法术可以让冒险者将自己投射到星界，并前往外星界。"
