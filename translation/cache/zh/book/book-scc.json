	"A magical world boasts many places where students can study magic and many sages who take eager learners under their wings. But being accepted to Strixhaven University is a special honor, the dream of many young students. Strixhaven is a place of enlightenment and learning, and both its graduates and its delegates are typically welcomed and respected wherever they go.": "一个神奇的世界拥有许多学生可以学习魔法的地方，也有许多圣人将热切的学习者纳入他们的麾下。但被斯特里克斯海文大学录取是一种特殊的荣誉，是许多年轻学生的梦想。Strixhaven是一个启蒙和学习的地方，它的毕业生和它的代表们无论走到哪里都会受到欢迎和尊重。",
	"Founded seven centuries ago by five ancient dragons, Strixhaven is the premier institution of magical learning, drawing promising young mages from all over. Each equipped with its own campus and faculty, Strixhaven's five colleges—summarized in the Colleges of Strixhaven table—cover a vast array of academic and magical specialties.": "七个世纪前由五条古龙创建的斯特里克斯港是首屈一指的魔法学习机构，吸引了来自各地的有前途的年轻法师。Strixhaven的五所学院--Strixhaven学院表中的摘要--涵盖了大量的学术和魔法专业，每所学院都有自己的校园和教师。",
	"As a Strixhaven student, you start with a well-rounded education in a rigorous first-year program. In your second year, you choose your preferred specialty at one of the five colleges. You can also partake in a vibrant campus life, with plenty of clubs and other activities. You might even play on one of Strixhaven's prestigious Mage Tower teams and bask in the adoration of cheering crowds!": "作为一名Strixhaven的学生，你将在严格的第一年课程中开始接受全面的教育。在第二年，你在五个学院之一选择你喜欢的专业。你还可以参加充满活力的校园生活，有大量的俱乐部和其他活动。你甚至可以在斯特里克斯海文著名的法师塔团队中打球，并沐浴在欢呼的人群中。",

	"{@book Chapter 1|SCC|1} gives an overview of life and study at Strixhaven. It introduces the main features of the central campus and each of the five colleges.": "{@book Chapter 1|SCC|1}对Strixhaven的生活和学习进行了概述。它介绍了中心校区和五个学院的主要特点。",
	"{@book Chapter 2|SCC|2} is your guide to creating a student character. It introduces the owlin race and five backgrounds—one for each college—as well as a collection of feats, spells, and magic items.": "{@book Chapter 2|SCC|2}是你创建学生角色的指南。它介绍了猫头鹰种族和五个背景，每个学院都有一个背景，以及一系列的特技、咒语和魔法物品。",
	"{@book Chapters 3|SCC-CK|0}–{@adventure 6|SCC-ARiR|0} provide a campaign meant to advance characters from 1st to 10th level as they progress through their magical studies. Each chapter covers a year's worth of adventure, so characters begin {@book chapter 3|SCC|3} as 1st-level characters and first-year students and begin {@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0} at the start of their fourth year of studies (at around 8th level). Chapter 3 includes an overview of the adventures and the overall campaign arc as well as special rules for aspects of campus life: exams, relationships, extracurriculars, and jobs.": "{@book Chapters 3|SCC-CK|0}-{@adventure 6|SCC-ARiR|0}提供了一个活动，旨在让角色在通过魔法学习的过程中从1级提升到10级。每一章涵盖了一年的冒险，因此角色从{@book chapter 3|SCC|3}一级角色和一年级学生开始，到{@adventure chapter 6|SCC-ARiR|0}第四年的学习开始时（大约8级）。第三章包括对冒险和整个活动弧线的概述，以及对校园生活各方面的特殊规则：考试、人际关系、课外活动和工作。",
	"{@book Chapter 7|SCC|8} is a collection of stat blocks for students, faculty, and various creatures on and around the Strixhaven campus. Whether student adventurers get caught up in a duel with their rivals or face a dreaded {@creature mage hunter|SCC}, the stat blocks in this chapter give you the information you need to resolve the situation.": "{@book Chapter 7|SCC|8}是Strixhaven校园内和周围的学生、教师和各种生物的状态块的集合。无论学生冒险者是陷入与对手的决斗中，还是面对可怕的{@creature mage hunter|SCC}，本章中的状态块都能为你提供解决问题所需的信息。",
	"The following subsections present three important facts to keep in mind as you explore these pages and prepare to play or run the book's campaign.": "以下各小节介绍了三个重要的事实，在你探索这些页面并准备玩或运行本书的活动时，要牢记在心。",
	"This book's campaign assumes that the player characters are students at Strixhaven University. Even as they get caught up in the adventures, the characters have to continue going to class, doing homework, and studying for exams. Optional rules in {@book chapter 3|SCC|3|Exams} reinforce the importance of study in the adventures.": "本书的活动假设玩家角色是Strixhaven大学的学生。即使他们被卷入了冒险，角色们也必须继续去上课、做作业和为考试学习。{@book chapter 3|SCC|3|Exams}中的可选规则加强了冒险中学习的重要性。",
	"The characters are also subject to the authority of the university's faculty and staff members. Circumstances will at times cause player characters to defy faculty authority—and even deans—during their adventures, and the threat of detention or even expulsion might hang over their head.": "角色也要服从大学教职员工的权威。在冒险过程中，有时情况会导致玩家角色藐视教职员工的权威，甚至是院长，而拘留甚至开除的威胁可能会悬在他们头上。",
	"Finally, student characters are part of a school community. They live in university housing, eat in dining halls, and spend the majority of their time on campus. They eat, sleep, study, socialize, and adventure as part of a community of students, faculty, and staff. The school is like a town, where a relatively small cast of characters can play significant roles over the course of the campaign.": "最后，学生角色是学校社区的一部分。他们住在大学宿舍，在食堂吃饭，大部分时间在校园里度过。他们吃饭、睡觉、学习、社交和冒险，是学生、教师和工作人员社区的一部分。学校就像一个城镇，相对较小的人物在运动过程中可以发挥重要作用。",
	"Study at Strixhaven isn't about learning to be a wizard but about learning to be a historian, an artist, an orator, a scientist, or some other profession—while using magic to enhance one's studies. The university's understanding of magic is expansive. Characters of any class can study at Strixhaven, whether they're full-fledged spellcasters like wizards, clerics, and druids; they manage a spell or two thanks to a subclass or feat; or they manifest magical abilities that aren't even spells. (For example, a barbarian who follows the {@class Barbarian|PHB|Path of the Ancestral Guardian|Ancestral Guardian|XGE}, described in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, can excel in studying history at Lorehold College by virtue of their connection to an ancestral spirit.)": "在斯特里克斯海文的学习并不是为了学习成为一名巫师，而是为了学习成为一名历史学家、艺术家、演说家、科学家或其他一些职业--同时使用魔法来提高自己的学习。这所大学对魔法的理解是广泛的。任何阶级的角色都可以在斯特里克斯港学习，无论他们是像巫师、牧师和德鲁伊这样的成熟的施法者；他们通过一个子类或特技掌握一两个法术；或者他们表现出甚至不是法术的魔法能力。(例如，一个遵循{@class Barbarian|PHB|Path of the Ancestral Guardian|Ancestral Guardian|XGE}的野蛮人，在{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的野蛮人，可以凭借他们与祖先的精神联系，在罗尔霍德学院学习历史时表现出色。）",
	"Magic is everywhere on campus. The campus culture encourages finding magical solutions to the most mundane problems, and if characters need access to a spell they can't cast, they have a strong chance of finding someone who can cast it.": "在校园里，魔法无处不在。校园文化鼓励为最平凡的问题寻找魔法解决方案，如果角色需要获得他们无法施展的法术，他们有很大机会找到可以施展的人。",
	"Strixhaven draws students and faculty from across the world and from other realms in the multiverse. The university's students and faculty are united by a desire to learn and include humans, elves, dwarves, owlin (described in {@book chapter 2|SCC|2|Owlin}), orcs, trolls, vampires, and studious folk of many other origins.": "Strixhaven吸引了来自世界各地和多元宇宙中其他领域的学生和教师。大学的学生和教职员工因为对学习的渴望而团结在一起，其中包括人类、精灵、矮人、猫头鹰（在{@book chapter 2|SCC|2|Owlin}中描述）、兽人、巨魔、吸血鬼和许多其他来源的好学的人。",
	"In practical terms, for player characters, you can use the rules found in any D&D book to select a character's race, if the DM approves. For nonplayer characters, you're as likely to meet a {@creature pixie}, a {@creature dryad}, a giant, a {@creature treant}, or another fantastical creature on campus as you are to meet a Humanoid. The faculty members mentioned in {@book chapter 1|SCC|1} include genasi, tritons, and even a bipedal brown bear.": "在实践中，对于玩家角色，如果DM同意，你可以使用任何D&D书中的规则来选择角色的种族。对于非玩家角色，你在校园里遇到{@creature pixie}、{@creature dryad}、巨人、{@creature treant}或其他幻想生物的可能性与遇到类人生物的可能性一样大。{@book chapter 1|SCC|1}中提到的教员包括genasi、tritons，甚至还有一只双足棕熊。",
	"To the faculty and students of Strixhaven, it is unremarkable to meet someone who hails from a far-off land, since almost everyone on campus is from somewhere else. Strixhaven has a place for anyone who is dedicated to magic-enhanced study.": "对于斯特里克斯海文的教师和学生来说，遇到一个来自遥远国度的人并不引人注目，因为校园里几乎每个人都来自其他地方。Strixhaven为任何致力于魔法强化研究的人提供了一个位置。",
	"Strixhaven bills itself as \"the premier institution of magical learning in the world,\" but the question that raises for your campaign is this—which world?": "Strixhaven将自己标榜为 \"世界上最重要的魔法学习机构\"，但这给你的活动提出了一个问题--哪个世界？",
	"In the multiverse of the Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Game, Strixhaven is located on a world called Arcavios, which (according to legend) formed from the collision or merging of two other worlds. It is situated in the northeastern portion of a continent called Orrithia, also known as the Vastlands, which is populated by a tremendous variety of peoples.": "在《魔法：集会》交易卡游戏的多元宇宙中，Strixhaven位于一个叫做Arcavios的世界，（根据传说）它是由另外两个世界的碰撞或合并形成的。它位于一个名为Orrithia的大陆的东北部，也被称为Vastlands，该大陆上有大量的民族居住。",
	"For the purposes of D&D, though, you can place Strixhaven wherever it best fits the needs of your campaign. It could be in a world of your own creation, in a published D&D setting (such as the Forgotten Realms or Eberron), in the planar cosmopolis of Sigil, or in an interplanar nexus that allows it to draw students from across the Material Plane or the entire multiverse.": "不过，就D&D而言，你可以把Strixhaven放在最适合你的活动需要的地方。它可以在你自己创造的世界中，在已出版的D&D设定中（如被遗忘的领域或Eberron），在Sigil的平面宇宙城市中，或在一个星际纽带中，使它能够吸引来自整个物质世界或整个多元宇宙的学生。",
	"Whatever world you decide to place Strixhaven in, three elements of the wider world of Arcavios might have some impact on adventures in the school.": "无论你决定将斯特里沙文放在哪个世界，阿卡维奥斯更广阔的世界中的三个元素可能会对学校的冒险产生一些影响。",
	"As described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, magic suffuses all existence in the worlds of D&D. In the Forgotten Realms, scholars describe the fabric of magic as a Weave that allows spellcasters to interact with the world's underlying magical reality. In Arcavios, that fabric is knotted and tangled in some locations, creating a phenomenon called snarls. At these places, spells can be amplified or distorted in unpredictable ways. This phenomenon matters for Strixhaven because a luminous snarl is situated at the very heart of campus, located in the Hall of Oracles in the university's monumental library, the Biblioplex.": "正如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所描述的，在D&D的世界中，魔法充斥着所有的存在。在被遗忘的领域中，学者们将魔法的结构描述为一种编织，允许施法者与世界的基本魔法现实进行互动。在阿卡维奥斯，这种结构在某些地方打了结并纠缠在一起，形成了一种叫做 \"咆哮 \"的现象。在这些地方，法术会以不可预知的方式被放大或扭曲。这种现象对斯特里克斯海文来说很重要，因为一个发光的咆哮声位于校园的中心，位于大学的纪念性图书馆--书库中的奥拉司大厅。",
	"Similarly, gravity-defying arch shapes appear throughout the world of Arcavios and, in particular, tower over the Biblioplex. These star arches are made from spokes of natural materials that float in an arch shape, with a precise inner curve and a rough and irregular outer arch. They can stand straight or lie at an angle, and they can be small or enormous, whole or broken, grown over or mysteriously clean. Their irregular spokes evoke the radiating lines of a shining star.": "同样，违反重力的拱门形状出现在整个阿卡维奥斯的世界里，尤其是耸立在图书馆的上方。这些星形拱门由天然材料的辐条制成，呈拱形漂浮，内部有精确的曲线，外部则是粗糙不规则的拱门。它们可以笔直地站立，也可以倾斜地躺着，可以是小的，也可以是巨大的，可以是完整的，也可以是破碎的，可以是长在上面的，也可以是神秘地干净的。它们的不规则辐条让人联想到一颗闪亮的星星的辐射线。",
	"The star arches are a mystery left over from the birth of the world. In most cases, the arches simply float inexplicably—silent, immovable, and inert. But many people report seeing an arch appear to them at a critical juncture in their lives, helping them understand a lesson or answer a burning question in their mind. Some scholars believe each arch marks a place of great magic, such as the site of a great mage's birth or the location of a time-lost spell. Other folk believe these arches are connected with the archaics in some way (see \"{@book Archaics and the Oracle|SCC|0|Archaics and the Oracle}\" below). Some students have even seen an arch come to life with magic in an archaic's presence.": "星形拱门是世界诞生后留下的一个谜团。在大多数情况下，拱门只是莫名其妙地漂浮在空中--静止的、不动的、惰性的。但许多人报告说，在他们生活的关键时刻，看到一个拱门出现在他们面前，帮助他们理解一个教训或回答他们心中的一个迫切问题。一些学者认为，每个拱门都标志着一个伟大的魔法场所，如一个伟大的法师的出生地或一个失传的法术的位置。其他民间人士相信这些拱门在某种程度上与古人有关（见下文\"（%0%）\"）。有些学生甚至看到拱门在古人面前用魔法复活。",
	"Both snarls and star arches are subjects of magical research for students and faculty at Strixhaven, who also study wild and dead magic zones, floating earth motes, and other weird locales.": "咆哮声和星拱门都是斯特里克斯港师生的魔法研究对象，他们还研究野生和死亡魔法区、漂浮的地球微粒和其他奇怪的地方。",
	"Strixhaven University was founded by five ancient dragons who, according to legend, hatched from the magical energy of the newborn world of Arcavios. These Founder Dragons were among the first to master magic, and they realized that only through disciplined study would magic be safe in the hands of other peoples. They founded Strixhaven to facilitate that study and established the five colleges based on the magic that each dragon mastered, as summarized in the Founder Dragons table.": "Strixhaven大学是由五条古龙建立的，根据传说，他们是从新生的阿卡维斯世界的魔法能量中孵化出来的。这些创始人龙是第一批掌握魔法的人，他们意识到，只有通过有规律的学习，魔法才能在其他民族手中得到安全。他们建立了斯特里克斯港以促进这种研究，并根据每条龙掌握的魔法建立了五所学院，正如创始人龙的表格中所总结的。",
	"To this day, the Founder Dragons roam the world. They no longer associate directly with Strixhaven, preferring to let the deans of the colleges speak in their stead. The dragons' knowledge is vast, but their tempers can prove short. Mages seek them out only to learn the most elusive secrets. The dragons' stat blocks are presented in {@book chapter 7|SCC|8}.": "时至今日，创始人龙族仍在世界范围内游荡。他们不再直接与斯特里克斯港联系，而是更愿意让学院的院长们代替他们说话。龙的知识很丰富，但它们的脾气却很暴躁。法师们找他们只是为了了解最难以捉摸的秘密。龙的状态块是以{@book chapter 7|SCC|8}表示的。",
	"The {@creature Oracle of Strixhaven|SCC} is the wisest and most accomplished mage in the world of Arcavios, selected by the Founder Dragons. The Oracle's lifelong task is to ensure that magic is used to help people and not twisted to evil ends. To be the Oracle, one must understand fundamental truths about the nature of magic, know and wield hundreds of spells, and possess impeccable judgment and virtue.": "{@creature Oracle of Strixhaven|SCC}是阿卡维奥斯世界中最聪明、最有成就的法师，由创始人龙族选定。神谕者的终生任务是确保魔法被用来帮助人们，而不是被扭曲为邪恶的目的。要成为神谕者，必须了解关于魔法本质的基本真理，知道并掌握数百种法术，并拥有无可挑剔的判断力和美德。",
	"Mysteriously linked to the Oracle, {@creature Archaic|SCC|archaics} are wise, giant, long-lived beings with an innate talent for magic. They can be seen striding through the wilds, exploring sources of magic with their many arms or contemplating existence through their \"eye,\" which functions as a magical focus of some kind. Scholars seek out archaics for their vast knowledge of history and magic, but archaics tend to communicate in obscure allusions and cryptic metaphors.": "与神谕有神秘联系的（%0%）是智慧的、巨大的、长寿的生命，具有天生的魔法天赋。人们可以看到他们在荒野中漫步，用他们的许多手臂探索魔法的来源，或者通过他们的 \"眼睛 \"来思考存在的问题，他们的眼睛是某种魔法的焦点。学者们因其丰富的历史和魔法知识而寻找古人，但古人倾向于用晦涩的典故和神秘的比喻进行交流。",
	"Few know that archaics' existence is linked to a time-warping phenomenon involving the Oracle. When an Oracle dies, their mind and spirit is swept off to the distant past, drawn backward through time toward the intense magical power that brought the world into being. Splinters of that Oracle's soul and its fragmented memories coalesce into a creature—a newborn archaic. Every archaic alive today was born at the dawn of time from the mind of someone who has lived and died (or who will one day live and die) as an Oracle. Archaics speak in cryptic allegories not only to tease and test the eager minds of young mages, but also to cleverly sidestep time paradoxes.": "很少有人知道，古生物的存在与涉及神谕的时间扭曲现象有关。当神谕者死亡时，他们的思想和精神被卷到遥远的过去，通过时间被吸引到带来世界的强大魔力中。神谕者的灵魂碎片和其零散的记忆凝聚成一种生物--新生的古人。今天活着的每一个古人都是在时间的黎明时分从一个曾经作为神谕者生与死（或有一天会生与死）的人的头脑中诞生。古代人用神秘的寓言说话，不仅是为了挑逗和测试年轻法师急切的头脑，也是为了巧妙地回避时间悖论。",
	"Stat blocks for {@creature Archaic|SCC|archaics} appear in {@book chapter 7|SCC|8}, alongside that of the current {@creature Oracle of Strixhaven|SCC|Oracle}, whose name is Jadzi.": "{@creature Archaic|SCC|archaics}的状态块出现在{@book chapter 7|SCC|8}，与当前{@creature Oracle of Strixhaven|SCC|Oracle}的状态块一起，他的名字是Jadzi。",
	"Strixhaven University sparkles with the enthusiasm of its students and faculty, as they study, debate about, and experiment with magic in its varied forms. This chapter offers an overview of life and studies on the university's campus, as well as a look at each of the five colleges where students explore different modes of magical study.": "斯特里克斯海文大学闪烁着师生们的热情，他们研究、争论并尝试各种形式的魔法。本章概述了大学校园的生活和学习情况，并对学生探索不同魔法研究模式的五个学院进行了介绍。",
	"The fundamental work of Strixhaven University is the application of magic to academic study. Students and faculty aren't limited to magical topics alone; they pursue studies in every facet of existence—magical or otherwise—applying magic to whatever they study. At Strixhaven, historians call the spirits of the dead to aid their lessons about the past, and arcano-biologists use necromancy to pull at life and coax out death when teaching about the natural world. Simultaneously, mage-artists sculpt elemental energy to create animate art, and arcane symbologists teach students how to recognize and understand the magical glyphs they encounter.": "Strixhaven大学的基本工作是将魔法应用于学术研究。学生和教职员工并不局限于魔法课题；他们在存在的每一个方面--魔法或其他方面--进行研究，将魔法应用于他们所研究的一切。在Strixhaven，历史学家召唤死人的灵魂来帮助他们关于过去的课程，弧形生物学家在教授自然世界时使用死灵术来拉动生命和哄骗死亡。同时，魔法师雕刻元素能量以创造有生命的艺术，而奥术符号学家则教学生如何识别和理解他们遇到的魔法字形。",
	"The colleges and curriculum at Strixhaven are organized around the idea of philosophical principles joined in concordant opposition. Each school embraces the paradoxical unity of two polar principles: life and death, order and chaos, reason and emotion, and so on. The five Founder Dragons are thought to embody the coexistence of these principles, while the ten deans of the colleges stand for the individual principles distinguished from their opposites.": "Strixhaven的学院和课程是围绕着哲学原理的和谐对立而组织的。每所学校都拥护两极原则的矛盾统一：生命与死亡，秩序与混乱，理性与情感，等等。五位创始人龙被认为体现了这些原则的共存，而学院的十位院长则代表了区别于其对立面的个别原则。",
	"A student's course of learning at Strixhaven involves exploring the tension between these opposing principles, which typically involves late-night arguments in residence halls and study rooms. The university's teaching philosophy is built on the idea that exploring opposites leads to an understanding of a greater whole. Most people believe that only a being with the wisdom (and long life) of the Founder Dragons or the archaics can truly master both halves of a school's dichotomy, but a mage must learn at least the rudiments of those halves. A Strixhaven graduate is expected to leave the university prepared to argue the fundamental issues of their school's philosophies.": "学生在Strixhaven的学习课程包括探索这些对立原则之间的张力，这通常包括在宿舍和自习室的深夜争论。该大学的教学理念是建立在探索对立面导致对更大的整体的理解这一想法之上的。大多数人认为，只有拥有创始人龙族或古人的智慧（和长寿）的存在才能真正掌握一个学校二分法的两半，但法师必须至少学会这两半的粗浅知识。一个Strixhaven的毕业生被期望在离开大学时能准备好争论他们学校哲学的基本问题。",
	"The faculty members of Strixhaven are mages and scholars—experts in their various fields and in the use of magic to enhance their studies. They are dedicated to their research and to educating generations of mage-students who follow in their footsteps. Some faculty members value research more than teaching, while others make education their highest priority. But all find some balance between the two.": "Strixhaven的教职员工都是法师和学者--他们是各个领域的专家，也是使用魔法来加强研究的专家。他们致力于他们的研究和教育一代又一代跟随他们脚步的魔法学生。一些教员重视研究胜过教学，而另一些教员则把教育作为最优先事项。但所有人都在这两者之间找到了某种平衡。",
	"Strixhaven's faculty begin their careers as instructors, focusing primarily on teaching classes and crafting curriculum, while the school administration evaluates their performance. At the end of a provisional period, which can last from one to several years, an instructor is elevated to the rank of professor or let go.": "Strixhaven的教职员工开始时是作为教员，主要侧重于教授课程和精心设计课程，同时学校行政部门对他们的表现进行评估。在临时期结束时（可能持续一至数年），教员会被提升为教授级别或被解雇。",
	"Professors who have distinguished themselves over the course of a long career—typically at least twenty years—hope to be recognized with the title of esteemed professor. This honor is bestowed in recognition of groundbreaking research as well as exceptional teaching.": "在长期职业生涯中表现突出的教授--通常是至少20年--希望被授予受尊敬的教授称号。这一荣誉的授予是为了表彰开创性的研究和卓越的教学。",
	"Upon retiring, a professor receives the title of mage emeritus. Mages emeriti are held in high esteem and welcomed to campus as guest lecturers.": "在退休后，教授会得到名誉法师的称号。荣誉法师受到高度尊重，并被欢迎到校园担任客座讲师。",
	"Students at Strixhaven spend their first year in a course of general studies, which lays the foundation for the more specialized work to follow. During this year, they wear a uniform of black, white, and gray. They're encouraged to study broadly so that they become acquainted with a wide range of disciplines.": "Strixhaven的学生在第一年学习普通课程，这为接下来更专业的工作打下了基础。在这一年里，他们穿着黑、白、灰三色的制服。我们鼓励他们广泛地学习，以便他们熟悉广泛的学科。",
	"First-year students live in dormitories located on the central campus and often form close friendships there that last throughout their educational careers, even when members of tight-knit groups of friends join different colleges in their second year. A few students continue to live on central campus after choosing a college, particularly if they pursue extensive studies in multiple colleges or work as resident advisers to first-year students. But most students move to dormitories located on their chosen college's campus in their second year.": "大一学生住在位于中心校区的宿舍里，并经常在那里形成密切的友谊，这种友谊贯穿他们的教育生涯，甚至在他们的第二年，紧密的朋友群体的成员加入不同的学院。少数学生在选择大学后继续住在中心校区，特别是如果他们在多个学院进行广泛的学习或作为一年级学生的驻地顾问工作。但大多数学生在第二年搬到位于他们所选学院校园内的宿舍。",
	"Before starting their second year of studies, students choose one of the five colleges—{@book Lorehold|SCC|1|Lorehold College}, {@book Prismari|SCC|1|Prismari College}, {@book Quandrix|SCC|1|Quandrix College}, {@book Silverquill|SCC|1|Silverquill College}, or {@book Witherbloom|SCC|1|Witherbloom College}—to be their academic home for the remainder of their education. From this point, students wear uniforms featuring the colors of their college, though these outfits aren't as unvarying as the first-year garb.": "在开始第二年的学习之前，学生在五个学院中选择一个--{@book Lorehold|SCC|1|Lorehold College}、{@book Prismari|SCC|1|Prismari College}、{@book Quandrix|SCC|1|Quandrix College}、{@book Silverquill|SCC|1|Silverquill College}或{@book Witherbloom|SCC|1|Witherbloom College}--作为他们余下教育的学术家园。从这时起，学生们穿上以他们学院的颜色为特色的校服，尽管这些服装并不像一年级的服装那样一成不变。",
	"Upon choosing a college, a student is assigned two professors to serve as counselors to help the student plan a course of studies. The two deans of the college assign these two counselors, who represent the poles of the college's philosophical opposition. By design, the two counselors tend to offer conflicting advice, forcing the student to navigate opposing principles. For example, a student pursuing historical studies in Lorehold College might have one counselor who focuses on the unpredictable, war-filled chaos of historical reality and another who dwells on the idea of an orderly progression toward an ideal. The former might encourage the student to choose courses based on gut feeling, to delve into the military aspects of an issue, and to supplement their academic studies with some practical martial training. The other counselor, meanwhile, might offer several ordered, rational proposals for course selection, focus on the political and human aspects of historical issues, and place less emphasis on martial prowess. The student must then navigate this conflicting advice and chart their own course.": "在选择大学时，学生会被指派两名教授作为顾问，帮助学生计划学习课程。学院的两位院长指定了这两位顾问，他们代表了学院的哲学反对派的两极。根据设计，这两位顾问往往会提供相互冲突的建议，迫使学生驾驭对立的原则。例如，一个在罗尔霍德学院追求历史研究的学生，可能会有一个辅导员关注历史现实中不可预测的、充满战争的混乱局面，而另一个辅导员则沉浸在向理想有序发展的理念中。前者可能会鼓励学生根据直觉选择课程，深入研究某个问题的军事方面，并以一些实际的武术训练来补充他们的学术研究。而另一位辅导员则可能为课程选择提供几个有序的、合理的建议，注重历史问题的政治和人文方面，而不太强调武术能力。然后，学生必须驾驭这些相互冲突的建议，制定自己的路线。",
	"Some students, having chosen a college, spend virtually all their remaining school years on that campus and study with those professors, diving into their preferred area of study and related fields. Other students take as many as a third of their classes in other colleges, continuing the breadth of their first-year education and looking for places where the perspectives of other disciplines can bring new insight to their studies. Both approaches are encouraged at the university.": "一些学生在选择了一所大学后，几乎所有剩余的学年都在这个校园里度过，与这些教授一起学习，潜心研究他们喜欢的研究领域和相关领域。其他学生在其他学院学习多达三分之一的课程，继续他们第一年教育的广度，并寻找其他学科的观点可以为他们的研究带来新的见解的地方。这两种方法在大学都受到鼓励。",
	"A student's course of study at Strixhaven lasts at least four years but allows for advanced study for several years beyond that time frame. Most students eventually graduate, though, and they walk a variety of paths after leaving the university. Many return to whatever home they came from, putting what they have learned to use in their communities. Some mages travel the multiverse in search of ever-greater magic, continuing their research in some form beyond the confines of an academic program. A few alumni return to Strixhaven, sooner or later, as instructors themselves, and a small, select number join the Dragonsguard, an elite force of mages who work with the Founder Dragons.": "一个学生在斯特里克斯海文的学习课程至少持续四年，但在这一时间框架之外还可以进行几年的深造。虽然大多数学生最终会毕业，但他们在离开大学后会走上各种不同的道路。许多人回到了他们的家乡，将他们所学的东西用于他们的社区。一些法师在多元宇宙中旅行，寻找更强大的魔法，在学术课程的范围之外以某种形式继续他们的研究。一些校友迟早会回到斯特里克斯港，成为导师，还有一小部分人加入了龙卫队，这是一支与创始人龙合作的法师精英部队。",
	"The day-to-day functioning of Strixhaven relies on hundreds of laborers, clerks, coaches, administrators, and others. These personnel include folk like Mavinda Sharpbeak, the kindly owlin guidance counselor who takes first-year students under her wing, and Gyome, the troll chef of Witherbloom College. In addition to legions of people who devote their lives to the university's operations, numerous automatons and artificial life-forms—various kinds of Constructs—serve in various roles, including campus guides and library assistants.": "Strixhaven的日常运作依赖于数百名工人、文员、教练、行政人员和其他人员。这些人员包括像马文达-沙佩克（Mavinda Sharpbeak）这样的人，她是一位善良的猫头鹰辅导员，将一年级学生置于她的羽翼之下，还有吉梅，威瑟布洛姆学院的巨魔厨师。除了为大学的运作奉献自己生命的人之外，还有许多自动装置和人工生命形式--各种类型的结构体--担任各种角色，包括校园导游和图书馆助理。",
	"All these operations are managed by an administration overseen by the ten deans, two in each college. Each dean is an esteemed professor who embraces one side of their school's philosophical dichotomy. The deans, like the professors who serve as counselors to students, view it as their role to disagree with each other and guide the college by way of their arguments. Furthermore, rivalries among the deans only exacerbate this combative attitude.": "所有这些业务都由十个院长监督的行政部门管理，每个学院有两个院长。每位院长都是一位受人尊敬的教授，他们拥护他们学校的哲学二分法中的一方。院长们，就像作为学生辅导员的教授们一样，认为他们的职责是与对方持不同意见，并通过他们的争论来指导学院的工作。此外，院长们之间的竞争只会加剧这种争斗的态度。",
	"When the argumentative deans fail to chart a coherent course for Strixhaven, the Founder Dragons are occasionally forced to intervene. They don't step in directly, but a director known as the Voice of the Founders—currently an imposing man named Taiva—speaks on the dragons' behalf.": "当争论不休的院长们未能为Strixhaven制定一个统一的路线时，创始人龙偶尔会被迫进行干预。他们并不直接介入，而是由一位被称为 \"创始人之声 \"的主管--目前是一位名叫泰瓦的威严男子--代表龙族发言。",
	"Each of Strixhaven's five colleges has a mascot—a small creature associated with the magic of the school and often found wandering their respective campuses. Witherbloom's mascots, pests, are naturally found in the world around the campus. The other colleges' mascots are brought into being through magic. The Strixhaven Mascots table lists the mascots by college. Each of these mascots is detailed in {@book chapter 7|SCC|8}.": "Strixhaven的五所学院都有一个吉祥物--一种与学校的魔力有关的小生物，经常被发现在各自的校园里游荡。威瑟布洛姆的吉祥物是害虫，在校园周围的世界里自然存在。其他学院的吉祥物是通过魔法产生的。Strixhaven吉祥物表按学院列出了吉祥物。每一个吉祥物都有详细的（%0%）。",
	"The five kinds of mascots act as companions for students and faculty, sometimes serving as willing subjects for experiments or demonstrations, and occasionally even helping out in a duel or a more serious combat situation. Most notably, mascots are also playing pieces of sorts in the Strixhaven sport of Mage Tower, described in more detail in {@adventure chapter 4|SCC-HfMT|0}.": "这五种吉祥物作为学生和教师的伙伴，有时作为实验或演示的自愿对象，偶尔甚至在决斗或更严重的战斗情况下帮忙。最值得注意的是，吉祥物也是法师塔的Strixhaven运动中的一种玩物，在{@adventure chapter 4|SCC-HfMT|0}中有更详细的描述。",
	"Strixhaven occupies hundreds of acres, spread out over six campuses.

	"Well-maintained roads connect the six campuses, and walking from one to another can take a half-hour or more. Regular shuttles—large carriages drawn by horselike automata—run on an hourly schedule between a station near the Biblioplex and each of the satellite campuses, making the journey in about 15 minutes. In addition, each campus has multiple permanent teleportation circles, which faculty and more advanced students can use when they require instantaneous travel, and several magical portals exist as well. These portals can be unpredictable: they aren't necessarily open all the time, they don't always lead to the same places, and some require complicated conditions or keys to open.": "维护良好的道路连接着六个校区，从一个校区步行到另一个校区可能需要半小时或更长时间。定期班车--由马车牵引的大型马车--每小时在图书馆附近的一个车站和每个卫星校区之间运行，行程约为15分钟。此外，每个校区都有多个永久性的传送圈，教师和更高级的学生在需要即时旅行时可以使用这些传送圈，还有几个神奇的传送门存在。这些传送门可能是不可预测的：它们不一定一直开放，也不总是通向相同的地方，有些需要复杂的条件或钥匙才能打开。",
	"The central campus—shown on map 1.1—is the heart of Strixhaven. Its extensive grounds include residence halls for first-year students, dining halls, administration buildings, classrooms and laboratories (mostly used for first-year classes and interdisciplinary studies), and space for social gatherings.": "地图1.1所示的中心校园是斯特里克斯海文的中心。其广阔的场地包括一年级学生的宿舍、食堂、行政大楼、教室和实验室（主要用于一年级课程和跨学科研究），以及社交聚会的空间。",

	"The center of Strixhaven is the Biblioplex, the university's main library. At the heart of the library is a snarl, a tangle in the fabric of magic, that glows like a miniature sun in the grand Hall of Oracles. A star arch called the Dawnbow curves across the sky above the library, marking its location as a center of mystic learning.": "Strixhaven的中心是Biblioplex，这所大学的主要图书馆。在图书馆的中心是一个咆哮，一个魔法结构中的纠结，它像一个微型太阳一样在宏伟的Oracles大厅中闪耀。一个被称为 \"黎明之弓 \"的星拱门在图书馆上方的天空划过，标志着它作为一个神秘学习中心的位置。",
	"Arches welcome inquisitive minds into the library. Inside, almost every surface from the floor to the high ceiling is jammed with stacks of books. The interior of the Biblioplex is vast, with long hallways, archive chambers tall enough to have their own weather, and even pools and moat-passages crossable only by boat.": "拱门欢迎好奇的心灵进入图书馆。在里面，从地板到高高的天花板，几乎每个表面都塞满了成堆的书籍。图书馆的内部非常宽阔，有长长的走廊，有高到足以有自己的天气的档案室，甚至还有只能用船穿过的水池和护城河通道。",
	"Five lines of beacon-towers radiate from the Biblioplex like enormous spokes. These Torches of Enlightenment stretch out to the five college campuses and beyond, more than a hundred miles into the surrounding countryside. They burn perpetually with magical flame, symbolizing the path toward learning and an escape from ignorance.": "五行烽火台像巨大的辐条一样从图书馆辐射出来。这些启蒙火炬一直延伸到五个大学校园，并延伸到周围100多英里的乡村。它们永远燃烧着神奇的火焰，象征着通往学习和摆脱无知的道路。",
	"Just south of the Biblioplex, a star arch curves overhead like a smaller echo of the Dawnbow, and a lush park, Archway Commons, marks the site. More familiarly called the Commons, the park is a favorite spot for students—especially first-years—to gather in fair weather or to wander through on dates. Some of the university's clubs also use the park to host social gatherings and games, including live-action roleplaying games and casual sports.": "就在图书馆的南面，一个星形拱门在头顶上弯曲，就像黎明之弓的一个较小的回声，一个郁郁葱葱的公园，拱门公社，标志着这个地方。人们更熟悉的叫法是，该公园是学生--尤其是一年级学生--最喜欢的地方，在天气好的时候可以聚集在一起，或者在约会时漫步其中。大学的一些俱乐部也利用该公园举办社交聚会和游戏，包括真人角色扮演游戏和休闲运动。",
	"At the edge of Archway Commons and just outside the Biblioplex stands the cozy Firejolt Café, where students cram both information and caffeine into themselves before exams. The café's name comes from its trademark beverage, which the manager, an elf mage named Ellina, brews with her fire magic. The Firejolt has a reputation as a hangout for first-year students, but older students from all five colleges can be seen inside at all hours.": "在Archway Commons的边缘和Biblioplex的外面，有一家舒适的Firejolt咖啡馆，学生们在考试前都会在这里补充信息和咖啡因。咖啡馆的名字来自于它的标志性饮料，经理是一位名叫埃利纳的精灵法师，用她的火魔法酿造的。Firejolt咖啡馆被誉为一年级学生的聚会场所，但来自所有五个学院的高年级学生在任何时候都可以在里面看到。",
	"At the western end of the Dawnbow, where it meets the ground, stands a smaller university landmark: Bow's End Tavern, which serves as a hangout for older students. Most patrons come for the live music, deliciously greasy food, and various potions and beverages. Others come to settle their differences in wild duels in the lot behind the tavern. The tavern's manager is a kind but strict orc named Tulk \"the Bulk\" Tusktooth.": "在黎明之弓的西端，在它与地面相接的地方，矗立着一个较小的大学地标。弓之端酒馆，它是高年级学生的一个聚会场所。大多数顾客是为了现场音乐、美味的油腻食物和各种药水和饮料而来。其他人则是为了在酒馆后面的空地上通过疯狂的决斗来解决他们的分歧。酒馆的经理是一个善良但严格的兽人，名叫图尔克 \"大块头 \"图斯克托斯。",

	"Lorehold College is devoted to the study of history, broadly understood to include the various aspects of culture, behavior, and social relationships that shape historical events. Its studies include various subdivisions of history (military history, social history, cultural history), archaeology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, religion, and economics. It overlaps with Prismari College in the field of art history, with some students splitting their studies between the two colleges. Lorehold mages use their magic to unearth secrets and share illumination.": "罗尔霍德学院致力于历史研究，从广义上讲，包括文化、行为和社会关系等塑造历史事件的各个方面。它的研究包括历史学（军事史、社会史、文化史）、考古学、人类学、心理学、社会学、宗教和经济学的各种分支。它与棱镜学院在艺术史领域有重叠，一些学生在两所学院之间分头学习。罗尔霍德法师用他们的魔法来发掘秘密并分享照明。",
	"Lorehold's two deans carry the titles Dean of Order and Dean of Chaos, as order versus chaos encapsulates the fundamental conflict at the heart of Lorehold's philosophy.

Are deep patterns hidden in historical texts, or is time a series of coincidence and happenstance?": "洛雷霍尔德的两位院长拥有秩序院长和混乱院长的头衔，因为秩序与混乱概括了洛雷霍尔德哲学中心的基本冲突。这种冲突围绕着支撑和驱动历史的力量。时间的进程是在向一个秩序良好的理想状态推进，还是在慢慢演变成混乱？历史文本中是否隐藏着深刻的模式，或者时间是一系列的巧合和偶然？",

Order focuses on systemic changes and the actions of people collectively.": "秩序的观点强调将人们拉在一起的结构--法律、宗教、经济、教育、社会阶层等等，以及这些结构如何推动历史事件。秩序关注的是系统性的变化和人们集体的行动。",
	"The perspective of chaos, by contrast, emphasizes individual actions, personal bonds of families and friends, and the disruptive force of lone, passionate people in history.

	"When Hofri (neutral good dwarf {@creature Lorehold professor of order|SCC}) first enrolled in Strixhaven, he believed his future lay with Prismari. A diligent student, he quickly mastered the technical skills of art, but his magic left something to be desired.

	"His time at Prismari was hardly wasted, however. Combining his artistic skill with his keen spiritual sense, Hofri could visualize a spirit's mortal appearance and construct a viable statue form for them to inhabit. No one in Lorehold's history had previously created a spirit statue from scratch, and Hofri was offered a professorial position after graduation, which he happily accepted.": "然而，他在Prismari的时间并没有被浪费。结合他的艺术技巧和敏锐的精神感觉，Hofri可以想象出一个精神的凡人外表，并为他们建造一个可行的雕像形式来居住。在Lorehold的历史上，以前没有人从头开始创造一个精神雕像，Hofri在毕业后得到了一个教授职位，他欣然接受。",
	"Even by Lorehold standards, Osgir (neutral {@creature stone giant}) is obsessed with relics of the past. A professor of order, he treasures every connection to old civilizations, whether it's a magnificent jeweled crown or an old shovel.

He displays something different every week in his Lorehold office, from a mighty sword of demon-slaying to a delicate elven music box.": "因此，他自然掌握了复制修复的神奇艺术。他不仅能从最小的废料中完美地重现一个古老的物体或装置，而且还能为他的个人收藏制作第二个相同的版本。他每周都会在他的罗尔霍德办公室展示不同的东西，从一把强大的屠魔剑到一个精致的精灵音乐盒。",
	"\"Have you met Golwanda yet?\" is a question that older Lorehold students love to ask second-year students, new to the college. Sooner or later, one professor or another summons this spirit of a notorious stone giant warmonger, ostensibly as a cautionary tale about the dire fate that befalls a society that loses control of its aggressive impulses.

	"Part natural chasm, part archaeological excavation, and part new construction, Pillardrop is a series of buildings excavated out of cliffs on the Lorehold campus. Ruins and upgraded halls together are now used for research, classwork, and housing. Precarious bridges link one neighborhood of Pillardrop to another, often directly passing the enormous stone faces of old statues.

Prismari studies focus on visual arts (including architecture, painting, and sculpture) and performing arts (such as dance, music, and theater). The curriculum overlaps with Lorehold in the field of art history and with Silverquill in the literary arts, and some students divide their time between Prismari and one of those other schools to pursue these interdisciplinary fields. Prismari mages use magic to weave the elements into their creations; they might juxtapose fire alongside paint, ceramics, or fabric, or they might choreograph elaborate works that unite a dancer's movements with gusts and eddies of air.": "Prismari学院致力于艺术。它的学者将艺术视为自我表达的基本形式，将魔法视为一种工具、一种媒介和一种灵感。Prismari的研究重点是视觉艺术（包括建筑、绘画和雕塑）和表演艺术（如舞蹈、音乐和戏剧）。该课程在艺术史领域与洛雷霍尔德（Lorehold）重叠，在文学艺术领域与银奎尔（Silverquill）重叠，一些学生在Prismari和其他学校之一之间分配时间，以追求这些跨学科领域。棱镜法师使用魔法将各种元素编织到他们的创作中；他们可能将火与颜料、陶瓷或织物并列，或者他们可能编排精心的作品，将舞者的动作与空气的阵风和涡流结合起来。",
	"Prismari's two deans carry the titles Dean of Perfection and Dean of Expression, and they often express the fundamental conflict of their philosophy as perfection versus expression—or, sometimes, as intellect versus emotion.

	"The Quandrix campus is alive with dynamic sculptures made of water behaving in odd ways: cube-shaped fountains, arching aqueducts that flow through the air, towers of solid-seeming water. One water structure holds a secret: a mysterious inner expanse called the Arithmodrome. From the outside, the Arithmodrome looks like a large cube of water, ten feet on each side.

	"At Witherbloom, the College of Essence Studies, mages draw power from the opposing forces of life and death. These mages brew their spells from natural components and the essence of living creatures, using that power to heal or harm the living or to raise or entreat the dead. They can cause entire forests to blossom out of nowhere or call down old curses that scourge flesh from bone. Some Witherbloom mages defend ecosystems from pollution, while others revel in the power of corruption. They're at home riding zombie crocodiles down a languid river, picking herbs for a potion to treat a disease, brooding over a chorus of swamp frogs, or summoning fearsome avatars of nature.": "在精华研究学院Witherbloom，法师们从生命和死亡的对立力量中汲取力量。这些法师用自然成分和生物的精华来酝酿他们的法术，用这种力量来治疗或伤害活人，或者让死者复活或祈求。他们可以使整个森林凭空开花，也可以召唤古老的诅咒，使肉体和骨骼受到祸害。一些Witherbloom法师保护生态系统免受污染，而其他法师则陶醉于腐败的力量。他们可以在家里骑着僵尸鳄鱼在慵懒的河流中游走，为治疗疾病的药水采摘草药，在沼泽青蛙的合唱中沉思，或者召唤出可怕的自然化身。",
	"The curriculum of Witherbloom College focuses on various sciences, revolving around the life sciences.

Mages who adopt this view wield positive energy and practice healing magic.": "根（生长）的哲学集中在生命和它不可抗拒的兴旺动力上。这种观点赞美生命形式的多样性和适应性，从最微小的细胞到最复杂的生物网络。成长哲学宣称，生存和繁殖的冲动是宇宙中最基本的原则。采用这种观点的法师们挥舞着正能量，练习治疗魔法。",
	"The philosophy of the vein (decay) focuses on the inevitability of death and decay. Its traditional name comes from the prominence of vampires within the college, whose conceptions of draining life through the vein have long proven an important counterweight to the growth philosophy of Witherbloom. The decay philosophy sees life energy as a resource to be consumed, rather than a good to be nourished for its own sake. Mages who adopt this view wield negative energy and practice necromancy.": "静脉（腐烂）哲学关注的是死亡和腐烂的不可避免性。它的传统名称来自于吸血鬼在学院内的突出地位，他们通过静脉排泄生命的概念长期以来被证明是对威瑟布洛姆的成长哲学的重要抗衡。腐烂哲学认为生命能量是一种需要消耗的资源，而不是一种需要为其本身而滋养的物品。采用这种观点的法师们挥舞着负能量，从事死灵法术。",

Many years ago, a group of rebellious students got lost in Detention Bog and took shelter in what turned out to be Willowdusk's roots. She protected them from a pack of hungry groffs and shepherded them back to Widdershins Hall, offering a lecture on proper herb-gathering practices during the journey.": "没有人知道Willowdusk（中性好（%0%））到底有多老。这位生长学教授声称自己比斯特里沙文本身还要老，虽然很多人怀疑她夸大其词，但没有任何一个活了很久的人愿意去反驳她。许多年前，一群叛逆的学生在拘留所迷路了，他们在柳树的根部避难。她保护他们不受一群饥饿的格罗夫的伤害，并把他们送回维德申斯大厅，在途中提供了一个关于正确的草药采集方法的讲座。",

While Quentillius is a powerful presence on stage—especially in romantic roles—critics have called his performances histrionic.
