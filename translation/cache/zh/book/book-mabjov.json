	"Back when me and Boo caught the Calishite itch, Boo said we should start a journal. But his paws were tiny and ink got everywhere...including places that I should not write down here. So I, Minsc, decided to write down our adventures to prove that the pen is not mightier than the sword! With Boo's help, we wrote about every den of stinking evil that was found, every wicked butt that was kicked, and lots more besides!": "当我和小布被卡利希特之痒缠身时，小布说我们应该写一本日记。但是他的爪子很小，墨水弄得到处都是......包括我不应该在这里写下的地方。所以，我，Minsc，决定写下我们的冒险经历，以证明笔不比剑更有力！在Boo的帮助下，我们写下了我们的冒险。在小布的帮助下，我们写下了每一个被发现的臭气熏天的邪恶巢穴，每一个被踢的邪恶屁股，以及更多的东西",
	"Me and Boo thought the journal would help other heroes see how good and fun it is to smash and smite evil, so we asked our friend Volo to publish it. But Volo said something about it being childlike gibberish and in need of an \"editor\". He said he would edit it for us, but only if we helped him out with a book he was writing. Why would Volo write a book on monsters? He has never gone butt-kicking in the name of righteousness! But me and Boo are always eager to help a friend, so monster hunting we went.": "我和老布认为这本日记可以帮助其他英雄看到粉碎和打击邪恶是多么美好和有趣，所以我们请我们的朋友沃罗出版它。但沃罗说，这是些像孩子一样的胡言乱语，需要一个 \"编辑\"。他说他会为我们编辑它，但前提是我们要帮助他写一本书。沃罗为什么要写一本关于怪物的书？他从来没有以正义的名义去踢屁股! 但我和老布总是热心帮助朋友，所以我们就去找怪物了。",
	"Monster hunting was fun, as it always is. Boo has a nose that can sniff out evil, so sniffing out monsters was as easy for my little friend as sniffing out squirrels in heat. We mostly killed cockatrices and basilisks, because we hate creatures that turn you to stone. Being turned to stone is no fun. No fun at all.": "猎杀怪物很有趣，就像以往一样。小布有一个能嗅出邪恶的鼻子，所以对我的小朋友来说，嗅出怪物就像嗅出发情的松鼠一样容易。我们主要杀的是鸡冠花和罗勒鱼，因为我们讨厌那些把你变成石头的生物。被变成石头可不好玩。一点都不好玩。",
	"We returned to Volo with monster carcasses and our writings on the joy of giving evil the backhand of justice. Volo got all red in the face. He said something about how I ignored the \"list\" he had given me. I think he meant the paper that Boo used on his furry backside while we were on the road.": "我们带着怪物的尸体和我们写的关于给邪恶以正义的反手的快乐的文章回到了沃罗。沃罗的脸都红了。他说了一些关于我如何忽视他给我的 \"清单 \"的话。我想他指的是我们在路上时布用在他毛茸茸的背上的纸。",
	"It all worked out in the end. I just had to promise not to talk to our good friend Volo for one hundred years. But one hundred years can fly by when you're not looking. Me and Boo know this from experience...": "最后一切都解决了。我只是不得不保证在一百年内不和我们的好朋友沃罗说话。但是，当你不注意的时候，一百年可以飞快地过去。我和老布从经验中知道这一点...",
	"When you think of your favorite heroic story, it almost always follows a familiar formula. The hero begins his journey in his hometown, usually threatened by evil. He encounters a mentor figure who helps reveal what must be done to save his hometown (and often the rest of the world). In the end, he comes face to face with a villain that must be overcome. Don't believe me?": "当你想到你最喜欢的英雄故事时，它几乎总是遵循一个熟悉的公式。英雄在他的家乡开始他的旅程，通常受到邪恶的威胁。他遇到了一位导师，他帮助揭示了必须做什么来拯救他的家乡（往往还有世界其他地方）。最后，他与一个必须克服的恶棍面对面。不相信我？",
	"Harry Potter fights to protect Hogwarts, is mentored by Dumbledore and must defeat Voldemort. Frodo begins his journey in the Shire, is recruited by Gandalf and must journey into the heart of Sauron's land of evil. Luke Skywalker leaves Tatooine to learn how to use the Force from Obi-Wan in order to defeat Darth Vader.": "哈利-波特为保护霍格沃茨而战，得到了邓布利多的指导，必须打败伏地魔。弗罗多在夏尔开始他的旅程，被甘道夫招募，必须进入索伦的邪恶之地的中心。卢克-天行者离开塔图因，向欧比旺学习如何使用原力，以打败达斯-维德。",
	"While Dungeons & Dragons has always focused on the heroes, a great mentor, villain and hometown can make a campaign come alive.": "虽然《龙与地下城》一直专注于英雄，但一个伟大的导师、反派和故乡可以使一个活动变得生动。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons has already provided rules on mentors with their excellent write ups on Group Patrons, so we will be using that term in this book.": "龙与地下城》已经为导师提供了规则，他们在《团体赞助人》中写得很好，所以我们将在本书中使用这个术语。",
	"Hometowns are where player characters begin the campaign. Hometowns are often a base of operations and the place where the group patron can be found. The campaign villain might also be based out of the hometown. Sometimes the campaign villain even threatens the very existence of the hometown.": "故乡是玩家角色开始活动的地方。家乡通常是一个行动基地，也是可以找到团体赞助人的地方。活动中的反派也可能以家乡为基地。有时，活动中的反派甚至威胁到家乡的存在。",
	"One of the main uses of a hometown from a gameplay perspective is that it provides player characters with a place to spend gold (and other coin). Over the course of a campaign, player characters often accumulate vast quantities of gold with very few places to spend it. Hometowns give player characters access to bazaars, shops and NPCs that possess contacts for magic items, recipes or treasure maps. Not only does this give player characters a place to use their gold, but it also allows them to customize the kinds of magic items their character is able to obtain.": "从游戏的角度来看，故乡的主要用途之一是为玩家角色提供一个花费黄金（和其他硬币）的地方。在一个战役的过程中，玩家角色往往积累了大量的黄金，但却没有什么地方可以花。家乡让玩家角色能够接触到集市、商店和拥有魔法物品、配方或藏宝图联系人的NPC。这不仅为玩家角色提供了使用黄金的地方，而且还允许他们定制自己角色能够获得的魔法物品种类。",
	"Robbing or murdering a shop keep for their magic items is pointless as shops don't keep the magic items or recipes on the premises. Instead they have contacts with powerful NPCs and creatures that have access to the magic items.": "抢劫或谋杀商店老板以获得他们的魔法物品是毫无意义的，因为商店并不把魔法物品或配方放在店内。相反，他们与强大的NPC和生物有联系，可以获得魔法物品。",
	"Group patrons give player characters a reason to work together toward a common goal. They are powerful backers who give adventurers a clear purpose. They can also provide rare resources such as magic items, contacts and other hard to find resources.": "团体赞助者给了玩家角色一个为了共同目标而合作的理由。他们是强大的支持者，给冒险者一个明确的目标。他们还可以提供稀有资源，如魔法物品、联系人和其他难以找到的资源。",
	"The group patron helps determine the theme of a campaign through the missions that they send the player characters on. All patrons have an overarching ambition that determines what kind of missions they will be giving out. This ambition or cause encourages all the player characters to work together.": "团体赞助人通过他们派给玩家角色的任务来帮助确定活动的主题。所有赞助人都有一个总的雄心壮志，决定了他们将发出什么样的任务。这个野心或事业鼓励所有玩家角色一起工作。",
	"Each group patron has one or two primary contacts that interact with the player characters.": "每个团体赞助人都有一个或两个主要联系人，与玩家角色互动。",
	"The missions that a group patron send the player characters on are great ways to introduce new adventures. It's up to the players whether or not they want to go on the missions that are set out for them.": "团体赞助人派玩家角色执行的任务是引入新冒险的好方法。这取决于玩家是否愿意去执行为他们安排的任务。",
	"Each group patron has a list of enemies. In addition to the infernal lords listed in the Campaign Villain section, these enemies include other group patrons. The contacts from these enemy group patrons can be used as rivals to the player characters or even as allies of the campaign villain.": "每个团体赞助人都有一个敌人名单。除了 \"活动反派 \"部分列出的无间道领主外，这些敌人还包括其他团体赞助人。这些敌人团体赞助人的联系人可以作为玩家角色的对手，甚至可以作为活动反派的盟友。",
	"Group patrons offer access to resources not readily available to most people. These resources include magical equipment, secret information and training. Each group patron gives a different set of perks. Most group patrons also give access to magical items for purchase or recipes on how to craft them.": "团体赞助人可以获得大多数人不容易获得的资源。这些资源包括魔法设备、秘密信息和培训。每个团体赞助人都有不同的好处。大多数团体赞助人还提供购买魔法物品的机会，或者提供制作魔法物品的配方。",
	"Each member of the party can grant advantage on an ability check, an attack roll or a saving throw of another member of the party. To grant advantage in this way the character and the chosen target must be able to see or hear each other and neither can be {@condition incapacitated}. Once a party member grants this advantage that individual can't do so again until they finish a long rest.": "党的每个成员都可以在党的另一个成员的能力检查、攻击卷或拯救动作上给予优势。要以这种方式给予优势，角色和被选择的目标必须能够看到或听到对方，而且都不能是（%0%）。一旦一个党员给予了这种优势，这个人就不能再这样做了，直到他们完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Campaign villains are NPCs who oppose the player characters throughout their entire careers. These villains often have a personal connection to either the player characters or their group patron. A campaign villain rarely confronts the player characters directly, instead resorting to henchmen. Only when a campaign nears its end will the player characters finally confront their villain.": "活动中的反派是指在玩家角色的整个职业生涯中与他们作对的NPC。这些反派通常与玩家角色或他们的团体赞助人有个人联系。活动中的反派人物很少直接与玩家角色对抗，而是求助于其手下。只有当活动接近尾声时，玩家角色才会最终与他们的反派对抗。",
	"An effective campaign villain has a clear reason for interfering with the characters' lives. It is usually in clear opposition to the goals of the player character's group patron.": "一个有效的活动中的反派有一个明确的理由来干扰角色的生活。它通常与玩家角色的团体赞助人的目标明显对立。",
	"A campaign villain almost always has henchmen that they can send against the player characters. They also likely have access to vast resources, whether that be money, political influence or military power.": "竞选中的反派人物几乎都有随从，他们可以派人对付玩家角色。他们还可能拥有大量的资源，无论是金钱、政治影响还是军事力量。",
	"When the players defeat a henchman sent by the campaign villain, their main reward is the magical equipment that most henchmen possess.": "当玩家击败竞选中的反派所派来的随从时，他们的主要奖励是大多数随从所拥有的魔法装备。",
	"Me and Boo have talked about the word henchmen. What about henchwomen or henchhalflings?": "我和老布已经谈到了 \"鸡仔 \"这个词。那么女鸡或女半兽人呢？",
	"Perhaps using the word henchpeople would be less offensive. Boo doesnt believe there are any henchhamsters, for what hamster would ever serve evil?": "也许使用 \"鸡仔 \"这个词会更有攻击性。老布不相信有什么小仓鼠，因为哪只仓鼠会为邪恶服务？",
	"Many henchmen are presented in their own chapter later in this book. In addition, some allies and henchmen for a campaign villain may be drawn from the Group Patron list. The Order of Icarus, Flaming Fist, Raven Circle and Shadow Thieves all make great enemies. These organizations might be secretly manipulated by the campaign villain or even directly controlled.": "许多随从在本书后面的章节中都有各自的介绍。此外，活动中反派的一些盟友和随从可以从团体赞助人名单中抽取。伊卡洛斯骑士团、火焰之拳、乌鸦圈和影子盗贼都是伟大的敌人。这些组织可能被竞选中的反派秘密操纵，甚至直接控制。",

	"Athkatla, the City of Coin, is one of the wealthiest cities in all of Faerûn. The capital of the mercantile nation of Amn, nearly every aspect of life in Athkatla revolves money and commerce. Its wealth and affluence are so well known that legends in foreign lands contend the city's streets are literally paved with gold... though if this were true, some enterprising citizens would long ago have found some way to extract the treasures from the cobblestones.": "Athkatla，硬币之城，是整个Faerûn最富有的城市之一。阿斯卡特拉是商业国家阿姆的首都，其生活的各个方面几乎都围绕着金钱和商业。它的财富和富裕是如此众所周知，以至于外国的传说认为这个城市的街道真的是用黄金铺成的......尽管如果这是真的，一些有进取心的公民早就找到了一些方法来提取鹅卵石上的财宝。",
	"The City of Coin never sleeps—it is constantly abuzz with the haggling and machinations of ruthlessly competitive merchants, peddlers, hustlers, con artists and criminals... though in Amn the lines between these groups is often blurred. In Athkatla, money is power, and there is a stark contrast between those who possess it and those who do not. The influential organizations that run the city's economy—such as the oppressive Cowled Wizards, the enigmatic Shadow Thieves, or the obscenely wealthy mercantile houses—act with unfettered impunity, answering only to themselves. Those who fall on the lower rungs of the social ladder—like the poor who dwell in the slums of the River District—have no recourse to the authorities or the law. For them, life in the City of Coin is a daily struggle to survive where danger lurks around every corner.": "金币之城从不睡觉--它不断地被无情竞争的商人、小贩、骗子、骗子和罪犯的讨价还价和阴谋诡计所扰......尽管在阿姆，这些群体之间的界限往往是模糊的。在阿斯卡特拉，金钱就是权力，拥有和不拥有金钱的人之间存在着鲜明的对比。管理城市经济的有影响力的组织--如压迫性的牛头人巫师、神秘的影子盗贼，或富裕到令人发指的商行--可以不受约束地行事，只对自己负责。那些处于社会底层的人，如居住在河区贫民窟的穷人，无法求助于当局或法律。对他们来说，在硬币城的生活就是每天为生存而挣扎，每个角落都潜伏着危险。",
	"Officially, Athkatla is ruled by the Council of Six. Although council positions were once held anonymously, the current council members rule openly, relying on their sponsors to protect them against threats and retaliation from potential rivals. The current council consists of the leader of House Selemchant, backed by the Cowled Wizards; the matriarch of House Dannihyr, supported by the Shadow Thieves; and the rulers of the independent mercantile families of House Alibakkar, House Ophal, House Nashivaar, and House Havarian—the most recent addition to the Council.": "正式来说，阿斯卡特拉是由六人委员会统治的。虽然理事会的职位曾经是匿名的，但目前的理事会成员公开统治，依靠他们的赞助人保护他们免受潜在对手的威胁和报复。目前的议会由以下成员组成：得到牛头人巫师支持的塞姆查特家族的领袖；得到影子盗贼支持的丹尼尔家族的族长；以及阿里巴克尔家族、奥法尔家族、纳希瓦尔家族和哈瓦里安家族--最近加入议会的独立商贾家族的统治者们。",
	"Status in Athkatla is measured almost exclusively by material wealth. As such, it is common practice for those in power to display their affluence through lavish parties and expensive gifts to allies and supporters. Bribery is commonplace, and widely accepted as the proper way to grease the wheels in business and politics.": "在Athkatla，地位几乎完全由物质财富来衡量。因此，当权者通过奢华的宴会和给盟友和支持者的昂贵礼物来显示他们的富裕是很常见的。贿赂是司空见惯的事，而且被广泛接受为在商业和政治中润滑车轮的适当方式。",
	"The constant effort to demonstrate extravagance surpassing one's peers has led to a culture of Athkatla's citizens embracing decadence and overindulgence, particularly among the elites of the gem district. During nights of revelry it is common practice to eat and drink to the point of bursting, then to forcefully empty the stomach through the practice of \"straking\"... leaving behind a vomitus mess for their servants or slaves to clean up.": "不断努力表现出超越同龄人的奢侈，导致了阿斯卡特拉公民拥抱颓废和过度放纵的文化，特别是在宝石区的精英中。在狂欢的夜晚，通常的做法是吃喝到爆，然后通过 \"踩踏 \"的做法强行清空胃部......留下呕吐物让他们的仆人或奴隶来清理。",
	"Not surprisingly, fashion in Athkatla also reflects this obsession with material wealth. Women typically wear elaborate turbans made from rare silks, inlaid with gems and embroidered with gold or platinum stitching. Men favor expensive vests and cloaks sewn from valuable furs imported from the distant North, sacrificing personal comfort in the blazing heat in order to show off their means. Ornate jewelry is common among both sexes, with an affinity for custom pieces showcasing rare gems, especially black pearls.": "毫不奇怪，Athkatla的时尚也反映了这种对物质财富的痴迷。妇女通常戴着用稀有丝绸制成的精致头巾，上面镶嵌着宝石，并绣有黄金或白金的缝线。男人则喜欢用从遥远的北方进口的珍贵毛皮缝制的昂贵的背心和斗篷，在烈日下牺牲个人的舒适度来炫耀他们的财力。男女都喜欢华丽的首饰，对展示稀有宝石的定制首饰情有独钟，尤其是黑珍珠。",
	"The various ranks of societal status are correlated with precious metals: ranging from the \"ore\" of the dregs of society to the \"mithral\" elites at the top.": "社会地位的不同等级与贵金属相关：从社会渣滓的 \"矿石 \"到顶端的 \"米特拉 \"精英。",
	"The lowest rank. Used to mean filthy or criminal, and strongly insulting.": "最低等级。用来表示肮脏或犯罪，并有强烈的侮辱性。",
	"The working class. Can also be used to mean a low-rank imposter.": "工人阶级。也可用于指低级别的冒牌货。",
	"Acceptable working class.": "可接受的工人阶级。",
	"Best of the working class, or military.": "最好的工人阶级，或军人。",
	"A rising merchant or one with much potential.": "一个正在崛起的商人或一个有很大潜力的商人。",
	"One whose wealth was inherited, or one who was wealthy without business sense.": "一个人的财富是继承来的，或者一个没有商业头脑的富人。",
	"The head of a mercantile house.": "一家商行的负责人。",
	"The highest self-made rank.": "最高的自制等级。",
	"Perfection. The highest possible rank.": "完美。可能的最高等级。",
	"A common insult is to refer to someone as a low-ranking metal, particularly if it is immediately below their actual station. Referring to someone or something as one of the higher ranks is seen as a compliment... or flattery.": "一种常见的侮辱是把某人称为低级金属，特别是在立即低于其实际地位时。将某人或某物称为较高等级的人被视为一种恭维......或奉承。",
	"In practice, the richer inhabitants have authority over the less wealthy. However, a recent public show of wealth such as a large purchase, high bid, or particularly extravagant party could temporarily raise an individual's status above those who possess greater total wealth.": "在实践中，较富裕的居民对较不富裕的居民有权威。然而，最近公开展示的财富，如大笔购买、高价竞标或特别奢侈的聚会，可以暂时提高个人的地位，使其高于那些拥有更大总财富的人。",
	"Because the societal emphasis is so heavily dependent on measurable material wealth, there is little regard given to racial stereotypes. As long as a potential customer or business partner adheres to the basic societal rules—and has the money to back their position—it does not matter who they are or where they are from.": "由于社会的重点是如此严重地依赖于可衡量的物质财富，所以很少考虑到种族定型观念。只要一个潜在的客户或商业伙伴遵守基本的社会规则，并有金钱支持他们的立场，他们是谁或来自哪里并不重要。",
	"One of the first major settlements in the region, the city was originally founded circa 100 DR by Calishite immigrants loyal to the Shoon Imperium. The region was first known as the Emirate of Amin, but when the Shoon Empire fell in 460 DR, Amn became an independent nation... though the city of Esmeltaran was its first capital, despite Athkatla being the oldest and largest city.": "这座城市是该地区最早的主要定居点之一，最初由忠于肖恩帝国的卡利希特移民建立，大约在100 DR。该地区最初被称为阿明酋长国，但当肖恩帝国在460 DR时灭亡，阿明成为一个独立的国家......尽管埃斯梅尔塔兰市是其第一个首都，尽管阿斯卡特拉是最古老和最大的城市。",
	"The next seven centuries were a period of prosperity and peace, driven largely by trade with the distant lands to the North. The rapid rise of the merchant traders led to a culture that valued economic success over all else. The obsession with profit and material wealth eventually became the defining characteristic of Athkatla and its citizens.": "接下来的七个世纪是一个繁荣与和平的时期，主要由与北方遥远土地的贸易驱动。商人的迅速崛起导致了一种将经济成功看得高于一切的文化。对利润和物质财富的痴迷最终成为阿斯卡特拉和其公民的决定性特征。",
	"In 1238 DR a series of trade wars began as various factions tried to exert control over the city. In 1333 all trade in or out of Amn was halted. Realizing such trade interruptions were harmful to not just the merchant houses, but the entire nation, a young Athkatla merchant named Thayze Selemchant persuaded the leaders of five other influential houses in the city to join together and form a new government to \"guide\" commerce... and the nation as a whole.": "1238年，由于各派别试图对该城市进行控制，一系列贸易战开始了。1333年，所有进出安恩的贸易都被停止了。意识到这种贸易中断不仅对商行，而且对整个国家都是有害的，一位年轻的阿斯卡特拉商人Thayze Selemchant说服了城市中其他五个有影响力的商行的领导人联合起来，组成一个新的政府来 \"指导 \"商业...和整个国家。",
	"Under the newly formed Council of Six, trade resumed, and profits flowed once more. The Council decreed that Athkatla, home of their Houses, would be the new capital of Amn. Given their economic influence across all levels of society, there were none who dared oppose them. Under the Council, Athkatla flourished, becoming the busiest trade port on the Sword Coast.": "在新成立的六人委员会的领导下，贸易恢复了，利润再次流动起来。理事会决定，他们的家族所在地阿斯卡特拉将成为阿姆的新首都。鉴于他们在社会各阶层的经济影响力，没有人敢于反对他们。在议会的领导下，阿斯卡特拉繁荣起来，成为剑海岸最繁忙的贸易港口。",

Actions that would be considered illegal or immoral in other lands are tolerated, providing the offenders are rich enough to pay the pre-determined fines. Lewd and licentious behavior are rampant in the city, slavery is common, and even the thieves within the city are permitted to operate provided they follow the terms of written contracts.": "Athkatla的法律是基于黄金法则--谁拥有黄金，谁就制定规则。在其他地方被认为是非法或不道德的行为都被容忍，只要犯罪者足够有钱来支付预先确定的罚款。淫乱和放荡的行为在城市里很猖獗，奴隶制很普遍，甚至城市里的盗贼也被允许经营，只要他们遵守书面合同的条款。",
	"The only real crime in Athkatla—other than being poor—is the use of arcane magic within the city limits. In the 13th Century DR, King Dhanar granted the Cowled Wizards complete oversight over spellcasters. As a result, only a handful of sorcerers are licensed to practice in Athkatla, all exclusively under contract with the various High Houses of Amn. Enforcement of this ban on arcane magic is under the purview of the Cowled Wizards, who administer brutal punishment on any who flout this law. Many of the High Houses now resent this arrangement, as they feel the Cowled Wizards are little more than agents working on behalf of House Selemchant, but the dissenters lack the influence and resources to effectively oppose the status quo.": "在阿斯卡特拉，除了贫穷之外，唯一真正的犯罪是在城市范围内使用奥术魔法。在公元13世纪，达纳尔国王授予牛头人巫师对施法者的完全监督权。因此，只有少数巫师被允许在阿斯卡特拉执业，他们都是与阿姆的各个大院签订合同的。对奥术魔法的禁令是由带头的巫师负责执行的，他们对任何藐视这一法律的人进行残酷的惩罚。许多高级家族现在对这种安排很反感，因为他们觉得牛头人巫师不过是代表塞姆尚家族工作的代理人，但持异议者缺乏有效反对现状的影响力和资源。",
	"A secretive cabal formed in the 13th century DR, they were originally the guardians of arcane knowledge and lore.

	"Violators of the city wide restrictions on magic face censure, banishment or even death. While the stated goal of the organization is to protect the security of the city and guard against the potential devastation a rogue mage might cause, many individual members of the Cowled Wizards use their position for personal profit and gain. Often this involves cutting secret deals with various parties that are not officially sanctioned by their organization. Despite this, there is little recourse for those who feel they have been treated unjustly by any of the Cowled Wizards, as accusations against them often result in severe retaliation.": "违反城市范围内对魔法限制的人将面临谴责、放逐甚至死亡。虽然该组织的既定目标是保护城市的安全，防范流氓法师可能造成的破坏，但许多有胆识的巫师的个人成员利用他们的地位谋取个人利益和收益。这往往涉及到与没有得到他们组织正式认可的各方进行秘密交易。尽管如此，对于那些觉得自己受到任何牛头人不公正对待的人来说，几乎没有追索权，因为对他们的指责往往会导致严重的报复行为。",
	"The members of the Cowled Wizards act in anonymity, often working publicly as merchants, librarians, apothecaries or other similar professions. The identity of any individual Cowled Wizard is known to their immediate family and—at most—a small circle of other members they work within the organization.": "Cowled Wizards的成员匿名行事，通常以商人、图书管理员、药剂师或其他类似职业的身份公开工作。任何一个牛头人巫师的身份都只有他们的直系亲属和--最多是--他们在组织内工作的其他成员的小圈子知道。",
	"The Cowled Wizards meet in secret in the hidden chambers beneath the city, located under Jane Lane. Wearing masks and the garb of the School of Wonder—an academy destroyed in a series of anti-arcane riots long ago—they are able to hide their identities even from each other as they share information and coordinate their activities.": "胆小鬼巫师们在位于简-莱恩下面的城市隐蔽的房间里秘密聚会。他们戴着面具，穿着 \"神奇学校 \"的服装--这是一所很久以前毁于一系列反毒品暴乱的学校--他们甚至能够在分享信息和协调他们的活动时隐藏自己的身份。",
	"One of the most powerful thieves' guilds in western Faerûn is headquartered in Athkatla.

	"However, their exile from Waterdeep proved to be a boon rather than a bane. In Athkatla, they found a society that allowed them to prosper and thrive, and by the early 14th century they controlled many of the criminal operations up and down the Sword Coast.": "然而，事实证明，他们从水底世界的流放是一个福音，而不是一个祸害。在阿斯卡特拉，他们找到了一个允许他们繁荣兴旺的社会，到14世纪初，他们控制了剑海岸上下的许多犯罪活动。",

	"Even though they are an open secret within Athkatla, the Shadow Thieves still prefer to operate discreetly. The Shadow Council that controls the guild understands that secrecy and subtlety are their greatest weapons, and this belief has trickled down through the ranks to every officer, agent and member. The full extent of their convoluted, ambitious machinations are known only to the handful of figures in the upper most echelon, though there are many rumors as to what conspiracies they are involved in. Many of these rumors are, in fact, false narratives planted by the Shadow Thieves themselves to obscure their true goals.": "尽管他们在阿斯卡特拉是一个公开的秘密，但影子盗贼仍然喜欢谨慎地运作。控制公会的影子委员会明白，秘密和狡猾是他们最大的武器，这种信念已经通过等级渗透到每个官员、代理人和成员。他们错综复杂、野心勃勃的阴谋，只有最上层的少数人知道，尽管有许多关于他们参与的阴谋的传言。事实上，这些谣言中有许多是影子盗贼自己编造的假话，以掩盖他们的真实目标。",
	"The Shadow Thieves provide many illicit services that the citizens of Athkatla use on a regular basis. Protection rackets are understood as a cost of doing business, and political leaders rely on the Shadow Thieves for protection... and often hire them to spy on or steal from their rivals. Similarly, the merchants of the city rely on the Shadow Thieves to coordinate the sale and distribution of black market goods to smugglers, pirates and various other underworld figures in numerous cities up and down the Sword Coast.": "影子盗贼提供许多非法服务，阿斯卡特拉的公民经常使用。保护费被理解为做生意的成本，政治领导人依靠影子盗贼的保护......并经常雇用他们监视或从他们的对手那里偷窃。同样，城市的商人们也依靠影子盗贼来协调黑市商品的销售和分配，这些黑市商品被卖给走私者、海盗和剑海岸上下许多城市的其他黑社会人物。",
	"The Guild is known for being as ruthless as they are secretive. Violence is always an option, and in addition to theft and burglary they are also adept in assassination and kidnapping... though prisoners are only taken if they can be ransomed for substantial profit.": "行会以其无情和隐秘而闻名。暴力总是一种选择，除了盗窃和入室盗窃，他们还擅长暗杀和绑架......不过，只有当囚犯可以被赎回以获得可观的利润时才会被带走。",
	"The Guild is controlled by an 8-person Shadow Council operating in Athkatla, which is overseen by an individual known as the Grandmaster of Shadows. There are allegations that the Shadow Thieves have some type of alliance/agreement with the Council of Six allowing them to operate with impunity within the city. In truth, the Grandmaster is always a member of the powerful Dannihyr House—a permanent member of the Council of Six. Because of this, the Shadow Thieves have a powerful voice in the politics of the city... though what would happen if the needs of House Dannihyr came into conflict with those of the guild is something that can only be speculated on.": "该行会由一个在阿斯卡特拉运作的8人影子委员会控制，该委员会由一个被称为影子大师的人监督着。有指控称，影子盗贼与六人委员会有某种类型的联盟/协议，允许他们在城市中不受惩罚地运作。事实上，大师总是强大的丹尼尔家族的成员--六人委员会的永久成员。正因为如此，影子盗贼在城市的政治中拥有强大的话语权......不过，如果丹尼尔家族的需求与公会的需求发生冲突，会发生什么，只能是猜测。",
	"Though the Shadow Thieves have many despised rivals, like the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Waterdeep and the Rundden in Calimshan, their true enemies will forever be the Lords of Waterdeep. Even after more than a century, the Shadow Thieves still harbor a desire for vengeance against the heirs of those who first cast them out of their ancestral home.": "虽然影子盗贼有很多被鄙视的对手，比如水底世界的Xanathar盗贼公会和Calimshan的Rundden，但他们真正的敌人永远是水底世界的领主。即使过了一个多世纪，影子盗贼们仍然对那些最初将他们赶出祖先家园的人的继承人怀有复仇的欲望。",

	"Because Baldur's Gate is first and foremost a city of trade built around its harbor, the docks remain the true heart of the city. This busy area is the base of operations for many key trade organizations in Faerûn, including the famous mercenary company the Flaming Fist. Even the role of the Gate's leaders, the Council of Four (or the \"Grand Dukes\"), has mercantile origins and still pulls many of its members from the ranks of successful merchants.": "因为博德之门首先是一个以港口为中心的贸易城市，所以码头仍然是这个城市的真正核心。这个繁忙的区域是法鲁恩许多重要贸易组织的运营基地，包括著名的雇佣兵公司火焰之拳。即使是大门的领导人，四人理事会（或称 \"大公\"），也是以贸易为基础的，其成员中的许多人仍然来自成功的商人行列。",
	"Often simply referred to as \"the Gate,\" especially by its residents—Baldurians, as they're called—Baldur's Gate was founded over 400 years ago.

	"Baldur's Gate is named for perhaps its most famous citizen, the legendary explorer Balduran.

	"In this way, Balduran used the great fortune he amassed during his travels to help the small town that would someday bear his name grow into a major metropolis. His most famous project was the construction of the impressive city walls that helps make Baldur's Gate an island of security within the otherwise dangerous and unpredictable Sword Coast.": "这样一来，鲍杜兰利用他在旅行中积累的巨大财富，帮助这个有朝一日以他的名字命名的小镇发展成为一个大都市。他最著名的项目是建造了令人印象深刻的城墙，使博德之门成为危险和不可预测的剑海岸中的安全岛。",

However, he and his crew were never heard from again, their ultimate fates still unknown to this day.": "城墙建成后，Balduran最后一次起航，打算返回并进一步探索Anchorome。然而，他和他的船员们再也没有了消息，他们的最终命运至今仍不得而知。",
	"As the years went by, the Gate's rapid growth and increasing prosperity have caught the attention and resentment from wealthy nobles and merchants in Waterdeep and Amn.

	"Baldur's Gate is surrounded by walls on three sides and the rushing River Chionthar to the south, making the city relatively secure from outside threats. For threats within the city, the Flaming Fist does its best to enforce law and order. However, the city's dense population and thriving economy have made it an ideal place for rogues and thieves to ply their trade. Facilitating such illicit activities is an extensive sewer system and network of subterranean structures. Such hidden passageways allow individuals to move throughout the city away from the prying eyes of more upstanding citizens and Flaming Fist patrols.": "博德之门三面环墙，南面是奔腾不息的基昂萨尔河，使城市相对安全，不受外界威胁。对于城内的威胁，火焰之拳竭力执行法律和秩序。然而，城市密集的人口和繁荣的经济使其成为流氓和小偷的理想交易场所。为这种非法活动提供便利的是一个广泛的下水道系统和地下结构网络。这种隐蔽的通道使个人能够在整个城市中移动，远离更多正直的公民和火焰拳头巡逻队的窥视。",

	"Buildings in the Gate generally get newer further away from the harbor, though exceptions can be found where previous structures were torn down for more recent construction in the same lot. The typical style for buildings in the city is towards the tall and narrow, reflecting the fixed amount of area available for development within the walls. However, the Gate is not without urban decay, which is especially common in the Northeast Outskirts, largely considered the slums of the city where only the most destitute make their homes. The northwest represents the opposite side of this coin, containing most of the finer estates belonging to wealthy Baldurians.": "门内的建筑一般都是离港口越远越新，不过也有例外，以前的建筑被拆掉了，在同一地段有了新的建筑。城市建筑的典型风格是高而窄，反映了城墙内可用于发展的固定面积。然而，阊门并非没有城市衰败，这在东北郊特别常见，基本上被认为是城市的贫民窟，只有最贫穷的人才会在这里安家。西北部代表了这枚硬币的另一面，包含了大部分属于富裕的Baldurian的高级庄园。",
	"Like most aspects of life in Baldur's Gate, its balance of power largely revolves around what the city is mainly known for: commerce. The many trade organizations within the Gate have formed a symbiotic relationship with the Grand Dukes. The Dukes' approval can mean lucrative trade agreements, while strong trade organization support is often necessary for their election. Hired by the Dukes and paid through tariffs and taxes, the Flaming Fist mercenary company enforce the law—while the city's highly organized and equally sizable Thieves' Guild works hard to ply their own trade without getting noticed.": "就像博德之门生活的大多数方面一样，它的权力平衡在很大程度上是围绕着这个城市的主要特点而展开的：商业。博德门内的许多贸易组织与大公爵们形成了一种共生的关系。公爵们的批准意味着有利可图的贸易协议，而强大的贸易组织支持往往是他们选举的必要条件。由公爵们雇用并通过关税和税收支付的火焰之拳雇佣兵公司负责执法，而城市中组织严密、规模庞大的盗贼公会则努力从事自己的贸易而不被人注意。",
	"Baldur's Gate has had its fate entwined for more than a century with that of Bhaal, god of murder. Bhaal foresaw that he would die in the Time of Troubles and enacted a plan that would allow him to return to life. While that plan took more than a century to come to fruition, Bhaal has indeed been reborn in the city of Baldur's Gate. Having been dead for more than a century, he now works to rebuild his following and thus strengthen his divine might.": "一个多世纪以来，博德之门的命运与谋杀之神Bhaal的命运纠缠在一起。Bhaal预见到他将在动乱时期死去，并制定了一个可以让他重生的计划。虽然这个计划花了一个多世纪才得以实现，但Bhaal确实已经在博德之门的城市中重生了。死了一个多世纪后，他现在致力于重建他的追随者，从而加强他的神力。",
	"Baldurs Gate teems with evil and the stinky smell of decay. Perhaps not as stinky as a hamster fart, but a close second for sure.": "博德门充满了邪恶和腐烂的臭味。也许没有仓鼠放的屁那么臭，但肯定是紧随其后。",
	"Also known as the Council of Four, the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate rule the city and are entrusted with making political decisions to the benefit of its citizens. Each Duke is democratically elected by landowners within the Gate, serving for life or until resignation. Rarely, a Duke who has committed an egregious offense is then stripped of their title. Although anyone can theoretically become a Grand Duke with enough support, they are usually pulled from the ranks of wealthy merchants, renowned military leaders, and famous adventurers. The current Dukes consist of Ulder Ravengard (also commander of the Flaming Fist), Belynne Stelmane and Dillard Portyr. One of the positions has recently become open with the death of duke Thalamra Vanthampur. A newcomer to the city, {@creature Eo Ashmajiir|MaBJoV}, has been aggressively politicking to be elected to the empty seat.": "博德之门的大公爵们也被称为四人会议，他们统治着这座城市，并被委托做出有利于市民的政治决定。每个公爵都是由门内的土地所有者民主选举产生的，终身任职或直到辞职。极少数情况下，犯有严重罪行的公爵会被剥夺其头衔。虽然理论上任何人都可以在足够的支持下成为大公，但他们通常是从富商、著名军事领袖和著名冒险家的行列中挑选出来的。目前的公爵包括乌尔德-拉文加德（也是火焰之拳的指挥官）、贝琳-斯特尔曼和迪拉德-波蒂尔。最近，随着塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔公爵的去世，其中一个职位已经空缺。一个新来的{@creature Eo Ashmajiir|MaBJoV}，一直在积极地进行政治活动，希望能当选这个空位。",
	"The first Dukes were directly linked to the port city's nautical past and were entirely made up of retired sea captains. Despite the importance of its port, Baldur's Gate was originally ruled by wealthy farmers. Sailors resented having to pay hefty fees and taxes to use the gates built by their lost colleague, Balduran. They eventually overthrew the farmers, installing the four oldest sea captains as rulers of the Gate. The four were originally called \"Grand Dukes\" in jest, but the title—now used unironically—has stuck to this day.": "第一批公爵与港口城市的航海历史直接相关，完全由退役的船长组成。尽管博德门的港口很重要，但它最初是由富有的农民统治的。水手们对不得不支付高昂的费用和税收来使用他们失去的同事Balduran建造的大门感到不满。他们最终推翻了农民的统治，将四位最年长的海员任命为大门的统治者。这四个人最初被称为 \"大公 \"是开玩笑的，但这个头衔--现在被非讽刺地使用--一直坚持到今天。",
	"The Grand Dukes operate out of the Ducal Palace, also known as the High Hall. One of the tallest buildings in Baldur's Gate, the Ducal Palace acts as an office for everyday decisions, a venue for regal ceremonies, and a suitably luxurious place to entertain politically important individuals visiting the city. The palace also provides sleeping quarters for temporarily displaced nobles and those whose main estates lie outside the city walls. As its name suggests, the Ducal Palace has been built to emulate the residences of more conventional royalty, complete with heavily fortified walls and high towers.": "大公爵们在公爵府（Ducal Palace）内办公，也被称为高级大厅。公爵府是博德之门最高的建筑之一，它既是日常决策的办公室，也是举行皇家仪式的场所，还是招待来访的政治要人的适当的豪华场所。宫殿还为暂时流离失所的贵族和那些主要财产在城墙外的人提供睡眠场所。顾名思义，公爵府的建造是为了模仿更多传统皇室成员的住所，并配有坚固的城墙和高塔。",

It is considered by most Underdark denizens as unescapable and being consigned to the prison a fate worse than death. The reason for this is that it is run by demodands from the infernal plane of Carceri. A portal to the plane of Carceri is even located in its lower depths. Some of the prisoners rumored to be held in the prison include powerful drider, rogue illithid such as Alhoon and even a few specimens of phaerrim.
