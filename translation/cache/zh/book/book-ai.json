	"Acquisitions Incorporated was founded in Seattle, Washington, in a time spoken of in only hushed tones: the year 2009. It first saw life as a podcast, which, at the time, was an unusual way to play Dungeons & Dragons. The intervening decade saw Acq Inc take on many forms—streams, recorded content, comics, and, of course, live roleplaying shows. While these are all now completely normal ways to discover and enjoy D&D, back then, not so much. We just did it because it seemed like a cool idea, and ten years later, it seems like maybe we were right. Today, Acq Inc's adventures continue, dutifully chronicled online at acq-inc.com.": "收购公司成立于华盛顿州西雅图，当时人们只用沙哑的语调谈论：2009年。它最初是以播客的形式出现的，这在当时是一种不寻常的玩龙与地下城的方式。在这十年间，Acq公司采取了许多形式--流媒体、录制内容、漫画，当然还有现场角色扮演节目。虽然这些都是现在发现和享受D&D的完全正常的方式，但在当时，并不是这样的。我们这样做只是因为这似乎是一个很酷的想法，而十年后，似乎我们是对的。今天，Acq公司的冒险仍在继续，在acq-inc.com网站上尽职地记录着。",
	"Our intention with Acquisitions Incorporated was to bring dark office comedy to a world of swords, sorcery, dungeons, and (dare we say) dragons. This book, created in concert with Wizards of the Coast, sets you up for success in your own fantasy-business endeavors. Chapter 1 provides an orientation for new franchise members, detailing how to start a game and play the Acquisitions Incorporated way. {@book Chapter 2|AI|1} explores the various positions within an Acq Inc franchise, introducing a variety of roles vital to an adventuring enterprise's success. {@book Chapter 3|AI|2} delves into backgrounds for Acq Inc franchise members, entrenching company goals at the core of their beings. In {@adventure Chapter 4|OoW|0}, all this comes together in an adventure taking characters from level 1 to 6, establishing a party's claim on a world they've begun to explore and strip-mine for profit.": "我们编写《收购公司》的目的是将黑暗的办公室喜剧带入一个充满剑、巫术、地牢和（我们敢说）龙的世界。本书是与 \"海岸奇才 \"合作编写的，为你在自己的奇幻事业中取得成功做了准备。第1章为新的特许经营成员提供了一个方向，详细介绍了如何开始一个游戏和以收购公司的方式进行游戏。{@book Chapter 2|AI|1}探讨了Acq Inc特许经营中的各种职位，介绍了对冒险企业的成功至关重要的各种角色。(1%)深入探讨了Acq Inc特许经营成员的背景，将公司的目标牢牢固定在他们的核心位置。在{@adventure Chapter 4|OoW|0}中，所有这些都汇集在一个冒险中，人物从1级到6级，建立了一个政党对他们已经开始探索和开采利润的世界的要求。",
	"Following these chapters, {@book appendix A|AI|3} presents stalwarts of the Acquisitions Incorporated world, founding members and characters from the company's ongoing adventures. {@book Appendix B|AI|11} details foes, from terrifying deep crows to infamous keg robots. {@book Appendices C|AI|12}, {@book D|AI|13}, and {@book E|AI|14} conclude this guide with a variety of Acq Inc tools and treasures, from vehicles like the {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} to the mighty {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}.": "在这些章节之后，{@book appendix A|AI|3}介绍了收购公司世界的中坚力量，公司的创始成员和正在进行的冒险中的人物。(%%1%)详细介绍了敌人，从可怕的深海乌鸦到臭名昭著的水桶机器人。{@book Appendices C|AI|12}、{@book D|AI|13}和{@book E|AI|14}以各种Acq公司的工具和宝物作为本指南的结尾，从{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}等交通工具到强大的{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}。",
	"Many hands worked diligently throughout the process of creating the Acquisitions Incorporated campaign and this resulting book. If you put your ear very close to the pages, you will hear us whisper, \"thank you.\"": "在创建Acquisition Incorporated运动和这本书的整个过程中，许多人都在辛勤地工作。如果你把耳朵贴近书页，你会听到我们轻声说：\"谢谢你\"。",
	"With its roots set firmly in heroic fantasy, D&D might feel out of sync with modern-day business dealings. But the game and its settings are actually a perfect fit for such tropes. What better way to think of the big bad monster at the center of a web of even bigger and badder plans than as the CEO of a megacorporation, using every resource to dominate the market? What is an adventuring party but a limited-liability corporation, with each member contributing specialized skills to growing the brand and expanding a power base?": "由于其根植于英雄主义幻想，D&D可能会感到与现代商业交易不同步。但这个游戏和它的设定实际上是对这种套路的完美诠释。还有什么比作为巨型公司的首席执行官，利用一切资源来支配市场，更能让人联想到处于更大、更坏的计划网络中心的大坏蛋？什么是冒险党，而是一个有限责任公司，每个成员都为发展品牌和扩大权力基础贡献专门技能？",
	"Likewise, hirelings, sidekicks, apprentices, and other paid laborers working for the heroes have been staples of Dungeons & Dragons since the earliest editions of the game. Charisma in AD&D was good for little other than determining how many followers your character might gather—and, more importantly, how much pain and suffering you could put those followers through before they abandoned you. The world of Acquisitions Incorporated returns these hired helpers to prominence for their importance to the campaign story. And, of course, for comic effect.": "同样，从龙与地下城游戏的最早版本开始，雇佣兵、跟班、学徒和其他为英雄工作的有偿劳动者就一直是龙与地下城游戏的主要内容。AD&D中的魅力除了决定你的角色可能聚集多少追随者外，几乎没有其他用处--更重要的是，在这些追随者抛弃你之前，你可以让他们经历多少痛苦和折磨。在《收购公司》的世界里，这些受雇的帮手因其对战役故事的重要性而回归到突出的位置。当然，也是为了达到喜剧效果。",
	"When the characters are relatively low level, an Acquisitions Incorporated style of play can present them with even more hurdles to overcome. The often bizarre, unfeeling, and surreal elements of corporate and business life can add a degree of danger or absurdity to even the most run-of-the-mill adventuring. And as the characters attain higher levels—and their franchise attains higher rank—their connections to Acquisitions Incorporated can help dial up the stakes of any adventure path. In an Acq Inc campaign, every NPC is a potential customer. Every bit of treasure found is an investment in the franchise and its future. Every other would-be hero is the competition, and every villain is the head of Evil Incorporated, just begging for some market volatility.": "当角色的等级相对较低时，收购公司的游戏风格会给他们带来更多的障碍，需要克服。公司和商业生活中经常出现的怪异、无情和超现实的元素可以为最普通的冒险活动增加一定程度的危险或荒诞。随着角色等级的提高，以及他们的特许经营权获得更高的等级，他们与收购公司的联系可以帮助拨高任何冒险路径的风险。在Acq公司的活动中，每个NPC都是一个潜在的客户。每一个发现的宝藏都是对特许经营权和其未来的投资。每一个可能成为英雄的人都是竞争对手，而每一个反派都是邪恶公司的头头，都在等待着市场的波动。",
	"Money, as they say, makes the world go around. And as is true in real life, so it goes in the fantasy realm. The far-reaching power of global corporations allied with political power doesn't just inform our own real world—it molds it. Bringing that concept of powerful corporations working with or against nobility to gain money, power, and influence into D&D adds another layer of depth to the story your campaigns create.": "俗话说，金钱使世界运转。在现实生活中是如此，在幻想领域也是如此。全球性企业与政治权力结盟的深远力量不仅影响了我们自己的现实世界，而且还塑造了它。将强大的公司与贵族合作或反对贵族以获得金钱、权力和影响力的概念引入D&D，为你的活动创造的故事增加了另一层深度。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has a unique texture, because it combines deeply ordinary clerical toil with multiverse-spanning stakes. And in the end, you never know which one of those tropes might save your life.": "一个收购公司的活动具有独特的质地，因为它将普通的牧师工作与跨越多个宇宙的赌注结合起来。最后，你永远也不知道哪一个惯例会救你的命。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated is high fantasy by way of office comedy. Imagine the Fellowship of the Ring insisting they only trekked from nine to five. Think about Conan barbarously assailing his way up the corporate ladder. Or perhaps King Arthur insisting that Excalibur's real magic lie in brand awareness, or Robin Hood pivoting the Merry Men toward a pyramid scheme.": "收购公司是以办公室喜剧的方式进行的高级幻想。想象一下，\"魔戒团 \"坚持他们只从九点到五点进行跋涉。想想柯南野蛮地攻击他在公司的阶梯上。或者，亚瑟王坚持认为神剑的真正魔力在于品牌意识，或者罗宾汉把快乐的人引向金字塔计划。",
	"Starting your own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise means stepping into a world of possibility. It opens up countless adventure hooks, rules for building and growing your own personalized base of operations, and a way to introduce Acquisitions Incorporated's specific sense of farcical corporate culture, questionable morality, and unfolding narrative to your own game.": "开始你自己的收购公司专营权意味着踏入一个充满可能性的世界。它开辟了无数的冒险钩子，建立和发展你自己的个性化行动基地的规则，以及将收购公司的特定意义上的滑稽企业文化、可疑的道德和展开的叙事引入你自己的游戏的方法。",
	"Within the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, the franchise is the center of brand expansion throughout the world of Faerûn and beyond, even as it provides a new set of tools for player expression and involvement. In a way, it provides players with a greater purpose to explore. And although entirely nonnegotiable, franchise fees are incredibly reasonable.": "在《收购公司》的世界里，特许经营权是整个Faerûn世界和其他地方的品牌扩张的中心，即使它为玩家的表达和参与提供了一套新的工具。在某种程度上，它为玩家提供了一个更大的探索目的。虽然完全没有商量的余地，但特许权费用却非常合理。",
	"Our integrated Intern Success Pathway is a robust, unparalleled system for reliable growth year-on-year while maximizing your downstream.": "我们的综合实习生成功之路是一个强大的、无与伦比的系统，可以实现逐年的可靠增长，同时最大限度地提高你的下游。",
	"Throughout history, some people have had things and other people have wanted those things. But where most would gaze upon that arrangement and see an inescapable life of unfulfillment, {@creature Omin Dran|AI|Ominifis Hereward \"Omin\" Dran} saw a business opportunity. Thus was Acquisitions Incorporated born. In the years since, Omin and longtime employee (though less-longtime friend) {@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI|James Winifred \"Jim\" Darkmagic III} have turned a talent for redistribution of property into a reputation as the multiverse's premier adventurers for hire.": "纵观历史，一些人拥有一些东西，另一些人想要这些东西。但是，当大多数人注视着这种安排，看到的是无法逃避的不满足的生活时，{@creature Omin Dran|AI|Ominifis Hereward \"Omin\" Dran}却看到了一个商业机会。因此，Acquisition Incorporated诞生了。在此后的几年里，奥明和长期雇员（尽管是不太长久的朋友）（1%）已经把重新分配财产的天赋变成了作为多元宇宙的首要冒险家的声誉。",
	"{@creature Omin Dran|AI}, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated and war priest of Tymora, is the very model of the modern Faerûn business mien. He prioritizes his responsibilities first to his shareholders (which is to say, himself); second to his goddess; and then at some later stage to the well-being of his employees. It's definitely not third. But it's up there somewhere.": "{@creature Omin Dran|AI}，收购公司的首席执行官和Tymora的战神，是现代Faerûn商业行为的典范。他首先对他的股东（也就是他自己）负责；其次是对他的女神负责；然后在后来的某个阶段对他的员工的福利负责。这绝对不是第三。但它是在那里的某个地方。",
	"{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI} III comes from a long line of renowned wizards, but he turned his back on his family and his inheritance for a life on the stage—at least until well-paid heroics came calling. Jim and Omin's unlikely partnership began when Jim was the only surviving candidate in the running for a hotly contested position with the company. (Any deaths incurred in this process were incidental, and not the result of the actions or negligence of Acq Inc.)": "{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI}三世出身于著名的巫师世家，但他为了舞台上的生活而背弃了他的家庭和他的遗产--至少在高薪的英雄主义出现之前。吉姆和奥明的不可能的伙伴关系始于吉姆是公司一个竞争激烈的职位中唯一幸存的候选人。(在这个过程中发生的任何死亡都是偶然的，而不是Acq公司的行为或疏忽造成的）。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated began as most adventuring groups do, with the wholesale removal of irksome kobolds, scouting ruined towers, delving into dwarven necropolis-cities, and abandoning wounded goblin hirelings named Splug to a terrible fate. The usual stuff. But in short order, Acq Inc traded kobolds for dragons, and upgraded ruined towers to eldritch temples. As the company grew, so too did its demand for willing and able-bodied adventurers. However, a limited payroll meant having to settle for one or the other.": "收购公司开始时与大多数冒险团体一样，全盘清除令人讨厌的哥布林，侦察废墟上的塔楼，深入矮人的死城，并将受伤的哥布林雇佣者Splug遗弃在可怕的命运中。这些都是平常的事情。但在短时间内，Acq公司将哥布林换成了龙，并将废墟塔楼升级为长生殿。随着公司的发展，它对有意愿和有能力的冒险家的需求也在增加。然而，有限的薪资意味着必须满足一个或另一个。",
	"After coming to the conclusion that a mission statement best described as \"minion harvesting\" sent the wrong message, Acquisitions Incorporated started an internship program. In accordance with the truism \"you get what you pay for,\" the very first Acq Inc intern died on his second assignment with the company. But like all good leaders, {@creature Omin Dran|AI} understood that truisms cut two ways, and he led the remaining team on a legendary trek through the Nine Hells to recover the soul of said intern. (Clearly, none of those hells paid for him either.)": "在得出 \"收割奴才 \"的使命宣言发出错误信息的结论后，收购公司开始实施实习计划。根据 \"一分钱一分货 \"的道理，收购公司的第一个实习生在他加入公司的第二个任务中就死了。但像所有优秀的领导者一样，{@creature Omin Dran|AI}明白，真理是有两面性的，他带领剩余的团队在九层地狱中进行了一次传奇的跋涉，以恢复上述实习生的灵魂。(显然，这些地狱也没有为他付出代价）。",
	"The rogue {@creature Viari|AI} is one of Acquisitions Incorporated's best internship success stories. In fact, he was so successful that he remained the company's flagship intern for nearly a decade. He first joined Acquisitions Incorporated during an expedition into the {@adventure Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (who, due to an ongoing defamation suit, we can no longer refer to as \"the Mad Mage\"). From regrowing his own arm after an unfortunate incident with the {@i Apocalypse Dagger}, to wrangling dinosaurs to win street races, {@creature Viari|AI} has earned something far more valuable than a regular salary with Acq Inc. He's earned on-the-job experience.": "流氓（%0%）是收购公司最好的实习生成功故事之一。事实上，他是如此成功，以至于他在近十年内一直是公司的旗舰实习生。他第一次加入收购公司是在对{@adventure Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}（由于正在进行的诽谤诉讼，我们不能再把他称为 \"疯狂法师\"）的考察中。从在一次与{@i Apocalypse Dagger}的不幸事件后重新长出自己的手臂，到操纵恐龙赢得街头比赛，{@creature Viari|AI}在Acq公司赢得了远比普通工资更有价值的东西。他赢得了在职工作的经验。",
	"Thanks to the company's continuing success and robust internship program, Acquisitions Incorporated has long since outgrown garden-variety slaughter and disregard for public well-being. {@creature Môrgæn|AI}, an elf ranger from the Elsewynn, joined the team as a troubleshooter some time ago, and quickly showed that her propensity for slaughter and disregard for the public well-being is far beyond garden variety.": "由于公司的持续成功和强大的实习计划，收购公司早已不再是花园式的屠杀和对公众福祉的漠视。{@creature Môrgæn|AI}，一个来自埃尔塞文的精灵游侠，前段时间作为故障排除者加入了这个团队，并很快显示出她的屠杀倾向和对公众福祉的漠视远远超出了花园式的范畴。",
	"{@creature Môrgæn|AI}'s recruitment coincided with Acquisitions Incorporated acquiring its first airship. Diviners have theorized that this was no coincidence, but the combined psychic will of all mortal creatures to put as much distance between them and the ranger as possible. More practical minds see the folly in this, since the airship simply gave {@creature Môrgæn|AI} a better vantage point.": "{@creature Môrgæn|AI}的招募恰好与收购公司获得其第一艘飞艇相吻合。占卜者认为这不是巧合，而是所有凡人生物的综合精神意志，让他们与游侠之间的距离越远越好。更实际的人认为这是愚蠢的，因为飞艇只是给了(1%)一个更好的视野。",
	"Beyond the core Acquisitions Incorporated crew, {@creature Omin Dran|AI} has overseen regular strategic expansion of the Acq Inc brand. The \"C\" Team, the \"B\" team, and numerous other franchise operations have been established, flying the Acq Inc flag, bearing the Acq Inc sigil, and—most crucially—paying a cut of the profits into company coffers on a monthly basis.": "除了核心的Acquisition Incorporated团队，{@creature Omin Dran|AI}还负责监督Acq Inc品牌的定期战略扩张。C \"团队、\"B \"团队和许多其他特许经营业务已经建立，悬挂着Acq Inc的旗帜，带有Acq Inc的标志，而且最关键的是，每月向公司库房支付一定的利润。",
	"What the customer wants is not always what the customer needs... or gets.": "客户想要的并不总是客户需要的......或得到的。",
	"In the years between its founding and today, Acquisitions Incorporated has pried deep into the underbelly of Waterdeep, commandeered battle balloons above the jungles of Chult, faced down mechanical beholders, and robbed a bank operated by devils. The team has also rubbed shoulders with some of the most notorious figures in the Forgotten Realms, including bumping into Drizzt Do'Urden while journeying through the Underdark.": "在成立至今的这些年里，收购公司已经深入到水底世界的底层，征用了丘特丛林上空的战斗气球，面对机械人，并抢劫了一家由魔鬼经营的银行。该团队还曾与被遗忘的领域中一些最臭名昭著的人物擦肩而过，包括在穿越暗黑世界时碰到德里兹特-杜尔登。",
	"When {@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI} became afflicted with the Death Curse, there was no definitive proof that this was a direct result of his employment with Acquisitions Incorporated, or had been incurred while on assignment. However, as Omin had already made his stance on the subject of death and termination of employment contracts very clear, he sought to break the curse. Dabbling in some light cloning and contracting the help of a trash witch, the team managed to restore Jim to peak productivity. Never one to waste company resources, Omin also traded Jim's clone to a devil. It seemed prudent at the time.": "当{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI}受到死亡诅咒的困扰时，没有确切的证据表明这是他受雇于收购公司的直接结果，或者是在执行任务时发生的。然而，由于奥明已经非常清楚地表明了他对死亡和终止雇佣合同问题的立场，他试图打破诅咒。在一些轻度克隆和与一个垃圾女巫签约的帮助下，团队成功地将吉姆恢复到最高生产力。奥明从不浪费公司的资源，他还将吉姆的克隆体交易给了一个魔鬼。这在当时看来是很谨慎的。",
	"However, nothing in Acquisitions Incorporated's storied history encapsulates the company's efficacy better than the recovery of Omin's sister, {@creature Auspicia Dran|AI}, from the Wandering Crypt. The specifics of her initial capture by that dread creature remain shrouded in mystery. Some say it was inspired by the evil actions of Omin's other sister, {@creature Portentia Dran|AI|Portentia}. Some also speculate that as the sole shareholder of Acq Inc, Omin founded the company for the express purpose of rescuing his beloved sister. Acquisitions Incorporated will not be making further statements on the matter at this time.": "然而，在收购公司的传奇历史中，没有什么比从流浪墓穴中救出奥明的妹妹{@creature Auspicia Dran|AI}更能体现该公司的功效了。她最初被那个可怕的生物捕获的具体细节仍然笼罩在神秘之中。有人说这是受到奥民的另一个妹妹（1%）的邪恶行为的启发。也有人猜测，作为Acq公司的唯一股东，Omin创立公司的目的就是为了营救他心爱的妹妹。收购公司目前不会就此事发表进一步声明。",
	"The company's mounting successes have led, of course, to imitators and rivals. The Six, counting among their number a certain left-for-dead goblin now named {@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI}, have been a persistent splinter in the Acq Inc corporate paw for ages. Suggesting that acquisition is a family business, Omin's own sister Portentia now runs and serves a competing company called Dran Enterprises. Originally founded by what turned out to be a false version of Omin's lost sister, Auspicia, Dran Enterprises has long sought to execute a hostile takeover of Acquisitions Incorporated. All such efforts have been skillfully rebuffed, of course, with Acq Inc embracing its place as an always-independent (and clearly superior) operation.": "该公司不断取得的成功当然也导致了模仿者和竞争对手。六人帮，其中有一个已经死去的小妖精，现在被命名为（%0%），长期以来一直是Acq公司企业爪子上的一个分裂体。暗示收购是一项家族事业，奥明的亲妹妹波坦蒂亚现在经营并服务于一家名为德兰企业的竞争公司。德兰企业最初是由奥明失散的妹妹奥斯皮西亚的虚假版本创立的，长期以来一直试图对收购公司实施敌意收购。当然，所有这些努力都被巧妙地回绝了，Acq公司作为一个始终独立的（而且明显优越的）运营机构，拥抱着自己的位置。",
	"Riding its past success into a completely deliberate and planned expansion across the multiverse, Acquisitions Incorporated shows no signs of slowing down. (Because that would likely require self-reflection and measured responses that are historically off-brand.) And that expansion means new franchises. The first step was Ravnica, a city run by guilds and simply overflowing at the practicability of acquisition for hire. But beyond that? Infinite possibilities. Because wherever people want things they don't currently have, Acquisitions Incorporated will be there, asking them to sign.": "利用其过去的成功，在整个多元宇宙中进行了完全审慎和有计划的扩张，收购公司没有显示出放缓的迹象。(因为这很可能需要自我反省和有分寸的反应，这在历史上是不符合品牌要求的）。而这种扩张意味着新的特许权。第一步是拉夫尼卡（Ravnica），一个由行会管理的城市，在雇佣收购的可行性方面简直是泛滥成灾。但除此之外呢？无限的可能性。因为只要人们想要他们目前没有的东西，收购公司就会在那里，要求他们签字。",
	"No time to read the whole book? Who can blame you! (What is this thing, like 200 pages? Yikes.) To get a taste of the awesomeness that is an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, just roll up any number of critical franchise elements from the tables on this page. (DMs can also do this if they want to shirk the work of creating rival franchises from whole cloth. Slackers.)": "没有时间阅读整本书？谁能怪你呢！（这是什么东西？(这是什么东西，有200多页吗？耶。)要想体验一下收购公司特许权的可怕之处，只需从本页的表格中卷起任何数量的关键特许权元素。(如果DM想推卸创建竞争对手的工作，他们也可以这样做。懒人）。",

This chapter also introduces company positions—a new set of rules for franchise characters granting access to unique, tier-based abilities that can help a party stand out in a crowded marketplace. And because taking a vacation is no excuse for diminished returns, an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can make use of expanded rules for downtime and franchise activities, allowing players to help shape the business and the narrative of the campaign even when they aren't in the field.": "本章介绍了Acquisition Incorporated的特许经营和经营规则。特许经营的好处是按等级划分的，包括一个不断扩大的商业领地，特许经营总部的广泛选择和升级，以及更多。本章还介绍了公司职位--一套新的特许经营角色规则，授予他们独特的、基于等级的能力，可以帮助一方在拥挤的市场上脱颖而出。因为休假不是收益减少的借口，收购公司的特许经营可以利用扩大的停工和特许经营活动规则，让玩家即使不在现场也能帮助塑造业务和活动的叙述。",
	"A license to operate an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise comes with nearly limitless benefits! When your party starts a franchise, you receive a region in which to operate, a franchise headquarters, and a majordomo to assist with basic headquarters needs. As your characters become accomplished adventurers (and continue to contribute to Head Office coffers), Acquisitions Incorporated helps your franchise gain even greater benefits! See the following {@book Franchise Advancement table|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} for a summary of what you get at each rank.": "经营Acquisition Incorporated特许经营权的许可几乎带来了无限的好处! 当你的队伍开始经营时，你会得到一个经营区域，一个特许经营总部，以及一个协助满足总部基本需求的大佬。当你的角色成为有成就的冒险家时（并继续为总部库房做贡献），收购公司会帮助你的加盟店获得更大的利益 请看下面{@book Franchise Advancement table|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}对你在每个等级中得到的东西的总结。",
	"By default, a franchise rank is gained at each tier of play (beginning at level 1 and advancing when the average party level reaches level 5, 11, and 17). The DM might choose to increase or decrease the level of play at which franchise tiers are gained, or tie advancement to story or campaign goals. Each franchise rank provides characters the opportunity to operate in a larger geographic area, hire staff and direct them to execute franchise tasks, and customize the franchise headquarters.": "默认情况下，每一级游戏都会获得一个特许权等级（从1级开始，当队伍的平均等级达到5级、11级和17级时，就会晋级）。管理者可以选择增加或减少获得特许权等级的游戏级别，或将晋级与故事或活动目标挂钩。每个特许经营等级都为角色提供了在更大的地理区域内经营的机会，雇佣员工并指导他们执行特许经营任务，以及定制特许经营总部。",
	"When a franchise first starts out, it is licensed to operate in a small region focused on a settlement or similar mercantile point. You might think this means Head Office doesn't trust its new franchisees. Not at all! No! It's just so much easier to support a group when they start in a focused area. Don't worry at all that a rival Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will outmaneuver you. It seldom happens. Keep growing your business, and the Acq Inc license will expand to help you find more customers and increase your brand presence.": "当一个特许经营权刚开始时，它被授权在一个小区域内经营，重点是一个定居点或类似的商业点。你可能认为这意味着总部不信任它的新加盟商。根本不是这样的! 不是的! 当一个团体在一个重点地区开始时，支持他们就会容易得多。不要担心竞争对手Acquisition Incorporated的特许经营权会超过你的能力。这很少发生。继续发展你的业务，Acq公司的许可证将扩大，以帮助你找到更多的客户，增加你的品牌影响力。",
	"Within your licensed region, you have the right to use the full power of Acquisitions Incorporated branding. No other Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will operate in your region, and all the region's customers are exclusively yours. Of course, non-Acquisitions Incorporated rival organizations might be present. You are expected to drive them out of business. (Or give them untimely deaths. You do you.) A franchise can build or operate any number of locations, such as warehouses and trade shops, within its region. You may not maintain property or establish formal operations in a settlement outside your region, even if you ship goods to that location.": "在你的许可区域内，你有权使用Acquisitions Incorporated品牌的全部力量。在你的区域内，没有其他收购公司的特许经营权，该区域的所有客户都是你的专属。当然，非收购公司的竞争对手组织可能会出现。你要把他们赶出企业。(或者让他们过早地死去。你做你的。)一个特许权可以在其区域内建立或经营任何数量的地点，如仓库和贸易商店。你不能在你的地区之外的定居点维持财产或建立正式的业务，即使你把货物运到那个地方。",
	"You may not use the Acquisitions Incorporated brand outside your licensed region without written, documancer-generated permission, since those areas might belong to other licensees. You can adventure outside your territory, of course, and can assist or work for other organizations. However, you are expected to prioritize missions given to you by Head Office.": "没有书面的、文档管理员生成的许可，你不能在你的许可区域之外使用Acquisition Incorporated的品牌，因为这些区域可能属于其他被许可人。当然，你可以在你的领地之外冒险，也可以协助或为其他组织工作。但是，你应该优先考虑总部给你的任务。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated grants your franchise a license to operate in a settlement, and in a territory around the settlement approximately 10 miles across. If your region includes a coastline, you are granted the rights to engage in sea trade within that region. You can ship goods (over land, water, or air) to one city or other settlement outside your region. (The DM approves this location, and might wish to establish your franchise's relationship with it through play as part of the campaign.)": "收购公司授予你的特许经营权，可以在一个定居点和定居点周围约10英里范围内经营。如果你的地区包括一个海岸线，你被授予在该地区从事海上贸易的权利。你可以将货物（通过陆地、水路或空中）运送到你所在地区以外的一个城市或其他定居点。(DM批准这个地点，并可能希望通过作为战役一部分的游戏来建立你的专营权与它的关系。)",
	"Your license now expands to include a region similar in size to a province or a small kingdom—typically up to 50 miles across, with your starting settlement somewhere within. (For mapping purposes, this area is roughly the same scale as a province-scale map. See \"{@book Mapping Your Campaign|DMG|1|Mapping Your Campaign}\" in chapter 1 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.) You are expected to expand your trade and branding throughout the region. You'll seize new markets, develop new offerings, increase your network of contacts, and safeguard the king and queen's spoiled kids so the monarchs think of you positively. You can ship goods to two cities or other settlements outside your region.": "你的许可证现在扩展到包括一个类似于省或小王国大小的区域--通常是50英里宽，你的起始定居点在其中的某个地方。(为了绘图的目的，这个区域的规模与一个省规模的地图大致相同。参见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第一章中的\"{@book Mapping Your Campaign|DMG|1|Mapping Your Campaign}\"。你要在整个地区扩大你的贸易和品牌效应。你要抢占新的市场，开发新的产品，增加你的关系网，并保护国王和王后宠爱的孩子，让君主们对你有积极的看法。你可以将货物运往你所在地区以外的两个城市或其他定居点。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a group effort. Many decisions must be made in the course of running a franchise and playing in an Acq Inc campaign, and it is assumed that all players will be involved in making those decisions. Whenever this book talks about a franchise collectively—and in particular, when it talks about decisions being made by a franchise—the understanding is that all characters (in the game) and all players (at the table) have an equal say in determining a franchise's fortunes and fate. Sure, arguments will crop up from time to time. But that kind of roleplaying is a big part of what makes an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "收购公司的特许经营权是一个团体的努力。在经营特许经营权和参与Acq Inc活动的过程中，必须做出许多决定，而且假定所有玩家都会参与做出这些决定。每当本书谈到特许经营权时，特别是谈到特许经营权所做的决定时，我们的理解是，所有的角色（在游戏中）和所有的玩家（在桌子上）在决定特许经营权的财富和命运方面都有平等的发言权。当然，争论会不时地出现。但这种角色扮演是收购公司活动的一个重要组成部分。",
	"Your license grows to include a broad expanse of provinces, a few small kingdoms, or a large kingdom or federation, covering a territory the size of half the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. A large territory might overlap with other Acquisitions Incorporated regions, though you are theoretically working with (and perhaps overseeing) smaller franchises rather than working against them. You can ship your goods to any destination, and can assign staff to a city to which you ship goods—solely to oversee the distribution of those goods, and certainly not to compete with rivals. Don't cause too much trouble and Head Office will stay happy.": "你的特许权发展到包括广阔的省份、几个小王国或一个大王国或联邦，覆盖的领土面积相当于《被遗忘的王国》战役背景中的半个剑海岸。一个大的领地可能会与其他收购公司的地区重叠，尽管理论上你是在与（也许是在监督）较小的专营权合作，而不是与它们作对。你可以将你的货物运往任何目的地，并可以向你运送货物的城市派驻工作人员--只是为了监督这些货物的分销，当然不是为了与对手竞争。不要造成太多麻烦，总部会保持快乐。",
	"Your franchise now includes specific locations located on other planes of existence. These could include such fabled trading locations as Sigil, the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or a githyanki outpost in the Astral Plane. Your license to operate in these regions is not exclusive. Your region on the Material Plane might or might not expand, depending on both your performance and the goals of the campaign. The DM might establish extraplanar locations through play. Failing—or succeeding—in securing an extraplanar location could create interesting and deadly rivalries!": "你的特许经营权现在包括位于其他存在平面上的特定地点。这些地方可能包括传说中的贸易地点，如Sigil，火元素位面的黄铜城，或星界的吉特安基前哨。你在这些地区的经营许可并不具有排他性。你在物质界的区域可能会也可能不会扩张，这取决于你的表现和活动的目标。DM可能通过游戏建立星外地点。失败或成功地获得一个星外地点，可能会产生有趣的、致命的竞争!",

	"{@book Chapter 5|PHB|5|Services} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} details the costs for characters to hire skilled and untrained hirelings. As is true of characters in any campaign, Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees are free to hire any NPCs they want, within whatever limitations the DM wants to set on such employment. But the franchise itself comes with a number of staff whose wages are part of the franchise's cost, providing not only labor but story potential.": "{@book Chapter 5|PHB|5|Services}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}详细说明了角色雇佣熟练和未训练的雇佣者的费用。如同任何战役中的角色一样，收购公司的特许经营人可以自由地雇佣任何他们想要的NPC，在DM想对这种雇佣设置的任何限制范围内。但特许经营权本身也有一些员工，他们的工资是特许经营权成本的一部分，不仅提供了劳动力，还提供了故事的潜力。",
	"Each franchise rank grants a number of new staff members who live in the franchise headquarters or within its geographic scope. The cost of maintaining staff is included in a franchise's costs. Each staff member has a proficiency bonus equal to 2 + the franchise's rank. For skilled hirelings or crew, the DM might substitute NPC statistics when that seems appropriate. Each time a franchise gains a rank, existing staff members can be gifted with early retirement (that is, fired), and replaced alongside new hires that fit the franchise's needs.": "每个特许经营等级都会授予一些居住在特许经营总部或其地理范围内的新工作人员。维持员工的费用包括在加盟店的成本中。每个员工都有一个相当于2+特许权等级的熟练度奖励。对于熟练的雇佣者或工作人员，DM可以在适当的时候用NPC的统计数字来代替。每当特许经营权获得一个等级，现有的工作人员就可以被赠予提前退休（也就是被解雇），并由符合特许经营权需求的新雇员取代。",
	"A franchise might engage all kinds of hirelings and agents over the course of a campaign, but specialized franchise staff fall into four different categories.": "在活动过程中，一个特许经营机构可能会雇用各种雇佣人员和代理人，但专门的特许经营人员可分为四种不同的类型。",
	"An employee is like a friend you pay.": "雇员就像你付出的朋友。",
	"A majordomo administers a franchise headquarters. They typically reside within the headquarters and seldom leave it, sending out communications through a dedicated messenger (at no extra cost, and traveling on foot or by means the franchise provides). A majordomo is proficient in Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) and two skills of the DM's choice.": "主事人负责管理一个特许经营总部。他们通常居住在总部内，很少离开总部，通过专门的信使（不需要额外的费用，步行或乘坐特许经营权提供的交通工具）来发送通信。大领主精通魅力（（%0%））和DM选择的两个技能。",
	"The DM is encouraged to use the rules for creating nonplayer characters in {@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Designing NPCs} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to detail the majordomo, giving this individual a vibrant personality and backstory. The majordomo's goals should be aligned with the franchise and with Acquisitions Incorporated as a whole, allowing them to properly act as an ally and steward for the party.": "我们鼓励DM使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于创建非玩家角色的规则来描述大领主，给这个人一个充满活力的个性和背景故事。大领主的目标应该与特许经营权和收购公司整体保持一致，使他们能够适当地充当党的盟友和管家。",
	"It can be helpful to a campaign to provide the majordomo with a backstory that complements a franchise's evolution over time. A sage might research how the franchise gains new capabilities. Or perhaps the majordomo was the pilot of a vessel capable of planar travel, who slowly applies those features to the headquarters. A majordomo of a franchise modeling itself after a spy organization might constantly invent devices for the franchise, making continuing progress as the party returns with gold, lore, and resources.": "为圣人提供一个背景故事，以补充特许经营权随时间的演变，这对活动是有帮助的。圣人可能会研究特许经营权如何获得新的能力。也可能主子是一艘能够进行平面旅行的船只的驾驶员，他慢慢地将这些功能应用到总部。一个以间谍组织为模型的特许经营权的主要负责人可能会不断为特许经营权发明设备，当党派带着金子、传说和资源回来时，就会不断取得进展。",
	"A franchise's majordomo can take a company position (see the next section) in addition to the positions taken by the characters. Especially with a small party, it can be good to have a majordomo fill a useful position that no character wants to take. No other NPCs can take company positions.": "特许经营的主事人除了担任人物的职务外，还可以担任公司的职务（见下一节）。特别是在一个小团队中，让一个主事人担任一个没有角色愿意担任的有用职位是很好的。其他NPC不能担任公司职位。",
	"As described in the \"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services}\" section in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, untrained hirelings provide general labor, and can function as builders, cleaners, porters, and other workers. Untrained hirelings can work for a franchise or its allies, perhaps tending a garden for a noble family or helping a merchant unload cargo from ships. They will not engage in combat and do not leave the headquarters to join the party on adventures.": "正如《(1%)》第五章的\"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services} \"部分所描述的，未经训练的雇佣兵提供一般的劳动，可以作为建筑工、清洁工、搬运工和其他工人。未经训练的雇佣兵可以为一个专营机构或其盟友工作，也许是为一个贵族家庭打理花园或帮助商人从船上卸货。他们不会参与战斗，也不会离开总部加入党的冒险活动。",
	"The DM should name at least one hireling who acts as a leader for any interactions with groups of untrained laborers. Providing hirelings with a similar background (such as a band of ex-soldiers or reformed criminals) can add personality to the group. Consider using the rules in {@book chapter 4|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, applying the results of a single set of rolls to the entire group. Those hirelings could all shave their heads zealously, be brawny but absentminded, play various musical instruments, use colorful oaths and exclamations, and so on.": "DM应该至少指定一个雇佣者，在与未经训练的劳动者群体的任何互动中充当领导者。提供具有类似背景的雇佣者（比如一队退役士兵或改过自新的罪犯）可以为这个团体增加个性。可以考虑使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的规则，将一组卷轴的结果应用于整个团体。那些雇工都可以热心地剃光头，身强力壮但心不在焉，会演奏各种乐器，使用丰富多彩的誓言和感叹词，等等。",
	"Group ideals, bonds, and flaws, along with a shared history, can all add depth to a group of untrained hirelings. Those musicians might be connected by the ideal of tradition, and bound to the franchise to protect a cultural heirloom they value above all else. Their flaw and secret could be that they stole the heirloom from their former employer, a rival merchant organization. Over time, the same hirelings might show up as part of the characters' adventures time and time again, revealing aspects of their past and creating story continuity.": "团体的理想、纽带和缺陷，以及共同的历史，都可以为一群未经训练的雇佣者增加深度。那些音乐家可能被传统的理想所联系，并被约束在保护他们最重视的文化传家宝的特许经营权上。他们的缺陷和秘密可能是他们从他们的前雇主--一个敌对的商人组织--那里偷来了这个传家宝。随着时间的推移，同样的雇工可能会一次又一次地出现在人物的冒险中，揭示他们的过去，创造故事的连续性。",
	"What the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} calls untrained hirelings are often referred to as \"subemployees\" within an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, while skilled hirelings typically gain the more prestigious title of \"intern.\" It's entirely up to individual franchisees what awesome titles they bestow upon their staff members in addition to (or, indeed, in lieu of) perks such as an occasional wage.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}所说的未经训练的雇佣者在收购公司的特许经营中通常被称为 \"次级雇员\"，而熟练的雇佣者通常获得 \"实习生 \"这一更有声望的称号。除了偶尔的工资等福利外，他们赋予员工什么了不起的头衔（或者，事实上，代替了），完全取决于各个加盟商。",
	"A skilled hireling has one or more skill, weapon, or tool proficiencies. A franchise can request skilled hirelings when needed (up to the maximum allowed by franchise rank), with the players describing the concept behind the hirelings and selecting one proficiency for each. The DM can then customize the hirelings as desired, perhaps by adding additional proficiencies or adjusting their combat statistics.": "一个熟练的雇佣兵有一个或多个技能、武器或工具的熟练度。当需要的时候，一个特许经营商可以申请熟练的雇佣兵（在特许经营商等级允许的最大限度内），由玩家描述雇佣兵的概念，并为每个雇佣兵选择一种熟练度。然后，管理员可以根据需要定制雇佣兵，也许可以增加额外的熟练度或调整他们的战斗统计。",
	"Skilled hirelings can be fired and hired as needed. A franchise might bring on a couple of thugs to act as distraction during a street fair, then release those NPCs to hire a different set of skilled hirelings to conduct franchise tasks and downtime activities.": "熟练的雇佣者可以根据需要被解雇和雇佣。一个特许经营商可能会在一个街头集市上雇佣几个打手来分散注意力，然后释放这些NPC来雇佣不同的熟练雇工来执行特许经营任务和休息时间的活动。",
	"Hirelings cannot perform more than one task at a time. A full complement of skilled hirelings assisting the party on a mission precludes other skilled hirelings from helping with franchise tasks and downtime activities until the mission is completed. As with untrained hirelings, detailing a group background and assigning personality characteristics to a group leader can make for a fun play experience.": "雇佣兵不能同时执行一个以上的任务。如果一个熟练的雇佣兵在任务中协助团队，那么在任务完成之前，其他熟练的雇佣兵就不能帮助完成特许任务和休息时间的活动。与未经训练的雇佣兵一样，详细描述一个团体的背景并为一个团体的领导者分配个性特征可以带来有趣的游戏体验。",
	"Characters can adventure with up to one skilled hireling at a time. An NPC with a challenge rating of roughly half the franchise rank works well for most adventures, providing utility without disrupting balance. The loyalty system described in {@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} can be used to determine whether the hireling remains dedicated to the party's goals, or the DM can make that decision on the basis of how the adventure plays out and the characters' attitude toward the adventuring NPC.": "角色每次最多可以和一个熟练的雇佣者一起冒险。一个挑战等级大约为特许权等级一半的NPC对大多数冒险来说都很有效，在不破坏平衡的情况下提供效用。{@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty}中描述的忠诚度系统可以用来决定雇佣者是否仍然致力于党的目标，或者DM可以根据冒险的发展情况和角色对冒险NPC的态度来做出决定。",
	"Skilled hirelings can also be assigned to franchise tasks, as described in the \"Franchise Tasks and Downtime\" section later in this chapter.": "熟练的雇工也可以被分配到特许经营任务中，如本章后面的 \"特许经营任务和停工 \"部分所述。",
	"Hirelings are kindling in the fire of opportunity!": "雇工是机会之火中的火种!",
	"Crew are skilled hirelings trained in tasks pertaining to the physical maintenance of a franchise (for example, servers or gardeners) or the navigation of a mobile headquarters (sailors for a seagoing franchise, engineers for a giant hollow statue, and so on). Crew do not leave a franchise and cannot perform franchise tasks. They typically run rather than fight back when attacked, though the DM can decide otherwise. If a mobile franchise headquarters requires more crew than is granted by the franchise's rank, the characters must hire the remainder (typically at the skilled hireling cost of 2 gp per day).": "船员是受过训练的熟练雇工，他们的任务是与专营店的物理维护（例如，服务器或园丁）或移动总部的导航（航海专营店的水手，巨大空心雕像的工程师，等等）有关。船员不会离开专营店，也不能执行专营店的任务。在受到攻击时，他们通常会逃跑而不是反击，不过DM可以决定不这样做。如果一个移动的特许经营总部需要比特许经营等级所赋予的更多的船员，那么人物必须雇用剩余的船员（通常以每天2戈比的熟练雇工费用）。",
	"Hiring crew can become a cooperative roleplaying activity. Potential crew might hear of Acquisitions Incorporated or the party's exploits and come to interview with the franchisees. Choices might be offered by the DM, as between a team of ex-militia who lost their last battle and a crew of recently released criminals who swear they were wrongly imprisoned. Names, personalities, and roles can be assigned to crew by the DM and the players. Rather than simply interacting with the cook and the first mate, the characters can instead deal with Pepper, the chef who loves spicy foods, and Brazen, the veteran sailor who always talks back, creating the potential for entertaining interactions as the franchise grows.": "雇用船员可以成为一种合作性的角色扮演活动。潜在的船员可能会听说收购公司或党的探索，并前来与特许经营人面谈。DM可以提供一些选择，比如在一队上次战败的前民兵和一队最近被释放的、发誓说自己被错误监禁的罪犯之间选择。名字、性格和角色可以由DM和玩家分配给船员。角色不是简单地与厨师和大副互动，而是可以与喜欢吃辣的厨师Pepper和总是顶嘴的老水手Brazen打交道，随着特许经营权的增加，创造出有趣的互动潜力。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office provides the members of each franchise with a place to call their own. It might not be initially impressive (cleaning any old blood stains is the franchisees' responsibility). But over time, characters in an Acq Inc campaign are granted resources to help construct the headquarters of their dreams! Each franchise rank affords the characters a number of choices, allowing customization and creativity. Sample features are provided as guidelines, but a franchise's features can include literally anything decided on and agreed to by the players and the DM.": "收购公司总部为每个加盟店的成员提供一个属于他们自己的地方。它最初可能并不引人注目（清理任何旧的血迹是加盟商的责任）。但随着时间的推移，Acq Inc活动中的人物会获得资源，以帮助建造他们梦想中的总部 每个特许经营等级都为角色提供了许多选择，允许定制和创造。我们提供了一些特征样本作为指导，但一个特许经营权的特征可以包括由玩家和管理员决定和同意的任何东西。",
	"When selecting a feature, the characters must make decisions together—meaning the players must do the same. Deciding on the features of a headquarters should be a team effort, both in game and around the table. What should a headquarters look like initially? Do the characters prefer to travel by land or by sea, or to operate from a fixed location? Is a ruined keep more interesting than an old vine-covered wizard's tower in the woods? Is the headquarters remote or within a settlement—perhaps an old tavern or caravansary the characters can restore?": "在选择特征时，人物必须共同做出决定--也就是说，玩家也必须这样做。决定总部的特征应该是一个团队的努力，无论是在游戏中还是在餐桌上。总部最初应该是什么样子的？角色们喜欢从陆地或海上旅行，还是从一个固定的地点行动？一个被毁坏的堡垒是否比森林中被藤蔓覆盖的老巫师塔更有趣？总部是在偏远地区还是在一个定居点内--也许是一个古老的小酒馆或商队，角色可以修复？",
	"It can be helpful to think ahead as well. Acquisitions Incorporated is known for mobile franchises, helping to bring goods and adventuring services to distant locations. When a franchise headquarters becomes mobile, will it fly or sail? Will it gain the power to teleport across the land? Will it sprout legs and walk?": "提前思考也会有帮助。收购公司以移动特许经营而闻名，帮助把货物和冒险服务带到遥远的地方。当一个特许经营总部成为移动的时候，它将飞翔还是航行？它是否会获得在陆地上传送的能力？它是否会长出腿来走路？",
	"Everything depends on the type of headquarters. The top of a wizard's tower might detach and shoot skyward like a missile. Or a franchise's headquarters might be contained within a giant statue, which over time gains the power to move farther and faster. A castle or other stationary structure could contain a portal or teleportation circle, allowing the characters to travel to distant locations while the stronghold remains behind.": "一切都取决于总部的类型。巫师的塔顶可能会分离出来，像导弹一样射向天空。或者一个特许经营的总部可能包含在一个巨大的雕像中，随着时间的推移，雕像会获得更远更快的移动能力。城堡或其他固定的结构可以包含一个传送门或传送圈，允许人物前往遥远的地方，而据点却留在后面。",
	"There are a lot of perks to being an intern that people overlook. The hours are very flexible, you get a 20 percent discount in the gift shop, you get a bathroom break every four hours as long as you ask your supervisor first. And sometimes if you go into the conference room after a meeting, there will be a bunch of soda and leftover subs. You can just take as much as you want! As long as nobody sees you.": "作为一名实习生，有很多人们忽视的好处。工作时间非常灵活，你在礼品店可以得到20%的折扣，只要你先问一下你的主管，每四小时就有一次卫生间休息。有时，如果你在会议结束后进入会议室，会有一堆苏打水和吃剩的潜艇。你可以想吃多少就吃多少! 只要没有人看到你。",
	"The characters' collective skill proficiencies, tool proficiencies, backgrounds, and positions within their franchise could all impact the design and construction of a headquarters. A glassblower might make beautiful stained-glass windows, while a herbalist fills the headquarters with pleasing or mysterious scents. An acolyte could outfit a small area of the headquarters as a chapel, while a sage sources a unique desk at which to work. Such features are cosmetic or limited in impact, but enable players to feel more interested and invested in their headquarters.": "角色的集体技能熟练度、工具熟练度、背景以及在其特许经营范围内的地位都可能影响总部的设计和建造。一个玻璃工可能会制作漂亮的彩色玻璃窗，而一个草药师则会让总部充满令人愉悦或神秘的气味。圣徒可以把总部的一小块地方布置成小教堂，而圣人则可以找到一张独特的办公桌来工作。这些功能是外观上的，或影响有限，但能使玩家对他们的总部感到更有兴趣和投入。",
	"Each franchise's starter headquarters is a mundane site, which has often been selected or handed down by Acquisitions Incorporated. The characters' initial base of operations could be a ruined tower, a worn horse-drawn carriage, a beat-up fishing boat, a dilapidated store or farm, or any similar structure or site. The DM might direct the characters toward a single ideal location, or might provide a range of options for players and characters to choose from. And of course, many potential franchise locations will have an interesting past—a haunted mansion, a mysterious lighthouse, an old wizard's tower filled with malfunctioning magic, and so forth.": "每个特许经营权的启动总部都是一个平凡的地方，通常是由收购公司选择或传授的。角色最初的行动基地可以是一座破败的塔楼、一辆破旧的马车、一艘破旧的渔船、一个破旧的商店或农场，或任何类似的结构或地点。管理员可能会将角色引向一个理想的地点，也可能提供一系列的选择供玩家和角色选择。当然，许多潜在的特许经营地点都会有一个有趣的过去--一座闹鬼的豪宅、一座神秘的灯塔、一座充满故障魔法的老巫师塔，等等。",
	"The DM approves the headquarters concept and decides how large or small the initial structure can be, as well as any useful features. DMs and players can work together to create a map of the headquarters and its surroundings. {@book Chapter 5|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} can help detail both wilderness and urban locations.": "DM批准总部的概念，并决定初始结构的大小，以及任何有用的功能。DM和玩家可以共同创建一张总部及其周围环境的地图。{@book Chapter 5|DMG|-1}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}可以帮助详细说明荒野和城市的位置。",
	"Whenever characters are in residence at their franchise headquarters, they can automatically benefit from a minimum lifestyle—poor at rank 1, modest at rank 2, comfortable at rank 3, and wealthy at rank 4. The normal costs associated with that lifestyle for franchisees and select staff are subsumed within the overall cost of running the franchise. Outside the franchise headquarters, normal lifestyle expenses apply.": "每当人物居住在他们的特许经营总部时，他们可以自动受益于最低限度的生活方式--等级1为贫困，等级2为适度，等级3为舒适，等级4为富裕。与这种生活方式相关的加盟商和特定员工的正常费用被归入经营加盟店的总成本中。在特许经营总部之外，正常的生活方式费用适用。",
	"Many franchisees will use their starter headquarters as a point for expansion, adding new features, new rooms, new levels—and, of course, new magic as the franchise grows in rank. Other campaigns might be better served by having the franchise change headquarters at different stages. Characters might start out in a ship, then move to a castle, then take possession of a unique magical headquarters in the end. Any potential headquarters site might be discovered by the characters as part of the campaign, or sites might be suggested or allocated by Head Office.": "许多加盟商会把启动总部作为一个扩张点，增加新的功能、新的房间、新的级别--当然，随着加盟店等级的增长，还会有新的魔法。其他的活动可能会在不同的阶段让特许经营权更换总部，这样做效果更好。角色可以从一艘船开始，然后转移到一座城堡，最后拥有一个独特的魔法总部。任何潜在的总部地点都可以由人物在活动中发现，或者由总部建议或分配。",
	"Any of the following suggestions can make a great starter headquarters, or can provide inspiration for other headquarters features.": "以下任何建议都可以成为一个伟大的启动总部，或者可以为其他总部的功能提供灵感。",
	"Raided by orcs who left no one alive? Those are probably just stories. And even if true, the orcs won't come back (probably). This abandoned lighthouse headquarters is strong enough to stand against any storm (probably), and many of the leaks have been fixed already. And just look at that cool light up top, and the oversized storage cellar. Docks close by are perfect for a starter franchise that comes into possession of a boat, and are also a sign of the lighthouse's importance to coastal trade. Commandeering it will likely win over the locals and maybe even the region's royalty!": "被兽人突袭，没有人活着？这些可能只是故事。即使是真的，兽人也不会再来了（可能）。这个废弃的灯塔总部足够坚固，可以抵御任何风暴（可能），而且许多漏水处已经被修复。再看看上面那盏很酷的灯，还有超大的储藏室。附近的码头很适合拥有船只的初创企业，这也是灯塔对沿海贸易的重要性的标志。征用它很可能会赢得当地人，甚至是该地区的皇室成员的青睐！\"。",
	"Any franchise can take to the seas in this new (okay, very used) {@vehicle keelboat}! Pirates killed the previous owners, and Head Office picked it up for an excellent price. Most of the holes in the hull are repaired, and the sails are only a little bit moldy. Even better, there's a small covered area in the rear protected from the elements that makes a perfect living space! The keelboat holds a half-ton of cargo, and might even come with reduced docking fees at some ports of call.": "任何加盟商都可以开着这艘新的（好吧，很旧的）（%0%）出海! 海盗杀死了以前的主人，总部以一个很好的价格把它买了下来。船体上的大部分洞都被修复了，而船帆也只是有点发霉。更妙的是，在后部有一个小的有盖区域，免受外界影响，是一个完美的生活空间! 这艘龙骨船可以容纳半吨货物，甚至可能在一些港口减免停靠费。",
	"Statistics for a standard {@vehicle keelboat} are found in {@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles|DMG|chapter 5} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The DM might adjust the number of people the boat can comfortably carry, but having such a headquarters typically implies that most franchise staff are itinerant or live elsewhere in whatever settlement is the boat's primary port of call.": "一个标准的{@vehicle keelboat}的统计数据可以在{@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles|DMG|chapter 5}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中找到。DM可能会调整该船可舒适承载的人数，但拥有这样一个总部通常意味着大多数特许经营人员是流动的，或者住在其他地方，无论该船的主要停靠港是什么定居点。",
	"I don't have rivals. I have partners who simply don't know it yet.": "我没有对手。我有伙伴，只是他们还不知道而已。",
	"With just a little work and some better furniture, this place could be the talk of the town. The tavern is certainly not haunted. Seriously, no one listens to those rumors. But if it were, and if the story was spun the right way, the marketing potential could be huge. Some even say that the ghosts (which totally don't exist) like to sing, so that's a plus! The kitchen is already stocked with plates, mugs, and lots of knives, and a few rooms upstairs are ready to rent out to travelers.": "只要稍加修整，加上一些更好的家具，这个地方就能成为镇上的话题。这家酒馆当然不会闹鬼。说真的，没有人听那些传言。但是，如果是这样，如果故事被正确地传播，其营销潜力可能是巨大的。有些人甚至说，鬼魂（完全不存在）喜欢唱歌，所以这是一个加分项。厨房里已经放好了盘子、杯子和很多刀子，楼上的几个房间已经准备好出租给旅行者。",
	"This humble, worn carriage, previously owned by a now-defunct trading company, makes a perfect starter headquarters. The carriage's exterior is weathered wood, and the interior seats and cushions have seen better days. Still, it offers all the perks of home plus the ability to change the neighbors every time you take to the road.": "这辆简陋、破旧的马车，以前由一家现已倒闭的贸易公司拥有，是一个完美的启动总部。马车的外表是风化的木头，内部的座椅和坐垫也已经过了好几天。尽管如此，它仍然提供了家庭的所有好处，而且每次上路都能改变邻居的身份。",
	"The rear of the carriage features a generous cargo space for up to 500 pounds of goods, and is protected from the weather. The horses are hardworking and love apples. The carriage has AC 11 and 75 hit points, and moves at the speed of its {@creature Draft Horse||draft horses} (40 feet). Four passengers can ride inside, two up front with one steering, and two atop the rear cargo area. Up to three people can also sit on the roof of the cabin, for an especially exciting perch when the cart is moving quickly!": "马车的后部有一个宽敞的货物空间，可容纳500磅的货物，并且可以避开天气。马匹很勤劳，喜欢吃苹果。马车的AC值为11，命中率为75，移动速度为其（%0%）（40英尺）。里面可以坐四个人，两个人在前面，一个人掌舵，两个人在后面的货物区上面。最多三个人也可以坐在车厢顶上，当马车快速移动时，可以有一个特别刺激的栖息地!",
	"Because this sort of franchise typically can't hold the characters and all their staff (at least not comfortably), such staff are often itinerant or based in whatever settlement the carriage returns to most often.": "因为这种特许经营通常无法容纳人物和他们所有的工作人员（至少不舒服），所以这种工作人员往往是流动的，或者驻扎在马车最常返回的任何定居点。",
	"A cosmetic improvement, gained at franchise rank 2, allows a franchise to radically alter the look and feel of its headquarters. A beat-up wagon could become a gilded carriage, with luxurious interiors and servants dressed in matching finery. A tavern could proudly display the party's kills in the drinking hall, feature mugs gathered from dwarven holds around Faerûn, and have decor matching a particular theme.": "在特许经营等级2级时获得的外观改进，允许特许经营权从根本上改变其总部的外观和感觉。一辆破旧的马车可以变成一辆镀金的马车，有豪华的内饰和穿戴整齐的仆人。一家酒馆可以在饮酒大厅里自豪地展示党的杀戮，以从法鲁恩附近的矮人仓库收集的杯子为特色，并有符合特定主题的装饰。",
	"Improvements can also be of a fantastic or magical nature, such as flickering magical torches or portraits that watch and interact with observers. The DM has final approval over such improvements, and is the arbiter as to whether cosmetic improvements might provide any actual benefits during play. When allowed, such benefits should be situational and limited. A foe might become distracted the first time a ghostly figure appears in a haunted tavern, but the quality of the illusion is such that it doesn't stand up to continued scrutiny.": "改进也可以是梦幻般的或魔法性质的，例如闪烁的魔法火把或能观察并与观察者互动的肖像。DM拥有对此类改进的最终批准权，并且在游戏过程中，外观改进是否会提供任何实际的好处，他是仲裁者。在允许的情况下，这种好处应该是情景性的和有限的。敌人可能会在幽灵般的人物第一次出现在闹鬼的酒馆里时分心，但这种幻觉的质量是经不起继续审查的。",
	"Cosmetic effects can also be focused on selling and branding a franchise, such as adding manufacturing capabilities, a light-up sign, a customer showroom or service center, and other commercial features. At the DM's discretion, such features might generate additional income or lower the costs of certain franchise tasks.": "美容效果也可以集中在销售和品牌的特许经营上，如增加制造能力、发光标志、客户展示厅或服务中心，以及其他商业功能。由DM决定，这些特征可能会产生额外的收入或降低某些特许经营任务的成本。",
	"This once-innocuous seagoing vessel has been detailed to appear as a brass dragon. The ship's interior is decorated in draconic art, and platforms among the rigging are linked by silk ropes attached to pulleys. These might provide benefits to crew trained in their use if the ship is ever attacked.": "这艘曾经毫不起眼的海船已经被细化为一条铜龙。船的内部装饰有龙的艺术，索具中的平台由连接在滑轮上的丝绳连接。如果这艘船受到攻击，这些东西可能会给受过训练的船员带来好处。",
	"In the entrance hall of a former-wizard's-tower headquarters, enchanted portraits display visages of the franchise's recently vanquished foes. Smaller portraits throughout the tower display important moments in the franchise's adventuring history, and the whole interior is set with magical lighting, decorated with candelabra, and features drapes and carpets matching the franchise's chosen motif.": "在一个前巫师塔总部的入口大厅里，被施了魔法的画像显示了特许经营项目最近被征服的敌人的形象。整个塔内较小的画像显示了特许经营历史上的重要时刻，整个内部设置了神奇的灯光，用烛台装饰，并配有符合特许经营所选主题的窗帘和地毯。",
	"At rank 2, an expansion feature allows a franchise to double the size of its headquarters. When doing so, players and characters can define the changes to the current configuration. Perhaps the headquarters expands in size laterally, or gains an extra floor. Perhaps a new basement is excavated—or poking around the existing basement reveals a secret level of dungeons heretofore unknown.": "在等级2，扩张功能允许特许经营权将其总部的规模扩大一倍。当这样做时，玩家和角色可以定义当前配置的变化。也许总部的面积会横向扩大，或者增加一个楼层。也许开凿了一个新的地下室，或者在现有的地下室周围探查，发现了以前不为人知的地下城的秘密层。",
	"Franchise members can decide on what features are involved in the expansion, including new windows, doors, and furniture. Adding certain types of space might also call for extra supporting features. If storage is on an upper floor, a winch might be installed to lift goods. A cellar could add another exit and an area for storing wine or alchemical supplies. Or a carriage headquarters could gain a second cart to become a wagon train.": "特许经营成员可以决定扩建涉及哪些功能，包括新窗户、门和家具。增加某些类型的空间也可能需要额外的支持功能。如果存储在上层，可能会安装一个绞盘来提升货物。一个地窖可以增加另一个出口和一个储存葡萄酒或炼金用品的区域。或者一个马车总部可以获得第二辆马车，成为一列马车。",
	"All construction is low cost but functional, as in the following examples.": "所有的建筑都是低成本的，但功能齐全，如以下例子。",
	"The lighthouse is now taller, with two additional levels, an upgraded beacon, and a stronger exterior. A stairway leads down into a network of old caverns, including some used as storage space, and finally onto a small beach with a dock.": "现在的灯塔更高了，增加了两层，升级了灯塔，外观也更坚固了。一条楼梯通向一个古老的洞穴网络，包括一些用作储存空间的洞穴，最后到达一个有码头的小海滩。",
	"The building adjacent to the tavern has been bought out and connected to it, allowing for more guest chambers, a larger common room, a larger kitchen, and staff quarters. A large fireplace fills the common room with light and warmth, while new tables and chairs create a welcome environment. Guest chambers might feature a patio or balcony.": "与酒馆相邻的建筑已被买下，并与之相连，从而有了更多的客室，一个更大的公共房间，一个更大的厨房，以及员工宿舍。一个大的壁炉使公共房间充满了光线和温暖，而新的桌子和椅子创造了一个受欢迎的环境。宾客室可能有一个天井或阳台。",
	"Also at rank 2, every franchise gains some form of mobility, with players and DM working together to determine how a headquarters facilitates travel (or expands on its normal travel modes) from one location to another. A ship might gain a magic sail, or could add a balloon to become a battle balloon airship. A hollow statue could gain the ability to stride across the landscape. A wizard's tower might teleport from place to place. Or doors within a tavern could be revealed as a magical portal connected to various locations in far-flung lands.": "同样在等级2，每个特许经营权都会获得某种形式的流动性，玩家和DM共同决定总部如何促进从一个地方到另一个地方的旅行（或在其正常的旅行模式上进行扩展）。一艘船可能会获得一个魔法帆，或者可以增加一个气球，成为一个战斗气球飞艇。一座空心雕像可以获得在景观上大步流星的能力。一座巫师的塔可能会从一个地方传送到另一个地方。或者酒馆里的门可以显示为一个神奇的入口，连接到遥远的土地上的各个地方。",
	"The DM has final approval over the method of locomotion, and can put in place any reasonable limitations or constraints on that movement. Additionally, any method of movement should have a weakness or drawback determined by the DM. As a rule of thumb, a mobile headquarters can travel a distance of 30 miles per day (equivalent to a fast travel pace) per franchise rank. This rate of travel can vary depending on weather, visibility, availability of maps, or other conditions.": "管理部对运动方法有最终批准权，并可以对该运动设置任何合理的限制或约束。此外，任何运动方法都应该有一个由军需官确定的弱点或缺点。作为一个经验法则，一个移动总部每天可以走30英里的距离（相当于快速旅行的速度），每一个特许等级。这个旅行速度可以根据天气、能见度、地图的可用性或其他条件而变化。",
	"A 100-foot-tall stone statue has stairs and rooms carved within its interior. When a character sits at the helm located in a room within the statue's head, the statue can be directed to walk across the land. The statue ignores difficult terrain, usually by simply crashing through it. However, the navigator has a limited sight line while peering out through the statue's large eyes. When the terrain is cluttered or subject to combat conditions, it can be hard to avoid creatures or objects smaller than a large building.": "一座100英尺高的石雕内部刻有楼梯和房间。当一个角色坐在位于石像头部的房间里的舵手处时，可以指挥石像在陆地上行走。雕像无视困难的地形，通常会简单地撞开它。然而，导航员通过雕像的大眼睛向外看时，视线有限。当地形杂乱或受到战斗条件的影响时，就很难避开比大型建筑更小的生物或物体。",
	"A good idea is to swim in the wake of an existing business. Somebody else did the market research and decided this was a good location? Awesome! Now use that decision against them. Set up direct competition. Then spread rumors about them until they're forced to leave the area in shame. Now the market is yours. That's how you business.": "一个好的想法是在现有企业的后面游走。有人做了市场调查并决定这是一个好地方？厉害啊! 现在利用这个决定来对付他们。建立直接竞争。然后散布关于他们的谣言，直到他们被迫羞愧地离开这个地区。现在市场是你的了。这就是你做生意的方式。",
	"A hot air balloon is lit by a magic furnace channeling elemental power. A galleon suspended below the balloon features a helm that controls the ship. The vessel can fly virtually anywhere, ignoring difficult terrain, but it is at risk from storms and strong winds. If the balloon takes significant damage, the ship could be forced to descend—or might even crash.": "一个热气球被一个引导元素力量的魔法炉点燃。悬挂在热气球下面的大帆船有一个控制船只的舵。这艘船几乎可以飞到任何地方，无视困难的地形，但它面临着暴风雨和强风的风险。如果气球受到重大损害，这艘船可能被迫下降，甚至可能坠毁。",
	"({@book Appendix C|AI|12} features vehicle statistics for a typical battle balloon. For characters who choose this highly coveted feature for their headquarters, the DM can impose limitations on the ship's attacks and make changes to its statistics.)": "({@book Appendix C|AI|12}特点是典型的战斗气球的车辆统计。对于那些为他们的总部选择这种令人羡慕的功能的角色，DM可以对该船的攻击施加限制，并对其统计数字进行修改)。",
	"This mobile franchise headquarters features a magical-mechanical locomotive that lays down its own track. Mechanical arms at the front of the locomotive set down crossbars and rails in front of the headquarters at ridiculous speed, while arms at the back of the headquarters pick up the track as it passes. The train moves at quarter speed over difficult terrain (instead of half speed). It can pass over rivers, but cannot cross lakes or large bodies of water.": "这个移动的特许经营总部有一个神奇的机械火车头，可以铺设自己的轨道。机车前面的机械臂以惊人的速度在总部前面放下横杆和铁轨，而总部后面的机械臂则在它经过时拾起轨道。火车在困难的地形上以四分之一的速度移动（而不是半速）。它可以通过河流，但不能跨越湖泊或大型水体。",
	"A seemingly simple wagon drawn by an old horse channels powerful magic. The wagon's driver can cause the wagon to teleport the distance of a day's journey, targeting a known location over the course of one or more extradimensional jumps. Such teleportation is usually done when no one is looking, to avoid arousing suspicion or frightening the locals. Though the wagon eventually arrives at the intended destination, the intervening stop-off points are unknown—and quite possibly perilous.": "一辆由老马拉着的看似简单的马车，却拥有强大的魔法。马车夫可以使马车传送一天的路程，在一次或多次超空间跳跃的过程中瞄准一个已知地点。这种传送通常是在无人注意的情况下进行的，以避免引起怀疑或惊吓到当地人。虽然马车最终到达了预定的目的地，但中间的停留点是未知的，而且很可能是危险的。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons offers a wide range of play styles, and works with many different types of campaign story. The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} talks about some of the most common types of fantasy that can shape a D&D campaign, including a general sense of campaigns being high magic, low magic, or the D&D standard in between.": "龙与地下城》提供了广泛的游戏风格，并与许多不同类型的战役故事配合。{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}谈到了一些可以塑造D&D活动的最常见的幻想类型，包括一般意义上的活动是高魔法、低魔法或介于两者之间的D&D标准。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has its own distinct feel, as talked about in {@book chapter 1|AI|0} of this book. Part of that feel comes from the substantial benefits that characters gain from franchise features and company positions—mechanical boons, magic items, access to powerful spell effects, and more. These benefits are gained automatically, as a general reward for the characters' adventuring success driving franchise advancement. So it's important that everyone is aware how adding those built-in campaign benefits to the regular magic gained during adventuring will give the characters a boost in power.": "正如本书{@book chapter 1|AI|0}中所谈到的，一个收购公司的活动有其独特的感觉。这种感觉部分来自于角色从特许经营功能和公司职位中获得的大量好处--机械恩赐、魔法物品、获得强大的法术效果，等等。这些好处是自动获得的，作为对人物冒险成功推动特许经营权发展的一般奖励。因此，重要的是，每个人都要知道在冒险过程中获得的常规魔法中加入这些内置的活动福利将如何给角色带来力量上的提升。",
	"For an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign meant to feel and play like standard D&D, the DM should consider creating a low-magic campaign, and letting the benefits of company positions and franchise features fill in the magical gaps. A standard campaign played with the rules in this book should be treated as a high magic campaign, with the DM and the players understanding that the difficulty of encounters and other tasks might need to be ramped up to offer a real challenge to the characters. Of course, nothing prevents anyone from playing a high magic campaign with the Acquisitions Incorporated rules. But DMs and players should all be aware that doing so will create extremely powerful characters—who will no doubt attract extremely powerful enemies and threats as a matter of course.": "对于一个旨在让人感觉和玩起来像标准D&D的收购公司战役来说，DM应该考虑创建一个低魔法战役，并让公司职位和特许经营功能的好处来填补魔法方面的空白。使用本书中的规则进行的标准战役应该被视为高魔法战役，DM和玩家应该明白，遭遇战和其他任务的难度可能需要提高，以给角色带来真正的挑战。当然，没有什么能阻止任何人用 \"收购公司 \"的规则来玩一个高魔法活动。但是，管理员和玩家都应该意识到，这样做会创造出极其强大的角色--毫无疑问，他们会理所当然地吸引极其强大的敌人和威胁。",
	"At rank 2, the members of a franchise can add a weapon to their headquarters, choosing from the options in the \"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment}\" section of chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The DM can limit those options or change the details of specific choices, and players can also design unique offensive features, subject to approval by the DM. For example, a walking statue that strikes with a fist could be treated as a ram—or the DM and the players might agree that it would be fun to use some of the effects of {@spell Bigby's hand} for such an attack.": "在等级2时，专营权的成员可以为他们的总部增加一种武器，从{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第八章的\"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment} \"部分的选项中选择。DM可以限制这些选项或改变具体选择的细节，玩家也可以设计独特的进攻功能，但要得到DM的批准。例如，一个用拳头击打的行走的雕像可以被当作公羊--或者DM和玩家可能会同意在这样的攻击中使用（%%2%）的一些效果会很有趣。",
	"Most siege weapons (whether mechanical or magical) require two characters, crew, or skilled hirelings to operate, and such weapons might be slow to reload or recharge. Headquarters weapons are not particularly effective against small bands of creatures (such as a group of goblins), but they can be useful against a single large threat (such as a dragon). If siege weapons are abused by franchisees, they might be targeted by enemies, break down, or require costly maintenance each time they are employed in battle.": "大多数攻城武器（无论是机械的还是魔法的）都需要两个人物、船员或熟练的雇工来操作，而且这种武器的装填或充能速度可能很慢。总部武器对小股生物（如一群哥布林）不是特别有效，但对单一的大型威胁（如龙）却很有用。如果攻城武器被加盟者滥用，它们可能会被敌人盯上，发生故障，或者每次在战斗中使用时都需要昂贵的维护。",
	"A giant hollow metal statue acting as a franchise headquarters features a control center from which the statue's arms can be manipulated. One fist can be used per round to strike at foes, using statistics similar to a ram (AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).": "一个巨大的空心金属雕像充当特许经营总部，它有一个控制中心，雕像的手臂可以被操纵。每轮可以使用一个拳头来攻击敌人，使用类似于公羊的统计数据（AC15，100点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one object or creature. {@i Hit}: 16 ({@dice 3d10}) bludgeoning damage.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+8，范围15英尺，一个物体或生物。{@i Hit}: 16 ({@dice 3d10})重击伤害。",
	"Magical power can be focused through a lighthouse beacon, requiring 1 round to gather energy and aim. The following round, the energy can be released. The beacon has AC 12, 75 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to cold. The explosion of energy can be treated as a {@spell scorching ray}, {@spell fireball}, or {@spell lightning bolt} spell, as the DM determines. More powerful features might require more time to recharge, or could be usable only a certain number of times per day. Such attacks might function at longer range but be unable to target creatures or objects within 60 feet of the lighthouse.": "魔法力量可以通过灯塔灯塔来集中，需要1轮来收集能量和瞄准。下一回合，能量可以被释放。灯塔有AC12，75点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫，对寒冷易感。能量的爆发可以被视为{@spell scorching ray}、{@spell fireball}或{@spell lightning bolt}的法术，由DM决定。更强大的功能可能需要更多的时间来充能，或者每天只能使用一定数量的次数。这样的攻击可能在更远的范围内发挥作用，但无法针对灯塔周围60英尺内的生物或物体。",
	"At rank 3, an arcane feature provides a unique magical capability to a headquarters. A haunted headquarters might gain a permanent cohort of friendly undead servants, while a giant statue headquarters could gain the ability to allow the characters to see at great distances and through darkness or fog. A more generic arcane feature could instead grant any franchisee the ability to cast a specific spell of 6th level or lower, with a limitation of one casting per day.": "在等级3中，一个奥术特征为总部提供了一种独特的魔法能力。一个闹鬼的总部可能会获得一个永久的友好的不死仆从队伍，而一个巨大的雕像总部可能会获得让人物在很远的地方以及在黑暗或雾中看到的能力。一个更通用的奥术特征可以赋予任何加盟者施放6级或更低的特定法术的能力，但每天有一次施放的限制。",
	"An arcane feature should be something that doesn't fit within another category (specifically, a transportation or weapon feature), though the DM is the final judge of what arcane features are acceptable.": "奥术特征应该是不适合其他类别的东西（特别是运输或武器特征），尽管DM是哪些奥术特征可以接受的最终判断者。",
	"Money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral—an impossible task. When Head Office comes knocking, tell them that money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral.": "金钱是一种试图使短暂的东西隐蔽化的尝试，这是一项不可能完成的任务。当总部来敲门时，告诉他们，钱是一种试图使短暂的东西不被发现的尝试。",
	"Whether an oceangoing vessel or an airship, this headquarters can alter its appearance with illusion magic. Additionally, the appearance of some or all creatures aboard can be changed as if they were affected by a {@spell seeming} spell. Franchisees can alter the appearance of the ship and its occupants a number of times per day, or can drop the illusory effects as needs be. The nature of the illusion magic means that the ship's size and features do not change, and individuals interacting with the ship or investigating its appearance have a chance to see the true form of the ship and its crew.": "无论是远洋船还是飞艇，这个总部都可以用幻觉魔法改变其外观。此外，船上的部分或所有生物的外观可以被改变，就像他们被一个（%0%）的法术影响一样。特许经营人每天可以改变飞船及其乘员的外观若干次，也可以根据需要放弃虚幻效果。幻象魔法的性质意味着这艘船的大小和特征不会改变，与这艘船互动或调查其外观的人有机会看到这艘船和其船员的真实形态。",
	"A tavern headquarters (which already has a cosmetic feature to make it appear haunted) now gains spectral wait staff. The spectral staff serve customers expertly, and speak and understand speech as if intelligent. However, they are magical creations similar to those conjured by the {@spell unseen servant} spell, able to perform all the functions of such a creation and any other functions agreed to by the DM. Spectral staff can momentarily become insubstantial, along with anything they carry, allowing them to serve food and drink through walls. Any member of the franchise can spend an action to telepathically command one or more spectral staff members.": "一个酒馆总部（已经有一个外观特征，使其看起来像闹鬼）现在获得了幽灵服务员。幽灵服务员能熟练地为顾客服务，并能像聪明人一样说话和理解讲话。然而，他们是类似于由（%0%）法术变出的魔法造物，能够执行这种造物的所有功能以及DM同意的任何其他功能。幽灵工作人员可以瞬间变得没有实体，连同他们携带的任何东西，使他们能够通过墙壁提供食物和饮料。特许经营的任何成员都可以花一个行动来心灵感应地指挥一个或多个幽灵工作人员。",
	"Also at rank 3, the headquarters gains one defensive feature, planned out by the players in collaboration with the DM. Ships and other vessels with statistics can gain an increase to hit points or AC. Or a general defensive feature could include the choice of any two effects noted in the {@spell guards and wards} spell, which can be enabled or disabled by any franchise member.": "同样在等级3，总部获得一个防御功能，由玩家与DM合作计划出来。舰船和其他有统计数据的船只可以获得命中率或AC的增加。或者一个一般的防御功能可以包括选择{@spell guards and wards}咒语中指出的任何两个效果，可以由任何加盟成员启用或禁用。",
	"Players are encouraged to be creative in thinking about defensive features. An airship might have a deck that can channel lightning to repel boarders. A wagon might have transparent windows as strong as steel, and the ability to retract any rails or platforms upon which attacking foes could stand. Defensive features might impose conditions on enemies, or even deal damage. The DM should limit damaging effects to dealing 10 damage to a single target (5 damage for a multitarget or area effect) per franchise rank. When a saving throw is required, a good DC is 12 + franchise rank.": "我们鼓励玩家在思考防御性功能时发挥创造性。一艘飞艇可能有一个甲板，可以引导闪电来击退登船者。一辆马车可能有像钢铁一样坚固的透明窗户，并能收回任何攻击敌人的轨道或平台的能力。防御性功能可能会对敌人施加条件，甚至造成伤害。管理员应该将伤害性效果限制在对单个目标造成10次伤害（多目标或区域效果为5次伤害），每一个特许等级。当需要蓄力时，一个好的DC是12+特许等级。",
	"A carriage gains potent defensive capabilities in the form of sections of its roof and walls set with powerful concealed springs. This defensive feature can be activated as a bonus action by the driver or any creature within 5 feet of them. When a creature steps or grabs onto a protected section, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be flung from the wagon to a distance of 10 feet per franchise rank. The creature takes falling damage as if it had fallen that distance.": "一辆马车的车顶和车壁都有强大的隐蔽弹簧，从而获得了强大的防御能力。这种防御功能可以由驾驶员或他们周围5英尺内的任何生物作为额外动作激活。当一个生物踩到或抓到受保护的部分时，该生物必须在一个灵巧的蓄力动作上取得成功，否则就会被从马车上甩出去，每一个特许等级的距离为10英尺。该生物会受到坠落的伤害，就像它已经坠落了那么远。",
	"Specific areas of a ship or airship's floor and railings are warded with elemental lightning, up to an area the size of half the ship's upper deck. A character at the helm can activate this magic as a bonus action.

	"Whether a building, a vessel, or some other structure, a franchise is equipped with a compartment holding grease. When activated, nozzles release the grease either in a 30-foot cone or into a specific area no larger than 20 by 20 feet—typically focusing on an area through which attacking creatures are likely to move. Any creature entering the greased area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone} and end its movement that turn. A creature driving a vehicle that enters the greased area must make an appropriate ability check against the save DC. On a failure, the vehicle veers {@dice 3d10 + 10} feet in a random direction, then ends its movement for the round.": "无论是建筑物、船只，还是其他结构，特许经营权都配备了一个储存油脂的隔间。激活后，喷嘴会在30英尺的范围内释放油脂，或者释放到一个不超过20乘20英尺的特定区域--通常集中在一个攻击性生物可能会经过的区域。任何进入油污区域的生物都必须在灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会跌倒（%0%），并结束该回合的行动。驾驶车辆进入油污区域的生物必须对蓄力DC进行适当的能力检查。如果失败，车辆会向一个随机的方向偏移（%1%）英尺，然后结束该回合的移动。",
	"At ranks 3 and 4, a franchise can outfit its headquarters with any one feature from among the lower-tier features (cosmetic, expansion, transportation, or weapon features). In consultation with the DM, this might cover additional features to augment the headquarters' existing look or combat capability, or a plan to instead make an existing feature even stronger. A method of transportation might double its speed and remove an existing drawback, or an offensive feature could deal more damage or target more than one creature per round.": "在等级3和4时，一个特许经营商可以从低级特征（外观、扩展、运输或武器特征）中为其总部配备任何一个特征。在与DM协商后，这可能包括额外的功能来增强总部现有的外观或战斗能力，或计划使现有的功能更加强大。一种运输方式可能会使其速度增加一倍，并消除现有的缺点，或者一种攻击性功能可以造成更多的伤害，或每回合针对一个以上的生物。",
	"A secret feature, gained at rank 4, is one that remains unnoticed to most inspection, typically requiring a successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice. A headquarters might have a secret exit that guarantees escape and allows franchise members or staff to leave and enter without detection. A secret feature should usually add in-game benefits, such as a potion-brewing laboratory in a secret level of a castle, or a secret cargo hold within a ship that can keep perishables fresh and provide endless stocks of food and water to crew and passengers.": "秘密功能，在等级4时获得，是一个对大多数检查来说都不被注意的功能，通常需要成功的DC25智力（（%0%））检查或智慧（（%1%））检查来注意。一个总部可能有一个秘密出口，可以保证逃跑，并允许加盟成员或工作人员在不被发现的情况下离开和进入。秘密功能通常应该增加游戏中的好处，比如在城堡的一个秘密层面上有一个药水酿造实验室，或者在一艘船上有一个秘密货舱，可以保持易腐物品的新鲜，为船员和乘客提供无尽的食物和水。",
	"A walking statue's head can also serve as an escape pod. If the headquarters is ever destroyed, or if the character controlling the statue activates the escape mode as an action, the head detaches from the body and takes to the air with a flying speed of 80 feet. The flight lasts for up to 5 rounds, and is directed by the same controls that originally controlled the statue. If the head is not on the ground when the flight ends, it falls and any creatures within take falling damage.": "一个行走的雕像的头部也可以作为一个逃生舱。如果总部被摧毁，或者控制雕像的角色作为一个动作激活了逃生模式，头部就会从身体上分离出来，以80英尺的速度飞向空中。飞行最多持续5个回合，并由原先控制雕像的人指挥。如果飞行结束时头颅不在地面上，它就会坠落，任何在其中的生物都会受到坠落伤害。",
	"Several of the doors in a franchise's tavern are inscribed with runes. Anyone who traces a rune while speaking a passphrase can access their choice of ten extradimensional rooms, 20 feet on a side. These rooms can function as libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, kitchens, prisons, private quarters, and more, with each room's setup and contents chosen when the rooms are first installed. Each room's initial furnishing and equipment are included, though characters can later add to these features as they wish.": "一家专营酒馆的几扇门上都刻有符文。任何人只要在说出密码的同时追踪符文，就可以进入他们选择的10个维度外的房间，边长为20英尺。这些房间可以作为图书馆、实验室、会议室、厨房、监狱、私人住所等，每个房间的设置和内容都是在房间首次安装时选择的。每个房间的初始家具和设备都包括在内，不过角色可以在以后根据自己的意愿增加这些功能。",
	"A hidden compartment within an airship holds ten gliders. A secret door leads to the compartment, which features an exterior escape hatch activated from within any glider. Each glider accommodates one Medium or smaller creature and up to 50 pounds of gear, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and must descend at least 20 feet each round. A glider can be piloted as an action by any character with proficiency with flying vehicles. Characters without such proficiency might need to make ability checks of the DM's choosing to pilot a glider successfully. A glider weighs 100 pounds, has AC 14, 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.": "飞船中的一个隐藏隔间可容纳10架滑翔机。一个秘密的门通向这个隔间，它有一个外部的逃生舱门，可以从任何一个滑翔机内激活。每架滑翔机可容纳一个中型或小型生物和最多50磅的装备，飞行速度为60英尺，每回合必须下降至少20英尺。滑翔机可以由任何精通飞行器的角色作为行动来驾驶。没有这种能力的角色可能需要进行DM选择的能力检查来成功驾驶滑翔机。滑翔机重100磅，AC14，50点，对毒药和精神伤害免疫。",
	"Running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise offers countless benefits to an adventuring party—but those benefits aren't cheap. Operating the franchise, installing and maintaining franchise features, paying staff, creating merchandise with proper branding, settling legal issues, and more are all encompassed by the baseline cost for a franchise's headquarters, a multiplier from the franchise's rank, and the franchise party's business performance for the month.": "经营Acquisition Incorporated特许经营权为冒险者提供了无数的好处，但这些好处并不便宜。经营特许经营权、安装和维护特许经营权的功能、支付员工工资、创造具有适当品牌的商品、解决法律问题等等，都包含在特许经营权总部的基线成本、特许经营权等级的乘数以及特许经营权方当月的经营业绩中。",
	"If a franchise's costs leave a party low on cash, that's a sign that it's time to go adventuring. Alternatively, characters might use downtime to structure a leaner business or engage in non-adventuring activities to bring in more gold (see \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" later in this chapter for more information). A franchise's majordomo handles these finances and makes all necessary payments to Head Office, suppliers, and other agents—as long as sufficient funds are available.": "如果一个特许经营权的成本使一方的现金不足，这就是一个信号，是时候去冒险了。另外，角色可以利用停工期来构建一个更精简的企业，或者从事非冒险活动来获得更多的金币（更多信息见本章后面的\"（%0%）\"）。只要有足够的资金，加盟商的老板就会处理这些财务问题，并向总部、供应商和其他代理商支付所有必要的款项。",
	"The baseline monthly cost of a franchise is calculated based on the franchise's headquarters, as noted on the Baseline Costs table on the next page. The costs on this table differ from the costs found in the \"{@book Recurring Expenses|DMG|6|Recurring Expenses}\" section of chapter 6 in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. (That section details the costs characters might expect to pay to own an inn, a keep, or other types of properties.) This is because franchise costs include a tithe to Head Office, repayment to Acquisitions Incorporated for funding the initial construction or purchase of the headquarters, the use of approved contractors for construction and maintenance, and other subtle fees.": "特许经营权的每月基准费用是根据特许经营权的总部计算的，如下页的基准费用表所示。这张表上的费用与第六章中\"{@book Recurring Expenses|DMG|6|Recurring Expenses} \"部分的费用不同，{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。(那一节详细说明了角色拥有客栈、守卫或其他类型的财产可能需要支付的费用）。这是因为特许经营的成本包括对总部的什一税，对收购公司资助总部的初始建设或购买的还款，使用批准的承包商进行建设和维护，以及其他微妙的费用。",
	"Baseline costs are for representative dwellings, and can be adjusted by the DM as needs be. A noble estate that is the envy of other nobles might demand expenditures of double or triple the baseline cost. A franchise's baseline costs might also change during the course of the campaign. A party might initially start out headquartered in an abandoned lighthouse with monthly expenses of 250 gp. But as time passes and headquarters features are added, that lighthouse might grow in size, weapon features, and magic to resemble a fortified tower. The DM will modify baseline costs as needed to fit the headquarters and the campaign style.": "基准成本是针对有代表性的住宅，可以由DM根据需要进行调整。一个令其他贵族羡慕的贵族庄园可能需要两倍或三倍于基线成本的支出。在战役过程中，一个特许权的基准成本也可能发生变化。一支队伍最初可能会把总部设在一个废弃的灯塔里，每月的支出为250戈比。但随着时间的推移和总部功能的增加，这个灯塔可能会在规模、武器功能和魔法方面有所增长，从而类似于一座坚固的塔。DM将根据需要修改基准费用，以适应总部和活动风格。",

A franchise might use a ship as its headquarters, while also owning a number of remote trading posts run by franchise staff. The costs for all such \"virtual headquarters\" should be added together to derive one monthly baseline cost.": "有些角色可能会决定为他们的特许经营权维持一个以上的总部，或者控制其他地点作为特许经营权整体运作的一部分。一个特许经营权可能使用一艘船作为其总部，同时还拥有一些由特许经营权员工管理的远程贸易站。所有这些 \"虚拟总部 \"的费用应该加在一起，以得出一个每月的基准费用。",
	"The multiplier on the Franchise Advancement table is applied to a franchise's baseline cost. This represents the increased costs a franchise faces as it expands into larger markets.": "特许经营推进表上的乘数适用于一个特许经营的基准成本。这代表了一个特许经营权在扩展到更大的市场时所面临的成本增加。",
	"Each month, a franchise performs the running a franchise task, which can be found in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section later in this chapter. The result of this task is used to calculate the final monthly cost, and is deducted from the franchise's coffers.": "每个月，加盟店都要执行运行加盟店的任务，这可以在本章后面的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分找到。这个任务的结果被用来计算最终的月度成本，并从加盟店的国库中扣除。",
	"No self-respecting franchise would ever run out of money and fail to make its monthly payments. Right? Were that to happen, the amount owed—plus a modest 15 percent penalty—would be due to Head Office the following month. Failing to make payments—and especially defaulting on two or more payments in a row—is likely to trigger campaign consequences. Head Office might send inspectors to a troubled franchise, or assign the franchisees a difficult (and hopefully profitable) mission. Rival groups and entrepreneurs might smell blood and attempt to attack the franchise or take over its markets. Nefarious NPCs will most certainly come calling.": "任何有自尊心的特许经营权都不会耗尽资金，无法按月付款。对吗？如果发生这种情况，所欠的金额--加上15%的适度罚款--将在下个月支付给总部。未能付款--尤其是连续两次或更多次的拖欠--很可能会引发运动性后果。总部可能会派检查员到有问题的加盟店，或给加盟商分配一个困难的（但希望是有利可图的）任务。敌对团体和企业家可能会闻到血腥味，并试图攻击特许经营权或接管其市场。邪恶的NPC们肯定会来找你。",
	"Defaulting on franchise payments can also strain relationships with nobles, merchants, and others who value a franchise more for its assets than for the characters. Such relationships typically turn frosty until the characters are able to prove that the franchise is back on its feet.": "拖欠特许经营权的款项也会使与贵族、商人和其他更重视特许经营权的资产而不是人物的关系紧张。这种关系通常会变得僵硬，直到角色们能够证明特许经营权已恢复正常。",
	"A franchise is a complex affair, requiring its participants to fulfill a myriad of important duties necessary for its proper growth (and the enrichment of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office). A company position establishes a character's role within a franchise, as well as a relationship with the larger Acq Inc organization.": "特许经营是一件复杂的事情，要求其参与者履行无数的重要职责，以保证其适当的增长（以及收购公司总部的充实）。公司职位确定了一个角色在特许经营中的作用，以及与更大的Acq公司组织的关系。",
	"When you choose a company position for your character, that choice is independent of and in addition to your character's background, class, and other options. Though Head Office might tell would-be Acq Inc franchisees to play to their strengths, you should choose the position that speaks to you—and that feels like it'll be the most fun. All characters who take on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise must take a company position. A character can take only one position within a franchise.": "当你为你的角色选择一个公司职位时，这个选择是独立于你的角色的背景、等级和其他选项之外的。虽然总部可能会告诉未来的Acq Inc特许经营商发挥他们的优势，但你应该选择对你有意义的职位，而且感觉它将是最有趣的。所有参加收购公司特许经营的角色都必须担任公司职位。一个角色在一个加盟店内只能担任一个职位。",
	"Each company position has its own distinct flavor—and comes with a range of preternatural benefits. Some of these benefits take the form of material boons granted by Head Office, including specialized magic items available only to Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. Others are shaped by the subtle power of your position and the franchise's rank.": "每个公司的职位都有其独特的风味--并有一系列超自然的好处。其中一些好处是由总部授予的物质恩惠，包括只有收购公司加盟商才能获得的专门的魔法物品。其他的则是由你的职位和特许权等级的微妙力量决定的。",
	"Players—and especially new players—should keep in mind the amount of creativity and collaboration a company position requires when determining which position is the best fit for their character. In addition to their various mechanical benefits, the features of each company position are intended to offer players and DMs the opportunity to collaborate on crafting campaign narrative. Sometimes this is straightforward, as when a feature allows a character to learn useful information about enemies or allies, as with the obviator's Read the Opposition feature. Sometimes this calls for a focused collaborative effort between player and DM, as with the cartographer's Tale of Safe Travel. Where the narrative options in a position's features lend themselves to interpretation, the DM works with the players to determine how those options play out, as is the baseline model of every Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "玩家--尤其是新玩家--在决定哪个职位最适合他们的角色时，应该牢记公司职位所需要的创造力和协作。除了各种机械上的好处外，每个公司职位的特点都是为了给玩家和管理员提供机会，使他们能够合作制作活动的叙述。有时，这很直接，比如当一个角色可以了解关于敌人或盟友的有用信息时，就像遗忘者的阅读对手功能一样。有时，这需要玩家和管理员之间的集中协作，就像制图员的安全旅行故事一样。如果一个职位的特征中的叙事选项适合于解释，那么DM就会与玩家一起决定这些选项如何发挥，这也是每个收购公司活动的基本模式。",
	"Accepting a company position with Acquisitions Incorporated means more than just a title and hopes of a paycheck. With it comes access to trade secrets, best practices, and corporate shortcuts central to fulfilling one's role within a franchise. When a character takes a specific company position, they gain proficiency in the tools and skills associated with that position. Such proficiency also extends to a variety of business practices, day-to-day tasks, and hazard mitigations that are all part of the job. Professional functions that characters can add their proficiency bonus to are detailed in the \"Position Proficiency\" section of each of the following company positions.": "接受收购公司的职位意味着不仅仅是一个头衔和薪水的希望。这意味着可以获得商业秘密、最佳实践和公司的捷径，这对履行一个人在特许经营中的角色至关重要。当一个角色担任一个特定的公司职位时，他们会获得与该职位相关的工具和技能的熟练度。这种熟练程度也延伸到各种商业惯例、日常任务和危险缓解措施，这些都是工作的一部分。角色可以增加其熟练度奖励的专业功能，在以下每个公司职位的 \"职位熟练度 \"部分有详细说明。",
	"The tools and items that are granted to a character as part of a company position are unique objects created and bestowed by Head Office on trusted franchisees. A set of Acquisitions Incorporated tools might resemble mundane tools, but they are never the same. Countless mundane cartographers in the world have proficiency with cartographer's tools. But only an Acquisitions Incorporated cartographer has access to a {@item cartographer's map case|AI} and the ability to use it.": "作为公司职位的一部分，授予角色的工具和物品是总部创造并授予受信任的特许经营人的独特物品。一套收购公司的工具可能类似于世俗的工具，但它们绝不相同。世界上无数平凡的制图师都能熟练使用制图师的工具。但只有收购公司的制图师才能获得{@item cartographer's map case|AI}并有能力使用它。",
	"Magic items gained as part of a company position always require attunement, but they do not count against the number of magic items a character can normally attune to. Each item can be attuned to only by the character to whom it has been granted by Head Office. If the tools of other Acq Inc franchisees are ever found, they cannot be attuned even by characters with the applicable position. (It goes without saying that such tools found at large are expected to be returned to Head Office immediately.)": "作为公司职位的一部分而获得的魔法物品总是需要调整的，但它们不计入一个角色通常可以调整的魔法物品的数量。每件物品只能由总部授予的角色来调和。如果发现其他Acq公司特许经营人的工具，即使是具有相应职位的角色也不能调谐它们。(不言而喻，这些工具被发现后，应立即归还总部）。",
	"Each position magic item is representative of the significant mystic expertise of Acquisitions Incorporated—and no matter who might use them, position items always belong to the franchise proper. The use of such items is typically revoked upon leaving the company, and Head Office is known for the diligence with which it retrieves items that are \"accidentally\" held onto.": "每个位置的魔法物品都代表着收购公司重要的神秘专业知识--无论谁可能使用它们，位置物品总是属于特许经营权的一部分。这些物品的使用通常在离开公司时被取消，总部以其对 \"意外 \"持有的物品的勤奋而闻名。",
	"You choose your character's position when the character first joins an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your character's position rank is equal to your franchise's rank. Starting from rank 1, you gain specialized training (including new proficiencies), special equipment, and your rank 1 position feature. Then, as the franchise grows, the scope of your position grows with it. Each time the franchise gains a rank (normally at levels 5, 11, and 17), your character is promoted to that new rank in their position and gains the appropriate benefits.": "当你的角色第一次加入Acquisition Incorporated特许经营时，你会选择你的角色的位置。你的职位等级等同于你的特许经营权等级。从等级1开始，你会获得专门的训练（包括新的技能），特殊的装备，以及等级1的职位特征。然后，随着特许经营权的增长，你的职位范围也会随之增长。每当特许经营权获得一个等级（通常在5、11和17级），你的角色就会被提升到他们职位的新等级，并获得相应的好处。",

	"At rank 3, when you use your Rumor Mill feature, the DM provides you with a sense of which parts of a particular rumor are inaccurate, if any. You do not necessarily learn the truth behind those false rumors.": "在等级3，当你使用你的 \"谣言粉碎机 \"功能时，DM为你提供一种感觉，即某一谣言的哪些部分是不准确的，如果有的话。你不一定能了解到那些虚假谣言背后的真相。",
	"At rank 4, you have little trouble finding the right people for the job. As an action, while in a populated area, you can make a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to locate an NPC who can provide a service immediately, no questions asked, for the standard fee (see \"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services}\" in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). On a successful check, information regarding the potential hire comes to you as supernatural insight, word of mouth, an advertisement blowing into your face, or a similarly convenient method. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.": "在等级4的时候，你在寻找合适的人做这件事上没有什么困难。作为一项行动，当你在一个人口稠密的地区时，你可以进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，以找到一个可以立即提供服务的NPC，不问任何问题，收取标准费用（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}第五章的\"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services}\"）。检查成功后，关于潜在雇佣者的信息会以超自然的洞察力、口耳相传、吹到你脸上的广告或类似的便捷方式出现在你面前。一旦你使用了这个功能，你就不能再使用它，直到你完成一个长时间的休息。",
	"Hirelings acquired through this feature are in addition to any franchise staff. They can be invited to bolster existing staff or fill a sudden need, but they are not part of the baseline staff gained through a franchise's rank. Their pay is not covered by the franchise's normal costs.": "通过此功能获得的雇佣者是任何特许经营员工的补充。他们可以被邀请来加强现有的员工或填补突然的需要，但他们不属于通过特许经营的等级获得的基本员工。他们的工资不包括在加盟店的正常费用中。",
	"Also at rank 4, you are able to make a focused effort to keep a potential customer's attention. When you provide a humanoid with a business card from your {@item portfolio keeper|AI}, you can cast {@spell charm person} on them (save DC 15). The spell ends prematurely if the character loses the business card.": "同样在等级4，你能够集中精力来保持潜在客户的注意力。当你向一个人形生物提供你（%0%）的名片时，你可以对他们施展（%1%）的魔法（保存DC15）。如果该人物失去了名片，那么该法术就会提前结束。",
	"You believe that people shouldn't work harder; they should work smarter. And then they should work harder.": "你认为人们不应该更努力工作；他们应该更聪明地工作。然后他们应该更努力地工作。",
	"You've always yearned to be in the people business, because inanimate objects can't pay you.": "你一直渴望做人的生意，因为无生命的物体不能给你报酬。",
	"Being able to hand out \"Employee of the Month\" stickers has been a life-long dream.": "能够发放 \"每月最佳员工 \"贴纸一直是我一生的梦想。",
	"You believe that customer loyalty can't be bought, but that it can be rented at reasonable terms and rates.": "你相信客户的忠诚度是买不到的，但它可以以合理的条款和费率租到。",
	"Your habit of constantly telling other people how they can improve makes you a master of performance reviews.": "你不断告诉别人如何改进的习惯使你成为绩效评估的大师。",
	"You've always believed that the customer is satisfied when you say the customer is satisfied, and not a second before.": "你一直相信，当你说客户满意的时候，客户才会满意，而不是前一秒。",
	"You love the joy that other people get when you tell them what to do.": "你喜欢别人在你告诉他们该怎么做时得到的快乐。",
	"Buzzwords was your first language.": "流行语是你的第一语言。",
	"As talked about in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} and the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, downtime activities allow players and DMs to make the breaks between adventures into a compelling part of the campaign. In between the highlights of slogging through dungeons, infiltrating death cults, and being generally heroic, characters can practice professions, engage in research, create special items, and indulge other activities beyond adventuring.": "正如在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}和{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中所谈到的，停工活动允许玩家和DM将冒险之间的休息时间变成活动的一个引人注目的部分。在艰难地穿越地下城、潜入死亡教派和普遍的英雄主义之间，角色可以练习职业、从事研究、创造特殊物品，以及沉溺于冒险之外的其他活动。",
	"Because an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is focused on the franchise, downtime is typically a big part of the game. (The adventure that makes up chapter 4 of this book, \"{@adventure The Orrery of the Wanderer|OoW|0},\" sets up downtime options between adventure episodes as a key component of the campaign.) But an Acq Inc campaign offers even more robust options for characters who want to get things done outside adventuring time, because the heroes of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign have something that most adventurers don't—a well-paid (okay, an occasionally paid) staff.": "因为收购公司的活动是以特许经营权为中心的，所以停机时间通常是游戏的一个重要部分。(构成本书第四章的冒险，\"{@adventure The Orrery of the Wanderer|OoW|0}\"，将冒险剧集之间的停工时间选项作为活动的一个关键组成部分。） 但是Acq公司的活动为那些想在冒险时间之外完成任务的角色提供了更多的选择，因为收购公司活动的英雄们拥有大多数冒险者所没有的东西--报酬丰厚（好吧，偶尔有报酬）的员工。",
	"In addition to the downtime activities characters undertake on their own, the hard-working subemployees and interns of a franchise can carry out orders and further the characters' goals through research, crafting, social encounters, and so forth. This lets the players direct behind-the-scenes activities even as the characters focus on the more rarefied pursuits of killing monsters and taking their stuff. Before your party sets out for the Fortress of Eternal Peril, an intern can be sent to research that magic book found in a previous adventure. Your majordomo might spend time currying favor with nobles as a means of expanding the franchise's reputation. And what could be more fun (for you) than to have the staff engage in a bit of dangerous criminal activity? If they're successful, the franchise gets the profits! And if they get caught, who are these people you barely know?": "除了人物自己进行的停工活动外，专营权中辛勤工作的副雇员和实习生可以执行命令，并通过研究、制作、社会接触等方式推进人物的目标。这让玩家可以指导幕后的活动，即使角色专注于杀戮怪物和夺取他们的东西的更高追求。在你的队伍出发去永恒的危险堡垒之前，可以派一个实习生去研究以前的冒险中发现的魔法书。你的主人可能会花时间去讨好贵族，作为扩大特许经营权声誉的一种手段。还有什么能比让员工从事一些危险的犯罪活动更有趣的呢（对你来说）？如果他们成功了，特许经营权就会得到利润！如果他们被抓了，谁还会有兴趣？如果他们被抓，这些你几乎不认识的人是谁？",
	"By allowing franchise tasks to take place not just during downtime but while the characters are adventuring, it's possible for players in an Acquisitions Incorporated game to try to push the pace of the campaign. Characters might try to avoid taking downtime of their own in favor of having franchise employees take care of all that boring not-adventuring stuff. But because an Acq Inc campaign makes great use of social encounters, research, and intrigue, players should be encouraged to not treat downtime as optional. Moreover, DMs can and will make use of rivalries and complications during franchise tasks to drag characters into that part of the game.": "通过允许特许经营任务不仅在停工期间进行，而且在角色冒险时进行，收购公司游戏中的玩家有可能试图推动活动的节奏。角色可能会尽量避免自己的停工时间，而让特许经营公司的员工来处理那些无聊的非冒险的事情。但是，由于Acq公司的活动极大地利用了社会接触、研究和阴谋，所以应该鼓励玩家不要把休息时间当作可有可无的事情。此外，管理员可以而且会利用专营权任务中的竞争和复杂情况，将角色拖入游戏的那一部分。",
	"Using the traditional approach to downtime, franchise tasks can be run at set break points during the campaign. When the characters return from adventuring, they take on some of the responsibility for bookkeeping, maintenance, long-term planning, and the like, making franchise staff available for other activities under the characters' guidance. In this model, characters and staff run downtime simultaneously between sessions of adventuring. This follows the standard approach of using downtime to advance the timeline of the campaign.": "使用传统的停工方式，特许经营任务可以在活动期间的固定休息点运行。当人物从冒险中回来时，他们会承担一些记账、维护、长期规划等方面的责任，使特许经营人员在人物的指导下可以进行其他活动。在这种模式下，角色和员工在冒险活动的两次会议之间同时运行停机时间。这遵循了利用停工期来推进活动时间线的标准方法。",
	"A more wide-open approach to franchise tasks sees the characters direct those activities at any point during the campaign, alongside traditional adventuring. During any game session, the players can decide to focus on what the franchise staff are up to by setting assignments, giving orders, and making checks to determine the success of franchise tasks. If those tasks tie strongly into the adventure, franchise tasks can effectively become a fourth pillar of an Acquisitions Incorporated game, alongside exploration, social interaction, and combat.": "对特许经营任务采取更加开放的方法，在活动期间的任何时候，角色都可以指挥这些活动，与传统的冒险活动一起。在任何游戏环节中，玩家都可以决定通过设定任务、下达命令和进行检查来确定特许经营任务的成功与否，从而关注特许经营工作人员的工作。如果这些任务与冒险紧密相连，特许经营任务可以有效地成为收购公司游戏的第四个支柱，与探索、社会互动和战斗并列。",
	"Whether franchise tasks are undertaken during regular downtime or alongside other adventuring activities, a franchise's rank puts a hard limit on the number of tasks the franchise's staff can undertake. See the \"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" section earlier in this chapter. (This limit is only for franchise tasks undertaken by staff. The characters are free to undertake whatever downtime activities the DM allows, as normal.)": "无论特许经营的任务是在正常的停工期内进行，还是与其他冒险活动一起进行，特许经营的等级对特许经营的员工所能承担的任务数量有硬性限制。参见本章前面的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"部分。(这个限制只针对员工承担的特许经营任务。角色们可以自由地进行DM允许的任何休息时间的活动，和平常一样）。",
	"For each available franchise task slot, players can allocate one or more staff members to a chosen franchise task. Those tasks can include any of the downtime activities in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, the new and revised downtime activities in {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}, and the new activities in this section. When all of a franchise's task slots are filled, one of those tasks must be completed before staff can be allocated to a new franchise task. (The one exception to this rule is the running a franchise activity, presented later in this section. That activity must be performed by a franchise, but does not require that specific characters or staff members be allocated to it.)": "对于每个可用的特许经营任务槽，玩家可以分配一个或多个工作人员去完成一个选定的特许经营任务。这些任务可以包括{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的任何停机活动，{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中新的和修订的停机活动，以及本节中的新活动。当一个特许经营的所有任务槽都被填满时，在工作人员被分配到新的特许经营任务之前，必须完成其中的一个任务。(这个规则的一个例外是本节后面介绍的经营特许经营活动。这个活动必须由一个加盟店来完成，但不需要为它分配特定的角色或工作人员）。",
	"Staff allocated to a franchise task are no longer available for other needs, including other franchise tasks. Any costs or resources associated with a franchise task must be provided by the franchise (which is to say, by the characters).": "分配给某项特许经营任务的人员不能再用于其他需要，包括其他特许经营任务。与特许经营任务相关的任何费用或资源必须由特许经营权提供（也就是说，由角色提供）。",
	"For example, a rank 2 franchise can undertake two concurrent franchise tasks. If the characters are setting out to explore the Swamp of Lingering Malaise, they might order their majordomo to send messages to various noble families while they're away, carrying out the sowing rumors activity from the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The task follows the regular rules for that downtime activity, but is carried out by the majordomo. At the same time, the characters might send out another staff member to engage in the explore territory activity (a new activity detailed below).": "例如，一个2级的特许经营权可以承担两个同时进行的特许经营任务。如果角色们要去探索 \"流弊沼泽\"，他们可能会命令他们的主人公在他们离开时向各个贵族家庭发送消息，执行{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的播种谣言活动。该任务遵循该停工活动的常规规则，但由大公执行。同时，这些人物可能会派出另一名工作人员从事探索领土活动（一种新的活动，详见下文）。",
	"You can't expect to get everything done yourself. Delegation is key. And the consequences for fumbling a simple task should be real, immediate, and serve as a lesson to others who serve you. No dessert for a tenday! That'll teach 'em.": "你不能指望自己能完成所有的事情。授权是关键。摸索一项简单任务的后果应该是真实的、直接的，并作为一个教训给其他为你服务的人。一个星期内没有甜点! 那会让他们知道。",
	"When a franchise task requires an ability check, a staff member can use their own ability check modifier to determine success. (This modifier might depend on the staff member's statistics, if an NPC, or it might be based on the franchise's rank. See the \"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" section.) Alternatively, the staff member can use the check modifier of a character overseeing the task and giving the staff member direction. This can encourage the characters to develop closer relationships with franchise staff through roleplaying, and keeps the players involved in staff-focused franchise tasks.": "当一个特许经营任务需要能力检查时，工作人员可以使用他们自己的能力检查修改器来决定是否成功。(如果是NPC的话，这个修正值可能取决于工作人员的统计数据，也可能是基于特许权的等级。参见\"（%0%）\"部分）。另外，工作人员可以使用一个监督任务的角色的检查修改器，给工作人员以指导。这可以鼓励角色通过角色扮演与特许经营的工作人员建立更密切的关系，并使玩家参与到以工作人员为中心的特许经营任务中。",
	"Franchise tasks can be an exciting, story-rich part of a gaming session. Over time, franchise tasks and character downtime activities can expand the story of a franchise and add depth to the characterizations of its NPC staff members. The successes, failures, and complications of franchise tasks might even become pivotal moments in the campaign.": "特许经营任务可以成为游戏环节中一个令人兴奋、故事丰富的部分。随着时间的推移，特许经营任务和角色的闲暇活动可以扩展特许经营的故事，并为其NPC工作人员的角色塑造增加深度。特许经营任务的成功、失败和复杂情况甚至可能成为活动中的关键时刻。",
	"As with all aspects of an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, franchise tasks are about creating narrative. As such, to make those tasks a part of the campaign story, the DM and the players can work together to break tasks down into distinct scenes using the following guidelines.": "与收购公司活动的所有方面一样，特许任务是关于创造叙述的。因此，为了使这些任务成为活动故事的一部分，管理员和玩家可以一起工作，使用以下准则将任务分解为不同的场景。",
	"When the characters select a franchise task, the players share their goals for that task with the DM. Having clear motives helps establish the stakes and provides ideas that the DM can weave into the campaign story. The DM might work up a narrative based on the players' initial discussions, and might ask additional questions to help narrow down options.": "当角色选择了一个特许任务时，玩家要与DM分享他们对该任务的目标。有了明确的动机，有助于建立利害关系，并为DM提供了可以编入活动故事的想法。DM可能会根据玩家的初步讨论进行叙述，也可能会问一些额外的问题来帮助缩小选择范围。",
	"As an example, consider a group of characters whose franchise headquarters is a submersible ship, and whose staff are largely former pirates. While the characters head out for a mission on the mainland, they direct the ship's staff-member captain to surprise other vessels and liberate goods from them. The DM decides that such acts of piracy fit the shady business practice activity (introduced later in this section), and quickly sketches out a few ideas for the task.": "举个例子，考虑一群人物，他们的特许经营总部是一艘潜水船，其工作人员大多是前海盗。当这些角色前往大陆执行任务时，他们指示船上的工作人员船长去偷袭其他船只，并从他们那里解放货物。DM决定，这种海盗行为符合不光彩的商业惯例活动（在本节后面介绍），并迅速勾勒出任务的几个想法。",
	"The DM describes the beginning of the task activity, setting the stage for the NPCs' actions. For the submersible headquarters discussed above, the DM might begin to describe how the ship leaves port in search of easy prey. The captain and crew are in a good mood. There's a storm in the area, but it doesn't threaten the submersible. The DM might ask the players to describe a few undertakings the crew can engage in to pass the time, or might even ask players to temporarily take on the roles of one or more staff members, helping to bring those NPCs to life through roleplaying.": "DM描述任务活动的开始，为NPC的行动设置舞台。对于上面讨论的潜水器总部，DM可能会开始描述这艘船是如何离开港口去寻找轻松的猎物的。船长和船员的心情都很好。该地区有一场风暴，但它并没有威胁到潜水器。DM可能会要求玩家描述一些船员可以从事的事业来打发时间，甚至可能要求玩家暂时扮演一个或多个工作人员的角色，通过角色扮演来帮助这些NPC活过来。",
	"For each ability check required by a franchise task, the DM describes what's happening, determines the applicable ability, and decides whether a skill or tool proficiency is appropriate (usually as suggested in the activity write-up). Whether the check is made by a staff member or the character who directed or set up the franchise task, a player makes the roll. The DM can encourage roleplaying by asking about what kind of guidance a character provided to the staff member, or what part of the staff member's background makes them good at the task at hand. The DM then describes successive scenes based on checks and roleplaying as the crew members locate a likely target ship and commence their attack.": "对于特许经营任务所要求的每一项能力检查，DM会描述正在发生的事情，确定适用的能力，并决定技能或工具的熟练程度是否合适（通常是在活动的写法中建议）。无论检查是由工作人员还是指导或设置特许经营任务的角色进行，都是由玩家来做检查。管理员可以通过询问角色为工作人员提供了什么样的指导，或者工作人员的哪部分背景使他们擅长手头的任务来鼓励角色扮演。然后，DM在检查和角色扮演的基础上描述连续的场景，因为船员们找到了可能的目标船并开始了他们的攻击。",
	"The DM determines the overall outcome for the franchise task, then narrates the outcome to wrap up that small part of the overall story. If the check for the activity indicates any degree of success, the DM describes how the franchise's pirates manage to grab some valuable cargo, in addition to other benefits as noted in the write-up for the shady business practice activity. With treasure aboard, the ship is ready for the characters' eventual return.": "DM决定特许经营任务的总体结果，然后叙述这个结果以结束整个故事的一小部分。如果该活动的检查结果显示有任何程度的成功，DM就会描述特许经营的海盗是如何设法抢到一些有价值的货物的，此外还有其他的好处，如黑幕商业惯例活动的写法中所提到的。有了财宝，这艘船已经准备好迎接人物的最终回归。",
	"Rather than treating franchise tasks as isolated episodes, the DM can weave the story of one task into the next, and can tie franchise tasks into the overarching campaign. Doing so assigns importance to franchise tasks, and lets the players understand how the success or failure of those tasks might drive the campaign. Even after a specific franchise task has concluded, the DM can make notes for how that task might tie to future tasks. For the characters running the submersible franchise, the ship that fought off the franchise's pirates might remember a few details about the franchise crew. Or perhaps the plundered vessel belongs to a franchise rival, or even a foreign dignitary the characters will eventually meet, setting up a future plot twist.": "与其将特许任务视为孤立的情节，DM可以将一个任务的故事编织到下一个任务中，并可以将特许任务与总体战役联系起来。这样做可以赋予任务以重要性，并让玩家了解这些任务的成败会如何推动战役的进行。即使在一个特定的任务结束后，DM也可以为该任务如何与未来的任务联系起来而做记录。对于经营潜水器专营权的角色来说，击退专营权海盗的那艘船可能会记得专营权船员的一些细节。或者，被掠夺的船只属于特许经营权的竞争对手，甚至是人物最终会遇到的外国政要，为未来的情节转折做准备。",
	"This section introduces the following new downtime activities, all of which can be used as franchise tasks in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign: explore territory, franchise restructuring, headquarters modification, marketeering, philanthropic enterprise, running a franchise, scrutineering, shady business practice, schmoozing, team building.": "本节介绍了以下新的停工活动，所有这些活动都可以作为收购公司活动中的特许经营任务：探索领土、特许经营重组、修改总部、营销、慈善事业、经营特许经营、审查、阴暗的商业行为、招摇撞骗、团队建设。",

	"The franchise and downtime activities introduced in this section all incorporate the idea that such activities can introduce ongoing complications to the campaign, and that anything a franchise's characters or employees do might bring the franchise into conflict with rivals.": "本节介绍的特许经营和停工活动都包含了这样的想法：这种活动可以为活动带来持续的复杂性，特许经营的人物或雇员所做的任何事情都可能使特许经营与对手发生冲突。",
	"If you use {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE} in your games, you're probably already familiar with complications and rivals as part of downtime, but you don't need to own that book to make use of these ideas. Rather, just remember that an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always about story. Each time the characters engage in downtime or direct their staff in a franchise task, the players and the DM can think about how those tasks and activities might complicate the ongoing campaign narrative, and how the franchise's enemies—or potential enemies—might get caught up in those complications.": "如果你在游戏中使用{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}，你可能已经熟悉了作为停机时间一部分的复杂情况和对手，但你不需要拥有那本书来利用这些想法。相反，只要记住，收购公司的活动总是关于故事。每当角色参与停工或指导他们的员工执行特许经营任务时，玩家和管理员可以考虑这些任务和活动如何使正在进行的活动叙事复杂化，以及特许经营的敌人或潜在的敌人如何被卷入这些复杂情况中。",
	"When a complication or a rival comes into play during downtime or franchise activities, the DM determines the particulars. The activities presented at the end of this section all come with tables of possible complications, but the DM is free to come up with even more dastardly complications to suit the campaign.": "在停工期或特许经营活动中，当出现复杂情况或对手时，由DM决定具体细节。本节末尾介绍的活动都附有可能的复杂情况表，但管理员可以自由地想出更多卑鄙的复杂情况以适应活动。",
	"An easy way to focus on complications and rivals in a campaign is to think about who might be paying attention to a franchise's activities. For example, a successful philanthropic enterprise (one of the new activities in this section) could draw the attention of a noble who begins to question the reputation and honesty of the characters running the franchise. Or the party might launch a marketeering campaign (another new activity), only to discover that their branding has an accidental resemblance to the logo of an assassins' guild. Complications are an excellent way to develop rich interactions between the setting and the characters. In an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, even the smallest actions can have unexpected (and, ideally, hilarious) consequences.": "在活动中关注复杂情况和对手的一个简单方法是思考谁可能会关注一个特许经营权的活动。例如，一个成功的慈善事业（本节的新活动之一）可能会引起一个贵族的注意，他开始质疑经营特许权的人物的声誉和诚实。或者该党派可能会发起一个市场推广活动（另一项新活动），但却发现他们的品牌与一个刺客公会的标志意外地相似。复杂化是发展环境和人物之间丰富互动的绝佳方式。在收购公司的活动中，即使是最小的行动也会产生意想不到的（最好是搞笑的）后果。",
	"Rivals represent any of the factions and organizations that can come into play during an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Rivals don't have to be villains or mortal enemies of the characters, though. Other Acq Inc franchises all compete with the characters' franchise, seeking to expand their own reach and impress Head Office. Governments, merchants, guilds, religious institutions, and noble families can all take notice as a franchise grows in power. And outside the characters' immediate sphere of influence, factions such as Dran Enterprises and the Six work dark plots that might make the characters targets for assimilation or destruction. (The plots of the Six and the operations of Dran Enterprises both play a part in the adventure \"{@adventure The Orrery of the Wanderer|OoW|0},\" chapter 4 of this book.)": "竞争对手代表了在收购公司活动中可能出现的任何派别和组织。不过，对手不一定是反派或人物的死敌。其他Acq公司的特许经营权都与角色的特许经营权竞争，寻求扩大自己的影响力，给总部留下深刻印象。政府、商人、行会、宗教机构和贵族家庭都会注意到一个专营权的增长。而在人物的直接影响范围之外，德兰企业和六人帮等派别会实施黑暗的阴谋，可能会使人物成为被同化或毁灭的目标。(六人帮的阴谋和德兰企业的运作都在本书第四章\"{@adventure The Orrery of the Wanderer|OoW|0} \"的冒险中发挥了作用）。",
	"When a complication occurs during a downtime or franchise activity, the DM determines whether and how that complication connects to a rival. Certain complications might be caused by rivals, as when the orc army camping in the characters' territory is revealed to have been invited there by a competing franchise. Other complications might draw a rival in, as when a greedy noble decides they want a piece of the franchise's action.": "当一个并发症发生在停工期或特许经营活动中时，DM决定该并发症是否以及如何与对手相联系。某些复杂情况可能是由对手造成的，比如在角色的领地上扎营的兽人军队被发现是由一个竞争的特许经营商邀请去的。其他的复杂情况可能会吸引对手，比如当一个贪婪的贵族决定要从特许经营权的行动中分一杯羹。",
	"Rival NPCs can be worked up using the rules in chapter 4, \"{@book Creating Nonplayer Characters|DMG|-1}\" of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, incorporating schemes, methods, and weaknesses. If you use {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE} in your game, that book provides example rivals and talks about establishing a rival's goals, assets, and plans. See also the \"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals}\" section in chapter 3 of this book for an introduction to some of the rival organizations that might appear in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "竞争对手的NPC可以使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的第四章\"{@book Creating Nonplayer Characters|DMG|-1} \"中的规则，将计划、方法和弱点纳入其中。如果你在游戏中使用{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}，该书提供了对手的例子，并谈到了建立一个对手的目标、资产和计划。也请参见本书第三章的\"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals} \"部分，了解一些可能出现在收购公司活动中的对手组织的介绍。",
	"Complications and rivals make excellent adventure seeds. Whenever a complication or rival draws the interest of the players, the DM can make a note of that for future development. As the campaign progresses, the agendas of rivals change over time, just as the characters' goals and agendas change as a result of their franchise's success (or their efforts to stave off failure).": "复杂情况和对手是很好的冒险种子。每当一个复杂情况或对手引起了玩家的兴趣，DM就可以把它记下来，以便将来发展。随着活动的进行，对手的议程会随着时间的推移而改变，就像人物的目标和议程会因为他们的特许经营权的成功（或他们为避免失败而做出的努力）而改变一样。",
	"The DM can decide how to invoke complications as the campaign story unfolds. Perhaps the characters were forced to slay an evil guard in a raid gone bad. Later, their majordomo engages in a little gambling as part of a franchise task... and finds the suspicious husband of the guard at their gaming table! Likewise, if a franchise has recently tangled with Dran Enterprises or opposed another Acq Inc franchise, the chance of a complication with either group likely goes up.": "DM可以决定如何在战役故事展开的过程中引出复杂情况。也许人物在一次突袭中被迫杀死了一个邪恶的警卫。后来，他们的主人公作为特许经营任务的一部分参与了一场小小的赌博......并在他们的赌桌上发现了那个守卫的可疑丈夫。同样地，如果一个特许经营权最近与德兰企业纠缠在一起，或者与另一个Acq公司的特许经营权对立，那么与这两个集团发生复杂关系的机会就会增加。",
	"In addition to the downtime activities found in other books, characters and their franchise staff can undertake the new activities presented in this section, either as regular downtime activities or as franchise tasks that can be undertaken at any time. These activities reflect the central role of the franchise in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "除了其他书中的停工活动外，角色和他们的特许经营人员可以进行本节介绍的新活动，可以作为常规的停工活动，也可以作为特许经营任务，随时进行。这些活动反映了特许经营在收购公司活动中的核心作用。",
	"The length of time required for these new downtime or franchise activities varies, from a number of days to one workweek (5 days) or more. All the normal rules for downtime must be followed by the character or NPC undertaking the downtime or franchise activity, including spending 8 hours each day engaged in that activity for the day to count toward the activity's completion. The one exception to this rule is that any costs for a franchise activity are paid for by the characters, even if franchise staff are executing the task.": "这些新的停工或特许经营活动所需的时间长短不一，从若干天到一个工作周（5天）或更多。从事停工或特许经营活动的角色或NPC必须遵守所有正常的停工规则，包括每天花8小时从事该活动，以计入活动的完成时间。这个规则的一个例外是，特许经营活动的任何费用都是由角色支付的，即使是特许经营人员在执行任务。",
	"Some downtime and franchise activities alter a franchise's monthly costs. See the \"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" section earlier in this chapter for how to determine a franchise's base monthly costs, and see the \"{@book Running a Franchise|AI|1|Running a Franchise}\" section below for more information on how that activity modifies the base cost.": "一些停工期和特许经营活动会改变一个特许经营的月度成本。参见本章前面的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"一节，了解如何确定一个特许经营权的基本月费，并参见下面的\"{@book Running a Franchise|AI|1|Running a Franchise} \"一节，了解该活动如何修改基本费用的更多信息。",
	"No matter how densely populated or remote and wild the territory in which a franchise is licensed to operate, that territory has secrets. Characters and franchise staff can explore their licensed territory in search of useful features, hidden lairs, resources, and creatures that can be engaged in beneficial service. (Or, you know, sold for parts. If you're okay with that). Exploration can be done any number of times in a franchise's territory, representing new areas being explored, new discoveries, or elements that have changed since the last exploration.": "无论特许经营权所在的地区是人口稠密还是偏远荒凉，该地区都有秘密。角色和特许经营人员可以探索他们的特许经营区，寻找有用的特征、隐藏的巢穴、资源和可以从事有益服务的生物。(或者，你知道的，卖掉做零件。如果你同意的话)。探索可以在一个特许经营的领土上进行任何次数，代表正在探索的新区域，新的发现，或自上一次探索以来已经改变的元素。",
	"Exploring a portion of a licensed territory requires at least one workweek of effort and incurs 200 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the chance that the expedition finds something of use to the franchise.": "探索特许经营区的一部分需要至少一个工作周的努力，并且每个特许经营等级会产生200金币的费用。花费更多的时间和金钱可以增加探险队发现对特许权有用的东西的机会。",
	"A character or staff member directing the expedition makes a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to determine the outcome. This check gains a +2 bonus if a character with the cartographer or occultant position is part of the expedition, a +1 bonus for each workweek beyond the first that is spent exploring, and a +1 bonus for every additional 200 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to this check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Exploration Discoveries table.": "指挥探险队的人物或工作人员进行智慧（（%0%））检查以确定结果。如果一个拥有制图师或神秘学职位的人物是探险队的一部分，那么这个检查就会获得+2的奖励；在第一个工作周之后，每花一个工作周的时间进行探险，就会获得+1的奖励；在基本费用之外，每多花200金币，就会获得+1的奖励。最大的奖励是+10，可以应用于这个检查。检查的总数决定了结果，如探索发现表所示。",

The franchise's monthly costs increase by 50 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.": "表上显示有重大威胁的结果代表了一个可能完全破坏特许经营权的能力--或者完全摧毁它的发现、事件或实体。这种威胁可能包括发现了一个集结的兽人部落，或者一条龙进入该地区袭击特许经营的贸易路线。在威胁得到解决之前，特许经营权的月度成本会增加50%，具体由DM决定。",
	"A minor threat to the franchise involves uncovering a danger that can disrupt the characters' ability to conduct business effectively. Such threats might arise from stumbling upon the lair of a monster, learning of the machinations of a noble, or discovering a rival's outpost. The franchise's monthly costs increase by 25 percent until the threat is resolved, as determined by the DM.": "对特许经营权的一个小威胁涉及到发现一个可以破坏角色有效开展业务能力的危险。这种威胁可能来自于偶然发现怪物的巢穴，得知贵族的阴谋，或者发现对手的前哨。专营权的月费增加25%，直到威胁被解决为止，具体由DM决定。",
	"The expedition could locate timber, precious metals, or other valuable natural resources; a feature that serves as a lookout or offers defensive value; a location that can serve as a safe house; or the like. Valuable resources lower a franchise's monthly costs by 25 percent for {@dice 1d4 + 1} months. Other natural features can offer material benefits in future gaming sessions. For example, a tall spire of rock could serve as a watchtower, allowing the franchise to gain advance warning of any large-scale forces moving through their territory. A cave network acting as a safe house could allow the franchise to conceal goods or people in times of trouble.": "考察可以找到木材、贵金属或其他有价值的自然资源；可以作为瞭望台或提供防御价值的特征；可以作为安全屋的地点；或类似的东西。有价值的资源可以使特许经营的月度费用降低25%，持续时间为（%0%）个月。其他自然特征可以在未来的游戏环节中提供物质利益。例如，一个高大的岩石尖顶可以作为一个瞭望塔，让特许经营权在任何大规模的力量通过他们的领土时获得预先警告。一个作为安全屋的洞穴网络可以让专营权在遇到麻烦的时候隐藏货物或人员。",
	"A new settlement is discovered in the territory, and the people there are eager to deal. These could be newcomers settling the area or a previously unnoticed village or group of farmsteads.

	"The dwelling of a useful ally, such as a sage or a former franchise member, is discovered. This ally can become a source of lore, providing insights into one or more campaign secrets—for a low, low fee of 100 gp times the franchise tier for each secret.

	"The expedition could instead locate a monster that is either willing to help the party or can be tamed. The challenge rating of the monster is typically equal to franchise rank, and providing for the monster's needs costs 100 gp per month. This monster could serve as a scout or spy, alerting the franchise to danger in its territory. Or it could serve as a mount or guardian and be based in the franchise headquarters. Such a monster remains with the franchise as long as its costs are covered and it is treated well.": "探险队倒是可以找到一个愿意帮助探险队或者可以被驯服的怪物。怪物的挑战等级通常等同于特许经营等级，满足怪物的需求每月需要100金币。这种怪物可以充当侦察员或间谍，提醒特许经营人注意其领土上的危险。或者，它可以作为坐骑或守护者，驻扎在特许经营总部。只要它的费用被支付，并且被善待，这样的怪物就会留在特许经营区。",
	"The DM chooses whether the expedition turns up a natural feature, new customers, or an ally or useful monster, then increases the benefit or reduces the cost of that discovery.

	"A growing franchise often needs fine-tuning to improve its operations and remain lean and capable.

The best plans often end up creating an auxiliary market for \"how-to\" books, such as {@i Can't-Miss Principles of Franchise Reinvisionary Strategery} and{@i  What to Inquire about How to Acquire}. In some campaigns, Head Office might periodically require this task to ensure that a franchise grows effectively.": "一个成长中的特许经营店往往需要进行微调，以改善其运作，并保持精干的能力。效率措施、大胆的新模式、闪亮的商业计划、内部审计和库存管理都可以成为新利润的关键。最好的计划往往最终为 \"如何做 \"的书籍创造了一个辅助市场，如（%0%）和（%1%）。在一些活动中，总部可能会定期要求这项任务，以确保特许经营权的有效增长。",

But it can also expand across a much broader range of activities.

A character with a background related to those they attempt to schmooze gains a +1 bonus to the check (a criminal schmoozing other criminals, a guild artisan schmoozing a guild master, and so forth).": "从事搭讪的人物或工作人员决定他们是想与特定的NPC建立关系，还是与某个团体的任何一般代表建立关系。角色进行魅力（（%0%））检查，以确定他们讨好的效果，如讨好表所示。处于观察者地位的人物在检查中获得+1的奖励。一个与他们试图讨好的人有相关背景的角色会获得+1的检定奖励（一个罪犯讨好其他罪犯，一个行会的工匠讨好一个行会的主人，等等）。",
	"The character's failed schmoozing brings the franchise into disrepute. Any further checks made for the franchise to schmooze NPCs from the same group or organization are made with disadvantage.": "角色的讨好失败会使特许经营权变得不光彩。任何为特许经营权而对同一团体或组织的NPC进行的进一步检查都是不利的。",
	"The character becomes known to those they schmooze, but gains no immediate benefit. If the character undertakes this activity again within the same group or social circle, the next check to schmooze is made with advantage.": "该角色会被他们所结交的人所认识，但不会立即得到好处。如果该人物在同一团体或社交圈内再次进行这项活动，那么在下一次检查讨好人的时候会有优势。",
	"The character successfully establishes the desired contacts, and is treated as a confidante of those they schmoozed.": "该人物成功地建立了所需的联系，并被视为他们所结交的人的知己。",
	"The character establishes the desired contacts and is treated as a trusted friend.": "该人物建立了所需的联系，并被当作一个值得信赖的朋友。",
	"The character establishes the desired contacts and gains a favor as a result of their schmoozing skill.": "该人物建立了所需的联系，并由于他们的讨好技能而获得了一个好处。",
	"If contacts are successfully made, the DM determines which NPCs the franchise is able to ingratiate itself with, how long those relationships last, and what kinds of benefits the franchise might gain. Some schmoozed NPCs might provide only a single minor benefit to the franchise before realizing the one-sided nature of the relationship. Others might hang around wanting to help the franchise for years—whether the characters want them to or not.": "如果成功地进行了接触，DM就会决定特许权能够与哪些NPC建立关系，这些关系持续多长时间，以及特许权可能获得什么样的好处。有些被拉拢的NPC可能只给特许经营权提供了一个小的好处，然后就意识到这种关系的片面性。另一些人可能会在周围徘徊，想要帮助特许经营权多年--无论角色是否希望他们这样做。",
	"A check of 5 or lower made to schmooze automatically triggers a complication. Because the stakes of schmoozing are often high, the DM might decide to have any successful schmooze attempt come with a potential downside. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Schmoozing Complications table.": "讨好的检查结果为5或更低，会自动触发一个复杂情况。由于调情的风险往往很高，所以管理员可以决定让任何成功的调情尝试都有一个潜在的坏处。管理员可以选择一种复杂情况，或者在 \"讨好复杂情况 \"表中进行滚动。",
	"A different group notices the character's schmoozing attempts. Agents threaten to expose the franchise's ulterior motives unless the characters perform a favor or pay a bribe.*": "一个不同的团体注意到这个角色的讨好企图。探员们威胁说，除非角色们帮个忙或行贿，否则就会暴露特许权的别有用心。",
	"To win over a potential contact, the schmoozing character or staff member swore to participate in an initiation ritual from the contact's group... without first learning the nature of that ritual.": "为了赢得潜在的联系人，拉拢的人物或工作人员发誓要参加联系人所在团体的入会仪式......而不先了解该仪式的性质。",
	"A contact becomes convinced that the schmoozing character or staff member intends to leave the franchise and join the contact's organization. It's clear that they'll become hurt or angry when they learn the truth.": "一个联络人开始相信，那个拉拢人心的人物或工作人员打算离开加盟店，加入联络人的组织。很明显，当他们得知真相时，会变得很受伤或愤怒。",
	"In the attempt to win over a contact, it was necessary to reveal one of the franchise's secrets.*": "在试图赢得一个联系人的过程中，有必要透露该特许经营权的一个秘密。",
	"The character or staff member regrets giving a contact a personal item, a drop of blood, or a lock of hair. It seemed like a great idea at the time.*": "角色或工作人员后悔给了联系人一件私人物品，一滴血，或一绺头发。这在当时似乎是个好主意。",
	"Shortly after schmoozing, the character or staff member receives a love letter from a contact—whether that interest is reciprocated or not.*": "聊天后不久，该人物或工作人员就会收到一封来自联系人的情书--无论这种兴趣是否得到回报。",
	"The frenetic pace of adventuring and running a franchise sometimes covers up underlying issues. Has the party's cleric accidentally started worshiping a dark god? Is the majordomo at odds with the occultant's habit of displaying entrails in the great hall? Is the fighter questioning their life choices? The team building activity can help characters work through problems, settle differences, and adjust the work-life balance. In the end, everyone ends up with a healthier working relationship. Or at least that's the plan.": "冒险和经营特许权的狂热节奏有时会掩盖潜在的问题。党的牧师是否意外地开始崇拜一个黑暗的神？大法官是否与神秘主义者在大殿中展示内脏的习惯相抵触？斗士是否在质疑自己的人生选择？团队建设活动可以帮助人物解决问题，解决分歧，并调整工作和生活的平衡。最后，每个人都以更健康的工作关系而告终。或者至少是这样的计划。",
	"At the DM's determination, characters might be directed by Head Office to run this activity each time a new franchise rank is gained, or during times of exceptional chaos or uncertainty.": "根据DM的决定，每次获得新的特许权等级时，或者在特别混乱或不确定的时候，总部可能会指示角色进行这项活动。",
	"Team building requires the involvement of at least two characters, or a character and a staff member. Those individuals must dedicate at least one workweek to this activity, whose particulars are worked out by participating players and the DM. The team building exercise might be a trust-inspiring ropes course, an emotional \"resolve your issues\" workshop, a meeting with an NPC spiritual guide, or any other suitable endeavor. Setting up the exercise incurs expenses of from 50 gp to 250 gp per franchise rank, as determined by the DM.": "团队建设需要至少两个角色，或一个角色和一个工作人员的参与。这些人必须拿出至少一个工作周的时间来进行这项活动，其具体内容由参与的玩家和管理员制定。团队建设活动可以是一个激发信任的绳索课程，一个 \"解决你的问题 \"的情感研讨会，一个与NPC精神向导的会面，或任何其他合适的努力。设置练习的费用为每个特许权等级50到250金币，由DM决定。",
	"Each character or staff member participating in team building chooses another participant, then creates a negative story connection to a bond, ideal, or similar element of that participant's backstory. The players come up with such connections for their own characters. The DM creates connections for franchise staff, either on their own or in consultation with the players. (Characters and staff members do not need to pair up. If everyone else in the franchise has a particular problem with one character, so be it.)": "参加团队建设的每个角色或工作人员选择另一个参与者，然后与该参与者的背景故事中的纽带、理想或类似元素建立负面故事联系。玩家为自己的角色想出这种联系。管理员为特许经营的工作人员建立联系，可以是自己的，也可以是与玩家协商的。(角色和工作人员不需要配对。如果特许经营中的每个人都对某个角色有特殊问题，那就这样吧）。",
	"Each character and staff member then makes a Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check. With the DM's approval, different ability checks and skills might be allowed if they relate to the specifics of the team building exercise. A participant has advantage on their check if the DM decides the story connection was particularly clever or well roleplayed. All checks gain a +1 bonus if one of the characters taking part in the activity is a decisionist.": "然后每个角色和工作人员进行智慧（（%0%））检查。经DM批准，如果与团队建设练习的具体内容有关，可以允许不同的能力检查和技能。如果管理员认为故事的连接特别巧妙或演得很好，那么参与者的检查就有优势。如果参加活动的角色之一是个决策者，所有检查都会获得+1的奖励。",
	"Each check is compared to the Team Building table. The outcome of the check can help redefine the relationships between individual characters, and can establish the tone of roleplaying between characters and franchise staff. Some outcomes also involve a team building memory that provides a potent benefit (see below).": "每一次检查都会与团队建设表进行比较。检查的结果可以帮助重新定义各个角色之间的关系，并且可以确立角色和特许经营人员之间的角色扮演的基调。有些结果还涉及到团队建设的记忆，提供有力的好处（见下文）。",
	"The participant uncovers deep-seated issues between themself and their chosen partner. If this is a character, they have disadvantage on ability checks made in the presence of the partner until the character undertakes this activity again. If this is a staff member, they are traumatized and leave the franchise unless the characters can convince them to stay.": "参与者发现他们自己和他们所选择的伙伴之间的深层问题。如果这是一个角色，他们在伙伴面前进行能力检查时将处于劣势，直到该角色再次进行这项活动。如果这是一个工作人员，他们会受到创伤并离开特许经营权，除非角色能说服他们留下。",

	"The participant sees themself and their connection to the other participant in a whole new way. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and they gain a team building memory (see below).": "参与者以一种全新的方式看待自己以及自己与其他参与者的联系。如果这是一个角色，他们在下一次在特许经营或停工活动中进行检查时有优势，并获得一个团队建设记忆（见下文）。",
	"The participant has had an awakening, gaining a deep sense of who they can become and their connection to their partner. The character has advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and gains two team building memories.": "参与者有了觉醒，对自己能成为谁以及与伙伴的联系有了深刻的认识。该角色在下一次在特许经营或停工活动中进行检查时具有优势，并获得两个团队建设记忆。",
	"The most potent personal changes inspired by team building can last a lifetime. Or at least an encounter. A character who earns a team building memory gains an extraordinary ability that can be used once. As a bonus action, the character gains one effect of the {@spell enhance ability} spell for 10 minutes (no concentration required).": "由团队建设激发的最有力的个人变化可以持续一生。或者至少是一次邂逅。一个获得团队建设记忆的角色会获得一个可以使用一次的非凡能力。作为一个额外的动作，该角色获得了一个{@spell enhance ability}的法术效果，持续10分钟（不需要集中注意力）。",
	"A character can retain team building memories only from the most recent instance of this activity. If a character has unused team building memories and undertakes this activity again, those memories are lost.": "一个角色只能保留最近一次活动中的团队建设记忆。如果一个角色有未使用的团队建设记忆并再次进行这项活动，这些记忆就会丢失。",
	"Wait, we're a team? I thought we were independent entities with temporarily aligned goals.": "等等，我们是一个团队？我以为我们是目标暂时一致的独立实体。",

	"The team building activity is revealed to actually be a death trap, an island of doom, or a similar challenge. The DM determines whether this was an honest mix-up, the act of a disgruntled staff member, or the actions of a rival.*": "团队建设活动被发现实际上是一个死亡陷阱，一个厄运之岛，或类似的挑战。管理员决定这是否是一个诚实的混淆，是一个不满的工作人员的行为，还是一个对手的行为。",
	"Upon hearing what took place during the team building exercise, uninvolved staff members decide that the franchise is subjecting them to too much trauma. Some staff members might threaten to quit, or decide they want more benefits.": "在听到团队建设演习中发生的事情后，没有参与的员工决定，特许经营权让他们受到了太多的创伤。一些工作人员可能威胁要辞职，或者决定要更多的福利。",
	"It's revealed that the team building exercise was set up by a rival as an opportunity to ambush the participants, or to attack the franchise headquarters while the characters were away.*": "据透露，这次团队建设活动是由一个对手设置的，目的是为了伏击参与者，或者在人物不在时袭击特许经营总部。",
	"The participants learn way too much about each other. Each character participating in the activity must select a bond, ideal, or similar background aspect from their partner and come up with a story explaining how this becomes a conflict for them.": "参与者对彼此了解得太多了。参加活动的每个角色必须从他们的伙伴那里选择一个纽带、理想或类似的背景方面，并想出一个故事，解释这如何成为他们的冲突。",
	"Staff members who did not participate in the team building exercise feel left out, and morale drops at the franchise. The characters must find a way to raise staff spirits that does not involve running this activity again.": "没有参加团队建设活动的员工感到被冷落了，专营店的士气也下降了。角色们必须找到一种方法来提高员工的精神状态，而不需要再次开展这项活动。",
	"A staff member involved in the activity is secretly a member of a rival organization, or has been duped into doing that organization's bidding. During the team building exercise, the rival organization plans to steal franchise secrets or destroy the participants' morale.*": "参与活动的工作人员暗地里是敌对组织的成员，或者被骗去为该组织服务。在团队建设活动中，对手组织计划窃取特许经营权的秘密或破坏参与者的士气。",
	"At Acquisitions Incorporated, no one ever asks, \"Should it be done?\" Instead they ask, \"How can it be done—and then how do we turn what we've done into cold, hard cash?\" It's this kind of forward thinking that brings new power and magical understanding to the world—and which keeps the Acq Inc humanoid resources team constantly on the lookout for new talent.": "在收购公司，从来没有人问 \"是否应该这样做\"？相反，他们会问：\"如何才能做到--然后我们如何将我们所做的事情变成冷酷无情的现金？\" 正是这种前瞻性思维给世界带来了新的力量和神奇的理解，并使Acq公司的类人资源团队不断寻找新的人才。",

	"This chapter also presents a new race inspired by the chaotic drive to achieve that underlies every Acq Inc campaign, as well as a number of spells with a decidedly financial flair.

They live prosperous, respectable lives, leaving the world a better place than they found it.": "无数的人来自充满爱的、培养人的家庭。通过努力工作、干净的生活和明智的决定，他们在自己的工作中表现出色。他们过着富裕、受人尊敬的生活，给世界留下一个比他们发现的更好的地方。",
	"You're not one of them.": "你不是他们中的一员。",

Or you might be an incredible jackass. But whatever your circumstances, you are now entering a new phase of your life. The earning potential of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise has given many wayward and lost souls a new lease on life. Those who scoffed at you or kicked you while you were down might soon be kissing up to you.": "在这条路上的某个地方，有些事情出了问题。也许是运气不好。情况可能已经密谋将你置于一个不可能的境地。你可能得到了命运女神的眷顾。或者你可能是一个不可思议的傻瓜。但无论你的情况如何，你现在正进入你人生的一个新阶段。收购公司特许经营权的盈利潜力给了许多迷失方向的灵魂一个新的生命。那些嘲笑你或趁你不备踢你的人可能很快就会对你拍马屁。",

	"Strength, endurance, and fighting don't necessarily have to come from unresolved childhood issues or a brooding, roiling well of anger. Primal instincts are valuable, but there are plenty of primal forces in the world—including the unrestrained drive for wealth, power, and everything that comes with it.": "力量、耐力和战斗力不一定要来自于未解决的童年问题或忧郁的、咆哮的愤怒之井。原始的本能是有价值的，但世界上有很多原始的力量--包括对财富、权力和随之而来的一切不受约束的驱动。",
	"For every CEO building up or bringing down businesses, it's a safe bet that there's a barbarian standing behind them. Often literally, with a large weapon in hand, and waiting for the order to go out and remove vital organs from another CEO. Corporate barbarians are the muscle behind the civil face of a franchise. It's not that they enjoy losing their composure and having to make other people's nice clothes all bloody, but some circumstances require carefully applied martial force. And others require the same thing, but with a lot less care.": "对于每一位建立或摧毁企业的CEO来说，可以肯定的是，他们身后站着一个野蛮人。往往是字面上的意思，手里拿着大型武器，等待着命令，去摘取另一位CEO的重要器官。公司的野蛮人是一个特许经营权的民间面孔背后的肌肉。这并不是说他们喜欢失去冷静，不得不把别人的漂亮衣服弄得血淋淋的，但有些情况需要谨慎地使用武力。而其他情况也需要同样的东西，但不那么小心。",
	"As a barbarian in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, you're not all about killing. Maiming and disfigurement are also a big part of the job. Permanently eliminating someone who owes your franchise money or who double-crossed you on a deal sends a short, clear message. But leaving them hobbling when they walk or incapable of eating without a team of specialists sends a glorious, evocative poem—the kind of violent sonnet that resonates not just with the recipient, but with bystanders as well.": "作为收购公司活动中的野蛮人，你并不是只负责杀人。残害和毁容也是工作的重要组成部分。永久性地消灭欠你特许经营权的人或在交易中出卖你的人，可以传达一个简短而明确的信息。但是，让他们走路时步履蹒跚，或者在没有专家团队的情况下无法进食，则是一首辉煌的、令人回味的诗--那种暴力十四行诗，不仅能引起接受者的共鸣，也能引起旁观者的共鸣。",
	"To maximize the power of your intimidation, you need to make sure the world knows who's delivering it. That's why you employ a tool of your trade: the signature item.

	"Unlike your wilder cousins, your connection to the spirit world is a little less woodsy and a little more civilized. However, that doesn't mean you still can't invoke the power of a totem creature when you need it. Rather than calling upon the bear, eagle, or wolf as your totem, you might gain the same features by calling upon more urban creatures.": "与你的野性表亲不同，你与精神世界的联系少了些许森林气息，多了些许文明气息。然而，这并不意味着你仍然不能在需要时调用图腾生物的力量。与其召唤熊、鹰或狼作为你的图腾，你可能通过召唤更多的城市生物来获得同样的功能。",

	"You might not be particularly faithful, but your dedication to your job can easily be mistaken for a kind of religious zeal. For long years, that dedication has been a force that guides you, granting you abilities beyond those of other skilled warriors. Rather than worshiping Tempus or Bane, Gruumsh or Tyr, you instead bow down before the altar of your own superiority, channeling your ego to drive your franchise's success.": "你可能不是特别忠诚，但你对工作的奉献很容易被误认为是一种宗教狂热。多年来，这种奉献精神一直是指导你的力量，赋予你超越其他熟练战士的能力。你没有崇拜天普斯或班恩、格鲁姆什或泰尔，而是在你自己的优越性的祭坛前俯首称臣，用你的自我来推动你的特许经营的成功。",
	"Seeming a \"square peg\" for the task at first glance, a barbarian might be an excellent choice, as they would destroy both the round hole and their own corners in the attempt to serve. It would be neat to see if this worked outside of an analogy.": "乍看之下，野蛮人可能是一个很好的选择，因为他们会在试图服务的过程中同时破坏圆洞和自己的角落。看看这在类比之外是否可行，会很有意思。",
	"Singing songs and strumming lutes might be fine for most bards. Who doesn't like a rousing shanty now and then? But standing in a crowded tavern playing for copper pieces tossed by commoners isn't for everyone—and it certainly isn't for bards in the Acq Inc world. The power and magic tied up in the voice of a franchise bard is meant for greater things. More profitable things.": "唱歌和弹琴对大多数吟游诗人来说可能都不错。谁不喜欢时不时地唱一首振奋人心的小调？但是，站在拥挤的酒馆里为平民抛出的铜币演奏并不是每个人都能做到的，当然也不是Acq公司世界里的吟游诗人。专营吟游诗人的声音所蕴含的力量和魔力是为了更伟大的事情。更有利可图的事情。",
	"Adventuring and commerce are where the true lessons of life are learned, and your bardic magic guarantees your mastery of those lessons. Your love of music has shown you that the world of commerce is a finely tuned instrument in its own right—and you're just the one to pluck it.": "冒险和商业是学习生活的真正课程的地方，而你的吟游诗人魔法保证了你对这些课程的掌握。你对音乐的热爱让你看到，商业世界本身就是一件精巧的乐器，而你正是弹奏它的人。",
	"As a bard, you're known as the go-to figure when things need to get done. Your tremendous array of skills and abilities mean that you're often the first one called upon to do the hard jobs. And if you're going to do something difficult, you might as well do it with panache. Since most of your franchise compatriots likely think \"panache\" is some kind of elven delicacy, it's all the more impressive.": "作为一个吟游诗人，当事情需要完成时，你是众所周知的首选人物。你巨大的技能和能力意味着你常常是第一个被要求做困难工作的人。如果你要做一些困难的事情，你可能会做得很潇洒。由于你的大多数特许经营同胞可能认为 \"潇洒 \"是某种精灵的美味，这更令人印象深刻。",
	"Jumping a small pit? Land with the flourish of a world-class gymnast! Slaying a kobold? Take it down with a legendary oath, and no one will realize that an asthmatic farmhand could have done the same thing with a rusty sickle. Running across a room?

	"When others pick on you about being a bard, you need only remind them that you and you alone have the power to insult creatures to death. Just the other day, your harsh word about a goblin's haircut caused it to keel over, bleeding from its ears. But with such great power comes the great responsibility—of not being lame. When you use your spells and class features to denigrate your enemies into an early grave, you need to have a number of tried and true zingers at hand to add the perfect insult to the ultimate injury.": "当别人挑剔你是个吟游诗人时，你只需提醒他们，只有你才有能力侮辱生物，让它们死亡。就在前几天，你对一个地精的发型说了句狠话，导致它倒地不起，耳朵流血不止。但如此强大的力量也带来了巨大的责任--不做跛子。当你用你的法术和等级特征来诋毁你的敌人，让他们早点死掉的时候，你需要手头有一些久经考验和真正的嘲讽，以增加对最终伤害的完美侮辱。",

	"The lessons taught by the College of Glamour are right in your wheelhouse. Being able to make friends and influence people is the bread and butter of your profession.

	"The College of Whispers teaches a skill set that's attractive in terms of its power, but which can be incredibly off-putting to anyone with any moral compass.

Otherwise, you'll never gain the much-needed trust that's part and parcel of being an effective business leader.": "窃窃私语学院教授的技能在力量方面很有吸引力，但对于任何有道德底线的人来说，这可能是令人难以置信的反感。值得庆幸的是，这对你来说永远不会是个问题。扰乱他人思想的能力是一种需要谨慎和明智地使用的技能。否则，你将永远无法获得急需的信任，而这正是成为一个有效的商业领袖的一部分和组成部分。",
	"If you think wading through scores of undead in a haunted crypt or channeling divine power to keep your party alive gets the adrenaline flowing, you should try keeping the peace at a corporate board meeting. Or managing the hostile takeover of a rival. Try negotiating merchandising rights.

	"Thankfully, your business acumen draws on insight that's literally out of this world. As an emissary of divine will, you possess the guiding wisdom that every franchise needs, and the knowledge that your business plans are always the best ones.

	"Despite their supposed wisdom, many common clerics fail to grasp the simple concept of using the best tool for the job. To the devoted priest of Tempus, every problem is just begging to be solved by a formal declaration of war. A cleric of Bane has never met a minion they couldn't wait to kick around. Lathander's clerics are all sunshine and happiness, even when they should be hiding in dark places to avoid danger.": "尽管他们有所谓的智慧，但许多普通的神职人员未能掌握使用最好的工具来完成工作的简单概念。对Tempus的忠实牧师来说，每一个问题都是在乞求通过正式宣战来解决。班恩的牧师从来没有遇到过他们迫不及待要踢的奴才。拉桑德的教士都是阳光和快乐的，即使他们应该躲在黑暗的地方以避免危险。",
	"As a cleric in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, you'll carefully choose your deity so that the domains of your divine patron synergize seamlessly with the goals of your franchise. But at the same time, you understand that the greatest thing about the gods is their prolificacy. With so many deities in so many pantheons, all of them have their own stock to sell. As such, even though you have your own personal favorite, you've also learned the value of diversifying your divine portfolio, keeping an array of holy symbols and icons on hand for any occasion.": "作为收购公司活动中的牧师，你会仔细选择你的神灵，以便你的神灵守护者的领域与你的特许经营的目标完美地结合起来。但与此同时，你也明白，神灵最伟大的地方在于他们的多产性。在这么多的万神殿中，有这么多的神灵，他们都有自己的股票可以出售。因此，即使你有自己的个人最爱，你也学会了使你的神明组合多样化的价值，为任何场合保持一系列神圣的符号和图标。",
	"From the most notable nobles to the most humble members of the working class, everyone needs faith and spiritual guidance. And what better way to teach the value of faith to others than to make sure the value of faith is measured in gp. In addition to your franchise's regular operations, you always keep a sideline going in religious paraphernalia, selling specialized signature items to select markets. By showing the world that faith is your business, you can ensure that business is always booming.": "从最引人注目的贵族到最卑微的工人阶级成员，每个人都需要信仰和精神指导。而有什么比确保信仰的价值是用金币来衡量的更好的方式来教导他人信仰的价值呢。除了你的特许经营的常规业务，你总是在宗教用品方面保持副业，向选定的市场出售专门的招牌商品。通过向世界展示信仰是你的事业，你可以确保生意永远兴隆。",

	"This dwarven deity of greed gets a bad rap. Because seriously, greed is just another form of the fundamental urge for survival. If gold is power and power is life, then the more gold you accumulate, the better and longer your life will be. Why is it that people who have money and power are admired and respected, yet people who stop at nothing to attain money and power are \"avaricious\" or \"materialistic\" or \"felons\"? Abbathor might be looked down upon and called evil for the lengths his followers sometimes go to in the pursuit of wealth, but the power he represents is the end goal of many an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.": "这个矮人的贪婪之神被说得很糟糕。因为说真的，贪婪只是生存的基本冲动的另一种形式。如果黄金就是权力，权力就是生命，那么你积累的黄金越多，你的生命就越好，越长。为什么拥有金钱和权力的人受到钦佩和尊重，而不惜一切代价获得金钱和权力的人却是 \"贪婪 \"或 \"物质主义 \"或 \"重罪犯\"？阿巴瑟可能会因为他的追随者有时为追求财富所做的努力而被看不起，被称为邪恶，但他所代表的权力是许多收购公司特许经营的最终目标。",
	"When they coined the phrase \"making a deal with the devil,\" this is the devil they were talking about. The Lords of the Nine Hells are the original CEOs of some of the multiverse's most profitable megacorporations, and Asmodeus is their master. If you want a model for efficiency and motivation in an organization, look no further than the infernal expanse of Nessus. You want to talk about a perfect sales pitch and a diabolically intricate contract? Asmodeus has you covered. Many civilized nations don't even count worshiping Asmodeus as a crime, unless you get into those nasty side trips of humanoid sacrifice and the like. But as long as you remain cognizant of not wanting to throw away potential customers that way, how much risk of going down that path could there be?": "当他们创造了 \"与魔鬼做交易 \"的短语时，这就是他们所说的魔鬼。九层地狱的领主是多元宇宙中一些最赚钱的巨型公司的原始CEO，而阿斯莫德是他们的主人。如果你想要一个组织的效率和动机的模型，那就不要再看了，就像内瑟斯的地狱般的广阔。你想谈一个完美的推销和一个邪恶的复杂的合同？阿斯莫德斯就能满足你。许多文明国家甚至不把崇拜阿斯莫德算作犯罪，除非你涉及到那些讨厌的人形牺牲之类的副作用。但只要你保持清醒的认识，不希望以这种方式丢掉潜在的客户，走这条路的风险能有多大？",
	"Death is a serious business. Literally. Jergal is a lesser deity who works alongside Kelemvor, the god of the dead. But whereas Kelemvor sees to the more metaphysical side of death, Jergal sees to the details. Where did sweet Nana want to be buried? What rites did your dearly departed love want performed? And how much of a donation to the church will you be making to see those things done? As an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric devoted to Jergal, you understand that there are only two sure things in this world: death, and getting paid to do something with the body.": "死亡是一件严肃的事情。从字面上讲。Jergal是与死神Kelemvor一起工作的次等神。但凯莱莫尔负责死亡的形而上方面，而杰尔格则负责细节方面。可爱的娜娜想被埋在哪里？你亲爱的爱人想要举行什么仪式？你要给教堂捐多少钱才能看到这些事情的完成？作为一个致力于Jergal的收购公司教士，你知道在这个世界上只有两件肯定的事情：死亡，以及拿钱来做一些尸体的事情。",
	"The Lady of Joy brings merriment, happiness, and fun to the world. And there's nothing people will pay more for than merriment, happiness, and fun. As a cleric worshiping Lliira, you open yourself up to become a vessel for the goddess's joy—for a price, of course. Because surely, if joy sustains the soul just as food sustains the body, then there's nothing wrong with making a bit of profit from happiness.": "欢乐女士给世界带来欢乐、幸福和乐趣。没有什么比快乐、幸福和乐趣更能让人们付出代价的了。作为一个崇拜Lliira的教士，你敞开自己，成为女神快乐的容器--当然，是有代价的。因为毫无疑问，如果快乐能维持灵魂，就像食物能维持身体一样，那么从快乐中赚取一点利润也没什么不对。",
	"The Master of All Thieves is an important deity for Acquisitions Incorporated characters to be aware of. Mask is the god of acquisition, after all, and governs the secrets that any successful Acq Inc franchise will be dealing in. Whether personal, professional, or business-related, secrets are an important component of gaining leverage over others. Moreover, your successful franchise will eventually have many secrets of its own that you desperately need to keep quiet.": "所有盗贼的主人是收购公司角色需要注意的一个重要神灵。毕竟，面具是收购之神，它掌管着任何成功的收购公司特许经营权所涉及的秘密。无论是个人的、专业的，还是与商业有关的，秘密都是获得对他人影响力的重要组成部分。此外，你的成功的特许经营权最终会有许多自己的秘密，你迫切需要保持沉默。",
	"Everyone knows the adage that knowledge is power, but no one believes it more than the worshipers of Oghma. As a follower of the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge, you seek knowledge for its own sake. But as a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you understand further that knowledge is just the first component of any business plan, and that turning knowledge into power requires a consistent amount of the follow-up action that your franchise is famous for.": "每个人都知道知识就是力量这句格言，但没有人比奥格玛的崇拜者更相信它。作为灵感、发明和知识之神的追随者，你为其自身而寻求知识。但作为收购公司的成员，你进一步了解到，知识只是任何商业计划的第一个组成部分，而将知识转化为力量需要持续不断的后续行动，这也是你的特许经营权所闻名的。",
	"The wise know that people are defined by their desires as much as anything else, and the Princess of Passion is the patron of desires. In the battle of logic versus passion, it's passion that guides mortals and gods more often than not. As an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric of Sune, your intimate understanding of passion—or, better yet, your skill at manipulating the passions of others—can be a huge boon to the operation of a successful franchise.": "智者知道，人们是由他们的欲望决定的，而激情公主是欲望的守护者。在逻辑与激情的较量中，往往是激情在引导凡人和神灵。作为收购公司的苏妮教士，你对激情的深刻理解--或者，更好的是，你操纵他人激情的技能--可以成为一个成功的特许经营运作的巨大助力。",
	"Luck is a lady tonight! And, as it turns out, every night. The goddess of fortune is known as Lady Luck, and every adventurer knows the importance of keeping luck on their side. As a pragmatic Acq Inc cleric of Tymora, you know that only stupid people ask the rhetorical question, \"Would you rather be lucky or good at something?\" Because no matter how good you are, you'll eventually have the bad luck of facing off against someone who's a whole lot better. When that happens, good luck is the only thing that's going to save you.": "今晚的运气是一位女士! 而且，事实证明，每晚都是如此。财富女神被称为幸运女神，每个冒险家都知道保持幸运的重要性。作为一个务实的Acq公司的泰莫拉教士，你知道只有愚蠢的人才会问这样一个反问句：\"你是愿意走运还是愿意做好一件事？\" 因为无论你有多好，你最终都会有运气不好的时候，面对的是比你强很多的人。当这种情况发生时，好运气是唯一能拯救你的东西。",
	"The Coinmaiden is the de facto patron of anyone who trades goods or services for payment. And thankfully, her relative ambivalence toward the laws underlying fair trade and honoring deals makes Waukeen a perfect fit for an Acquisitions Incorporated cleric. Regardless of your best intentions, ensuring the success of your franchise means eventually having to gingerly step across some ethical or moral line. Or having to hide the fact that your franchise companions have been busy erasing the line completely.": "Coinmaiden是任何以交易货物或服务来获取报酬的人的事实上的赞助人。值得庆幸的是，她对公平交易和尊重交易的法律的相对矛盾态度使沃肯成为收购公司教士的完美人选。无论你的意图如何，确保你的特许经营权的成功意味着最终不得不小心翼翼地跨过一些伦理或道德的界限。或者不得不掩盖一个事实，即你的特许经营同伴们一直在忙着完全抹去这条线。",
	"At first glance, druids might not seem the best fit for an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, with its frequent forays into urban settings and its focus on treasure procurement and business considerations. But the primal power wielded by druids reflects the relentless cycles of nature, which in turn make a remarkably prescient model for business. Growth and stagnation. Boom and bust. It's all there, writ large in the passage of the seasons and the ancient dance of bigger creatures consuming smaller creatures. And let's face it, those smaller creatures probably had it coming to them.": "乍一看，德鲁伊似乎并不适合收购公司的活动，因为它经常进入城市环境，并专注于宝藏采购和商业考虑。但德鲁伊挥舞的原始力量反映了自然界无情的循环，这反过来又为商业提供了非常有预见性的模式。增长和停滞。繁荣和萧条。这一切都在那里，在季节的流逝和古代大型生物吞噬小型生物的舞蹈中写得很清楚。让我们面对现实吧，那些较小的生物可能是自食其果。",
	"Druids are natural-born leaders. We are beasts of war and shepherds of balance. People might underestimate you for your \"simple\" ways, but your teeth will find their flesh all the same. Not that I condone eating your party members, of course. Only when absolutely necessary.": "德鲁伊是天生的领导者。我们是战争的野兽和平衡的牧羊人。人们可能会因为你的 \"简单 \"方式而低估你，但你的牙齿还是会找到他们的肉。当然，我并不是纵容吃你的党员。只有在绝对必要的时候。",

When a veritable army of natural things that want to eat you stands between your franchise and profit, you're the one the other party members are looking to for guidance.": "一些最有利可图的遗迹和怪物巢穴恰好位于世界上未开化的荒野中，很不方便。作为一个收购公司的德鲁伊，你的专长是让你的队伍以最大的利润和最少的流血来进出这些地区。(好吧，反正是你的血。）当一支名副其实的想吃你的自然物大军挡在你的特许经营权和利润之间时，你是其他党员所期待的指导者。",
	"Almost as importantly, every adventuring group bent on exploiting the natural world to gain resources and power needs a conservation expert to tell them when they've gone too far. After all, only fools would destroy their environment in the name of vast profits. Right?": "几乎同样重要的是，每一个一心想利用自然界来获得资源和权力的冒险团都需要一个保护专家来告诉他们什么时候做得太过分了。毕竟，只有傻瓜才会以巨大的利润为名破坏他们的环境。对吗？",
	"Branding is everything. Whenever you take on a wild shape form, you do so with a unique bit of personal style that lets folks know you're a beast to be reckoned with.": "品牌是一切。每当你采取一种狂野的形式，你就会带着独特的个人风格，让人们知道你是一个不可忽视的野兽。",
	"Your pelt is rich hues of gold and silver so bright that they reflect light.": "你的皮毛是丰富的金色和银色的色调，如此明亮，可以反射光线。",
	"When you take wild shape form, it's a painful, squelchy process that usually leaves your fellow adventurers queasy.": "当你采取野生形状的形式时，这是一个痛苦的、挤压的过程，通常会让你的同伴感到恶心。",
	"Your wild shape forms all wear an identical ceremonial bracelet on one limb, decorated with teeth.": "你们的野性形态都在一个肢体上戴着一个相同的仪式手镯，上面装饰着牙齿。",

	"When you switch back to your normal form, one hand always manages to retain its fur or feathers for a short while.": "当你切换回你的正常形态时，一只手总是能够短暂地保留其毛皮或羽毛。",
	"Even the most urban of locations feature sites of natural beauty and primal energy. You quickly become familiar with all such locations in the towns and cities you frequent, making them places for prayer, meditation, and arboreal solace. In addition to hanging out in parks or arboretums (or creating parks and arboretums in vacant lots when no one's looking), you might also be called upon to tend to struggling foliage or sick animals, eliminate threats to natural spaces, or serve as a font of horticultural and biological lore to folk in the area.": "即使是最城市化的地方，也有自然美景和原始能量的场所。你很快就会熟悉你经常去的城镇中的所有这些地点，使它们成为祈祷、冥想和树丛中的慰藉。除了在公园或植物园里闲逛（或在没人注意的时候在空地上创建公园和植物园），你还可能被要求照顾挣扎的树叶或生病的动物，消除对自然空间的威胁，或作为该地区的园艺和生物传说的来源。",
	"A cemetery that acts as a de facto park": "一个作为事实上的公园的公墓",
	"A museum hosting rare plants and animals from other lands": "一个收藏来自其他国家的稀有植物和动物的博物馆",

	"Though you might split your franchise life between the rural and the urban worlds, you never forget the wilderness where you came from. Because you've brought a piece of that wilderness with you. An unusual creature that came under your care when you were younger remains a part of your life, whether because you've decided you're the only person who can properly look after it, or vice versa.": "虽然你可能会在农村和城市世界之间分割你的特许经营生活，但你永远不会忘记你来自的荒野。因为你已经带来了那片荒野的一部分。在你年轻时受到你照顾的一种不寻常的生物仍然是你生活的一部分，无论是因为你决定你是唯一能适当照顾它的人，还是反之亦然。",

	"Though many druid circles are inspired by and focused on the natural world, even the most woodsy circles can fit into an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign with surprising ease.": "虽然许多德鲁伊圈子的灵感来自于自然界，并专注于自然界，但即使是最有木头味的圈子也能以令人惊讶的方式融入收购公司的活动中。",
	"Normally, druids who come from the Circle of Dreams have a connection to the dreamy lands of the Feywild. As an Acquisitions Incorporated druid, you maintain this connection and expand it, embracing the marketing potential of dreams and positive energy. This effluence of radiance and light is meant to be harnessed, shaped, and shared with as many people as possible. And if they're willing to pay for that sharing, so much the better.": "通常，来自 \"梦之圈 \"的德鲁伊与 \"仙境 \"的梦幻之地有一种联系。作为一个收购公司的德鲁伊，你保持这种联系并扩大它，拥抱梦想和正能量的营销潜力。这种光芒和光线的涌流是为了被利用，被塑造，并与尽可能多的人分享。如果他们愿意为这种分享付费，那就更好了。",
	"Any organization that wants to make an imprint on the world needs to employ an environmental consultant, ensuring that they're engaging with the land in a sustainable and efficient manner. As a druid of the Circle of the Land, your role in your franchise makes extensive use of your knowledge of nature. Your expertise ensures that the exploits of the franchise don't disturb nature—and just as importantly, prevent nature from disturbing the franchise.": "任何想要在世界留下印记的组织都需要雇佣一名环境顾问，以确保他们以可持续和有效的方式与土地打交道。作为 \"土地之环 \"的德鲁伊，你在你的特许经营中的角色广泛利用了你对自然的知识。你的专业知识可以确保专营权的开发不会干扰自然，同样重要的是，防止自然干扰专营权。",
	"Circle of the Moon druids are known for the myriad animal forms they wear, but those forms need not tie you to the wilderness. In rat form, you can slip past the sentries of a well-guarded guildhall to secure trade secrets. On a risky urban operation, you can adopt the form of a pigeon or an alley cat to be your party's chief scout and spy. And in a pinch, your most combat-focused animal forms make you an excellent hand at black ops, able to infiltrate, extricate, or eradicate with equal verve.": "月圆德鲁伊以他们所穿戴的无数动物形态而闻名，但这些形态不需要将你束缚在荒野中。在老鼠的形态下，你可以溜过守卫森严的市政厅的哨兵，以确保贸易机密。在一次危险的城市行动中，你可以采用鸽子或胡同猫的形态，成为你的团队的首席侦察员和间谍。在紧要关头，你最注重战斗力的动物形态使你成为秘密行动的一把好手，能够以同样的勇气进行渗透、解救或铲除。",
	"The world is a dangerous place, and the innocent always need champions to keep the figurative and literal wolves at bay. Others in your circle focus on protecting the helpless creatures of the wild from natural and unnatural threats. But your vow of protection extends to the common folk as well, recognizing that they are just as much a part of the natural world—and are often just as scared and helpless as any creature left to the mercy of that world.": "世界是一个危险的地方，无辜的人总是需要拥护者来阻止具象的和字面的狼群。你们圈子里的其他人专注于保护无助的野生生物，使其免受自然和非自然的威胁。但你的保护誓言也延伸到了普通人身上，因为你认识到他们也是自然界的一部分--而且往往和任由自然界摆布的任何生物一样害怕和无助。",
	"Some fight to slake bloodlust. Others fight for the thrill of besting an enemy. Some fight for a code, a faith, or an ideal. But a true pragmatist fights only for coin, understanding that battle is a means to an end and not an end in itself. A fighter in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign often fights for money above all else, whether focusing on a primary role as a combat specialist or providing martial backup for the franchise as needs be.": "有些人战斗是为了满足嗜血的欲望。其他人则是为了战胜敌人的快感而战斗。有些人是为了一种准则、一种信仰或一种理想而战。但真正的实用主义者只为钱而战，明白战斗是达到目的的一种手段，而不是目的本身。在收购公司的活动中，战士往往为钱而战，无论是专注于作为战斗专家的主要角色，还是在需要时为特许经营提供武术支援，都是如此。",
	"Whether your intention is to end a target's threat or simply deliver a message (violently or otherwise), those around you can take comfort in knowing that when you take on a job, the job gets done. When your franchise loses its direction or collective nerve, you stand tall with the power of your convictions and an even more powerful assortment of weapons to keep things on track. If that sometimes inspires a need to crack some rival skulls, that's just the way of war. And if those skulls sometimes turn out to belong to people on your own side of the ledger, well, that's just business.": "无论你的目的是结束目标的威胁还是简单地传递信息（暴力或其他方式），你周围的人都可以感到安慰，因为他们知道，当你接受一项工作时，工作就会完成。当你的特许经营权失去方向或集体神经时，你会以你的信念和更强大的武器种类来保持事情的正常进行。如果这有时会激发你去打碎一些对手的头颅，这就是战争的方式。如果这些头骨有时是属于你自己一方的人，那么，这就是生意。",
	"You are anything but reckless, however, recognizing the effort that goes into doing a job right. Berserkers flailing about the battlefield and challenging all comers have a certain amount of flamboyance, sure. But you can't spend the coin you've been promised for a job if the job leaves you dead.": "然而，你并不鲁莽，你认识到为做好一项工作所做的努力。狂热者在战场上耀武扬威，挑战所有来者，当然有一定的浮夸性。但如果工作让你死了，你就不能花钱买工作的承诺。",
	"No combat tactic is too down-and-dirty when your life and the welfare of your franchise are on the line. Smart fighters use any means necessary to gain the edge in battle, whether those tricks were learned from a long-gone drill instructor, first used by an opponent against you, or an original tactic perfected by long hours of training.": "当你的生命和你的特许经营权的福利处于危险之中时，任何战斗策略都不会太过低级和肮脏。聪明的战士会使用任何必要的手段在战斗中获得优势，无论这些技巧是向早已逝去的教官学习的，还是被对手首先用来对付你，或者是通过长时间的训练完善的原创战术。",
	"You are an expert at pretending you've been injured to the point where you can't possibly go on. By goading foes to finish you off, you keep your allies safe as you reveal how much fight you still have in you.": "你是假装自己已经受伤到不可能继续下去的专家。通过诱导敌人将你干掉，你可以保证你的盟友安全，因为你揭示了你还有多少战斗力。",
	"You always keep a small pouch of salt or sand at your belt. If you can blind an opponent, even momentarily, you can usually end a fight quickly.": "你的腰带上总是放着一小袋盐或沙子。如果你能使对手失明，哪怕是一时的，你通常可以迅速结束战斗。",
	"You fight with your off hand at the start of a battle, so that your opponent sets their defenses and attacks to one side. Then you quickly switch hands at the most opportune moment, making your foe wonder what other tricks you might play.": "在战斗开始时，你用你的假手作战，这样你的对手就会把他们的防御和攻击放在一边。然后你在最合适的时刻迅速换手，让你的敌人怀疑你还会玩什么花样。",
	"Swearing, name-calling, political satire—you do it all. You make use of a range of down-and-dirty fighting epithets that would make an ogre barbarian blush.": "脏话、骂人、政治讽刺--你都会做。你使用了一系列下流的战斗术语，这些术语会让食人魔野蛮人脸红。",
	"You constantly converse with your opponents during the battle, doing whatever you can to distract them or get into their heads. It's surprising how many combatants enter a fight not knowing whether their boots have come untied.": "你在战斗中不断地与你的对手交谈，尽你所能分散他们的注意力或进入他们的头脑。令人惊讶的是，有多少战斗人员在进入战斗时不知道他们的靴子是否已经解开。",
	"You have a belt pouch specially made to release ball bearings or caltrops in the thick of the fight, forcing your enemies to avoid those hazards while fending off your blows.": "你有一个专门用于在战斗中释放滚珠轴承或卡尔特罗的腰包，迫使你的敌人在抵御你的打击的同时避开这些危险物。",
	"It might seem ridiculous to say that your weapon, armor, or shield is your best friend and most stalwart companion—but you'll take that risk. If you had to choose between entering a battle without your favorite combat gear or without the party's bard, Singy McLuteface can sit this one out. You and your equipment have got this.": "说你的武器、盔甲或盾牌是你最好的朋友和最坚定的伙伴似乎很可笑--但你会冒这个险。如果你不得不在没有你最喜欢的战斗装备或没有党的吟游诗人的情况下进入战斗，辛吉-麦克卢特脸可以坐视不理。你和你的装备有这个能力。",
	"Your piece of signature equipment is more than a tool that has never let you down. It lets others know who you are on the battlefield. Even when your features are obscured by the blood of the fallen, the dust of a well-trodden arena, or the fog of war, allies and enemies alike take notice when you stalk the battlefield.": "你的标志性装备不仅仅是一个从未让你失望的工具。它让别人知道你在战场上是谁。即使你的特征被阵亡者的鲜血、饱经沧桑的竞技场的尘土或战争的迷雾所掩盖，当你在战场上徘徊时，盟友和敌人都会注意到。",
	"Handcrafted arrows whose heads bear the mark of a lightning bolt, and which give a distinctive whistle when fired": "手工制作的箭，其头部有闪电的标记，发射时发出独特的哨声。",
	"A shield made from the shell of a giant turtle": "用大海龟的壳做成的盾牌",
	"A matching shortsword and dagger, decorated to look like the upper and lower jaws of a carnivorous dinosaur": "一把配套的短剑和匕首，装饰得像食肉恐龙的上颚和下颚。",
	"A battleaxe with its head shaped like the flowing hair of a dwarf warrior": "一把斧头，其形状像矮人战士的飘逸头发",
	"A suit of armor made from the discarded chitin of giant arthropods": "用巨型节肢动物废弃的甲壳素制成的盔甲",
	"A pair of boots fashioned to look like the paws of a large feline": "一双看起来像大型猫科动物爪子的靴子",
	"A sword whose pommel is shaped in the form of a hand, so that you shake the hand when you wield it": "剑柄呈手形，挥舞时可摇动手掌的一种剑。",
	"A hammer forged to resemble a giant's fist on one side and a dragon's head on the other": "一把锤子，一边是巨人的拳头，另一边是龙的头，锻造得很像。",

	"A backpack made from the leather and fur of a skunk": "用臭鼬的皮革和皮毛制成的背包",
	"When the battle is done, enemies and allies alike stare in awe at the sight of your personal ritual of celebration.": "当战斗结束后，敌人和盟友都会敬畏地注视着你的个人庆祝仪式的情景。",
	"A finely honed, well-choreographed dance": "精心打磨、精心编排的舞蹈",
	"Ale! And then more ale!": "麦酒! 然后是更多的麦酒!",

	"There is no time to celebrate, for your war is eternal!": "没有时间庆祝，因为你们的战争是永恒的！\"。",
	"To the uninitiated, fighters are the simpletons of the adventuring world, flailing away with their weapons while taking repeated blows to the head. But those folk know precious little about the specialties and subtleties of this class. Many flavors of fighter exist in the world, and all can fit into an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in their own way.": "对于不了解的人来说，战士是冒险世界中的傻瓜，他们一边挥舞着武器，一边对着头部反复击打。但这些人对这个等级的特点和微妙之处知之甚少。世界上存在许多不同类型的战士，他们都能以自己的方式融入收购公司的特许经营中。",
	"Those elves really know how to bring the hurt from a distance, don't they? Fortunately for the arrow-slinging world, they were willing to share their arcane archery knowledge with friends, and now every Acq Inc franchise can have its very own magical cannon! As an arcane archer, you're incredibly useful during those tense discussions when someone needs to be able to whistle, and then moments later, arrows appear out of nowhere to stick out of the ground between the feet of the people they're talking to. Roll that next check to negotiate with advantage!": "这些精灵真的知道如何从远处带来伤害，不是吗？幸运的是，对于射箭的世界来说，他们愿意与朋友们分享他们的奥术射箭知识，现在每一个Acq公司的特许经营权都可以拥有自己的魔法大炮 作为一个奥术弓箭手，你在那些紧张的讨论中是非常有用的，当有人需要能够吹口哨时，片刻之后，箭就会凭空出现，从他们说话的人的脚间伸出地面。掷出下一次检定，谈判就会有优势!",
	"As a battle master involved with an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, you understand that your maneuvers might not do as much damage as the focused attacks of a less subtle fighter. But the needs of a franchise often call for subtlety and precision over simply busting heads. Add in your knowledge of the more cerebral aspects of combat, including all-important insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the enemy, and it's clear why you make a great addition to any franchise.": "作为一个参与收购公司特许经营的战斗大师，你明白你的演习可能不会像一个不那么微妙的战士的集中攻击那样造成很大的伤害。但是，特许经营的需要往往要求微妙和精确，而不是简单地打爆头。再加上你对战斗中更多脑力方面的知识，包括对敌人的力量和弱点的重要洞察力，很明显，你是任何特许经营权的最佳补充。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a heady mix of adventuring and business, and both those pursuits require travel. Who better to lead a long road journey than an experienced cavalier with a reliable mount? As a cavalier, you're one of the best warriors around for protecting less hardy allies, even off your mount, making you a mobile fighter, a team player, and a valiant protector.": "收购公司的特许经营是冒险和商业的完美结合，而这两种追求都需要旅行。谁能比一个有经验的骑兵和可靠的坐骑更适合领导漫长的公路旅行？作为一名骑兵，你是周围最好的战士之一，可以保护不那么坚韧的盟友，甚至在你的坐骑之外，使你成为一个移动的战士，一个团队成员，和一个英勇的保护者。",
	"Accepting the wisdom of the old adage \"Sometimes less is more\" is an excellent way to go broke. Because less is less, obviously. Just look at the balance sheet. But there's one exception to that nonrule that can make a big difference in the successful operation of a franchise—the focused, no-frills approach to combat of the champion fighter. As a champion, you quickly master your role within your franchise, because that role is simple. Lift heavy things. Stand in front of monsters. Hit them till they drop.": "接受 \"有时少即是多 \"这句古老谚语的智慧是破产的绝佳途径。因为少就是少，很明显。看看资产负债表就知道了。但这一规则有一个例外，它可以在特许经营的成功运作中发挥很大的作用--冠军斗士的专注、不做作的战斗方法。作为一个冠军，你很快就能掌握你在特许经营中的角色，因为这个角色很简单。举起重物。站在怪物面前。打他们，直到他们倒下。",
	"Fighter? Wizard? Why not both?! If a franchise's recruiting efforts result in a party lacking either fighting or magical ability—or, Tymora forbid, both—you make a great addition to the team as an eldritch knight. Your focus on abjuration and evocation ensures that your fighting style is supported by magic that can either defend allies or deal massive damage to your foes. And if your franchise operation runs true to form, you'll have plenty of opportunity for both.": "战斗机？巫师？为什么不是两个？如果一个专营权的招募工作导致一方缺乏战斗力或魔法能力--或者，Tymora不允许，两者都缺乏--那么你作为一个长老骑士，是团队中的一个伟大补充。你对咒语和唤醒的关注确保你的战斗风格得到魔法的支持，这些魔法可以保护你的盟友或对你的敌人造成巨大伤害。如果你的特许经营权运行得很好，你就会有很多机会使用这两种魔法。",
	"Even if samurai are rare in the lands where Acquisitions Incorporated offers franchise opportunities, their fighting spirit makes them invaluable additions to any franchise—especially if that spirit encompasses the fight for profits. As a samurai, your impressive combat skills are matched by your social grace and wisdom, providing a boon to your franchise's standing in the community. Any franchise could do worse than having you as its public face—especially when your sense of quiet resolve is needed to quietly resolve some unexpected business disaster.": "即使武士在Acquisitions Incorporated提供特许经营机会的土地上很少见，但他们的战斗精神使他们成为任何特许经营的宝贵补充--尤其是当这种精神包括为利润而战时。作为一个武士，你令人印象深刻的战斗技能与你的社会风度和智慧相匹配，为你的特许经营权在社区中的地位提供了一个福音。任何特许经营权都可以比有你作为它的公众形象更糟糕--特别是当需要你安静的决心来悄悄解决一些意外的商业灾难时。",
	"Ki is a magical energy that fills the space between all things in the multiverse. Monks tap into that energy through spiritual and martial training, meditation, and contemplation. And punching and kicking. And more punching and kicking. And maybe a head-butt for good measure.": "淇是一种神奇的能量，它充满了多元宇宙中所有事物之间的空间。僧侣们通过精神和武术训练、冥想和沉思来利用这种能量。还有拳打脚踢。还有更多的拳打脚踢。也许还可以用头撞一下，以达到良好的效果。",
	"Monks in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign find a way to integrate a typical ascetic life with the grandeur, majesty, and over-the-top business focus of their franchise. History (real and fantasy) has shown that monasteries don't always shy away from engaging in profitable enterprises. As such, your Acquisitions Incorporated monk likely brings their old monastery's entrepreneurial spirit with them—along with new ideas to energize that spirit even more.": "在收购公司的活动中，僧侣们找到了一种方法，将典型的苦行僧生活与他们的特许经营权的宏伟、威严和过度的商业焦点相结合。历史（真实的和幻想的）表明，寺院并不总是回避参与盈利的企业。因此，你的收购公司的僧侣可能会把他们以前的寺院的创业精神带过来--同时还有新的想法，使这种精神更加活跃。",
	"In my experience, hiring a monk skilled in the art of peaceful arbitration is the only way to attempt to defuse the rather concussive methods of negotiation employed by many Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. And if it comes to it, a monk will at least ensure that the concussions are fairly distributed.": "根据我的经验，雇佣一个精通和平仲裁艺术的僧侣是试图化解许多收购公司特许经营人所采用的相当震荡的谈判方法的唯一途径。如果真到了这一步，僧侣至少可以确保脑震荡得到公平分配。",
	"Part of your martial training as a monk sees you adopting a variety of stances during combat. These stances help focus your mind, confuse your enemies, and relieve that strain on your lower back.": "作为一个僧侣，你的武术训练的一部分是在战斗中采取各种姿势。这些姿势有助于集中你的注意力，迷惑你的敌人，并减轻你腰部的压力。",
	"Incontinent Elder—Standing straight, knees together (excellent for surviving those long queues)": "大小便失禁的老人-站直，双膝并拢（对熬过那些漫长的排队时间非常有利）。",

	"Ponderous Pudding—Collapsed in a heap (useful when trying to disguise yourself as a drunken fool)": "深思熟虑的布丁-倒在一堆（在试图将自己伪装成一个醉酒的傻瓜时很有用）。",
	"Frightened Gnome—Curled in the fetal position (excellent when about to take a lot of damage)": "惊恐的侏儒--蜷缩在胎儿的位置上（在即将受到大量伤害时非常好）。",
	"Ambitious Student—Standing with one armed raised (useful when trying to be seen)": "雄心勃勃的学生--单臂站立（在试图被看到时很有用）",
	"Boisterous Brewmaster—Hand raised as if making a toast (excellent at preventing being slapped)": "喧闹的酿酒师-举起手来，好像在敬酒（防止被打耳光的能力很强）",
	"Hardy Harpy—Arms flapping wildly while singing (inspires people to leave you alone, and good for cooling off on hot days)": "哈迪-哈比-阿姆斯特朗一边唱歌一边疯狂地拍打着翅膀（激励人们不要打扰你，在炎热的日子里有利于降温）。",
	"Broken Bridge—Face down on the ground with knees bent and posterior up (reduces visibility to foes in front, and makes a useful ramp for allies to jump off)": "断桥-脸朝下跪在地上，膝盖弯曲，后背朝上（减少前面敌人的能见度，并为盟友提供一个有用的坡道，让他们跳下去）",
	"The writings of famous monks of the past sometimes become holy texts that come to define entire monastic traditions. The monks of your monastery have dedicated their training and their lives to the insight gleaned from an ancient monastic tome.": "过去著名僧侣的著作有时会成为定义整个寺院传统的圣典。你的寺院的僧侣们将他们的训练和生活献给了从古老的寺院巨著中收集到的洞察力。",
	"Plenty of monasteries turn out business-minded monks. After all, it's not money that's the root of all evil; it's the love of money. So if you just like money—you know, as a friend—then it's all good! Many Acq Inc franchises actively try to recruit monks into entrepreneurship, knowing of their reputation for versatility both in and out of combat. If you hail from a particularly profitable monastery, you won't need to be convinced of the benefits of a well-run business—you'll already be on board.": "很多寺院都会培养出有商业头脑的僧侣。毕竟，一切罪恶的根源不是金钱；而是对金钱的热爱。因此，如果你只是喜欢钱--你知道，作为一个朋友--那么这一切都很好! 许多Acq公司的特许经营权积极尝试招募僧侣创业，因为他们在战斗中和战斗后都以多才多艺而闻名。如果你来自一个特别赚钱的寺院，你将不需要被说服一个经营良好的企业的好处--你已经在船上了。",

	"Hall of Mysteries (investigators for hire)": "神秘的大厅（雇佣调查员）",
	"The diversity of monk traditions makes those traditions different from each other in abilities as well as in attitude. And since an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise runs mostly on attitude, it's important for the philosophy of a monk's monastic tradition to mesh with the philosophy of the franchise.": "僧侣传统的多样性使得这些传统在能力和态度上都有所不同。由于收购公司的特许经营主要依靠态度，因此，僧侣的修道传统的哲学与特许经营的哲学相融合是很重要的。",
	"Monks following the Way of Shadow fill an important role in an Acq Inc franchise: that of an infiltrator. As a shadow monk, you're likely more adept than even a rogue at moving around without being seen, slipping into dangerous places unnoticed, and getting away with no one the wiser as to what you've stolen. And it's a safe bet that your fellow franchisees will quickly learn to search the shadows before they say something they don't want you to hear.": "遵循影子之道的僧侣在Acq公司的特许经营中扮演着一个重要的角色：潜入者的角色。作为一个影子和尚，你可能比流氓更善于在不被发现的情况下行动，不被注意地溜进危险的地方，并在没有人知道你所偷的东西的情况下逃脱。而且可以肯定的是，你的同伴们很快就会学会在他们说出不想让你听到的话之前搜索阴影。",
	"The most dangerous adventurer in the room is the one that no one knows is an adventurer. As a monk who follows the Way of the Drunken Master, you excel at keeping your true threat level under wraps. Your ability to literally spend days hanging out at the tavern and never be noticed makes you a valuable addition to any franchise that needs to keep its collective eyes and ears on happenings in town. Plus, you're a guaranteed riot at company parties!": "房间里最危险的冒险家是一个没有人知道是冒险家的人。作为一个遵循 \"醉翁之意不在酒 \"的和尚，你擅长将自己的真实威胁程度隐藏起来。你能在酒馆里呆上好几天，而且从不被人注意，这使你成为任何需要对镇上发生的事情保持集体耳目的特许经营权的重要补充。此外，你在公司的聚会上肯定会引起骚动。",
	"Most enemies who take on a monk expect to get a few punches or kicks for their trouble. So when flames, cold, and thunder come streaking toward them instead, they'll never know what hit them. As a monk of the Way of the Four Elements, you combine the striking power of a typical monk with the versatility of a wizard. Especially in a franchise without a dedicated combat spellcaster, your elemental affinity comes in handy.": "大多数对阵僧侣的敌人都希望得到几拳或几脚来解决他们的麻烦。因此，当火焰、寒冷和雷霆向他们袭来时，他们将永远不知道是什么袭击了他们。作为四元素之道的僧侣，你结合了典型的僧侣的攻击力和巫师的多功能性。特别是在一个没有专门的战斗法术师的特许经营中，你的元素亲和力就显得非常有用了。",
	"Monks following the Way of the Kensei often appear to care more about their weapons than they care about the people around them. Because they do. As a monk following that tradition, you make a perfect fit for a martial-focused franchise. Your skill with weapons makes you an asset in combat, and your practical knowledge makes trading in arms a natural sideline. For you, battle is business and business is always booming.": "遵循剑道的僧侣往往看起来更关心他们的武器，而不是关心他们周围的人。因为他们确实如此。作为一个遵循这一传统的僧侣，你是一个完美的适合以武术为重点的特许经营的人。你的武器技能使你成为战斗中的资产，而你的实用知识使武器交易成为自然的副业。对你来说，战斗就是生意，而生意总是兴隆的。",
	"It's always nice to have someone in a franchise who can slap an enemy so hard that they shrivel up and die several days after the characters have left town and arranged their alibis. As a monk following the Way of the Open Hand, you know that others think of you as a mysterious figure. You might sit by yourself for hours on end, humming strangely. You might say weird things that you expect others to treat as great wisdom. Frankly, as long as your fellow franchisees can count on you to break skulls when necessary, you can probably get away with anything.": "在一个特许经营项目中，有一个人能够狠狠地给敌人一巴掌，让他们在人物离开城镇并安排好不在场证明后的几天内萎缩死亡，这总是很好的。作为一个追随 \"张手道 \"的僧侣，你知道别人认为你是一个神秘的人物。你可能会一个人坐上好几个小时，奇怪地哼着歌。你可能会说一些奇怪的事情，而你希望别人把它当作大智慧。坦率地说，只要你的加盟商能够指望你在必要时打破头骨，你可能就能逃脱一切。",
	"Many benevolent monks have a reputation for being all punching and sunshine. As a Sun Soul monk, you epitomize this reputation. Except for the benevolent part. Whenever a fight is in need of area-effect damage, your fellow franchise members understand that you're their best friend in the world. And if your reputation for exploding in anger (literally) makes for easier negotiations with suppliers and business rivals, so much the better.": "许多仁慈的僧侣都有一个名声，那就是只知道打打杀杀，阳光灿烂。作为一个太阳魂和尚，你是这种声誉的缩影。除了仁慈的那部分。每当一场战斗需要区域效应的伤害时，你的同伴就会明白你是他们在这个世界上最好的朋友。如果你因愤怒而爆发的名声（字面意思）使你与供应商和商业对手的谈判更加容易，那就更好了。",
	"When many hear \"paladin,\" they can't help but envision a knight in shining armor, helping innocent people in distress and living a life of utmost virtue and chastity. Yawn. In the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, at least some small part of a paladin's dedication is focused on the code of business. Morals and ethics are all good. But an Acq Inc paladin knows that nothing puts food on the plates of the poor and roofs over the heads of the dispossessed better than cold, hard cash.": "当许多人听到 \"圣骑士 \"时，他们会情不自禁地设想一个穿着闪亮盔甲的骑士，帮助处于困境中的无辜者，过着极度美德和贞洁的生活。呵欠。在收购公司的世界里，至少有一小部分圣骑士的奉献精神是集中在商业准则上的。道德和伦理都是好的。但一个收购公司的圣骑士知道，没有什么比冷冰冰的、硬邦邦的现金更能让穷人有饭吃，让一无所有的人有房住了。",
	"And virtue and chastity are more guidelines than rules anyway. Right?": "而美德和贞操无论如何都是准则而不是规则。对吗？",
	"Stand up as straight as possible. Being a paladin is mostly about posture, and most people don't realize that. Evil drow slouch, but in this house, we are turgid to the point of discomfort!": "尽可能地站直。作为一个圣骑士主要是关于姿势的，而大多数人都没有意识到这一点。邪恶的乌鸦懒洋洋的，但在这所房子里，我们的身材臃肿到让人不舒服的地步。",
	"All life is sacred. Well, some lives are sacred. Okay, fine. The people you protect are sacred. On certain days, everyone else is negotiable. As an Acquisitions Incorporated paladin, you are dedicated to the protection of your fellow franchisees out of loyalty and duty—and because you can't earn all that sweet coin on your own.": "所有的生命都是神圣的。嗯，有些生命是神圣的。好吧，好吧。你所保护的人是神圣的。在某些日子里，其他所有人都是可以商量的。作为收购公司的圣骑士，你致力于保护你的加盟商伙伴，这是出于忠诚和责任--因为你不能靠自己的力量赚取所有甜蜜的硬币。",
	"In your role as the party's bodyguard, your unmatched training and sense of honor drive you to take untold risks as you put others' lives before your own. Your heavy armor is as fearsome as your heavy morals, and your healing ability, bonuses to saving throws, and lack of fear create a trifecta of comfort. Your natural leadership role also comes into play, as the squishier members of your party come to rely on your presence and protection.": "在你作为党的保镖的角色中，你无与伦比的训练和荣誉感驱使你冒着难以计数的风险，因为你把别人的生命放在自己的前面。你的重型盔甲和你沉重的道德观一样可怕，而你的治疗能力、救赎的奖励和缺乏恐惧感创造了一个舒适的三要素。你的自然领导作用也开始发挥作用，因为你的队伍中较弱的成员会依赖你的存在和保护。",
	"Every character has a few private matters they'd rather not share, but the truth-and-honesty stakes usually aren't as high for others as they are for a paladin. If there's any extra drama in your life, chances are it stems from a terrible secret in your background that you need to constantly struggle to keep. What'll happen if your friends and allies learn of your dark past? How might a sadistic DM put pressure on you throughout the unfolding story to keep your secret at all costs?": "每个角色都有一些他们不愿意分享的私事，但对于其他人来说，真实和诚实的风险通常没有圣骑士那么高。如果你的生活中有任何额外的戏剧性，很可能是源于你的背景中的一个可怕的秘密，你需要不断地努力去保持。如果你的朋友和盟友知道了你黑暗的过去，会发生什么？在整个故事的发展过程中，虐待狂的DM会如何对你施加压力，让你不惜一切代价保守你的秘密？",
	"Before taking your paladin oath, you accidentally publicly humiliated a good friend. You have sworn to make it up to them, despite them wanting nothing to do with you.": "在宣读你的圣骑士誓言之前，你不小心公开羞辱了一个好朋友。你发誓要补偿他们，尽管他们不想和你有任何关系。",
	"You took another person's identity to escape the law in your younger days—and quickly came to realize that this person was far cooler than the real you. If anyone finds out your true identity, your reputation will suffer.": "在你年轻的时候，你用另一个人的身份来逃避法律，而且很快就意识到，这个人比真正的你要酷得多。如果有人发现你的真实身份，你的声誉将受到影响。",
	"You were the child of nobles who were found guilty of stealing vast sums from their subjects. If your identity is discovered, you might be hunted down. But you might also be in line for a massive inheritance.": "你是贵族的孩子，被发现从他们的臣民那里偷窃了大量的钱财。如果你的身份被发现，你可能会被追杀。但你也可能会有机会获得巨额遗产。",
	"You once belonged to an organization that was eventually banned because a typo in its name made it appear seditious. If anyone discovers this, you run the risk of being mistaken for an enemy of the realm.": "你曾经属于一个组织，但最终被禁止，因为其名称中的一个错别字使其看起来具有煽动性。如果有人发现这一点，你有可能被误认为是王国的敌人。",
	"You made a deal with a fiendish creature to escape trouble or save another character's life. Emissaries of this fiend appear occasionally to tell you that the paperwork regarding the debt you owe is temporarily lost, but they're working on it.": "你与一个恶魔般的生物达成了交易，以逃避麻烦或拯救另一个角色的生命。这个恶魔的使者偶尔会出现，告诉你关于你所欠债务的文件暂时丢失了，但他们正在努力解决。",
	"You owe an enormous amount of money to a forgetful and amoral person. So far, that person has made no sign of wanting you to repay the debt, and you have no idea what to do about that.": "你欠了一个健忘而无道德的人一大笔钱。到目前为止，那个人没有任何要你还债的迹象，而你也不知道该怎么做。",
	"When problems arise as a result of your franchise's operations—and clearly through no fault of your own—you fix those problems as only you can. You excel at remaining calm and attacking each challenge logically and deliberately. Especially comforting to your teammates is your insistence on using a witty catchphrase to raise their spirits in the midst of the greatest danger. Your companions take great pride in your catchphrase, even if they're too shy to admit it.": "当你的特许经营权的运作出现问题时--显然不是你自己的过错--你要以你的能力解决这些问题。你善于保持冷静，有逻辑、有意识地应对每一个挑战。尤其让你的队友感到欣慰的是，你坚持使用诙谐的口头禅，在最大的危险中提高他们的精神。你的同伴对你的口头禅感到非常自豪，即使他们羞于承认。",
	"Looks like this is the end. So let's go back to the beginning.": "看来这就是结局了。所以让我们回到开头。",
	"There's only one way out of this pickle, and that's by breaking a few jars!": "只有一个办法可以摆脱这种困境，那就是打破几个罐子！\"。",
	"Looks like trouble has some vacation time coming up. So let's book it a nice inn.": "看起来麻烦的人有一些休假时间了。因此，让我们为它预定一个好的旅馆。",

	"Is that all I've got?!": "这就是我的全部吗？",
	"It's always darkest before the dawn, except when the moon is full. So let's moon!": "黎明前总是最黑暗的，除非是月圆之夜。因此，让我们一起赏月吧!",
	"We might be beaten, but we're not beaten! Because \"beaten\" means different things in both those contexts!": "我们可能被打败，但我们没有被打败！因为 \"被打败 \"和 \"被打败 \"的意思是不同的。因为 \"被打败 \"在这两种情况下的含义是不同的!",
	"\"Surrender\" is my middle name, but it was a family thing and I never use it!": "\"投降 \"是我的中间名，但这是一个家庭的事情，我从来没有用过它！\"。",
	"The oath that you take (or break) as a paladin defines your character as a center of moral authority in the world. And that works just fine in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, albeit with a few minor adjustments.": "作为一名圣骑士，你所发的誓言（或违背誓言）将你的角色定义为世界上的道德权威中心。这在 \"收购公司 \"的活动中非常有效，尽管需要做一些小的调整。",
	"Most paladins who take the Oath of Conquest consider martial subjugation the ultimate form of defeat for an enemy. You have a wider view, though, and are able to embrace monetary or business-related conquest as equally fulfilling activities. Is a business rival really all that different from a rampaging dragon? Both are dangerous and antisocial, and both sit on a hoard of wealth that could be yours if you're brave enough to take it.": "大多数立下 \"征服之誓 \"的圣骑士都认为武力征服是击败敌人的最终形式。不过你的视野更广，能够接受金钱或与商业有关的征服，认为这同样是一种满足的活动。一个商业对手与一条横冲直撞的龙真的有什么不同吗？两者都是危险的、反社会的，而且都坐拥大量财富，如果你有足够的勇气去拿的话，这些财富就会属于你。",
	"As a paladin devoted to the ideals of order and justice, you're in a perfect position to guide your franchise to great ends—even as you make an excellent foil for the less-savory plans of your fellow franchisees. Your insistence on dealing with business partners fairly, honoring legally signed contracts, and promoting the general welfare of the world helps you cement your franchise's reputation as a group worth dealing with. It might just take a little bit of convincing for your fellow party members to see things your way.": "作为一个致力于秩序和正义理想的圣骑士，你在指导你的特许经营权实现伟大的目标方面处于一个完美的位置--即使你对你的同伴的不太光彩的计划做了一个很好的衬托。你坚持公平地与商业伙伴打交道，履行合法签署的合同，并促进世界的普遍福利，这有助于你巩固你的特许经营权的声誉，使之成为一个值得交往的团体。这可能只是需要一点说服力，让你的同党以你的方式看待问题。",
	"The fury brought to bear by an Oath of Vengeance paladin fits well into most Acquisitions Incorporated campaigns. Those who break contracts, renege on deals, fail to repay debts, or otherwise break their word can expect a visit from you in your role as the executor of vengeance. And if your fellow franchisees can make a bit of profit by picking up the pieces when your job is done, then everyone's happy.": "复仇之誓的圣骑士所带来的怒火很适合大多数收购公司的活动。那些违反合同、背弃交易、未能偿还债务或其他失信行为的人，可以期待你作为复仇的执行者来拜访他们。如果你的加盟商能够在你的工作完成后通过收拾残局赚取一点利润，那么大家都会很高兴。",
	"Loving nature, exploring the wilderness, companioning with animals: most people wouldn't view these things as obvious assets for the rough-and-tumble business of running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. But most people are wrong about everything. Few Acq Inc franchises set their roots or undertake all their business in urban areas. As such, countless adventures will call a franchise into the wilds, where a qualified ranger makes the difference between forlorn failure and fabulous success. Even when a franchise engages in commerce in the cities and towns of the realm, a ranger's keen senses, sharp blades, and flesh-seeking arrows will never find lack of use.": "热爱大自然，探索荒野，与动物为伴：大多数人不会把这些东西看作是经营收购公司特许经营权这一粗犷业务的明显资产。但大多数人对一切都错了。很少有Acq公司的特许经营权在城市地区扎根或开展所有业务。因此，无数次的冒险将召唤特许经营权进入荒野，在那里，一个合格的护林员会在悲惨的失败和美妙的成功之间做出区别。即使特许经营商在王国的城市和城镇从事商业活动，游侠的敏锐感觉、锋利的刀片和寻肉的箭矢也不会缺乏用途。",
	"Rangers like to work alone, but it is convenient when others are around to draw the arrows to themselves.": "游骑兵喜欢独自工作，但当其他人在身边时，为自己引来箭矢也很方便。",
	"The notion of being a defender is core to your identity as a ranger. As a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you channel your natural proclivity for protectiveness into a razor-sharp focus on the franchise. Pure profit is never an end in and of itself, but whatever deep-seated personal goals you only ever talk about in the dead of night over a dying fire, those goals need financing.": "作为一名护卫者的概念是你作为游骑兵的核心身份。作为收购公司的一员，你将你天生的保护欲转化为对特许经营权的高度关注。纯粹的利润本身并不是目的，但无论你在夜深人静时才会在即将熄灭的火堆上谈论什么深层次的个人目标，这些目标都需要融资。",
	"Your role as a defender and a controller of problems makes you a natural leader for sure. Your sense of selflessness and integrity can help shape and guide the more unscrupulous business plans of your allies. Likewise, the other members of your franchise might panic when that crate of {@item Figurine of Wondrous Power||figurines of wondrous power} you acquired turns out to all be self-activating obsidian steeds. But you have the steady nerves and earnest resolve to revert and revise any pear-shaped plans.": "你作为一个捍卫者和问题的控制者的角色使你肯定是一个天然的领导者。你的无私和正直感可以帮助塑造和引导你的盟友的更多不正当的商业计划。同样，当你获得的那箱（%0%）变成都是自激活的黑曜石骏马时，你的特许经营权的其他成员可能会感到恐慌。但是，你有稳定的神经和认真的决心来恢复和修改任何梨形计划。",
	"The balance of nature is no less strong within civilization than it is in the wilds, and the streets and sewers of towns and cities are their own thriving ecosystem. As a ranger who spends part of your time in urban settings, you quickly learn to seek out the companionship of some of the many beasts that inhabit those settings.": "自然界的平衡在文明中并不亚于在荒野中，城镇的街道和下水道是他们自己的繁荣的生态系统。作为一个部分时间在城市环境中度过的游侠，你很快就会学会寻找一些居住在这些环境中的许多野兽的伙伴。",

During business meetings with rivals or attempts to play nice with the nobility, being forbidden from carrying weapons doesn't slow you down. Whether you channel your enemies' impending destruction through mundane equipment, thoughtful gifts, or a packed lunch, you and your improvised weapons are always ready for action.": "你融入自然背景的本能能力甚至在荒野之外也有应用。在与对手的商务会议或试图与贵族友好相处的过程中，被禁止携带武器也不会拖累你。无论你是通过平凡的设备、贴心的礼物还是打包的午餐来引导你的敌人即将到来的毁灭，你和你的简易武器总是准备好了行动。",

	"Any Beast Master understands that a beast companion is far more diligent, friendly, and reliable than most people. This might be doubly true in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, where if you fall in combat, your companion isn't going to assess the resale value of your gear versus the cost of the {@item potion of healing} it'll take to revive you. Even in an urban setting, a beast companion makes a solid ally, serving as a guard or a scout when you're skulking around places you shouldn't be.": "任何一个野兽大师都明白，野兽伙伴比大多数人要勤奋、友好和可靠得多。在收购公司的活动中，这一点可能更加真实，如果你在战斗中倒下，你的同伴不会评估你的装备的转售价值和使你复活所需的费用（%0%）。即使在城市环境中，野兽伙伴也是一个可靠的盟友，当你在不应该去的地方溜达时，它可以充当警卫或侦察员。",
	"Gloom Stalkers are often best known for their work in the Underdark, but shadows are shadows wherever they occur. As a Gloom Stalker ranger, you find solace and refuge in dark alleys, dimly lit back rooms, and the shadowy corners of any corporate boardroom. Moreover, your expertise as a skulker and an ambush predator fits right in with most franchise business models.": "阴暗潜行者通常以他们在暗黑世界的工作而闻名，但无论在哪里出现，阴影都是阴影。作为一名阴暗潜行者游侠，你可以在黑暗的小巷、灯光昏暗的密室以及任何公司会议室的阴暗角落中找到慰藉和庇护。此外，你作为一个潜行者和埋伏的捕食者的专长，正好符合大多数特许经营的商业模式。",
	"Every Acquisitions Incorporated franchise needs to be ready to travel at a moment's notice, with franchisees always rushing headlong into the next amazing opportunity. As a Horizon Walker, you're a master of travel, blazing trails into unknown realms by passing through the even-more-unknown realms of the planes. Whatever path your franchise walks, your combat and magical skill helps ensure a safe journey for you and your companions. Moreover, the unknown reaches of the world are the best places to find new resources, and no one knows more about the unknown than you do.": "每家收购公司的特许经营权都需要随时准备旅行，特许经营人总是一头扎进下一个惊人的机会。作为一名地平线行者，你是旅行的主人，通过更多未知的平面领域，开拓未知领域的小径。无论你的特许经营权走的是什么路，你的战斗和魔法技能都有助于确保你和你的同伴们的安全旅程。此外，世界的未知地带是寻找新资源的最佳地点，没有人比你更了解未知的世界。",
	"Whether in the wilds, in the cities, or in the wide expanses in between, your specialized combat training as a Hunter ranger makes you a stalwart defender of your franchise and your party. On a mission, you take a lead role in dispensing with threats. In a social encounter, you stand at the back of the room and look dangerous. Just focus on a bit of sensitivity training to counter your predator's instincts and you can be the definitive Acquisitions Incorporated employee—looking smart in a business suit one day, and hacking up enemies the next.": "无论是在荒野、城市，还是在两者之间的广阔地带，你作为猎人游侠的专业战斗训练使你成为你的特许权和你的队伍的坚定捍卫者。在任务中，你在消除威胁方面起着主导作用。在社交活动中，你站在房间的后面，看起来很危险。只要专注于一点敏感性训练，以对抗你的捕食者本能，你就可以成为绝对的收购公司雇员，今天穿着商务套装，明天就能砍死敌人。",
	"The nightmare creatures that haunt the world are more of a threat to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise than they are to other people. Because frankly, other people have less to lose. Sometimes monsters guard vast amounts of treasure just waiting for acquisition. Other times, they're in the employ of a business rival looking to acquire your wealth, your blood, or your soul. No matter how dark the adventure gets, your role as a Monster Slayer makes you the best offense and defense against whatever stands in your franchise's path to success.": "困扰世界的恶梦生物对收购公司的特许经营权比对其他人的威胁更大。因为坦率地说，其他人的损失要小一些。有时，怪物们守护着大量的财宝，等待着被收购。其他时候，它们受雇于一个商业对手，想要获得你的财富、你的血液或你的灵魂。无论冒险变得多么黑暗，作为一个怪物杀手，你的角色使你成为最好的进攻和防守者，以对抗任何挡在你的特许经营成功之路上的东西。",
	"A rogue is often the backbone of any successful adventuring party, providing an ample amount of martial prowess, a diverse skill set, and a pat on the back for a job well done (with or without a dagger in it). In an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, a rogue's talents are even more in demand. Not only is the rogue the first one into the dragon's lair and the last one out (after securing away the choicest bits of treasure first), but their keen eye for details and their practiced social skills make them equally invaluable in the boardrooms, the taprooms, and the back alleys where business gets done.": "流氓通常是任何成功的冒险队伍的骨干，提供充足的武功，多样化的技能组合，以及对完成任务的拍手称快（无论是否有匕首）。在收购公司的特许经营中，流氓的才能甚至更有需求。流氓不仅是第一个进入龙穴的人，也是最后一个离开龙穴的人（先把最珍贵的财宝弄走），而且他们对细节的敏锐观察和熟练的社交技巧使他们在会议室、酒馆和完成业务的小巷中同样具有价值。",
	"Personally, I feel that \"rogue\" is a little misleading as a term. It implies that those of us who follow a more... eclectic path toward life can all be grouped into a single category. That works with most other professions because they're good at one thing. But me? I'm good at everything.You need someone to sweet-talk the town guard? I'm your guy. Impersonate the governor? Easy peasy. Hit the streets for intel? Throw a dinner party? Engage in a clandestine property reassignment? Done and done. And if someone's giving you trouble? Well, let's just say they'll be no trouble to me.": "我个人觉得，\"流氓 \"这个词有点误导。它意味着我们这些遵循更多......不拘一格的生活道路的人都可以被归入一个单一类别。这适用于大多数其他职业，因为他们擅长一件事。但我呢？我什么都擅长。你需要有人跟镇上的警卫甜言蜜语？我就是你的人选。冒充州长？轻而易举。上街打探情报？举办一个晚宴？从事秘密的财产转移？完成了，也完成了。如果有人给你带来麻烦呢？好吧，我们只能说他们不会给我带来麻烦。",
	"In the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, dangers are as likely to be contractual as physical. Avoiding a trap's pressure plate in a dungeon is good. Avoiding an awkward social situation might be even more important. Explosive runes warding a treasure chest go off once, maybe no one spotted them, big deal. But a rogue who notices a carefully worded legal trap in a contract can save their franchise from lasting harm—and a rogue who can insert such details into someone else's contract is worth their weight in performance bonuses.": "在《收购公司》的世界里，危险既可能是契约性的，也可能是物理性的。在地牢里避开陷阱的压力板是好事。避免一个尴尬的社交场合可能更重要。保护宝箱的爆炸性符文一旦发生，也许没有人发现它们，这没什么大不了。但是，一个注意到合同中精心措辞的法律陷阱的流氓可以使他们的特许经营权免受持久的伤害--一个能在别人的合同中插入这种细节的流氓是值得他们在业绩奖金中加分的。",
	"Every rogue has a story about that one big score. With enough ales and a bit of prompting, you can easily be convinced to tell the tale, highlighting all the drama and derring-do. But the tale is so much better for the telling if you can highlight it with visual aids.": "每个流氓都有一个关于那笔大交易的故事。只要有足够的啤酒和一点提示，你很容易被说服去讲述这个故事，突出所有的戏剧性和疯狂的行为。但是，如果你能用视觉辅助手段来强调这个故事，那么这个故事就会好得多。",
	"You carry a trophy from that big score, which you pull out when the occasion demands or when you need a reminder of your own skill and luck. Sure, if anyone found the item on you, there's a good chance you could be arrested and convicted of the crime that procured it. But that's part of the excitement, right?": "你带着那个大比分的奖杯，在需要的时候或者需要提醒你自己的技巧和运气的时候，你会拿出这个奖杯。当然，如果有人发现你身上有这个东西，你很有可能被逮捕，并被判定犯有获取它的罪行。但这也是刺激的一部分，对吗？",

	"Many rogues learn their initial skill set through the school of necessity, forced to steal or kill to survive. More advanced talents, however, are generally taught through one of the many criminal guilds that crop up in towns and cities throughout the land. As an Acquisitions Incorporated rogue, you definitely left your guild in order to join a franchise, for no rogue can serve two masters. At least not officially.": "许多流氓通过必要的学校学习他们最初的技能，为了生存被迫偷窃或杀人。然而，更高级的技能通常是通过在全国各地城镇出现的许多犯罪行会中的一个来学习。作为一个收购公司的流氓，你肯定会离开你的行会，以便加入一个特许经营权，因为没有流氓可以为两个主人服务。至少不是正式的。",

	"Each of the many archetypes of the rogue offers a variety of features that can prove a boon to any Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. You might enjoy making a scene, or you might prefer to pass unseen. You might eliminate your foes in the most public way possible, or prefer to deal with all problems behind closed (and preferably soundproofed) doors. Either way, your talents make you the invaluable linchpin of your franchise's operations.": "众多流氓原型中的每一个都提供了各种功能，可以证明是任何收购公司特许经营的福音。你可能喜欢闹事，也可能喜欢不被发现。你可能会以最公开的方式消灭你的敌人，或者更喜欢在封闭的（最好是隔音的）门后处理所有问题。无论哪种方式，你的才能使你成为你的特许经营业务的宝贵关键。",
	"What does an adventurer who has all the tricks of a rogue need? Even trickier magic! As a rogue of the Arcane Trickster archetype, you supplement your dexterous abilities with spellcasting derring-do. Especially against competitors and enemies who don't know the full extent of your abilities, you make a most daunting foe.": "一个拥有所有流氓伎俩的冒险家需要什么？更加棘手的魔法! 作为一个奥术诡计师原型的流氓，你用法术伤害来补充你灵巧的能力。特别是面对那些不了解你能力的竞争对手和敌人时，你是一个最令人生畏的敌人。",
	"Working as an assassin within an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can be rewarding. Because even as good as the rest of your franchise mates are at killing things, you take that art to the next level. Your top-notch infiltration and disguise skills mean that you'll always be keeping busy. But if you're one of those \"You know too much, I have to kill you now, it doesn't matter that I was only asking for directions\"-type assassins, you might find that your inherent bloodlust needs to be focused to the subtle enterprises undertaken by the best franchises. So keep calm. Or if you can't, at least keep the killing quiet.": "在收购公司的特许经营范围内担任刺客是很有价值的。因为即使你的其他特许经营伙伴擅长杀人，你也能将这种艺术提升到新的水平。你一流的渗透和伪装技能意味着你将一直保持忙碌。但如果你是那种 \"你知道的太多了，我现在必须杀了你，我只是在问路，这并不重要 \"的刺客，你可能会发现你与生俱来的嗜血欲望需要被集中到最好的专营店所进行的微妙的企业。所以要保持冷静。或者如果你做不到，至少要保持杀戮的安静。",
	"As an inquisitive, your eye for detail and insightful demeanor complement the skills of the more martial members of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your powers of deduction make it clear that you're the obvious choice to lead your franchise, and you are an able operative in the field as you provide valuable information for ongoing operations. You also have a knack for finding weaknesses in enemies—not only in combat, but in a rival's business plans as well.": "作为一个好奇心强的人，你对细节的关注和有洞察力的举止补充了收购公司特许经营权中更多武术成员的技能。你的推理能力清楚地表明，你是领导你的特许经营权的不二人选，而且你是一个能干的外勤人员，为正在进行的行动提供有价值的信息。你还善于发现敌人的弱点--不仅在战斗中，而且在对手的商业计划中也是如此。",
	"Planning, tactics, misdirection, intrigue, sneak attack: it's like the rogue mastermind was specifically built for an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Your formidable social skills translate perfectly well from the street to the boardroom, and your ability to read your foes and rivals clearly makes you the best choice for franchise leader. Unfortunately, your equally practiced ability to read your allies means you'll know which of them see themselves as leader. Good thing that's a problem you're perfectly equipped to handle.": "计划、战术、误导、阴谋、偷袭：这就像流氓主谋是专门为收购公司的活动而设计的。你强大的社交能力可以很好地从街头转化到会议室，你阅读敌人和对手的能力显然使你成为特许经营领导人的最佳选择。不幸的是，你同样练就了读懂盟友的能力，这意味着你会知道他们中哪些人认为自己是领导者。好在这是一个你完全有能力处理的问题。",
	"Though many scouts are more comfortable in the wild, the lessons you've learned in the wilderness offer a surprising amount of utility when you're working in cities and towns. Whenever the party needs to go out and engage in some acquisition work, you're at the front of the group, literally and figuratively. Your skills in survival and ensnarement translate nicely to the civilized world, where it's just as much of a challenge to ambush a competitor's caravan as it is to deal with a goblin raiding party.": "尽管许多侦察员在野外工作时更为自如，但当你在城市和城镇工作时，你在野外学到的经验提供了惊人的效用。每当队伍需要出去从事一些收购工作时，你就会站在队伍的最前面，不管是字面意思还是形象意思。你的生存和诱捕技能在文明世界中得到了很好的转化，在那里，伏击竞争对手的商队和对付地精的突击队一样是个挑战。",
	"The one-on-one fighting style of a swashbuckler is a perfect fit for the stylish bravado that befits an Acq Inc franchise. Your mobility, audacity, and charm offer versatility in any number of situations, from infiltration, to theft, to fleeing the city guards when the infiltration and theft goes bad. Moreover, your social skills make you equally effective in and out of combat. However, your love of showing off means that you might have to work at not turning every social encounter into a combat encounter just because you can.": "侠客的一对一战斗风格是与Acq公司特许经营的时尚夸张完美契合的。你的机动性、胆识和魅力使你在任何情况下都能胜任，从潜入、偷窃到潜入和偷窃失败后逃离城市守卫。此外，你的社交技能使你在战斗中和战斗外都同样有效。然而，你对炫耀的热爱意味着你可能必须努力避免将每一次社交活动变成战斗活动，因为你可以这样做。",
	"For most people, to be called a thief is among the gravest of insults. For an Acquisitions Incorporated rogue, it's a compliment. You're able to look out for yourself in combat, but are smart enough to instead style yourself as the expert who gets out of trouble just as easily as the rest of the party gets into it. Whether you're picking locks at speed on the way out of a noble's estate or mastering the operation of a strange magic device before it burns your headquarters to the ground, your fellow franchise members always know how lucky they are to have you around. And with your special skills, you'll be able to make sure they show their appreciation financially—whether they know it or not.": "对大多数人来说，被称为小偷是最严重的侮辱之一。对于一个收购公司的流氓来说，这是一种赞美。你能够在战斗中为自己着想，但你足够聪明，可以把自己塑造成一个专家，像其他成员陷入麻烦一样轻松地摆脱麻烦。无论你是在离开贵族庄园的路上快速开锁，还是在一个奇怪的魔法装置将你的总部烧成灰烬之前掌握它的操作，你的同伴总是知道有你在身边是多么幸运。而凭借你的特殊技能，你将能够确保他们在经济上表示感谢--无论他们是否知道。",
	"A sorcerer's use of magic runs the range from chaotic to catastrophic—which suits the style of many Acquisitions Incorporated franchises alarmingly well. When a loud and emphatic marketing statement needs to be made using magic, trust a sorcerer to do the talking. And with natural charisma powering their magic, a sorcerer also makes a good public face for a franchise, with their darker or more chaotic tendencies either hidden or amplified depending on need.": "巫师对魔法的使用范围从混乱到灾难--这很适合许多收购公司的特许经营风格，令人震惊。当需要用魔法做出响亮而有力的营销声明时，请相信巫师能做到这一点。巫师的自然魅力为他们的魔法提供了动力，他们也是一个很好的特许经营的公众形象，根据需要，他们的黑暗或混乱的倾向会被隐藏或放大。",
	"Your natural charisma makes you the obvious choice to be the leader of your franchise. Others look to you constantly for inspiration, even if they're afraid to show it. And that's a good fit for you, because if you can tell others what to do and have them listen to you, it's easier to give the most dangerous frontline tasks to them while you cast from the back and reap the rewards.": "你的自然魅力使你成为特许经营权的领导者的明显选择。其他人不断向你寻求灵感，即使他们不敢表现出来。这很适合你，因为如果你能告诉别人该怎么做，并让他们听你的，就更容易把最危险的前线任务交给他们，而你则在后面指挥，获得回报。",
	"With great profit comes great responsibility, however, and it's important to let the other members of your franchise know that they have a place where their opinions matter. It's a place beneath you, sure, but good ideas often trickle upward. It's surprising how often a suggestion made by an underling turns out to be exactly what you were planning on thinking all along. And your understanding of chaos tells you it's easier by far to deal with the so-called law when you have a strong team at your back. Or, even better, at your front, so they're the ones drawing attention to themselves if things go bad.": "然而，巨大的利润伴随着巨大的责任，重要的是让你的特许经营权的其他成员知道，他们有一个地方，他们的意见很重要。当然，这是一个在你下面的地方，但好的想法往往是向上滴的。令人惊讶的是，一个下属提出的建议往往被证明正是你一直以来计划的想法。你对混乱的理解告诉你，当你有一个强大的团队在背后支持你的时候，处理所谓的法律要容易得多。或者，更好的是，在你的前面，所以如果事情变糟，他们才会引起人们的注意。",
	"All sorcerers rely on an arcane focus through which they channel their magic, but traditional focuses lack a singular style. Staffs, orbs, wands, blah, blah. You like to do things differently.": "所有的巫师都依赖一个奥术焦点，通过它来引导他们的魔法，但传统的焦点缺乏一种单一的风格。法杖、球体、魔杖，等等，等等。你喜欢以不同的方式做事。",

	"When you cast a spell, you go all in, channeling that magic through body and soul. Often, leftover magic from a casting manifests as a residual effect that can build up over repeated uses of your spells and cantrips. Some residual effects are subtle. Others are obvious to the point of distraction. But any such effect might eventually become a kind of spellcasting signature, ensuring that everyone knows the tenor of your magic as well as they know your name.": "当你施展法术时，你会全力以赴，通过身体和灵魂引导魔法。通常情况下，施法后剩余的魔力会表现为一种残余效应，在反复使用你的法术和咒语的过程中会逐渐积累。有些残余效果是微妙的。另一些则明显到让人分心的程度。但任何这样的效果最终都可能成为一种施法签名，确保每个人都知道你的魔法主旨，就像他们知道你的名字一样。",
	"A smell just slightly less noxious than troglodyte musk wafts off you from time to time.": "一种仅比troglodyte麝香稍逊一筹的气味不时地从你身上飘散出来。",
	"At random, your voice shifts three octaves higher or lower than normal.": "在随机的情况下，你的声音会比正常情况下高或低三个八度的转变。",

	"For 1 minute, you are 6 inches shorter or taller than normal.": "在1分钟内，你比正常人矮6英寸或高6英寸。",
	"Each sorcerer draws their power from different sources, based on their lineage or their connection to the multiverse. Your own lineage defines much about your place in the world and your approach to magic, and can help you establish your connection to your Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.": "每个巫师根据他们的血统或与多元宇宙的联系，从不同的来源吸取他们的力量。你自己的血统决定了你在这个世界上的位置和你对魔法的态度，并能帮助你建立与收购公司特许经营权的联系。",
	"As a divine soul, you have a special place in your franchise. Just as with the child of a wealthy business owner or an heir to a noble throne, your lineage and breeding demand respect, and it's your job to make sure your franchise mates understand that. Your success is ordained by the gods themselves, and you embrace that destiny by mastering the ways of business and adventuring, becoming the best you can be.": "作为一个神圣的灵魂，你在你的特许经营中拥有一个特殊的位置。就像一个富有的企业主的孩子或一个贵族王位的继承人一样，你的血统和教养需要得到尊重，你的工作是确保你的特许经营伙伴理解这一点。你的成功是由诸神自己决定的，你通过掌握商业和冒险的方法来拥抱这个命运，成为最好的自己。",
	"You know those people who seem to just automatically succeed at everything they do, tearing through life like it might be cheap parchment? Of course you do—because you are one. As the scion of mighty dragons, you are the master of everything you set your mind to. Adventuring, espionage, taking credit for your franchise's success—you do it all. And if you ever find yourself out of your depth, you're quick to establish that you're not actually out of your depth at all. You've totally got this!": "你知道那些似乎做什么事都能自动成功的人，把生活当成廉价的羊皮纸一样撕开？你当然知道，因为你就是这样的人。作为强大的龙的子孙，你是所有你想做的事情的主人。冒险、间谍活动、为你的特许经营权的成功邀功--你都能做到。如果你发现自己超出了自己的能力范围，你会很快确定你实际上根本没有超出自己的能力范围。你完全有这个能力。",
	"As a shadow sorcerer, your mysterious connection to the Shadowfell makes you a master of social encounters. The sinister laugh, the glowing eyes—nothing makes a clutch negotiation session go quicker. And when negotiations reach an impasse, your connection to the shadow world makes you a valuable tool for spying, infiltration, security, and, of course, killing.": "作为一名影子巫师，你与影子城的神秘联系使你成为社交活动的大师。阴险的笑声，发光的眼睛--没有什么能让一个紧要的谈判会议进行得更快。当谈判陷入僵局时，你与影子世界的联系使你成为间谍、渗透、安全，当然还有杀人的重要工具。",
	"Harnessing the energy of wind and lightning makes you great fun in combat. But as a storm sorcerer, you have even greater utility when your franchise travels overland or across water for business, as you shield allies and important cargo from inclement or dangerous weather. And sure, those allies harp sometimes about your occasional bouts of rage and your proclivity for blowing things up first and asking questions later. But you take it all in stride, because it's not like you have a temper or anything.": "掌握风和闪电的能量使你在战斗中获得极大的乐趣。但作为一个风暴巫师，当你的特许经营权在陆上或水上旅行时，你有更大的效用，因为你保护盟友和重要的货物免受恶劣或危险天气的影响。当然，那些盟友有时会对你偶尔的暴怒和你先炸东西后问问题的癖好提出异议。但你把这一切都看在眼里，因为你并不像有脾气或什么。",
	"In business, an element of unpredictability is the best means of keeping your franchise one step ahead of the competition—and nobody brings unpredictability like you do. Business plans and long-term strategies are all good, and kudos to your teammates for all their hard work on that stuff. But when a plan needs subtle refinement based on unexpected developments in the marketplace, you're the one who'll thoughtfully tear that plan up, burn it to ash, and just wing it.": "在商业中，不可预测的因素是保持你的特许经营权在竞争中领先一步的最佳手段--没有人像你这样带来不可预测的因素。商业计划和长期战略都是好的，为你的团队成员在这方面所做的努力点赞。但是，当一个计划需要根据市场的意外发展进行微妙的改进时，你就是那个会深思熟虑地把计划撕掉，把它烧成灰烬，然后随心所欲的人。",
	"A warlock can be an authoritative asset to an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, as their known association with powerful otherworldly forces makes for a great starting point in tough business negotiations. Likewise, a warlock's pact is the definitive binding contract, providing a unique insight into matters of debt and obligation.": "术士可以成为收购公司特许经营权的权威资产，因为他们与强大的其他世界力量的联系是艰难的商业谈判的一个伟大的起点。同样，术士的契约是具有约束力的最终合同，对债务和义务问题有独特的见解。",
	"The only thing you need to watch out for is making sure your work-life balance is in order. You want to be seen by your staff as the suave, fashionable master of your franchise's occult services, not the creepy weirdo with the glowing eyes always chuckling maniacally to yourself. As convenient as it might seem, remember that interns are not automatically potential sacrifices. Always check the individual contract first.": "你唯一需要注意的是确保你的工作和生活的平衡。你希望你的员工把你看作是一个风度翩翩的、时尚的、为你的专营店提供神秘服务的主人，而不是一个令人毛骨悚然的、眼睛发光的怪人，总是对自己狂笑。尽管看起来很方便，但请记住，实习生并不自动成为潜在的牺牲品。一定要先检查个人的合同。",
	"A diligent, results-minded individual is contracted to perform services for a higher-up, in exchange for career advancement. Have I described the perfect employee, or a warlock? Yes.": "一个勤奋的、注重结果的人被签约为上级提供服务，以换取职业晋升。我是否描述了一个完美的雇员，或者一个术士？是的。",
	"Being beholden to a strange, otherworldly entity gives you a certain style that none can match. Sometimes this style takes the form of an interesting quirk that makes you the memorable master of the dark arts you are.": "受制于一个奇怪的、另一个世界的实体，使你具有某种无人能及的风格。有时这种风格会以一种有趣的怪癖的形式出现，使你成为令人难忘的黑暗艺术大师。",

	"As a warlock, you bring every dark aspect of your dark path and darker calling to bear darkly on your franchise's operations. Wrapping yourself in mysterious defensive power or tagging an enemy in the face with {@spell eldritch blast} are just as valuable for corporate espionage as for tomb raiding.": "作为一个术士，你把你的黑暗道路和黑暗召唤的每一个黑暗方面都暗暗地影响到你的特许经营权的运作。将自己包裹在神秘的防御力量中，或者用{@spell eldritch blast}标记敌人的脸，对于公司的间谍活动和盗墓活动一样有价值。",
	"How you present yourself to the world at large is often a subtle reflection of your patron. Being a member of an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise means you have no trouble wearing suitable business apparel to make the right impression. But whether that stylish suit is made from fine Calimshan silk or the flayed skin of fiends is totally up to you.": "你如何向整个世界展示自己，往往是你的主顾的微妙反映。作为收购公司特许经营权的成员，意味着你不难穿上合适的商业服装，给人以正确的印象。但是，这套时尚的衣服是用上等的Calimshan丝绸还是恶魔的剥皮制成的，完全取决于你。",
	"There's an old Luskan saying: \"They could sell water to a sahuagin and it would come back for a refill.\" And that's you in a nutshell—using the connections of your pact to sell your skills, your services, and your legend. The right people need to hear about you, and the wrong people need to be completely unaware of your existence. A good motto for yourself (and your franchise, if the other characters are worthy) can be the difference between wasted days in endless taverns waiting for opportunities, and constantly filling your {@item bag of holding} with the sweetest loot.": "卢斯坎有句老话。\"他们可以把水卖给萨瓦金人，它就会回来补水。\" 这就是你的概况--利用你的契约的关系来推销你的技能、你的服务和你的传奇。正确的人需要听到你的消息，而错误的人则需要完全不知道你的存在。一个好的座右铭（如果其他角色值得的话，还有你的特许经营权）可以成为在无尽的酒馆中等待机会的蹉跎岁月和不断用最甜蜜的战利品填满你的（%0%）的区别。",

	"No matter what your pact, the process of binding yourself to power has prepared you well for life in an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Gathering secret information from the operatives of rival organizations, a bit of well-timed sabotage on some manufacturing equipment, or intimidating contractors into turning their backs on a rival are all regular business for an Acq Inc warlock.": "无论你的契约是什么，将自己与权力捆绑在一起的过程已经为你在收购公司特许经营中的生活做好了准备。从敌对组织的特工那里收集秘密信息，对一些制造设备进行适时的破坏，或恐吓承包商使其背弃对手，这些都是收购公司术士的常规业务。",

	"Many folk think of the fey as mysterious sylvan creatures that occasionally get up to harmless pranks. As a warlock of the Archfey, you know better—and are perfectly suited to lay the truth down whenever you can. You and your magic exemplify the duality of light and dark, and your motivations are often as inscrutable as those of your fey master. This can be an advantage when rivals are trying to suss out your plans. But it can be frustrating when allies start harping about, \"What are you up to?\", and \"Why won't you talk to us?\", and \"Why did you kill those people?\" Just tell them anything. It keeps them happy.": "许多人都认为精灵是神秘的森林生物，偶尔会搞一些无害的恶作剧。作为Archfey的术士，你知道得更多--而且完全适合在任何时候都能把真相说出来。你和你的魔法体现了光明与黑暗的双重性，你的动机往往和你的精灵主人的动机一样难以捉摸。当对手试图窥探你的计划时，这可能是一个优势。但当盟友开始唠叨：\"你要干什么？\"、\"你为什么不和我们说话？\"、\"你为什么要杀那些人？\"时，这可能会让人感到沮丧。只要告诉他们任何事情。这能让他们高兴。",
	"As a warlock of the Celestial, you meld the powerful magic of your class with the heavenly attitude of the Upper Planes. Your light-infused, radiant-based power makes it easy to establish trust among franchise mates and customers alike. That false sense of security then comes in handy whenever it's necessary to remind people that being good doesn't necessarily mean being lawful—and that even being lawful leaves a lot of wiggle room.": "作为天界的术士，你将自己等级的强大魔法与上层世界的天界态度相融合。你那充满光亮、以辐射为基础的力量使你很容易在特许经营的伙伴和客户之间建立信任。这种虚假的安全感在任何时候都能派上用场，因为你需要提醒人们，善良并不一定意味着合法，而且即使是合法，也会有很多回旋的余地。",
	"When people speak of doing deals with the darkness, you know just what they're talking about. As a warlock of the Fiend, you have a ton of experience walking the fine line between light and shadow. Or, you know, walking the shadow but being pretty sure the light is over there somewhere. As such, you're the perfect person to take point when your franchise needs to get down and dirty to succeed.": "当人们谈到与黑暗做交易时，你就知道他们在说什么了。作为恶魔的术士，你有大量的经验在光明和阴影之间行走。或者，你知道的，在阴影中行走，但非常确定光明就在那里。因此，当你的特许经营权要想获得成功，你是最合适的人选，你可以负责指挥。",
	"Everybody's met that one mind-addled poet at the end of the bar spouting all kinds of nonsense. But only you can really appreciate the truth of what they're talking about. As a warlock of the Great Old One, you harness the power of unreality and madness for the benefit of your franchise. You are known for consistently offering up plans and advice that go outside the box. Way, way outside.

	"As a warlock of the Hexblade, you dwell always within the realm of the disturbing and the unknown. But wow, is it worth it. Your ability to focus power through your weapons makes you a perfect franchise enforcer. Your aptitude for cursing, hexes, and dark magic makes you a skilled negotiator. And your ability to create spectral interns makes you a personnel manager's dream.": "作为一个六芒星的术士，你总是居住在令人不安和未知的领域中。但是，哇，这很值得。你通过你的武器集中力量的能力使你成为一个完美的特许执法者。你对诅咒、咒语和黑魔法的天赋使你成为一个熟练的谈判者。而你创造幽灵般的实习生的能力使你成为人事经理的梦想。",
	"The utility that a wizard brings to an Acquisitions Incorporated operation is obvious to franchise members, staff, clients, and rivals alike. Defensive spells, arcane travel rituals, eldritch utility magic—a wizard does it all. Plus, they'll blow things up when needed. And not surprisingly, things in an Acq Inc campaign need to get blown up a lot.": "巫师为收购公司的运作带来的效用，对加盟成员、员工、客户和对手来说都是显而易见的。防御性法术、神秘的旅行仪式、长生不老的实用魔法--巫师无所不能。此外，他们还会在需要时炸毁东西。毫不奇怪，在Acq公司的活动中，东西需要被炸得很厉害。",
	"It's easy to make the case that arcane magic is the most valuable component in any franchise business plan or strategic road map.

But in the small print, way down there at the bottom.": "在任何特许经营的商业计划或战略路线图中，奥秘的魔法是最有价值的组成部分，这一点很容易说得通。而作为一个巫师，你是有利的奥秘服务的高级供应商。只要确保员工和实习生的合同中有关于友军开火的风险的强烈措辞。但要写在小字里，在最下面的地方。",
	"No wizard will ever take offense to a polite round of applause from the rest of the party after a particularly well-crafted spell.": "没有哪个巫师会在一个特别精心制作的法术之后，对宴会其他成员的礼貌性掌声感到不快。",
	"Though wizard encompasses a single class, the study of arcane magic lends itself to a broad range of specialization. As such, it's not enough to simply dedicate yourself to being the best wizard you can be. It's about figuring out which wizardly path best addresses your franchise's potential needs.": "虽然魔法师包括一个单一的等级，但对奥术魔法的研究使其具有广泛的专业性。因此，仅仅致力于成为最好的魔法师是不够的。关键是要弄清楚哪条巫师之路最能满足你的专营权的潜在需求。",
	"Enchanters and illusionists in the service of a franchise can boggle the minds of enemies and allies. Transmuters, conjurers, and necromancers ensure that franchise members always have the right tool or monster for the job. Abjurers and diviners can help avoid catastrophic events before they happen. And evokers and war mages? No one needs to be reminded of the simple yet devastating majesty of a {@spell fireball} spell. Well, they don't need to be reminded more than once.": "为特许经营服务的魔法师和幻术师可以让敌人和盟友摸不着头脑。转化者、魔法师和死灵法师确保特许经营权成员总是有合适的工具或怪物来完成工作。魔法师和占卜师可以帮助避免灾难性事件的发生。而唤醒者和战争法师呢？没有人需要被提醒{@spell fireball}法术的简单但具有破坏性的威严。好吧，他们不需要被提醒不止一次。",
	"Your use of magic is always clean and precise. Still, tapping directly into the Weave to reshape reality or burn it to the ground has an eventual effect on the mind, and your sleep is often haunted by a recurring nightmare whose indelible images you cannot shake.": "你对魔法的使用总是干净而精确。不过，直接进入编织网来重塑现实或将其烧成灰烬，最终会对心灵产生影响，你的睡眠经常被反复出现的噩梦所困扰，而这些噩梦中不可磨灭的画面让你无法摆脱。",

	"Over the long years of study it took you to become a wizard, the arcane master you studied under left an indelible mark on you. Possibly a physical one. Kind or cruel, exacting or eccentric, this teacher shaped you during your apprentice days in profound and probably disturbing ways.

	"Protective magic is often underappreciated by the members of the lesser character classes, with their focus on dealing the most damage in the flashiest way possible. But in an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, where property and real estate need protection as much as the party members, your role as an abjurer is always greatly appreciated. Just don't make the rookie mistake of protecting everybody else before you take care of yourself and the goods. And if you need to reserve some spell slots before the rest of the party has been made sufficiently invulnerable? Hey, that's what potions are for.": "保护性的魔法往往不被那些较小的角色等级的成员所重视，他们的重点是以最华丽的方式造成最大的伤害。但在《收购公司》的特许经营中，财产和房地产与党员一样需要保护，你作为一个堕落者的角色总是受到极大的赞赏。只是不要犯新手的错误，在你照顾好自己和货物之前保护其他人。如果你需要在党的其他成员被变得足够无害之前保留一些法术槽？嘿，这就是药水的作用。",

As a conjurer, your utility to your franchise knows no bounds, whether you're creating the right tool for the job, summoning creatures for scouting or guard duty, or using {@spell dimension door} to slip away from a deal gone bad. The hard part of that last one is always figuring out which of your franchise mates you'll bring with you.

	"Seers and soothsayers abound in the world, but most ply their trade only to take advantage of the credulous and the desperate.

And sure, working on the credulous and the desperate is sometimes part of the plan. But when you do it, it's done with professional flare.": "预言家和占卜师在这个世界上比比皆是，但大多数人只是利用他们的贸易来利用那些轻信和绝望的人。你拥有占卜师的真正天赋，能够利用时间的流动来解读未来的预兆。你的占卜有助于为你的特许经营权消除风险，无论是在商业交易还是在危险的宝藏开采中。当然，对轻信的人和绝望的人下手有时也是计划的一部分。但当你这样做的时候，要用专业的眼光来看待。",
	"Trust. Community outreach. Social awareness. These things are important to every business, and as an enchanter, it's your job to ensure that your Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is synonymous with these concepts. Whether they're actually present in the franchise or not. When it comes down to it, having friends is an equally valuable asset in adventuring and business, and being able to turn enemies, rivals, and angry mobs into friends even for a short while can make a difference.": "信任。社区推广。社会意识。这些东西对每个企业都很重要，而作为一个魔法师，你的工作是确保你的收购公司的特许经营权是这些概念的同义词。无论它们是否真的存在于特许经营中。归根结底，在冒险和商业中，拥有朋友是同样宝贵的财富，能够把敌人、对手和愤怒的暴民变成朋友，哪怕是短暂的朋友，也会带来不同。",
	"As an evoker, you understand the wisdom of the adage, \"Speak softly and carry a big wand.\" As a member of Acquisitions Incorporated, you also know that the speaking softly part is entirely optional, contractually speaking. When your franchise needs firepower, you bring the damage and spread it in flashy, dramatic fashion. This works out great in the dungeon, and sometimes even at outdoor social events that don't feature a lot of flammable buildings nearby. In the boardroom or the council chamber, your skills are likely in less demand, but just knowing you're there can help keep the noble or the business magnate across the table fully engaged. Because as long as you are there, they know they're safe from having you burning their holdings to the ground.": "作为一个唤醒者，你明白 \"轻声细语，大手一挥 \"这句格言的智慧所在。作为收购公司的一员，你也知道，从合同上讲，轻声细语的部分是完全可以选择的。当你的特许经营权需要火力时，你会带来伤害，并以华丽的、戏剧性的方式传播它。这在地牢里非常有效，有时甚至在附近没有很多易燃建筑的户外社交活动中也是如此。在会议室或议事厅里，对你的技能的需求可能较少，但只要知道你在那里，就能让对面的贵族或商业巨头全情投入。因为只要你在那里，他们就知道他们是安全的，不会被你把他们的财产烧成灰烬。",
	"Success in business, as in combat, can often hinge on split-second decisions. As an illusionist, you have mastered the art of confounding the senses, leaving enemies, rivals, and customers uncertain as to what's real and what isn't. Once you convince those around you that they can't trust what they see or hear, that's a perfect opportunity to give them your preferred version of what's going on. Whether it's obscuring contracts, concealing incursions, or manifesting imaginary staff members to take the fall for your partners' misdeeds, your magic helps put the best possible illusory face on your franchise.": "生意上的成功，就像战斗中一样，往往取决于瞬间的决定。作为一个幻术师，你已经掌握了迷惑感官的艺术，让敌人、对手和客户无法确定什么是真实的，什么是不真实的。一旦你让你周围的人相信他们不能相信他们看到或听到的东西，这就是一个完美的机会，让他们知道你喜欢的版本。无论是掩盖合同、隐瞒入侵，还是显化出想象中的工作人员来为你的伙伴们的错误行为背黑锅，你的魔法都有助于为你的特许经营权披上最佳的虚幻面纱。",
	"As a necromancer, you've always had an easy time making friends. Hah! That's hilarious because your friends are undead. But not everyone else in your franchise sees the lighter side of your magical craft. Clearly, the labor-to-paid-benefits ratio of undead interns can't be beat, but you need to be cognizant of the potential public-relations nightmare of franchise-branded zombies running amok. Still, if things get bad, there's nothing like a general marketing campaign reminding local folk that necromancy means {@spell raise dead}. Even if you can't cast it.": "作为一个死灵法师，你总是很容易交到朋友。哈! 这很搞笑，因为你的朋友是亡灵。但在你的特许经营中，并不是每个人都能看到你的魔法工艺的轻松一面。显然，不死的实习生的劳动报酬率是无可比拟的，但你需要认识到特许经营品牌的僵尸横行的潜在公共关系恶梦。不过，如果事情变得糟糕，没有什么比一个普遍的营销活动更能提醒当地人，死灵法术意味着（%0%）。即使你不能施展它。",
	"As a transmuter, you practice one of the most subtle forms of magic—the transfiguration of one material substance into another. But let's be honest, your role in your franchise is going to be mostly about combat and ability buffs, and, \"Hey, why haven't you learned how to turn lead into gold yet?\" You take it in stride, though, because you understand that the long game is entirely about you. This franchise needs to be transformed from a chaotic mishmash of dysfunctional personalities and clashing goals into a well-tuned engine of commerce. And no one does transformation quite like you do.": "作为一个转化者，你练习最微妙的魔法形式之一--将一种物质转化为另一种物质。但说实话，你在你的特许经营中的作用主要是关于战斗和能力增强，以及，\"嘿，你为什么还没有学会如何把铅变成金子？\" 不过，你还是大步走了过来，因为你明白，长期的游戏完全是为了你。这个特许经营权需要从一个功能失调的人格和目标冲突的混乱混合体转变为一个精心调教的商业引擎。而没有人像你这样做转型。",
	"Success in business requires prudent caution and take-charge offense in equal measure. As a war mage, your focus on abjuration and evocation is thus a good fit for success. Many war mages feel it their duty to waste their lives (sometimes literally) on the battlefield. But you specialize in the more subtle conflicts of the marketplace, where you can take your skills to a whole new level. You cast spells under pressure, never blinking in the face of death or financial ruin. And when it's necessary, you can blow up an adversary like nobody's business. Just make sure your franchise's collateral damage insurance is all up to date.": "商业上的成功需要谨慎的小心和负责任的进攻，两者并重。作为一名战争法师，你对咒语和唤醒的关注因此很适合成功。许多战争法师认为在战场上浪费生命是他们的职责（有时是真的）。但你专攻市场上更微妙的冲突，在那里你可以将你的技能提升到一个全新的水平。你在压力下施展法术，面对死亡或经济损失从不眨眼。在必要的时候，你可以把对手炸得粉碎，无人能敌。只要确保你的特许经营权的附带损害保险都是最新的。",

	"To cast a spell that employs a royalty component (including using a {@item spell scroll} or other magic item that stores such a spell), a caster must have sufficient funds on their person. The cost of the casting is set by the caster who creates the spell, but is typically 1 gp per spell slot level. When the spell is cast, the royalty is magically transported to a coffer or other object designated by the creating spellcaster. This payment is made whether the caster using the spell is aware of the royalty component or not. If the caster does not have sufficient funds, the spell is not lost but it cannot be cast.": "要施展一个采用王权成分的法术（包括使用{@item spell scroll}或其他储存这种法术的魔法物品），施法者身上必须有足够的资金。施法的费用由创造咒语的施法者设定，但通常是每个咒语槽级别1个金币。当施法时，皇室成员会被神奇地运送到创造法术的施法者指定的一个库房或其他物体。无论使用该咒语的施法者是否意识到皇室成员的存在，这种支付都会进行。如果施法者没有足够的资金，法术不会丢失，但不能施展。",
