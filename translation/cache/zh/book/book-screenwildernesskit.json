	"During a chase,it's possible for the pursuers to become the quarry. For example, characters chasing a bandit through the woods might draw unwanted attention from other bandits. As they pursue the fleeing bandit, they must also evade the bandits pursuing them. Roll initiative for the new arrivals, and run both chases simultaneously. In another scenario, the fleeing bandit might run into the waiting arms of their accomplices.
