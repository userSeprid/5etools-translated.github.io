	"Volo has encountered many monsters in his day, few as odious or as ornery as the ones described herein. This chapter takes several iconic D&D monsters and provides additional information about their origins, their dispositions and behaviors, and their lairs-above and beyond what is written in the {@i Monster Manual.} To give every monster such grand treatment would require too many pages to count, so we winnowed down the list to nine groups of creatures that have a lot going for them and tend to get used often in D&D campaigns:": "沃罗在他的日子里遇到过很多怪物，但很少有像这里描述的那样可恶或讨厌的怪物。本章选取了几个具有代表性的D&D怪物，并提供了关于它们的起源、它们的性格和行为以及它们的巢穴的额外信息--超出了{@i Monster Manual.}中所记载的内容。 如果要对每个怪物进行如此隆重的处理，将需要太多的篇幅来计算，因此我们将名单缩小到九组生物，这些生物有很多优点，往往在D&D活动中经常被使用。",

	"If you plunder this chapter for ideas and maps the next time you create an adventure or a villain, then this material has served its purpose. We hope that, as you explore each monster section, you'll come up with new ways to challenge and entertain your players, as well as find new things that you can borrow for your own D&D campaign. Let each entry spark your imagination!": "如果你在下次创建冒险或反派时，能从这一章中获得一些想法和地图，那么这份材料就达到了它的目的。我们希望，在你探索每个怪物部分时，你会想出挑战和娱乐你的玩家的新方法，以及找到可以为你自己的D&D活动借用的新东西。让每个条目激发你的想象力吧",
	"The lore in this chapter represents the perspective of Volo and is mostly limited to the Forgotten Realms. In the Realms and elsewhere in the D&D multiverse, reality is more varied than the idiosyncratic views presented here. DM, use the material that inspires you and leave the rest.": "本章中的传说代表了沃罗的观点，主要限于被遗忘的领域。在王国和D&D多元宇宙的其他地方，现实比这里介绍的特异性观点更加丰富多彩。管理员，请使用能给你带来灵感的材料，其余的就不用管了。",
	"To those who would seek to conquer beholders or merely understand them, nearly everything about their quarry is unfathomable. These bizarre creatures are possessed of alien intelligence, inhuman forms of perception, and the ability to shape reality through force of will-or even by their mere presence. Inside the comfortable confines of its subterranean lair, a beholder is nearly unassailable thanks to the combination of its peerless intellect and the brutal effects of its eye rays.": "对于那些想要征服观世音菩萨或仅仅了解他们的人来说，关于他们的猎物的几乎所有事情都是深不可测的。这些怪异的生物拥有外星智慧、非人类的感知方式，以及通过意志力塑造现实的能力，甚至是通过他们的存在。在其地下巢穴的舒适范围内，由于其无以伦比的智力和其眼睛射线的残酷效果的结合，观察者几乎是不可撼动的。",
	"Some of the behaviors and motivations that beholders exhibit are analogous to those of humans and other intelligent creatures. The difference is one of degree. For instance, where a prideful, confident human might be cowed by a serious threat, the arrogance of a beholder knows no such bounds: it believes that it is superior to every other creature, even including other beholders. A human chess player becomes a master by honing the ability to look several moves ahead during a game-which is still no match for what a beholder can accomplish with its superior intelligence and awareness.": "持有人所表现出的一些行为和动机与人类和其他智能生物的行为和动机类似。区别在于程度。例如，一个骄傲自信的人类可能会被严重的威胁所吓倒，而持证人的傲慢却没有这种界限：它相信自己比其他所有的生物都优越，甚至包括其他持证人。一个人类棋手通过磨练在游戏中展望未来几步的能力而成为大师--但这仍然无法与持像者以其卓越的智慧和意识所能完成的事情相提并论。",
	"The mind of a beholder is powerful and versatile enough that it can envision literally any possibility, and it prepares accordingly, making it virtually impossible for any invaders to catch it unawares. This way of thinking could be interpreted as a form of paranoia-and if so, it would be the most extreme form imaginable. While a human tyrant might be rightfully paranoid about unperceived threats, a beholder is paranoid even though it perceives everything, because that attitude is the natural companion to eternal vigilance.": "观察者的思想足够强大和多才多艺，它可以设想到任何可能性，并做好相应的准备，使任何入侵者几乎不可能让它措手不及。这种思维方式可以被解释为一种偏执狂，如果是这样，那将是可以想象的最极端形式。虽然一个人类暴君可能会对未察觉的威胁产生理所当然的偏执，但一个看守者即使感知到了一切，也是偏执的，因为这种态度是永恒的警惕的自然伴侣。",
	"Beholders are among the few creatures that can shape reality in their vicinity. In addition, beholders don't truly sleep when they rest. Instead, a beholder's mind remains semiconscious even as it dreams. As a result, on rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another beholder, the dream-reality becomes warped and takes on physical form, becoming another actual beholder. To call this process reproduction would be inaccurate, because in most cases the old and new beholders fight to the death-a fact for which the rest of the world is thankful.": "观察者是少数能在其附近塑造现实的生物之一。此外，观想者在休息时并不真正睡觉。相反，持心者的头脑即使在做梦时也会保持半清醒状态。因此，在极少数情况下，当一个beholder梦到另一个beholder时，梦中的现实会变得扭曲并具有物理形态，成为另一个实际的beholder。将这一过程称为复制是不准确的，因为在大多数情况下，新旧持证人会争斗到死--这也是世界上其他地方所感谢的事实。",
	"A beholder sees in all directions. It is always looking for concealed attackers. Even when it sleeps, its smaller eyes remain open, scanning its lair for threats. If a human acted this way, the constant vigilance and lack of truly peaceful rest would lead to a dangerous level of psychosis, but a beholder's mind accepts this attitude as normal and necessary-it is always alert to the possibility of assassination or betrayal by unknown threats that stand ready to pounce on the beholder the instant it lets its guard down.": "观察者能看到所有的方向。它总是在寻找隐蔽的攻击者。即使在它睡觉的时候，它的小眼睛仍然睁着，扫描它的巢穴，寻找威胁。如果人类这样做，持续的警惕和缺乏真正的平静的休息会导致危险的精神错乱，但beholder的头脑接受这种态度是正常的和必要的--它总是警惕被未知的威胁暗杀或背叛的可能性，这些威胁准备在beholder放松警惕的瞬间扑向它。",
	"Complementing this ever-present, passive paranoia is the beholder's genius-level intelligence. Where another creature would ignore the occurrence of two seemingly unrelated events as merely coincidental, a beholder imagines multiple ways they could be related, finding or fabricating a pattern out of supposed or actual randomness. By thinking of all these possibilities-however implausible they might be-and extrapolating its own actions in response, a beholder is truly prepared for any situation and has a strategy to counteract it.": "与这种永远存在的、被动的偏执相辅相成的是看客的天才级智慧。其他生物会忽视两个看似不相关的事件的发生，认为这只是巧合，而看客会想象它们之间可能存在的多种关系，从假定或实际的随机性中找到或编造一种模式。通过思考所有这些可能性--无论这些可能性多么不可思议--并推断出自己的行动来应对，beholder对任何情况都有真正的准备，并有应对的策略。",
	"A beholder has plans on top of plans, even for the least likely circumstances. It doesn't matter if invading adventurers arrive at its lair with summoned angel allies or enslaved demons, by breaking through the floor, by teleporting or riding dinosaurs, or girded with layers of magical defenses and armed with advanced weapons. In any case, the beholder's reaction is calculated, because it has thought about what it and its minions must do in response to every situation.": "看守者在计划之上还有计划，甚至对最不可能发生的情况也有计划。如果入侵的冒险者带着被召唤的天使盟友或被奴役的恶魔来到它的巢穴，通过破门而入，通过传送或骑着恐龙，或者带着层层的魔法防御和先进的武器武装，这都不重要。在任何情况下，看守者的反应都是经过计算的，因为它已经想好了它和它的爪牙必须对每一种情况做出的反应。",
	"A beholder believes it is superior to all other entities. Unintelligent foes are regarded as food or pets. An intelligent creature is seen as food or a potential minion. A beholder's true rivals are other beholders, for only another beholder has the intellect, power, and magic to threaten another of its kind.": "观察者认为自己比其他所有实体都要优越。没有智慧的敌人被看作是食物或宠物。聪明的生物则被视为食物或潜在的奴才。一个持有者的真正对手是其他持有者，因为只有另一个持有者才有智力、力量和魔法来威胁另一个同类。",
	"Most of a beholder's mental activity is devoted to unearthing plots against itself (real or imaginary), planning attacks against known rivals, and preparing its defenses against all possible threats. It considers itself the center of the world, in a narcissistic way; of course the clan of duergar moving into its territory is because a rival is trying to oust it, of course the gang of adventurers in its lair were sent to kill it by a cowardly rival, and so on, because it is the perfect example of beholderness and all other creatures are jealous.": "一个beholder的大部分精神活动都是用来发掘针对自己的阴谋（真实的或想象的），计划对已知对手的攻击，并准备好防御所有可能的威胁。它认为自己是世界的中心，以一种自恋的方式；当然，迁入它领地的duergar氏族是因为对手要赶走它，当然，它巢穴里的那帮冒险者是由一个懦弱的对手派来杀它的，等等，因为它是beholderness的完美典范，所有其他生物都嫉妒。",
	"A beholder's arrogance is a prominent aspect of its personality. Although it isn't inclined to brag of its superiority, especially in combat, it is dismissive of its opponents' efforts and insulting of their abilities and failures. An exceptional challenger can earn a measure of respect-enough that the beholder might be merciful and pacify the creature with a charm ray or a sleep ray instead of killing it outright. Of course, this mercy has a purpose; the defeated opponent is interrogated, subjugated, and offered a role in the beholder's retinue once its will is broken. A beholder might consider a group of skilled adventurers to be a valuable prize and use its abilities to capture them all for this purpose, giving them the opportunity to serve as guards, spies, or assassins against a rival. Refusal means, at best, servitude as a charmed minion, and at worst, disintegration.": "看守者的傲慢是其个性的一个突出方面。虽然它并不倾向于吹嘘自己的优势，尤其是在战斗中，但它对对手的努力不屑一顾，对他们的能力和失败也是嗤之以鼻。一个出色的挑战者可以赢得一定程度的尊重，以至于看守者可能会手下留情，用魅力射线或睡眠射线来安抚这个生物，而不是直接杀死它。当然，这种仁慈是有目的的；被打败的对手会被审问，被征服，一旦它的意志被击垮，就会在看守者的随从中得到一个角色。看守者可能会认为一群熟练的冒险者是有价值的战利品，并为此利用其能力将他们全部捕获，让他们有机会充当卫兵、间谍或刺客来对付对手。拒绝意味着，在最好的情况下，作为一个被魅惑的奴仆，在最坏的情况下，解体。",
	"Beholders can produce others of their own kind, but the process has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with psychology.": "持有人可以产生自己的同类，但这个过程与生物学无关，与心理学有关。",
	"When a beholder sleeps, its body goes briefly dormant but its mind never stops working. The creature is fully aware, even though to an outside observer it might appear oblivious of its surroundings.": "当一个观察者睡觉时，它的身体会短暂地休眠，但它的头脑从未停止工作。这种生物是完全有意识的，尽管在外部观察者看来它可能对周围的环境视而不见。",
	"Sometimes a beholder's dreams are dominated by images of itself or of other beholders (which might or might not actually exist).": "有时，观察者的梦境被自己或其他观察者（可能存在也可能不存在）的形象所支配。",
	"On extremely rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another beholder, the act creates a warp in reality-from which a new, fully formed beholder springs forth unbidden, seemingly having appeared out of thin air in a nearby space. This \"offspring\" might be a duplicate of the beholder that dreamed it into existence, or it could take the form of a different variety of beholder, such as a death kiss or a gazer (see \"Beholder-Kin\"). It might also be a truly unique creature, such as could be spawned only from the twisted imagination of a beholder, with a set of magical abilities unlike that of its parent. In most cases, the process yields one of the three principal forms of the beholder: a solitary beholder, a hive, or a death tyrant.": "在极其罕见的情况下，当一个beholder梦到另一个beholder时，这种行为会在现实中产生一个扭曲--一个新的、完全形成的beholder会不由自主地涌现出来，似乎是在附近的空间中凭空出现的。这个 \"后代 \"可能是梦到它存在的那个Beholder的复制品，也可能采取不同种类的Beholder的形式，比如死亡之吻或凝视者（见 \"Beholder-Kin\"）。它也可能是一个真正独特的生物，比如只能从一个观想者扭曲的想象力中产生，拥有一套不同于其父母的魔法能力。在大多数情况下，这个过程会产生三种主要形式的看守者之一：一个单独的看守者，一个蜂巢，或者一个死亡暴君。",
	"Most of the beholders in the world live apart from others of their kind, and they like it that way. When a solitary beholder dreams another beholder into existence, the creatures' basic nature often means that the first thing they do is try to destroy one another. A solitary beholder lairs within a cave system or a ruined structure, either one of its own making or a place the creature took over after killing or driving off the beholder that gave it birth.": "世界上的大多数持币人都与其他同类分开生活，他们喜欢这种方式。当一个孤独的Beholder梦到另一个Beholder存在时，这些生物的基本性质往往意味着它们做的第一件事就是试图摧毁对方。一个孤独的beholder会在一个洞穴系统或一个废墟结构中藏身，要么是它自己制造的，要么是该生物在杀死或赶走让它出生的beholder之后占领的地方。",
	"A solitary beholder gathers (or inherits) inferior creatures that it uses as minions. These creatures help defend the lair and also serve as shock troops if the beholder vacates its lair to prey on the inhabitants of the surrounding area. Often, it plunders its neighbors' homes for knowledge and treasure. After the beholder secures the spoils it desires from its enemies, it allows its minions to divide the remaining booty.": "孤独的兽人收集（或继承）低等生物，并将其作为爪牙使用。这些生物帮助保卫巢穴，并且在兽人离开巢穴去掠夺周围地区的居民时充当冲击部队。通常情况下，它为了获取知识和财宝而掠夺其邻居的家园。当它从敌人那里获得它想要的战利品后，它允许它的爪牙瓜分剩余的战利品。",
	"An eye tyrant is a solitary beholder that has suppressed its xenophobia and paranoia and chooses to live as the leader or ruler of a community or an organization that includes other creatures. This doesn't mean that the eye tyrant likes, respects, or understands the creatures it chooses to associate with, but it does distinguish between individuals of other races and communicates with them on a regular basis. An eye tyrant is still ruthless at eliminating threats to itself, whether from another beholder or some other powerful creature-it just doesn't have an insane fear that any creature not under its direct control is working for an enemy. Most known beholders who choose to interact with humanoid society in any way are eye tyrants. For an example of an eye tyrant that leads an organization of humanoids, see the section on the Xanathar Guild.": "眼球暴君是一个独居的beholder，它压制了自己的仇外心理和偏执狂，选择作为一个社区或组织的领导者或统治者生活，其中包括其他生物。这并不意味着眼球暴君喜欢、尊重或理解它选择与之交往的生物，但它确实区分了其他种族的个体，并定期与他们交流。一个眼球暴君在消除对自己的威胁方面仍然是无情的，无论是来自另一个beholder还是其他强大的生物--它只是没有一种疯狂的恐惧，即任何不在它直接控制之下的生物都是为敌人工作。大多数已知的选择以任何方式与类人社会互动的beholder都是眼球暴君。关于一个领导人形生物组织的眼球暴君的例子，请参见Xanathar公会的部分。",
	"In exceedingly rare cases, a beholder might experience a dream in which it sees itself in a mirror, or encounters several copies of itself, or imagines a sensation akin to what humanoids call multiple personalities. At such a time, the beholder's dream-birthing creates a beholder hive-a group of \"newborns\" that are identical to its own shape but smaller.": "在极其罕见的情况下，持证人可能会经历一个梦，在梦中看到镜子中的自己，或遇到自己的几个副本，或想象一种类似于人类称之为多重人格的感觉。在这种情况下，观察者的梦境孕育出一个观察者蜂巢--一群与自己的形状相同但更小的 \"新生儿\"。",
	"When the dreamer awakens, it treats the newborns as extensions of its own self in other bodies, and therefore isn't consumed with an urge to kill them. This united group of identical beholders doesn't truly have a hive intelligence, but their personalities and goals are so similar that they can predict and assume each others' behavior, much as especially close human siblings can. The original beholder is usually the dominant one and takes a leadership role. A hive consists of three to ten beholders, plus whatever minions they control.": "当梦者醒来时，它把新生儿当作自己在其他身体中的延伸，因此不会被杀死他们的冲动所吞噬。这个由相同的持梦者组成的联合团体并不真正拥有蜂巢式的智慧，但他们的个性和目标是如此相似，以至于他们可以预测和假设对方的行为，就像特别亲密的人类兄弟姐妹一样。最初的蜂王通常是主导者，并发挥领导作用。一个蜂巢由三到十个蜂主组成，加上他们控制的任何爪牙。",
	"As a beholder ages, it spends more and more time worrying about its mortality. The dreams of such a death-fearing beholder might reach into strange corners of reality and imagine circumstances in which the creature can live on after death. When the beholder awakens, it finds itself transformed into a death tyrant. It now exists in a state of undeath-yet its fear of being killed remains unabated.": "随着观音的衰老，它花越来越多的时间来担心自己的死亡。这样一个惧怕死亡的看守者的梦境可能会深入到现实的奇怪角落，并想象生物在死后可以继续生存的情况。当看客醒来时，它发现自己变成了一个死亡暴君。它现在存在于一种不死的状态--然而它对被杀的恐惧仍然没有减弱。",
	"A death tyrant's paranoia about its enemies tends to be related to how it fears it will be destroyed, and its plans take that fear into account. For example, a death tyrant who imagined it would eventually be slain by frost giants might relocate its lair to the inside of a volcano, send its minions to hunt down all frost giants within 100 miles, or take some other drastic measure to ensure that the fear never becomes reality.": "一个死亡暴君对敌人的偏执往往与它担心自己会被摧毁有关，它的计划也考虑到了这种恐惧。例如，一个死亡暴君如果想象自己最终会被冰霜巨人杀死，可能会把巢穴迁到火山内部，派它的爪牙去追杀100英里内的所有冰霜巨人，或者采取一些其他严厉的措施来确保这种恐惧永远不会成为现实。",
	"The lesser creatures known as beholder-kin bear a superficial resemblance to true beholders in that each has a floating spherical body with eyes. That's where the similarity ends.": "被称为beholder-kin的较小的生物与真正的beholder有表面上的相似之处，即每个人都有一个带眼睛的漂浮的球形身体。这就是相似之处的结束。",
	"Chapter 3 of this book introduces several new types of beholder-kin. A {@b death kiss} is usually the result of a nightmare about blood, such as what a beholder might experience after an encounter with a vampire or after being severely wounded in battle. {@b Gazers} are \"born\" out of a poisoned or ill beholder's feverish dreams, in which its sense of perspective and scale is warped. A {@b spectator} (see the {@i Monster Manual)} is a kind of lesser beholder summoned from another plane of existence to watch over something, such as a treasure hoard. A {@b gauth} hails from the same plane as spectators, or one that overlaps it enough that they can take advantage of a flawed attempt to summon a spectator. Although true beholders can be found on a spectator's or gauth's home plane, the creatures' actual place of origin is unknown (whether another plane, a world beyond the stars, or some stranger location), and spectators and gauths aren't believed to originate from dreams as other beholders do.": "本书第三章介绍了几种新类型的beholder-kin。{@b death kiss}通常是关于血的恶梦的结果，比如说，在遇到吸血鬼或在战斗中受重伤后，beholder可能会经历这样的噩梦。{@b Gazers}是由中毒或生病的人在发烧的梦中 \"出生 \"的，在梦中，他们的视角和尺度被扭曲了。{@b spectator}（见{@i Monster Manual)}）是一种从另一个存在空间被召唤出来的较小的观想者，以看管一些东西，比如说一个宝藏。{@b gauth}的人来自与观察者相同的位面，或与位面有足够的重叠，他们可以利用有缺陷的召唤观察者的尝试。虽然真正的观望者可以在观望者或高斯的主位面被发现，但这些生物的实际起源地是未知的（无论是另一个位面、星际之外的世界，还是一些陌生的地方），而观望者和高斯并不像其他观望者那样被认为来自梦境。",
	"As a byproduct of their unique method of propagation, beholders in one part of the world tend to look similar, with variations becoming more pronounced the farther one travels from that area. Even a slight variation in the shape of an eyestalk or the texture of its skin is enough for one beholder to consider another a flawed abomination, which should be destroyed.": "作为他们独特的传播方法的副产品，世界上某一地区的人往往看起来很相似，离那个地区越远，变化就越明显。即使是眼柄的形状或皮肤的质地有轻微的变化，也足以让一个人认为另一个人是有缺陷的可憎之物，应该被摧毁。",

	"A beholder's natural ability to fly is essential to many of its defenses and habits. Portions of its lair-especially the remote part where it sleeps-usually aren't reachable on foot, which makes it harder for its minions to take over the lair, and forces intruders to find ways to overcome steep vertical climbs.": "Beholder的自然飞行能力对于它的许多防御和习惯都是至关重要的。它的巢穴的一部分--特别是它睡觉的偏远地区--通常是无法步行到达的，这使得它的爪牙更难接管巢穴，并迫使入侵者想办法克服陡峭的垂直爬升。",
	"Also, a beholder's natural levitation means it doesn't risk activating any floor-based traps, and therefore it is likely to use such defenses to protect its inner sanctum, allowing it to roam freely through the area while hostiles must dodge or overcome multiple obstacles.": "另外，看守者的自然漂浮意味着它不会冒险激活任何基于地板的陷阱，因此它很可能使用这种防御措施来保护它的内部圣地，允许它在该地区自由漫游，而敌人必须躲避或克服多种障碍。",

	"Even intruders who don't need light to see have to contend with the beholder's superior senses-the monster can see its opponents before 60-foot darkvision sees it.": "即使是那些不需要灯光就能看到的入侵者，也不得不与看客的超强感官抗衡--怪物可以在60英尺的暗视仪看到它之前看到它的对手。",
	"Although a beholder can't use its rays on targets inside the area of its antimagic cone, the ability of its central eye is incredibly effective in combat-instantly crippling enemy spellcasters, revealing the exact location of anyone using blur or invisibility, and causing opponents using magical flight to plummet to the ground. The cone is wide enough that the beholder can usually redirect it toward any particular creature trying to escape the area, keeping that target locked down until the monster has killed all the enemies outside the cone.": "虽然看守者不能对其反魔法锥体范围内的目标使用射线，但其中央眼睛的能力在战斗中是非常有效的--立即削弱敌人的施法者，揭示任何使用模糊或隐身的人的确切位置，并使使用魔法飞行的对手坠落到地面。这个圆锥体足够宽，持证人通常可以将它转向任何试图逃离该区域的特定生物，将该目标锁定，直到该怪物杀死圆锥体外的所有敌人。",
	"A beholder can use its telekinesis ray in conjunction with its antimagic cone to lift a heavy object above the cone and drop it onto an opponent inside the cone; gravity finishes the job, even though the cone negates the beholder's telekinetic control.": "看守者可以用它的心灵感应射线和它的反魔法圆锥体结合起来，把一个重物举到圆锥体上方，然后把它扔到圆锥体内的对手身上；尽管圆锥体否定了看守者的心灵感应控制，但重力完成了这项工作。",
	"The ability to temporarily suspend magical effects is useful to a beholder for determining if a minion has been charmed or compelled to act against its master; the creature might change its behavior when inside the cone, or it might remember or be able to speak of things it was compelled to forget or keep secret.": "暂时中止魔法效果的能力对观察者来说是很有用的，它可以确定一个奴仆是否被迷住了，或者被强迫对它的主人采取行动；这个生物在圆锥体内时可能会改变它的行为，或者它可能记得或者能够说出它被强迫忘记或保密的事情。",
	"Because the cone suppresses ongoing magical effects, the beholder might create a secure area in its lair behind a permanent wall of fire or wall of force, make use of an existing magical hazard (such as a pool that transforms any creature that touches it), or an area with magical guardians (such as an old shrine with a demon bound to it) that it can bypass.": "因为圆锥体抑制了正在进行的魔法效果，所以看守者可能会在它的巢穴中创造一个安全的区域，在永久的火墙或力墙后面，利用现有的魔法危险（比如一个可以改变任何触及它的生物的水池），或者一个有魔法守护者的区域（比如一个被恶魔束缚的古老神殿），它可以绕过这个区域。",
	"A beholder can fire multiple eye rays on its turn, and it might use all of them in succession on its most dangerous foe. Even a very tough fighter is going to have second thoughts after taking damage from a disintegration ray, an enervation ray, and a death ray.": "一个看守者可以在它的回合中发射多条眼睛射线，而且它可能对它最危险的敌人连续使用所有这些射线。即使是一个非常顽强的战士，在受到瓦解射线、保存射线和死亡射线的伤害后，也会有第二个想法。",
	"A beholder can shift its targets after its first or second rays. For example, if a beholder intends to shoot charm, slowing, and sleep rays at a ranger, and the ranger succumbs to the charm, the beholder could use its remaining rays against other targets.": "看守者可以在其第一或第二道射线之后转移目标。例如，如果一个持有者打算向一个游侠发射魅惑、减速和睡眠射线，而游侠屈服于魅惑，那么持有者可以用剩余的射线来对付其他目标。",
	"The beholder's ability to use legendary actions effectively doubles the number of times it can shoot rays in a round. Each legendary action a beholder takes gives it an opportunity to react to a change in circumstances, or to press an assault that it began on its turn. For instance, it might use its sleep ray as a legendary action against an enemy that has just been awakened. If no such opportunity presents itself, legendary actions are always useful for piling rays on the most dangerous foe.": "看守者使用传奇行动的能力有效地使它在一个回合中可以射出射线的次数加倍。持枪者采取的每一个传奇行动都使它有机会对环境的变化做出反应，或在它的回合中开始攻击。例如，它可以用它的睡眠射线作为传奇行动来对付刚刚被唤醒的敌人。如果没有这样的机会，传奇行动对于将射线堆积在最危险的敌人身上总是有用的。",
	"A beholder in its lair has access to so many resources that it can often vanquish invaders without directly confronting them. Devious and hidden traps are liable to be lurking around every corner, and might be blatantly obvious in some places, yet no less lethal. In similar fashion, a beholder might station some of its minions in a prime spot for an ambush, or it might send forth a bunch of its servants to overrun a group of enemies that have been weakened by traps and other hazards. Every beholder has minions, and can always acquire more, so the master of the lair doesn't hesitate to send its underlings into the fray.": "在它的巢穴中，看守者可以获得如此多的资源，以至于它往往可以在不直接面对入侵者的情况下将其消灭。狡猾和隐蔽的陷阱很可能潜伏在每个角落，在某些地方可能是明目张胆的，但也不乏致命性。同样地，一个拥有者可能会把它的一些爪牙驻扎在一个最好的地方进行伏击，或者它可能会派出一群仆人去消灭一群被陷阱和其他危险所削弱的敌人。每个人都有爪牙，而且总能获得更多的爪牙，所以巢穴的主人会毫不犹豫地把它的下属派到战场上。",
	"As described in the {@i Monster Manual,} a beholder's use of its eye rays in combat is random, governed by die rolls instead of by choice. This rule is an abstraction, designed to keep the beholder's opponents unsure of what rays will be coming next (and, not incidentally, to prevent the monster from using its most lethal eye rays at every opportunity). The rule also makes the creature easier to run.": "正如{@i Monster Manual,}中所描述的那样，在战斗中，beholder对其眼睛射线的使用是随机的，由掷骰子决定，而不是由选择决定。这条规则是一个抽象的概念，目的是让看守者的对手不确定接下来会有什么射线（而且，并非偶然地，是为了防止怪物一有机会就使用它最致命的眼睛射线）。这条规则也使该生物更容易跑动。",
	"In the safety of its lair, outside the view of any would-be enemies, a beholder can use any of its eye rays whenever it wants to. Many of them serve as tools.": "在安全的巢穴中，在任何可能的敌人的视线之外，持证人可以随时使用它的任何眼射线。它们中的许多都可以作为工具。",
	"The magic-nullifying effect of a beholder's central eye has a number of possible uses outside combat, but if it's not needed, the beholder can turn it off by simply closing the eye.": "看守者中央眼睛的魔法消除效果在战斗之外有许多可能的用途，但如果不需要它，看守者可以通过简单地关闭眼睛来关闭它。",
	"Normally usable only by a death tyrant, negative energy prevents survivors of a battle from healing and animates any dead or dying creatures as zombies under the beholder's control. Because there is no limit to the number of zombies a death tyrant can animate and control, it can pack its lair so full of undead that there is little space for anyone to walk, creating a shambling barrier of cadaverous resistance against any invasion.": "通常只有死亡暴君才能使用，负能量能阻止战斗中的幸存者痊愈，并使任何死亡或濒临死亡的生物成为受其控制的僵尸。由于死亡暴君可以控制的僵尸数量没有限制，它可以把自己的巢穴塞得满满的，以至于几乎没有空间让人行走，形成一个尸骨嶙峋的屏障，抵御任何入侵。",
	"It is common for a beholder to charm a hostile monster, lure the creature to the beholder's lair, and confine it there so it can't escape under its own power. In this way, even monsters that can't be bribed or coerced can be useful to a beholder, making its lair a confusing zoo of hostile beasts.": "魅惑敌方怪物，将其引诱到魅惑者的巢穴，并将其禁锢在那里，使其无法靠自己的力量逃脱，这是一种常见的做法。这样一来，即使是那些不能被收买或胁迫的怪物也能对看守者有用，使其巢穴成为一个充满敌意的混乱动物园。",
	"Although each use of the charm effect lasts only an hour, repeated uses over time against the same target tend to wear down a creature's will, creating a docile servant.": "虽然每次使用魅惑效果只持续一个小时，但长期对同一目标反复使用，往往会消磨生物的意志，形成一个温顺的仆人。",
	"Outside combat, the paralyzing ray is most often used to restrain a fleeing minion that it doesn't want to destroy outright.": "在战斗之外，麻痹射线最常被用来克制它不想直接摧毁的逃亡的小兵。",
	"A beholder uses its fear ray to psychologically torture and interrogate a prisoner until the creature loses the will to resist.": "看守者使用其恐惧射线对囚犯进行心理折磨和审讯，直到该生物失去抵抗的意志。",
	"A beholder might use its slowing ray on an uncooperative creature as a demonstration of sorts, threatening to follow it up with more severe consequences if the creature doesn't submit to the beholder's will.": "观察者可能会对一个不合作的生物使用它的减速射线作为某种示范，威胁说如果这个生物不服从观察者的意志，就会有更严重的后果。",
	"A beholder can fine-tune its death ray or enervation ray so that it can \"zap\" the smallest of targets and deal only a small amount of damage (though usually still enough to obliterate what it touches). For example, to guard against magical spying, a beholder might use either ray to eliminate all common vermin (bats, rats, spiders, and so on) from its lair.": "看守者可以微调它的死亡射线或保留射线，以便它可以 \"斩杀 \"最小的目标，只造成少量的伤害（尽管通常仍足以抹去它所接触的东西）。例如，为了防止魔法间谍活动，持枪者可以使用这两种射线来消灭其巢穴中的所有普通害虫（蝙蝠、老鼠、蜘蛛等等）。",
	"In addition to functioning as the beholder's arms and hands for everyday tasks, the telekinetic ray is essential for building traps and other lair defenses, such as positioning the weights for a falling block trap. This ray allows a beholder to station its minions in parts of the lair that can otherwise be accessed only by climbing or flying, preventing the occupants from escaping. A beholder could also use its telekinetic ray to forcibly transport a creature immune to charm effects (such as a construct or some kinds of undead).": "除了作为看守者的手臂和手来完成日常任务外，心灵感应射线对于建造陷阱和其他巢穴防御系统是必不可少的，例如为落块陷阱定位重量。这条射线允许持有者在巢穴的某些部分驻扎其爪牙，否则只能通过攀爬或飞行进入，以防止居住者逃跑。看守者也可以用它的心灵感应射线来强行运送对魅惑效果免疫的生物（如构筑物或某些种类的不死生物）。",
	"When it parlays with other creatures, a beholder might use its sleep ray as a display of power, quickly disabling the leader and thereby persuading the rest of the group to mount no resistance. This tactic is useful primarily when the beholder intends to use the group for its own purposes, and keeping the leader alive is advantageous to those plans. This ray is also used to pacify potentially useful captives, perhaps in preparation for conditioning them with the charm or fear rays.": "当它与其他生物结盟时，持灵者可能会使用它的睡眠射线作为力量的展示，迅速使首领丧失能力，从而说服其余的群体不做抵抗。这种战术主要是在持灵者打算利用群体达到自己的目的，并且保持首领活着对这些计划有利的情况下才有用。这种射线也被用来安抚可能有用的俘虏，也许是为了准备用魅力射线或恐惧射线来调节他们。",
	"The most mundane function of the petrification ray is as a means of decorating a beholder's lair with statues. Beyond that, this ray has a multitude of uses. An unruly minion could be turned to stone, eliminating the creature as a threat and creating a permanent reminder of the price of disobeying the beholder. A beholder might use loosely scattered petrified creatures to create obstacles in an open chamber, or pack them tightly in a corridor to seal off an area, or use them as falling hazards instead of heavy blocks in order to engender fear and uncertainty among intruders.": "石化射线最平凡的功能是用雕像来装饰观察者的巢穴。除此之外，这种射线还有多种用途。一个不守规矩的奴仆可以被变成石头，消除该生物的威胁，并创造一个永久的提醒，提醒人们不服从看守人的代价。看守者可以用松散的石化生物在一个开放的密室中制造障碍，或者把它们紧紧地包在走廊里来封闭一个区域，或者把它们当作坠落的危险，而不是重物，以便在入侵者中引起恐惧和不确定性。",
	"A beholder's disintegration ray is a useful tool for excavation. The beholder can also manipulate the ray with pinpoint control, enabling it to cut and shape objects as though it were wielding a fine chisel, drill holes too small for an arrow to pass through, carve masonry blocks out of raw stone, amputate limbs, or brand creatures with burn-like scars. This ray and the telekinetic ray are the basis for a beholder's ability to shape its lair to its very specific and exacting needs, whether sculpting rooms or fabricating traps.": "观察者的瓦解射线是一种有用的挖掘工具。看守者还可以精确地操纵射线，使其能够像挥舞着一把精细的凿子一样切割和塑造物体，钻出小到箭都无法通过的孔，从原石上雕刻出砖石块，截断肢体，或者给生物烙上烧伤般的疤痕。这条射线和心灵感应射线是观察者根据其非常具体和严格的需要塑造其巢穴的能力的基础，无论是雕刻房间还是制造陷阱。",
	"When a beholder's dream-imagination runs wild, the result can be an offspring that has an unusual or unique set of abilities. Rather than the standard powers of a beholder's central eye and eyestalks, the creature has one or more variant abilities-guaranteed to surprise any enemies who thought they knew what they were getting themselves into.": "当一个看守者的梦想-想象力失控时，其结果可能是产生一个具有不寻常或独特能力的后代。这种生物并不是拥有中心眼和眼线的标准能力，而是拥有一种或多种变异能力--保证能让那些自以为是的敌人大吃一惊。",
	"This section provides several alternative spell effects for a beholder's eye. Each of these effects is designed to be of the same power level as the one it replaces, enabling you to create a custom beholder without altering the monster's challenge rating. As another option, you can switch any of the damaging eye rays in the {@i Monster Manual} to an effect with a different damage type, such as replacing the enervation ray with a combustion ray that deals fire damage instead of necrotic damage.": "本节提供了几个可供选择的 \"观察者之眼 \"的法术效果。每种效果都被设计成与它所替代的效果具有相同的威力等级，使你能够在不改变怪物的挑战等级的情况下创建一个自定义的观世音。作为另一种选择，你可以将{@i Monster Manual}中的任何一个伤害性眼球射线换成具有不同伤害类型的效果，例如用燃烧射线取代保留射线，以造成火焰伤害而不是坏死伤害。",
	"Unless otherwise indicated, an alternative ability has the same range as the eye ray it is replacing, and it affects only one creature per use (even if the ability is based on a spell that normally affects an area or multiple targets). The saving throw for an alternative ability uses the same DC and the same ability score as the spell the eye ray is based on.": "除非另有说明，替代能力的范围与它所替代的眼线相同，而且每次使用只能影响一个生物（即使该能力是基于通常影响一个区域或多个目标的咒语）。替代能力的救赎使用相同的DC和相同的能力分数，就像眼线所基于的咒语一样。",

	"The lair of a beholder is a reflection of the creature's mind-set-designed to anticipate, and thwart, any plan that would-be invaders might devise. Each of its chambers is isolated, accessible from only one or two other areas, giving the beholder control over the route that enemies must take to reach the sanctum where the owner of the place lies in wait.": "看守者的巢穴反映了该生物的心态--旨在预测并挫败潜在入侵者可能制定的任何计划。它的每一个房间都是孤立的，只能从一两个其他区域进入，让看守者控制敌人必须走的路线，以到达这里的主人所等待的圣殿。",
	"A beholder usually creates its lair in an area of natural caves, shaping the chambers with its disintegration ray. Most of the entryways and passages that it fashions to connect one chamber with another are too narrow to admit creatures larger than itself (particularly in the innermost chambers). If any large openings between adjacent caves exist naturally, the beholder constricts or seals off such openings, either by employing slave labor or by collapsing the tunnel itself.": "看守者通常会在一个天然洞穴的区域内建立自己的巢穴，用它的分解射线来塑造这些洞穴。它所塑造的连接一个洞室和另一个洞室的入口和通道大多过于狭窄，无法接纳比自己大的生物（尤其是在最里面的洞室）。如果相邻洞穴之间有任何大的开口自然存在，看守者就会通过雇佣奴隶劳工或关闭隧道本身来收缩或封闭这些开口。",
	"Regardless of its overall configuration, every beholder's lair is oriented to take full advantage of the creature's flight ability. Adjoining chambers are connected by vertical or steeply sloped tunnels that the beholder carves out of the surrounding stone, each passage barely large enough to admit the beholder's body. Enemies that are too big to traverse these smooth-walled tunnels will find it difficult to move deep into the lair and virtually impossible to confront the beholder in its sanctum.": "无论其整体配置如何，每一个beholder的巢穴的方向都是为了充分利用生物的飞行能力。相邻的房间由垂直或陡峭的隧道连接，这些隧道是由看守者在周围的石头上开凿出来的，每条通道几乎都大到足以容纳看守者的身体。体型太大，无法穿越这些光滑墙壁的隧道的敌人会发现很难深入巢穴，而且几乎不可能在圣殿中与持灵者对抗。",
	"Minions and other creatures under a beholder's control generally have their own living spaces in the lair. Because a beholder's minions are typically not able to fly, many of these chambers are connected to others by staircases or gently sloping ramps in addition to the tunnels, so the beholder can easily move its minions around as the need arises.": "仆人和其他受看守者控制的生物通常在巢穴中拥有自己的生活空间。由于看守者的爪牙通常不能飞行，因此除了隧道之外，许多这些房间都通过楼梯或缓坡坡道与其他房间相连，因此看守者可以在需要时轻松地移动其爪牙。",
	"Common rooms found in a beholder's lair are described in the sections that follow.": "在看守者的巢穴中发现的普通房间将在后面的章节中描述。",
	"The main living area that the beholder uses is filled with objects that the creature enjoys looking at, such as art, statues, and its latest spoils of victory. The floor is uneven and difficult for intruders to navigate. Minions usually guard the entrances to this chamber.": "观察者使用的主要生活区充满了该生物喜欢看的物品，如艺术品、雕像和它最新的胜利战利品。地板不平，入侵者难以驾驭。仆人们通常守卫在这个房间的入口处。",
	"A lair has several escape tunnels, each closed off inside the lair by a large boulder or a mortared stone wall. Most of these routes are blocked on both ends, preventing creatures from easily entering the lair through anywhere but the main entrance. The beholder, of course, can disintegrate these barriers to gain access to the tunnel. As with the tunnels between chambers, escape tunnels are usually a steep climb or nearly vertical to make it difficult for non-flying creatures to follow. A tunnel bends every 50 to 100 feet to prevent attackers from shooting at the beholder while it flees, but giving the monster opportunities to attack when its enemies come into view. Many escape tunnels have falling block traps or weak ceilings supported by a single pillar, which the beholder can disintegrate after it passes that point to deter pursuit.": "一个巢穴有几条逃生通道，每条通道都被一块大石头或一堵加固的石墙封闭在巢穴内。这些通道的两端大多被封死，防止生物从主入口以外的任何地方轻易进入巢穴。当然，观察者可以瓦解这些障碍物以获得进入隧道的机会。与密室之间的隧道一样，逃生隧道通常是一个陡峭的攀登，或者几乎是垂直的，以使非飞行生物难以跟随。隧道每隔50到100英尺就会有一个弯道，以防止攻击者在它逃跑时向它射击，但当它的敌人出现在视野中时，就会给怪物以攻击的机会。许多逃生隧道都有坠落的块状陷阱或由一根柱子支撑的薄弱天花板，持物者在通过该点后可以将其瓦解以阻止追击。",
	"Because a beholder's paranoia knows no limits, it often designs its lair to include secret passageways that are used for reconnaissance or surprise attacks. (These features aren't shown on the accompanying map, but can be located anywhere you see fit.) A typical arrangement is a network of tunnels running above the main chambers of the lair, each wide enough for the beholder to fly through. Fist-sized holes in the floors of these tunnels open into the rooms below, allowing the beholder to spy on creatures in its lair and perhaps target them with eye rays. (Opponents can shoot back, but the holes function like arrow slits and provide three-quarters cover to the beholder.)": "因为看守者的偏执是无止境的，所以它的巢穴经常设计成包括秘密通道，用于侦察或突袭。(这些特征没有在随附的地图上显示，但可以位于你认为合适的任何地方。) 一个典型的安排是，在巢穴的主要房间上方有一个隧道网络，每个隧道都足够宽，可以让人飞过去。这些通道的地板上有拳头大小的洞，可以通向下面的房间，让看守者可以窥视巢穴中的生物，也许可以用眼射线瞄准它们。(对手可以反击，但这些洞的功能就像箭缝一样，为看守者提供四分之三的掩护。)",
	"The lair has rooms set aside for the beholder's minions, where those creatures live, cook, eat, and sleep.": "巢穴里有为看守者的爪牙预留的房间，这些生物在那里生活、做饭、吃饭和睡觉。",
	"A beholder often sets aside a chamber to hold captives that it chooses not to kill. The simplest kind of prison, easy enough for a beholder to create, typically consists of 20-foot-deep holes disintegrated into the floor, some times covered with a wood or metal grating. A prisoner is stripped of weapons and magic items, thrown into one of the holes, and guarded by minions at all times.": "看守者通常会留出一个房间来关押它选择不杀的俘虏。最简单的一种监狱，对于一个看守者来说很容易创建，通常由20英尺深的洞组成，被分解在地板上，有些时候用木头或金属栅栏覆盖。囚犯被剥夺了武器和魔法物品，被扔进其中一个洞里，并一直由爪牙看守着。",
	"The beholder's private chamber is usually at the highest elevation inside the lair and accessible only through a long vertical tunnel. Here, the beholder rests and plots. The room typically contains a nest of sand or cloth bedding and the beholder's favorite pieces of sculpture.": "看守者的私人密室通常位于巢穴内的最高处，只能通过一条长长的垂直隧道进入。在这里，观察者休息和谋划。房间里通常有一窝沙子或布制的被褥和看守者最喜欢的雕塑作品。",
	"Beyond the lair entrance lies the vestibule. Rather than being sculpted with tools or eye rays, the entrance and the vestibule are left in their natural form to mislead intruders who might be expecting an artificially created structure. The floor of the vestibule is usually 15 feet or more lower than the entrance corridor, and the chamber is often inhabited by shriekers, which act as an early warning system.": "巢穴入口之外是前庭。入口和前庭并不是用工具或眼线雕刻出来的，而是以其自然形态存在，以误导那些可能期待人工创造的结构的入侵者。前庭的地板通常比入口处的走廊低15英尺或更多，而且室内经常居住着尖叫者，作为早期警告系统。",
	"A room not dedicated to some other purpose could be festooned with a variety of traps. In addition to traps that are meant to catch ground-based creatures, a beholder creates or positions certain traps so that they're effective against flying intruders.": "一个没有专门用于其他目的的房间可以用各种陷阱来装饰。除了用来捕捉地面生物的陷阱外，观察者还可以创造或安置某些陷阱，使其对飞行入侵者有效。",
	"Practically any kind of trap could be a feature of a beholder's lair. A few possibilities are described here.": "实际上，任何种类的陷阱都可以成为看守者巢穴的一个特征。这里描述了几种可能性。",
	"Simple yet effective, a covered pit trap is a hole covered with a false floor and perhaps concealed by a sprinkling of dirt or gravel. The pit might be empty, be filled with mud (causing anything trapped in it to eventually drown), or have spikes at the bottom.": "简单而有效，有盖坑道陷阱是一个用假地板覆盖的洞，也许还可以用洒上的泥土或沙砾掩盖。这个坑可能是空的，也可能装满了泥巴（导致被困在里面的东西最终被淹死），或者在底部有钉子。",
	"In a seldom-used cavern with a high ceiling, a beholder might erect a wall that doesn't reach the ceiling and build a trapped door into it. The beholder can fly over the trap, while intruders are forced to deal with the door or waste time trying to climb over the wall. A typical simple door trap is a pivoting spiked arm that swings downward to impale an intruder when the door is opened.": "在一个天花板很高的很少使用的洞穴里，一个beholder可能会竖起一堵达不到天花板的墙，并在墙里建一个陷阱门。观察者可以飞过陷阱，而入侵者则被迫对付门或浪费时间试图爬过墙。一个典型的简单的门陷阱是一个可旋转的带刺手臂，当门被打开时，它向下摆动以刺伤入侵者。",
	"In addition to making use of classic \"gravity traps\" such as the collapsing roof, the falling net, and the rolling sphere, a beholder can use its disintegration ray to blast a hole in the ceiling above its enemies, opening up a previously prepared chamber filled with mud, water, sand, garbage, green slime, petrified enemies, poison gas, swarms of centipedes, zombies, or any other sort of hazardous material or creatures.": "除了利用经典的 \"重力陷阱\"，如坍塌的屋顶、落下的网和滚动的球体，看守者可以用它的瓦解射线在敌人上方的天花板上炸出一个洞，打开一个事先准备好的密室，里面装满泥浆、水、沙子、垃圾、绿色粘液、石化的敌人、毒气、成群的蜈蚣、僵尸，或任何其他种类的危险物质或生物。",
	"One form of gas spore trap is nothing more than a small room or section of tunnel that contains one or more hovering gas spores. The passage leading to it is sealed off or constricted to prevent the fungus creatures from drifting into inhabited areas. Medium or smaller intruders can easily move through the passage but might have little warning about what lies ahead, especially if the passage has sharp turns that make it likely that the gas spore isn't seen until the last moment. A beholder might use its telekinesis ray to forcibly push a gas spore into an opponent, making the gas spore explode.": "一种形式的气体孢子陷阱不过是一个小房间或一段隧道，里面有一个或多个盘旋的气体孢子。通往它的通道被封闭或限制，以防止真菌生物漂移到有人居住的区域。中等或较小的入侵者可以很容易地穿过通道，但对前面的情况可能没有什么警告，特别是如果通道有急转弯，使得气体孢子有可能直到最后一刻才被看到。观察者可能会使用它的心灵感应射线，强行将气体孢子推到对手身上，使气体孢子爆炸。",
	"If its lair includes a long, narrow chamber with an uneven floor and multiple terraces, a beholder might turn this area into a killing ground. The floors count as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and the terraces mean that in some places climbing or jumping down is required to make progress. These areas are often seeded with perils both stationary and mobile. The beholder and its minions can bypass the area by means of secret doors at either end. Some obstacle courses feature low walls to slow enemies even further or a portcullis to trap them in one section of the chamber.": "如果它的巢穴包括一个狭长的密室，有不平整的地板和多个梯田，那么看守者可能会把这个区域变成一个杀人场所。地板算作（%0%），而梯田意味着在某些地方需要攀爬或跳下才能前进。这些区域通常有固定的和移动的危险种子。看守者和它的爪牙可以通过两端的秘密门绕过这个区域。有些障碍物通道的特点是有低矮的墙壁，以进一步减缓敌人的速度，或者有一个舷窗，将他们困在密室的一个部分。",
	"The main element of an oil sprayer trap is a large tank, filled with oil, embedded into the top of a column or located in a space above the trapped room. When the trap is triggered, a valve in the bottom of the tank opens, and oil spews into the room, making the floor slick and igniting if any open flames are present.": "喷油器的主要部件是一个装满油的大油箱，它被嵌入到柱子的顶部或位于被困房间上方的空间。当疏水阀被触发时，油罐底部的阀门就会打开，油就会喷到房间里，使地板变得光滑，如果有任何明火存在，就会被点燃。",
	"A beholder that has amassed many trophies might set aside an area in its lair dedicated to their display. A trophy gallery is often a long chamber decorated with mementos taken from creatures the beholder has slain. Niches and pedestals hold smaller objects, while larger objects are suspended from the ceiling or left freestanding in the room. To prevent minions from handling or trying to steal trophies, the more favored and valuable items are kept on high shelves, accessible to the flying beholder but out of reach of anyone on the ground.": "积累了许多战利品的持有者可能会在其巢穴中留出一块区域，专门用于展示这些战利品。战利品陈列室通常是一个长长的房间，上面装饰着从持有者所杀的生物身上取得的纪念品。壁龛和基座上摆放着较小的物品，而较大的物品则悬挂在天花板上或独立放置在房间里。为了防止奴才处理或试图偷取战利品，更受青睐和更有价值的物品被放在高高的架子上，飞行的看守者可以接触到，但地面上的人却无法触及。",
	"A beholder goes to a lot of trouble to make its lair as safe and comfortable as it possibly can, and so it rarely ventures outside. A typical beholder would primarily be concerned with securing the area in a 1-mile radius around its lair (corresponding to the area of the beholder's regional effects), but could range even farther if the need arises. It might leave home to confront or forestall the advance of creatures that it sees as threats, or to capture a new pack of minions, or to go after a particularly enticing trophy.": "一个beholder费尽心思使它的巢穴尽可能地安全和舒适，所以它很少冒险出去。一个典型的beholder将主要关注其巢穴周围1英里范围内的安全（相当于beholder的区域效应），但如果有需要，它的范围甚至会更远。它可能会离开家去对抗或阻止它认为有威胁的生物前进，或者去捕捉新的奴仆群，或者去追逐一个特别诱人的战利品。",
	"When a beholder goes on the offensive against a threat outside its lair, it plans ahead and makes use of all of its advantages. For example, if it decides a newly settled human village nearby is a threat, it and its minions will set up camp nearby and scout the area (usually by flying high overhead at night using darkvision) for one or two days. Once the layout and guard movements are known, the beholder sends its minions to attack or draw out defenders while it flies high overhead and uses its eye rays to subdue the village, targeting leaders and other formidable foes before significant resistance can be mounted.": "当beholder对其巢穴外的威胁发起进攻时，它会提前计划并利用其所有的优势。例如，如果它决定附近新定居的人类村庄是一个威胁，它和它的爪牙就会在附近扎营，并对该地区进行一到两天的侦察（通常是在夜间使用暗视仪从高空飞行）。一旦知道了村庄的布局和守卫的动向，看守者就会派它的爪牙去攻击或引出守卫者，而它则在高空飞行，用它的眼睛射线来制服村庄，在可以进行重大抵抗之前瞄准领导人和其他强大的敌人。",
	"One of these raids usually lasts less than an hour, after which the beholder withdraws its forces, leaving the terrified survivors to wonder when the next attack will occur. Unless they flee, the beholder and its forces return night after night, each time eliminating key defenders, and ultimately breaking the morale of the survivors, at which point the beholder's minions can capture anyone or anything worth keeping and raze the settlement.": "一次突袭通常持续不到一个小时，之后持币人就会撤走它的部队，留下惊恐的幸存者想知道下一次攻击会在什么时候发生。除非他们逃跑，否则持神者和它的部队会夜复一夜地回来，每次都会消灭关键的守卫者，并最终打击幸存者的士气，这时持神者的爪牙可以抓到任何值得保留的人或物，并夷平定居点。",
	"A beholder carefully scrutinizes all the treasure in its lair and divides the booty into five groups: tools, gifts, hazards, trophies, and clutter.": "一个观察者仔细检查了它巢穴中的所有宝物，并将战利品分为五组：工具、礼物、危险品、战利品和杂物。",
	"A {@b tool} is any treasure that the beholder can use as personal gear. A beholder's body can't use many kinds of humanoid-type magic items because it doesn't have the body parts to wear them; for example, it can't use gloves or boots because it doesn't have hands or feet. But a beholder could wear magic rings on its eyestalks or affix a magic cloak to its back, and the items function as they would if used by a humanoid.": "A{@b tool}是指任何可以作为个人装备使用的宝物，beholder。看守者的身体不能使用许多种人形类型的魔法物品，因为它没有穿戴它们的身体部位；例如，它不能使用手套或靴子，因为它没有手或脚。但是，观音可以在它的眼柄上戴上魔法戒指，或者在它的背上贴上魔法斗篷，而这些物品的功能就像人形生物使用的那样。",
	"At your discretion, a beholder might be able to use magic items that must be held to activate, such as wands; the beholder is assumed to be using its telekinesis eye ray to move and point the item in the same way that a humanoid would use its hand. A beholder can't attune to items that require attunement by a spellcaster or a member of a certain class.": "根据你的判断，持物者也许可以使用必须拿着才能激活的魔法物品，比如魔杖；持物者被认为是在使用它的心灵感应眼线来移动和指向物品，就像一个人形生物使用它的手一样。持心者不能调整那些需要由施法者或某个等级的成员进行调整的物品。",
	"A {@b gift} is a treasure the beholder can't use itself but that would be useful to a minion, such as magic gloves, boots, armor, or an item it can't attune itself to. Usually a beholder gives gifts to make a minion more powerful and better at its job, which typically involves guarding the beholder's lair. Sometimes it uses gifts as rewards and incentives for exceptional minions; although it prefers to rule by coercion and fear, it understands that better results can sometimes be achieved by rewarding positive behavior instead of punishing negative behavior.": "一个{@b gift}是看守者自己不能使用但对奴才有用的宝物，比如魔法手套、靴子、盔甲，或者一个它自己不能调整的物品。通常情况下，持有者给予礼物是为了让奴才更强大，更好地完成其工作，这通常涉及到守护持有者的巢穴。有时，它用礼物作为对杰出奴才的奖励和激励；虽然它更喜欢用胁迫和恐惧来统治，但它明白，有时通过奖励积极行为而不是惩罚消极行为可以取得更好的效果。",
	"A {@b hazard} can be put to use in an offensive, defensive, or utilitarian capacity. Beholders are skilled at repurposing cursed or dangerous items as elements of traps or obstacles in its lair, especially if such an item emits an ongoing effect that it can suppress as needed with its antimagic cone.": "一个{@b hazard}可以被用于进攻、防御或功利性的目的。兽人善于重新利用被诅咒的或危险的物品作为其巢穴中的陷阱或障碍物的元素，尤其是当这种物品发出一种持续的效果，它可以根据需要用反魔法锥压制。",
	"A {@b trophy} is a treasure that a beholder cherishes as evidence of its power, or serves as a remembrance of victory over its enemies, or evokes another sort of positive reaction from it. The preserved corpse of a rival beholder (or any parts it can recover from a battle) would certainly be a prized trophy, as would be the skull of a defeated dragon, the clothing of a famous adventurer the beholder killed, or art objects that are pleasing to its alien senses. A beholder usually has the location of all its trophies memorized and immediately senses if something is missing or out of place. {@b Clutter} is treasure that has intrinsic value, but isn't immediately useful to the beholder or its minions. This category includes currency, gems, jewelry, and magic items that nobody in the lair can use or use well. These items are stored somewhere in the lair until they're disposed of-sometimes by distributing them among the minions as gifts, other times by disintegration.": "一个{@b trophy}的宝物是一个beholder所珍视的，作为其力量的证据，或作为战胜敌人的纪念，或引起它的另一种积极反应。竞争对手的尸体（或它能从战斗中恢复的任何部分）肯定会是一个珍贵的战利品，就像被打败的龙的头骨、被它杀死的著名冒险家的衣服，或让它的异类感官愉悦的艺术品一样。看守者通常会记住它所有战利品的位置，如果有什么东西丢失或不合适，它就会立即感觉到。{@b Clutter}是具有内在价值的宝物，但对看守者或其爪牙来说并不立即有用。这类物品包括货币、宝石、珠宝，以及巢穴中无人能用或用不好的魔法物品。这些物品被存放在巢穴中的某个地方，直到它们被处理掉--有时是作为礼物在爪牙之间分发，有时是被分解掉。",
	"A beholder's personality greatly influences how it categorizes its treasures. A braggart beholder might use a slain enemy's magic battleaxe as a trophy, but a manipulative beholder might give that axe as a gift to a lieutenant in order to encourage competition between its upper ranks. An inventive beholder might use an {@i eversmoking bottle} to obscure dozens of pit traps in a room, but a more militaristic one might not have a use for it and treat it as clutter. Circumstances might change the role of a piece of treasure-a {@i staff of the python} used to prop up a stone block trap might be given as a gift if the beholder acquires a minion who can attune the item.": "持币人的个性在很大程度上影响了其对宝物的分类。一个爱吹牛的人可能会把被杀的敌人的魔法战斧作为战利品，但一个爱操纵的人可能会把那把斧头作为礼物送给一个中尉，以鼓励其上层的竞争。一个有创造力的看守者可能会用一个{@i eversmoking bottle}来掩盖房间里的几十个坑洞陷阱，但一个更军事化的看守者可能对它没有用处，把它当作杂物。情况可能会改变一件宝物的作用--用来支撑石块陷阱的(1%)可能会被当作礼物送出，如果持有者获得了一个可以调整该物品的奴仆。",
	"Beholders often make use of minions. Establishing control over these creatures usually involves the use of its eye rays, but eventually the minions come to understand that the beholder can kill them whenever it wants and it is in their best interest to stop resisting and just obey the beholder's orders.": "看守者经常利用爪牙。建立对这些生物的控制通常涉及到使用它的眼睛射线，但最终奴才们会明白，持物者可以随时杀死他们，停止抵抗并服从持物者的命令对他们来说是最有利的。",
	"Minions build walls in the beholder's lair, distribute food to other residents, and carve out new living spaces for themselves and other minions-tasks that the beholder considers beneath its personal attention. Some even worship the beholder as an angry, capricious deity.": "仆人们在看守者的巢穴中建造墙壁，向其他居民分发食物，并为自己和其他仆人开辟新的生活空间--看守者认为这些任务不在其个人关注范围之内。有些人甚至把看守者当作一个愤怒、任性的神灵来崇拜。",
	"Three tables-Beholder Lesser Minions, Beholder Greater Minions, and Beholder Pets-make it easy to stock a beholder's lair with such creatures.": "三张表格--\"较小的仆人\"、\"较大的仆人 \"和 \"仆人的宠物\"--使我们可以很容易地在仆人的巢穴中储存这些生物。",
	"If a beholder's retinue were likened to an army, the grunts would be represented by its lesser minions, intelligent creatures that can talk and usually live in large groups. They handle menial tasks for the beholder such as hunting, scouting, and guarding the lair.": "如果把看守者的随从比作一支军队，那么步兵将由其较小的奴仆代表，他们是能说话的智能生物，通常生活在大群体中。他们为看守者处理琐碎的任务，如狩猎、侦察和守卫巢穴。",
	"A beholder's greater minions are formidable opponents. In the lair, they might be stationed where they can catch intruders in an ambush, or they could be a last line of defense against foes that threaten the inner sanctum.": "一个看守者的大奴仆是可怕的对手。在巢穴中，他们可能驻扎在可以捕捉到入侵者的伏击的地方，或者他们可以作为威胁内部圣殿的敌人的最后一道防线。",
	"A beholder often has one or more pets in its lair, mainly because (for whatever reason) it enjoys the company of such creatures. Pets are usually of low intelligence and are kept around because of their combat abilities, entertainment value, or trophy status.": "兽人的巢穴中通常有一个或多个宠物，主要是因为（无论出于什么原因）它喜欢与这些生物为伴。宠物通常智力低下，因为它们的战斗能力、娱乐价值或战利品地位而被留在身边。",
	"Roll twice, ignoring results above 65": "滚动两次，无视65以上的结果",
	"{@dice 1d2} {@creature fire giant||fire giants}, {@dice 1d3} {@creature frost giant||frost giants}, {@dice 2d4} {@creature hill giant||hill giants} or {@dice 1d6} {@creature stone giant||stone giants} (as appropriate to the terrain)": "{@dice 1d2} {@creature fire giant||fire giants}, {@dice 1d3} {@creature frost giant||frost giants}, {@dice 2d4} {@creature hill giant||hill giants} 或 {@dice 1d6} {@creature stone giant||stone giants}（根据地形情况而定）",
	"Roll twice, ignoring results above 75": "滚动两次，忽略75以上的结果",
	"The Xanathar Guild is a thieves' and slavers' guild operating underneath the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting. The guildmaster is a beholder-the latest in a series of such creatures. Like its predecessors, the beholder uses \"the Xanathar\" as a title rather than its personal name (which is Zushaxx). The guild has been in operation for nearly two hundred years, with a different beholder taking over every few decades.": "Xanathar公会是一个盗贼和奴隶主公会，在被遗忘的领域的Waterdeep城下运作。行会会长是一个beholder--一系列此类生物中的最新一员。和它的前辈们一样，这个人用 \"Xanathar \"作为称号，而不是它的个人名字（即Zushaxx）。这个公会已经运作了近两百年，每隔几十年就有一个不同的beholder接手。",
	"The Xanathar, like its forerunners, is an eye tyrant-a type of beholder that chooses to live among other creatures in a position of superiority over them. Its paranoia is kept under control most of the time, and it turns its strange mind to the pursuit of organized crime in Undermountain and Waterdeep. The Xanathar believes its intelligence and magic make it uniquely suited for this-even more so than its slain predecessor-and it uses its abilities to ruthlessly enforce its will on as much political and criminal territory as possible.": "Xanathar，像它的先驱一样，是一个眼球暴君--一种选择生活在其他生物中，处于比它们更优越地位的眼球。它的偏执狂在大多数时候都被控制住了，它把自己奇怪的心思转到追求地下城和水底世界的有组织犯罪上。萨纳塔认为它的智慧和魔法使它独特地适合做这件事--甚至比它被杀的前辈更适合，它利用自己的能力在尽可能多的政治和犯罪领域无情地执行自己的意志。",
	"The Xanathar's bond is its lair, an elaborate cavern complex created by its predecessors, carved out between the twisting sewers of Waterdeep. It almost never leaves its home, for at the center of this world it is the master of all it sees and safe from outside threats. The expansive lair is well stocked with the exotic pleasures it craves, such as scented oils for bathing, fragrant incense, and fine foods prepared by skilled chefs. It surrounds itself with evidence of its wealth and success, eating off gold plates, drinking from diamond-encrusted chalices, decorating its sleeping area with marvelous tapestries, and adorning itself and its sanctum with powerful magic items.": "萨纳塔的纽带是它的巢穴，一个由它的前辈们创造的精致的洞穴建筑群，在沃特迪普曲折的下水道之间开凿出来。它几乎从未离开过自己的家，因为在这个世界的中心，它是它所看到的一切的主宰，并且免受外界的威胁。这个宽广的巢穴里有它所渴望的异国情调，比如沐浴用的香油、芬芳的熏香，以及由熟练厨师准备的精美食物。它用财富和成功的证据围绕着自己，用金盘子吃饭，用镶钻的圣杯喝酒，用奇妙的挂毯装饰睡眠区，用强大的魔法物品装饰自己和它的圣殿。",
	"Its fear of conspiracies is merely dormant, though, not absent. From time to time it is gripped by overwhelming concerns about assassination plots, revenge-seekers, and other schemes against it. When these thoughts bubble to the surface, the Xanathar might crack down on its lieutenants, interpreting their mistakes as disobedience, their failures as deliberate attempts to undermine its power, and their successes as challenges to its superiority. The beholder's ire might manifest as abruptly as a disintegration ray or as slowly as an angry glare and increasing scrutiny over the next few weeks.": "它对阴谋的恐惧只是处于休眠状态，但并不是没有。它不时地被对暗杀阴谋、复仇者和其他针对它的计划的压倒性担忧所笼罩。当这些想法浮出水面时，Xanathar可能会打击它的副手，把他们的错误解释为不服从命令，把他们的失败解释为蓄意破坏它的权力，把他们的成功解释为对它的优势的挑战。观察者的愤怒可能会像瓦解射线一样突然表现出来，也可能会像愤怒的目光一样慢慢表现出来，并在接下来的几周内不断加强审查。",
	"The Xanathar is ambitious and wants to expand its power by making alliances, but it is constantly wary of betrayal. The only allies it considers relatively safe are individuals that it (or its predecessor) has worked with for years, and most of these are creatures it has no reason to fear because they aren't a physical threat to it or the guild. It is hesitant to form alliances with other powerful groups, and is likely to break off ties with a new ally if it senses even a hint of betrayal or difficulty. If an organization is useful but significantly weaker than the guild, the Xanathar is likely to absorb its members and resources into its guild (either immediately or gradually) so it can keep an eye on threats from within that group.": "Xanathar雄心勃勃，希望通过结盟来扩大自己的权力，但它对背叛一直保持警惕。它认为唯一相对安全的盟友是与它（或它的前身）合作多年的个人，而这些人大多是它没有理由害怕的生物，因为它们对它或行会没有人身威胁。它对与其他强大的团体结成联盟犹豫不决，如果它感觉到哪怕是一丝背叛或困难，都有可能与新盟友断绝关系。如果一个组织是有用的，但明显比公会弱，Xanathar可能会将其成员和资源吸收到公会中（无论是立即还是逐步），这样它就可以密切关注来自该团体内部的威胁。",
	"Like all beholders, the Xanathar craves information. It is aware of the great library at Candlekeep and the lore stored there, and one of its main objectives is to get an agent into the place that can start sending copies of that information back to the Xanathar for review. The Xanathar's ultimate goal is to control the entire region under Waterdeep (both Undermountain and Skullport), giving it as much political clout as all the Lords of Waterdeep combined.": "像所有的持有者一样，Xanathar渴望获得信息。它知道烛龙镇的大图书馆和那里储存的传说，它的主要目标之一是让一个代理人进入那里，开始把这些信息的副本送回给Xanathar审查。萨纳塔的最终目标是控制水底世界的整个区域（包括山下和斯库尔波特），使其拥有与水底世界所有领主加起来一样多的政治影响力。",
	"Thanks to its superior intelligence and its unique way of thinking, the Xanathar is able to efficiently supervise and direct the efforts of many creatures at the same time. It holds sway over a dozen specialized lieutenants. Each lieutenant is responsible for operating one of the aspects of guild business, including assassination, blackmail, extortion, mercenaries, slavery, smuggling, spying, and thievery (of these operations, slavery and thievery are the largest). When one needs to be replaced, the best candidates are those who appreciate the benefits of strict organization (and thus are lawful evil or at worst neutral evil) and who have a high tolerance for their boss's sometimes erratic behavior.": "由于其卓越的智力和独特的思维方式，Xanathar能够同时有效地监督和指导许多生物的工作。它掌握着十几个专门的副手的权力。每个中尉负责操作公会业务的一个方面，包括暗杀、勒索、敲诈、雇佣兵、奴隶制、走私、间谍和偷窃（在这些业务中，奴隶制和偷窃是最大的）。当一个人需要被替换时，最好的人选是那些欣赏严格组织的好处的人（因此是合法的邪恶或最差的中性邪恶），并且对他们的老板有时不稳定的行为有很高的容忍度。",
	"Each lieutenant is allowed to manage its part of the guild operation as desired. Some use a direct, hands-on approach, and some establish a chain of command that establishes a clear hierarchy from the top to the lowest underling. As long as a lieutenant's operation runs smoothly, the Xanathar doesn't object to methods or micromanage day-to-day activity.": "每个中尉都被允许根据需要管理自己的那部分公会运作。有些人使用直接的、亲力亲为的方法，有些人则建立了一个指挥系统，从高层到最底层的下属都建立了明确的等级制度。只要中尉的运作顺利，Xanathar就不会反对方法或微观管理日常活动。",
	"When a human megalomaniac rises to power in an evil organization, that individual is always at risk of being killed or replaced by a power-hungry rival.": "当一个人类的自大狂在一个邪恶的组织中崛起时，这个人总是有可能被杀死或被一个渴望权力的对手取代。",
	"When such a group is led by a beholder rather than a human, the tyrant has incredible staying power against challengers. Not only are its opponents unsure of the best way to kill it, but it can quickly retaliate with lethal force against multiple enemies at the same time, and it literally sleeps with its eyes open. The only real threat to the Xanathar's rule is another beholder, which speaks to the reason why the Xanathar Guild has been led by a succession of beholders instead of by various humanoid or inhuman creatures. Lieutenants who have their own ambitions, who might come to oppose the tyrant or fear for their safety, are much more likely to flee (or \"retire\") than to confront the beholder. The petrified heads of several  traitorous lieutenants decorate the Xanathar's lair as testimony to how it deals with challengers.": "当这样一个群体由一个beholder而不是一个人类领导时，暴君对挑战者有难以置信的持久力。它的对手不仅不知道杀死它的最佳方法，而且它可以同时对多个敌人迅速进行致命的报复，而且它简直是睁着眼睛睡觉。对Xanathar统治的唯一真正威胁是另一个beholder，这也说明了为什么Xanathar公会一直由一连串的beholder领导，而不是由各种人形或非人形生物领导的原因。那些有自己野心的副手，可能会来反对暴君或担心自己的安全，他们更有可能逃离（或 \"退休\"），而不是与beholder对抗。几个叛徒副官的石化头颅装饰着Xanathar的巢穴，见证了它如何处理挑战者。",
	"In addition to its lieutenants, the Xanathar has many minions with specific jobs. These underlings don't have as much clout as the lieutenants do, but they do hold key roles in its guild and have some degree of influence in the organization. Among these are the beholder's accountant, chamberlain, chief messenger, doctor, fish-keeper, fortune-teller, lawyer, master entertainer, monster trainer, trap-setter, and warden for its private prison. The individuals in these roles generally serve the Xanathar for months or years, because replacements that have the same specialized skills can be hard to come by.": "除了它的副手之外，Xanathar还有许多有特殊工作的爪牙。这些下属没有副官那么大的影响力，但他们确实在公会中担任关键角色，在组织中具有一定程度的影响力。在这些人中，有会计师、内侍、首席信使、医生、养鱼人、算命先生、律师、娱乐大师、怪物训练师、陷阱设置者，以及私人监狱的典狱长。担任这些职务的人通常为Xanathar服务数月或数年，因为具有相同专业技能的替代者可能很难找到。",
	"The organization's grunt-level employees-thieves, slavers, and ordinary thugs-work for the Xanathar Guild because it pays well. They don't necessarily know their leader is a beholder; they just know the boss is powerful, dangerous, and doesn't tolerate mistakes.": "该组织的低级雇员--盗贼、奴隶主和普通暴徒--为Xanathar公会工作，因为它的报酬很高。他们不一定知道他们的领导是个神棍；他们只知道老板很强大，很危险，而且不能容忍错误。",
	"Although previous Xanathars carefully guarded the facts of their true nature and allowed only a handful of their lieutenants to know the truth, the current Xanathar treats the matter more like an open secret.": "虽然以前的Xanathars小心翼翼地保护着他们的真实性质，只允许他们的少数副手知道真相，但现在的Xanathar对待这件事更像是一个公开的秘密。",
	"All of its lieutenants, as well as many mid-level members of the guild that the Xanathar trusts, know that the guild is run by a beholder.": "它的所有副手，以及Xanathar信任的许多公会中层成员都知道，公会是由一个beholder管理的。",
	"Most of the guild's low-ranking members have an idea that the boss isn't human, especially given how long the Xanathar has been in power (they aren't aware that several beholders have held the job). Most believe their leader is a member of a long-lived race, perhaps a dwarf or an elf. Some think the truth is more monstrous, and that the Xanathar is a drow or perhaps a dragon in humanoid form.": "公会的大多数低级成员都有一个想法，那就是老板不是人类，特别是考虑到Xanathar掌权的时间有多长（他们不知道有几个beholder担任过这个职位）。大多数人认为他们的领袖是一个长寿种族的成员，也许是一个矮人或精灵。有些人认为事实更加怪异，Xanathar是一个乌鸦，或许是一个人形的龙。",
	"The people of Waterdeep are generally aware that there are one or more guilds controlling criminal activity in the city. Rumors occasionally surface about a monstrous crime lord, such as a demon or a dragon, that guides its organization from the shadows. Most common folk dismiss these rumors and the fools who circulate them, asserting that the Lords of Waterdeep would never allow such creatures to roam the city.": "沃特德普的人们一般都知道有一个或多个行会在控制城市的犯罪活动。偶尔也会有关于一个可怕的犯罪头目的传言，比如恶魔或龙，在暗处指导其组织。大多数普通人对这些谣言和传播这些谣言的傻瓜不屑一顾，他们断言水底城的领主绝不会允许这种生物在城市里游荡。",
	"The saga of giantkind began in the dawn of the world. Elves had yet to set dainty foot out of the fey realm when the thunder of the giants' steps shook the world to its bones, and even the dragons were yet unaware of the power and glory they would attain. The record of that early age had already vanished into the mists of legend by the time humankind came onto the scene. Now, not even the giants know the full truth of their beginnings.": "巨人族的传奇始于世界的黎明。当巨人的脚步声震撼世界的时候，精灵们还没有踏出精灵界，甚至连龙都还没有意识到他们将获得的力量和荣耀。当人类出现在现场时，那个早期时代的记录已经消失在传说的迷雾中了。现在，甚至连巨人都不知道他们开始的全部真相。",
	"All that the giants and their kin know for certain is that they are sibling races. Humanoids such as elves, humans, and dwarves are more similar in size and shape than the disparate giant types are to one another, but those races have no shared heritage. In contrast, every true giant, regardless of type, can trace its ancestry directly to Annam the All-Father. Most giants believe that Annam took a number of consorts in addition to his mate Othea, accounting for the variety in appearance and abilities among the types of giantkind.": "巨人和他们的亲属所能确定的是，他们是兄弟姐妹种族。像精灵、人类和矮人这样的类人，在尺寸和形状上比不同类型的巨人彼此之间更相似，但这些种族没有共同的遗产。相比之下，每一个真正的巨人，无论其类型如何，都可以直接追溯到全能之父安南的祖先。大多数巨人认为，除了他的配偶奥赛亚之外，安南还娶了许多妃子，这就说明了巨人类型在外观和能力上的多样性。",
	"Giants and giant kin rank among the world's most fearsome creatures, literally towering over the other, younger beings that crowd the world. Yet nowadays most giants live in isolation or in obscure locations, exhibiting none of the collective grandeur and power of their forebears.": "巨人和巨人的亲属是世界上最可怕的生物之一，简直高过了世界上其他年轻的生物。然而，如今大多数巨人都生活在与世隔绝或不起眼的地方，没有表现出他们祖先的集体雄风和力量。",
	"Encountering a giant can be an awe-inspiring and disorienting experience. First comes a rhythmic booming, felt more than heard, that resolves slowly into the sound of footsteps: a giant is near! Loose stones vibrate and tumble down the hillside. Trees sway, then bend aside as the colossus emerges. How can anything be that big? Is it a trick of perspective?": "遇到一个巨人可能是一个令人敬畏和迷失方向的经历。首先是有节奏的轰鸣声，感觉到的比听到的多，慢慢变成了脚步声：一个巨人正在靠近！这时，你就会发现，在山坡上有一个巨大的石块。松动的石头震动着，从山坡上滚落下来。树木摇晃，然后随着巨人的出现而弯向一边。怎么会有这么大的东西？这是个透视的把戏吗？",
	"When giants first appear before a band of adventurers, they demonstrate the qualities that make them spectacular to behold:": "当巨人第一次出现在一队冒险家面前时，他们展示了使他们壮观的品质。",
	"Most giants can easily peer in a second-floor window. The larger ones would have to stoop to get down to that level! A giant's metal hammer could serve as an anvil for a human smith, and a giant's shield is bigger and heavier than a feasting table.": "大多数巨人可以很容易地在二楼的窗户里窥视。大一点的则要弯腰才能到那一层! 巨人的金属锤子可以作为人类铁匠的铁砧，而巨人的盾牌比宴席桌更大、更重。",
	"If a giant sits on a wagon, its wheels and axles are liable to snap like twigs. A giant can crush a house or capsize a ship simply by carelessly shifting its weight. An ox that strays too close to a sleeping giant could wind up pinned or crushed if the giant rolls over suddenly.": "如果一个巨人坐在马车上，它的车轮和车轴很可能会像树枝一样折断。巨人只需不经意地转移重量，就能压垮一座房子或掀翻一艘船。一头牛如果离睡着的巨人太近，如果巨人突然翻身，就会被夹住或压死。",
	"The footsteps of giants in the distance are often initially mistaken for thunder, even on a clear day. The sounds of a giant beating a weapon against its shield and bellowing a challenge to foes are strident enough to knock dishes from shelves and rattle doors in their frames.": "巨人在远处的脚步声最初往往被误认为是雷声，即使是在晴朗的日子里。巨人用武器击打盾牌，并向敌人发出挑战的声音，足以将餐具从架子上打落，并将门在框架中敲响。",
	"A charging warhorse at full gallop, capable of bowling over a line of human warriors, merely crumples against the bulk of a giant. A giant could kick a cart with enough force to send it smashing through a house, and a giant's club—the size of, if not actually, an entire tree—could level the same house with a single blow.": "一匹全速奔跑的战马，能够越过一排人类战士，但面对巨人的身躯，却只能溃不成军。巨人可以用足够的力量踢一辆马车，让它砸穿一栋房子，而巨人的棍子--即使不是真的，也有一整棵树那么大--可以一击打平同一栋房子。",
	"In an age before human and elf, when all dragons were young, Annam the All-Father put the first giants upon the world. These giants were reflections of his divine offspring and also children of the world, birthed from the marrow of mountains, the hot blood of volcanoes, and the breath of hurricanes.": "在人类和精灵之前的时代，当所有的龙都还年轻的时候，全能之父安南把第一批巨人带到了世界上。这些巨人是他神圣的后代的反映，也是世界的孩子，从山的骨髓、火山的热血和飓风的气息中孕育出来。",
	"Annam conceived the giants to be masters of the world. He gave them great height so they would look down on all they ruled. He created a hierarchy for his children-the ordning-so that all would know their status with respect to one another, and would know who among them stood nearest the knee of the All-Father.": "安南设想巨人要成为世界的主人。他给了他们很高的身高，这样他们就可以俯视他们所统治的一切。他为他的孩子们创造了一个等级制度--Ordning--以便所有人都知道他们彼此之间的地位，并知道他们中谁最接近全能之父的膝盖。",
	"United in purpose, Annam's children built Ostoria, the fabled empire of the giants, where they lived according to the ordning. Storm giants ruled all from both below and above. They held sway over the oceans from undersea fortresses and lorded over the land from castles in the sky. Cloud giants built immense floating cities and served the storm giants as their strong right hands. Stone giants and fire giants settled on the mountaintops and in the sprawling caverns beneath them, where they carved and forged the greatest works of giant art and craft. Frost giants defended Ostoria with the might of their arms, not just on the chilly peaks and glaciers but on every frontier. Hill giants sprawled over all other lands, subjugating lesser creatures through brute force.": "安南的孩子们团结一致，建立了奥斯托里亚，传说中的巨人帝国，他们在那里按照法令生活。风暴巨人们从下面和上面统治着一切。他们在海底堡垒中控制着海洋，在天空的城堡中统治着陆地。云巨人建造了巨大的浮动城市，并作为风暴巨人的有力助手为其服务。石巨人和火巨人定居在山顶和山下广阔的洞穴中，他们在那里雕刻和铸造最伟大的巨人艺术和工艺作品。冰霜巨人用他们强大的武器保卫着奥斯托利亚，不仅仅是在寒冷的山峰和冰川上，而是在每一个边境地区。山地巨人横跨所有其他土地，通过蛮力征服了较小的生物。",
	"The tale of Ostoria is drawn from the Forgotten Realms. Think of it as a good example of how giants developed on many worlds, as it captures their rise and fall from prominence in a manner that is iconic to many D&D settings. In your own world, you can replace Ostoria with another giant empire or adapt it to create your own origin story.": "奥斯托利亚的故事取材于《被遗忘的领域》。可以把它看作是巨人在许多世界中发展的一个很好的例子，因为它以一种对许多D&D设定具有标志性的方式捕捉到了他们的崛起和衰落。在你自己的世界中，你可以用另一个巨人帝国取代奥斯托里亚，或者改编它来创造你自己的起源故事。",
	"All told, the empire of Ostoria dominated the world for four millennia before its decline began in a genocidal struggle against the dragons that came to be known as the Thousand-Year War.": "总而言之，奥斯托利亚帝国统治了世界四千年，然后在与龙族的种族灭绝式斗争中开始衰落，这场战争被称为千年战争。",
	"Dragons had lived in and around Ostoria in relative peace since the empire's foundation. Conflicts between dragons and giants in those days were personal, not tribal or regional, and usually involved bragging rights or hunting territory. Differences were settled by individual contests of might, wits, or skill. That situation persisted for generations, until the red dragon Garyx inflamed the greed and envy in its followers by railing against the giants' prosperity, and they rose up in response.": "自帝国成立以来，龙一直生活在奥斯托利亚及其周围地区，相对和平。在那些日子里，龙和巨人之间的冲突是个人的，而不是部落或地区的，而且通常涉及吹嘘的权利或狩猎的领土。分歧通过个人的力量、智慧或技巧的较量来解决。这种情况持续了几代人，直到红龙加里克斯通过抨击巨人的繁荣而激起其追随者的贪婪和嫉妒，他们才起而响应。",
	"At least, that's what most giants believed to have happened. No one really knows any longer what set off the war. But once battle began, the long-standing peace between giants and dragons crumbled everywhere. Foes tore at each others' throats in all parts of Ostoria. There were no front lines or safe havens, only endless ambushes, sieges, and atrocities committed against giants and dragons alike. Eventually, none were left alive on either side who had seen the war's beginning. Age and brutality had claimed them all, and the few giants and dragons then alive had spent their entire existence at war. The Thousand-Year War didn't truly end so much as it wasted away through attrition and exhaustion.": "至少，这就是大多数巨头认为发生的事情。没有人真正知道是什么引发了这场战争。但是一旦战斗开始，巨人和龙之间长期存在的和平就会四处崩溃。敌人们在奥斯托利亚的所有地方互相撕咬着对方的喉咙。没有前线或安全避难所，只有无尽的伏击、围攻和对巨人和龙的暴行。最终，双方都没有活着看到战争开始的人。岁月和残暴夺走了他们所有人，当时活着的少数巨人和龙在战争中度过了他们的一生。千年战争并没有真正结束，而是在消耗和疲惫中消亡。",
	"The realm that could still be called Ostoria survived only far in the north. A few outposts and fragment kingdoms, such as the fire giants' Helligheim and the stone giants' Nedeheim, clung to life in deep caverns and hidden valleys. In the millennia that followed, even these places fell, and what remained of Ostorian territory became barren, shrouded in ice as thick as mountains. Since that time, many lesser races have attained greatness and themselves fallen into obscurity. Few hints of the giants' once-great empire have survived the relentless accumulation of years.": "仍然可以被称为奥斯托利亚的王国只在遥远的北方幸存下来。一些前哨站和碎片王国，如火巨人的Helligheim和石巨人的Nedeheim，在深邃的洞穴和隐蔽的山谷中坚持着生命。在随后的几千年里，甚至这些地方也沦陷了，奥斯托利亚领土上剩下的地方变得贫瘠，被像山一样厚的冰层所笼罩。从那时起，许多较小的种族获得了伟大的成就，而他们自己却陷入了默默无闻。巨人曾经的伟大帝国在无情的岁月积淀中几乎没有任何痕迹。",
	"Voninheim (\"Titan Home\" in the Giant language) stood as the capital of Ostoria for millennia. It was an awe-inspiring structure of iron and stone, raised by magic as much as by mortal hands. Some attributed its construction directly to one or more of Annam's sons, arguing that even giants couldn't have erected such a monumental edifice. The palace stood firm and unshaken as glaciers that could flatten mountains assailed it and flowed around it, until only its iron spires jutted above the ice like great, gray fangs. Eventually the relentless ice buried it utterly, and Voninheim was abandoned. Many giants seek to rediscover its location: some hope to recapture the lost glory of Ostoria, but others want only to claim the mighty weapons of legend said to be entombed in its frozen halls.": "Voninheim（巨人语言中的 \"泰坦之家\"）作为奥斯托利亚的首都已经存在了千年之久。它是一个令人敬畏的铁石结构，由魔法和凡人之手共同建造而成。有些人把它的建造直接归功于安南的一个或多个儿子，认为即使是巨人也不可能建起这样一座不朽的建筑。这座宫殿岿然不动，任凭可以压平山脉的冰川袭击它，并在它周围流淌，直到只有它的铁尖顶像巨大的灰色獠牙一样突出在冰面上。最终，无情的冰雪将它彻底掩埋，沃宁海姆被遗弃。许多巨人试图重新发现它的位置：一些人希望重新获得奥斯托利亚失去的荣耀，但其他人只想获得传说中的强大武器，据说它们被埋藏在冰封的大厅里。",
	"But the giants remember. Their empire and their unified purpose are long gone, but a yearning for a return to the greatness that was once theirs burns in all their memories.": "但巨人记得。他们的帝国和统一的目标早已不复存在，但他们所有的记忆中都燃烧着对回归曾经的伟大的渴望。",
	"When Ostoria fell, Annam disowned his children, swearing never to regard the giants again until they returned Ostoria to its past prominence and reclaimed their rightful positions as rulers of the world. Giants, therefore, don't pray to Annam, who refuses to hear them. Instead, they revere his divine children, as well as a host of other hero-deities and godly villains that are minor members of the pantheon.": "当奥斯托利亚陷落时，安南不承认他的孩子们，发誓再也不理会巨人，直到他们把奥斯托利亚恢复到过去的显赫地位，并重新获得他们作为世界统治者的合法地位。因此，巨人不向安南祈祷，安南拒绝听他们的祈祷。相反，他们崇敬他的神的孩子，以及其他许多英雄神灵和神的恶棍，他们是万神殿的次要成员。",
	"Chief among the giant gods are the six sons of Annam. The brothers are Stronmaus (champion and favorite of storm giants), Memnor (cloud giants), Surtur (fire giants), Thrym (frost giants), Skoraeus Stonebones (stone giants), and Grolantor (hill giants).": "巨人神中最主要的是安南的六个儿子。他们兄弟俩分别是斯特朗莫斯（风暴巨人的冠军和宠儿）、梅姆诺尔（云巨人）、苏尔图尔（火巨人）、特里姆（霜巨人）、斯科雷欧斯-石骨（石巨人）和戈兰托尔（山丘巨人）。",
	"Although each of Annam's sons is typically worshiped by giants of a particular type, they, like Annam himself, aren't racially distinct. Stronmaus, for example, doesn't look like a storm giant, though he is often depicted as one in carvings and other art. Like Annam and each of his brothers, Stronmaus is a unique godly being with no mortal equivalent. His temperament and interests are similar to those of the storm giants, so most of his followers are of that type.": "尽管安南的每个儿子通常都被特定类型的巨人所崇拜，但他们和安南本人一样，并没有种族上的区别。例如，斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）看起来并不像一个风暴巨人，尽管他在雕刻和其他艺术作品中经常被描绘成一个风暴巨人。像安南和他的每一个兄弟一样，斯特龙莫斯是一个独特的神性存在，没有凡人可以比拟。他的气质和兴趣与风暴巨人相似，所以他的大多数追随者都是这种类型的。",
	"Similar statements can be made about the other five brothers. Most cloud giants revere Memnor, for example, but many reject him because of his deceitfulness and venerate Stronmaus instead. A storm giant living amid blizzards and icebergs in the far northern sea might pay homage to Thrym rather than to Stronmaus. Giants that have given up hope of rising in the ordning sometimes worship Vaprak the Destroyer, who is recognized by giants as the father of trolls and ogres. Giants don't worship male deities exclusively, either. Annam's mate Othea, Hiatea the huntress and home warden, Iallanis the goddess of love and peace, and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster, have substantial followings. Like humans, some giants even fall prey to demon cults, in which they pay homage to a demon lord such as Baphomet or Kostchtchie. Worshiping such entities, or any non-giant deity, is considered a great sin against the ordning. Being discovered means being cast out from family and clan.": "关于其他五位兄弟也可以有类似的说法。例如，大多数云雾巨人都崇敬梅姆诺，但许多人因为他的欺骗性而拒绝他，转而崇敬斯特龙马斯。生活在遥远的北海的暴风雪和冰山中的风暴巨人可能会向特里姆致敬，而不是向斯特龙马斯致敬。放弃了在秩序中崛起的希望的巨人有时会崇拜毁灭者瓦普拉克，巨人认为他是巨魔和食人魔的父亲。巨人也不完全崇拜男性神灵。安南的配偶奥赛亚、女猎手和家庭监护人希阿提亚、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯，以及冲动而傲慢的骗子戴安卡斯特拉，都有大量的追随者。像人类一样，一些巨人甚至成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，他们向诸如巴弗梅特或科斯特奇这样的恶魔领主表示敬意。崇拜这样的实体，或者任何非巨人的神灵，都被认为是对教会的巨大罪过。被发现意味着被从家庭和宗族中驱逐出去。",
	"The language that giants share is one of the few remnants from their once-grand empire. Over time it has fragmented into many dialects, and each type has its own distinctive accent, but giants of different types can generally understand one another.": "巨人共享的语言是他们曾经的大帝国为数不多的遗留物之一。随着时间的推移，它已经分裂成许多方言，每种类型都有自己独特的口音，但不同类型的巨人一般都能相互理解。",
	"Any non-giant who learns the Giant language can converse with all types of giants, but giants sometimes have a hard time hearing the tiny voices of human-sized creatures, and some vowel sounds emitted by giants are nearly impossible to reproduce for any creature that doesn't have lungs as large as beer barrels.": "任何学会巨人语言的非巨人都可以与所有类型的巨人交谈，但巨人有时很难听到人类大小的生物的微小声音，而且巨人发出的一些元音对于任何肺部没有啤酒桶那么大的生物来说几乎不可能再现。",
	"Two words have special significance in the Giant language  and the giants' worldview. Neither one of them translates directly into Common or any other language, because their definitions encompass several related concepts. {@b Maat} (pronounced mott) is the term giants use to describe ideas, behaviors, creatures, and objects that they consider good, holy, honorable, or desirable. {@b Maug} (pronounced mog) is the counterpart term, embodying what other languages call evil, unholy, dishonorable, or undesirable.": "有两个词在巨人的语言和巨人的世界观中具有特殊意义。它们中的任何一个都不能直接翻译成普通语言或任何其他语言，因为它们的定义包含了几个相关的概念。{@b Maat}（读作mott）是巨人用来描述他们认为好的、神圣的、光荣的或理想的想法、行为、生物和物体的术语。{@b Maug}（读作mog）是一个对应的术语，体现了其他语言所称的邪恶、不神圣、不光彩或不可取。",
	"Individual giants aren't necessarily thought of as maat or maug by their kin. What matters isn't a giant's personal philosophy but its standing within the ordning, which is influenced by behavior and attitude but also by a host of other factors. Every individual commits both maat and maug acts, and rises or falls in the ordning as a consequence. A giant isn't judged by other giants on the basis of whether what it did was inherently good or evil, but on whether its actions enhanced or diminished the qualities giants admire-the \"giantness,\" if you will-in themselves and their clans.": "巨人个人并不一定被他们的亲属认为是maat或mag。重要的不是一个巨人的个人哲学，而是它在军团中的地位，它受行为和态度的影响，也受许多其他因素的影响。每个人都会做出 \"马特 \"和 \"马格 \"的行为，并因此而在军团中上升或下降。一个巨人被其他巨人评判的依据不是它所做的事情本身是好是坏，而是它的行为是否提高或降低了巨人所欣赏的品质--\"巨人性\"，如果你愿意的话。",
	"A storm giant, for example, might see the raiding practices of hill giants as distasteful but not maug, because brutal raiding is an inborn trait of the hill giants. If those same hill giants worshiped Yeenoghu, however, that act would represent a flagrant turning away from the traditions  of the ordning. Hill giants who choose that path make themselves maug.": "例如，一个风暴巨人可能会认为山地巨人的突袭行为令人厌恶，但并不妨碍他们的行为，因为残酷的突袭是山地巨人与生俱来的特征。然而，如果这些山地巨人崇拜Yeenoghu，那么这种行为就代表着公然背离军团的传统。选择这条道路的山地巨人使他们自己成为了毛利人。",

	"For much of their written communication, giants use a modified version of the runic letterforms claimed by the dwarves as their own. This alphabet is used widely today, including by many traditional enemies of the dwarves such as orcs, giants, and goblinoids. That giants were first in the world and thus the creators of the script is a fact that giants take for granted but which dwarves hotly dispute.": "在大部分的书面交流中，巨人使用被矮人宣称为他们自己的符文字母的修改版。这种字母表今天被广泛使用，包括许多矮人的传统敌人，如兽人、巨人和妖精。巨人是世界上第一个出现的人，因此也是文字的创造者，这是一个巨人认为理所当然的事实，但矮人却对此提出了强烈的异议。",
	"Many giants are illiterate or nearly so-particularly hill, frost, and fire giants, which place little value on learning. Instead of writing stories with words, they typically tell their tales with pictograms etched in wood, ice, stone, or even earth, in the case of hill giants. These \"tale carvings\" relate legends or the stories of important events or meetings in the manner of highly sophisticated cave paintings. Often they employ aspects of legends about the giant pantheon. For example, Memnor's face or head floating above the shoulders of another giant indicates that the giant was a liar or a deceiver; a depiction of Iallanis being stabbed in the back represents the betrayal of love. Such symbols and visual allegories are well understood by giants, but they can be indecipherable to viewers who aren't steeped in the giants' mythology. Most non-giants find a tale carving as unintelligible as giants would find poetry written in Elvish.": "许多巨人都是文盲或几乎是文盲--特别是山丘巨人、冰霜巨人和火巨人，他们对学习不重视。他们通常不用文字来写故事，而是用刻在木头、冰、石头上的象形文字来讲述他们的故事，如果是山地巨人们，甚至是用土。这些 \"故事雕刻 \"以高度复杂的洞穴壁画的方式讲述传说或重要事件或会议的故事。它们通常采用关于巨人神殿的传说的某些方面。例如，Memnor的脸或头漂浮在另一个巨人的肩膀上，表示这个巨人是个骗子或欺骗者；对Iallanis被刺中背部的描绘表示对爱情的背叛。这样的符号和视觉寓意对巨人来说是很好理解的，但对那些没有浸淫在巨人神话中的观众来说，他们可能无法理解。大多数非巨人发现故事雕刻就像巨人发现用精灵语写的诗歌一样无法理解。",

	"Giants have a paradoxical relationship with magic. The most outwardly magical are the cloud giants, followed closely by storm giants. Both types have an innate ability to use some forms of magic related to air, weather, and gravity. Very few giants, however, study magic in the way that humans, dwarves, and elves do. Arcane scholarship by itself isn't acknowledged by the ordning; it isn't maug, but it isn't maat, either. Mastering the secrets of magic, though, demands a degree of devotion that would take giants away from pursuits that are valued by the ordning. As a consequence, it's a path rarely taken.": "巨人与魔法有一种矛盾的关系。最具外在魔力的是云巨人，紧随其后的是风暴巨人。这两种类型都有一种与生俱来的能力，可以使用一些与空气、天气和重力有关的魔法形式。然而，很少有巨人会像人类、矮人和精灵那样研究魔法。奥术学术本身并不被军团所承认；它不是Maug，但也不是maat。不过，掌握魔法的秘密需要一定程度的奉献，这将使巨人远离那些被军团所重视的追求。因此，这是一条很少有人走的路。",
	"The exception is rune magic. Giants are drawn to the solidity and permanence of magical runes. Stone giants are great practitioners of rune carving, both because of the artistry it demands and because their environment is perfect for its use. At least a few skiltgravr (\"rune cutters\") can be found among any type of giants, even the slow-witted hill giants who stomp enormous marks into hillsides or gouge them into their own flesh.": "符文魔法是个例外。巨人被魔法符文的稳固性和持久性所吸引。石头巨人是符文雕刻的伟大实践者，这既是因为它需要艺术性，也因为他们的环境非常适合使用它。在任何类型的巨人中都能找到至少几个skiltgravr（\"符文切割者\"），即使是头脑迟钝的山地巨人，他们也会在山坡上踩出巨大的痕迹，或者把它们抠进自己的肉里。",
	"Crafting this form of magic is painstakingly slow. Imagine a wizard who crafts a scroll and who eschews the convenience of parchment and ink in favor of stone and chisel, glacier and axe, or iron and forge.": "制作这种形式的魔法是痛苦而缓慢的。想象一下一个制作卷轴的巫师，他放弃了羊皮纸和墨水的便利，而选择了石头和凿子，冰川和斧头，或者铁和锻刀。",
	"Carving a magical rune into an item imbues it with power. Like any other magic item, it can be used to activate one or more magical effects. A magical rune can also be inscribed upon a surface to create effects similar to those of a glyph of warding or symbol spell. The rune itself determines what sort of magic the item or surface holds. For example, a storm rune carved into a stone might allow the stone's possessor to control the weather. The same rune carved into door or chest might deal thunder damage to anyone who opens it.": "将魔法符文刻在物品上会赋予它力量。像其他魔法物品一样，它可以被用来激活一个或多个魔法效果。魔法符文也可以刻在一个表面上，以创造类似于守护字形或符号咒语的效果。符文本身决定了该物品或表面拥有什么样的魔法。例如，刻在石头上的风暴符文可能允许石头的拥有者控制天气。同样的符文刻在门或箱子上可能会对打开它的人造成雷霆伤害。",
	"A giant on the move always has a sack slung over its shoulder. The primary purpose of a giant's bag is to carry food. With such an enormous belly to feed (particularly in the case of hill giants), it's unwise for a giant to travel without a supply of nourishment.": "一个移动中的巨人总是在肩上挂着一个麻袋。巨人的袋子的主要目的是为了携带食物。由于要养活如此巨大的肚子（尤其是山地巨人），巨人在旅行时没有营养品供应是不明智的。",
	"Giants also carry rocks in their bags: a few for battle, a few others for hunting, and one or two special ones for games. Beyond that, a bag might contain anything: tools, mementos, items for trade, or merely curios the giant wanted to bring along. Some possible contents are:": "巨人的包里也带着石头：一些用于战斗，一些用于打猎，还有一两个用于游戏的特殊石头。除此之外，袋子里可能包含任何东西：工具、纪念品、交易物品，或者仅仅是巨人想带的奇珍异宝。一些可能的内容是。",

	"Giants have a well-deserved reputation as living siege engines-all of them can hurl boulders with accuracy across great distances. Rock throwing-for battle, hunting, and sport-is a tradition that goes back to the ancient times of the giants. Other races developed the sling, the spear-thrower, or the bow to artificially improve the strength and accuracy of their ranged attacks, but giants never perceived a need for mechanical assistance. Even in places where giants have adapted bows or javelins for use in combat, they've never neglected the straightforward strategy of picking up a rock and letting it fly. Few activities, in fact, seem to give them as much satisfaction as the simple act of tossing boulders.": "巨人作为活的攻城器械有着当之无愧的声誉--他们都能将巨石准确地投掷到很远的地方。为战斗、狩猎和运动而投掷石块是一种传统，可以追溯到巨人的古代时代。其他种族开发了吊索、投矛器或弓箭，以人为地提高他们远程攻击的强度和准确性，但巨人从未意识到对机械援助的需要。即使在那些巨人将弓或标枪用于战斗的地方，他们也从未忽视过捡起一块石头让它飞起来的直接策略。事实上，很少有活动能像投掷巨石这种简单的行为一样让他们感到满足。",
	"Most of the games that giants play involve throwing rocks in ways that hone their skills for hunting and war. One of the most popular contests, especially among fire giants, involves nothing more than taking turns trying to knock each other down with boulders. Frost giants build targets out of snow and ice and compete to see who can knock down the most with a single toss. A popular one-on-one game begins with the challenger throwing a stone as far as it can. The giant who was challenged then goes to where the stone landed and hurls it back at the challenger. A challenger who is stronger wins, because the return throw will fall short, but a giant who took on a better thrower will stumble away, nursing its injuries, as a lesson that arrogance has a price.": "巨人玩的大多数游戏都涉及到投掷石块的方式，以磨练他们的狩猎和战争技能。最受欢迎的比赛之一，特别是在火巨人之间，无非是轮流用巨石击倒对方。霜巨人用雪和冰建造目标，比赛看谁能在一次抛掷中击倒最多的目标。一个流行的一对一游戏开始时，挑战者将石头扔得最远。然后被挑战的巨人走到石头落地的地方，把它扔回给挑战者。一个更强壮的挑战者获胜，因为他的回投会落空，但一个面对更好的投掷者的巨人会跌跌撞撞地离开，护理自己的伤口，作为一个教训，傲慢是有代价的。",
	"In battle against puny creatures, giants use boulders that fit in one hand. When giants fight enormous foes (such as dragons) or enormous targets (such as castles), they prefer to hurl stones so large that even a giant must use both arms to lift and throw one. Giants throw just as accurately with both arms as with one, a feat most humans would find impossible. These attacks are effective only at shorter ranges, however, for obvious reasons.": "在与弱小生物的战斗中，巨人使用适合一只手的巨石。当巨人与巨大的敌人（如龙）或巨大的目标（如城堡）作战时，他们更喜欢投掷大石头，即使是巨人也必须用双臂才能举起和投掷。巨人用双臂投掷和用单臂投掷一样准确，大多数人类会觉得这是不可能的。然而，由于明显的原因，这些攻击只在较短的范围内有效。",
	"When they hunt by rock throwing, giants use smaller stones, about the size of a human head, that can kill an elk or a bear without smashing it into pulp.": "当他们用扔石头的方式打猎时，巨人使用较小的石头，大约人头大小，可以杀死麋鹿或熊，而不会把它砸成肉酱。",
	"A force allied with giants-or worse, a force made up of giants-is one of the most fearsome opponents on the battlefield. The giants can rain boulders onto an enemy from a distance where only skilled archers, heavy siege weapons, or spellcasters can strike back at them.": "与巨人结盟的部队，或者更糟糕的是，由巨人组成的部队，是战场上最可怕的对手之一。巨人可以从远处向敌人投下巨石，只有熟练的弓箭手、重型攻城武器或施法者才能对他们进行反击。",
	"At first blush, it might seem that a potent wizard would make the best giant-killer, but few spellcasters can stand up to a giant in direct confrontation. One might do harm to a giant, but odds are it will survive the one or two spells that can be thrown at it before a well-placed boulder or the swing of an enormous club quashes the threat.": "乍一看，似乎一个强大的巫师会成为最好的巨人杀手，但很少有施法者能在直接对抗中对抗巨人。一个人可能会对巨人造成伤害，但在一块位置良好的巨石或一根巨大的棍子挥动之前，它有可能在一两个法术的打击下幸存。",
	"Among those with experience fighting giants, dwarves have developed the most effective tactics. To defeat a giant, dwarves rely on prolonged, accurate, massed archery (favoring heavy crossbows for such work), fast-moving cavalry that can force the giant into a disadvantageous position, or fanatical troops armed with pole arms, ropes, and grappling hooks. If a giant can be tripped or pulled down-preferably onto its belly so it's less able to defend itself-then it can be entangled in nets and cables and disabled by concentrated attacks on its head and neck.": "在那些有与巨人作战经验的人中，矮人已经发展出最有效的战术。为了打败巨人，矮人依靠的是长时间的、精确的、大规模的射箭（偏重于重型弩箭），快速移动的骑兵可以迫使巨人处于不利的位置，或者用杆臂、绳索和抓钩装备的狂热的部队。如果一个巨人能被绊倒或拉倒--最好是拉到肚子上，这样它的自卫能力就会减弱--那么它就能被网和缆绳缠住，并通过集中攻击它的头部和颈部而致残。",
	"On the other side of the field, giants understand that smaller foes will try to target their legs and lower bodies. Thus, when they head into a fight against human-sized opponents, they don thick boots, greaves, armored codpieces, and wide, heavy hide or metal belts to protect their bellies. Even savage hill giants peel thick bark from trees and strap it around their legs and dangle logs or stones from their belts to make the going more perilous for an enemy that tries to get underfoot.": "在战场的另一边，巨人明白，较小的敌人会试图瞄准他们的腿和下半身。因此，当他们与人类大小的对手作战时，他们会穿上厚厚的靴子，穿上长袍，戴上盔甲，用宽而重的皮革或金属腰带来保护自己的腹部。即使是野蛮的山地巨人也会从树上剥下厚厚的树皮，绑在腿上，并在腰带上挂上木头或石头，使试图踩在脚下的敌人走得更危险。",
	"Giants are exceptionally long-lived compared to humans, but none are immortal. A peaceful death from old age is a common occurrence among cloud giants and storm giants and isn't unusual among stone giants and fire giants. It's the exception among hill giants and frost giants, most of which die violently in battle against humans, dragons, other monsters, or their own kind.": "与人类相比，巨人的寿命特别长，但没有人是不朽的。在云巨人和风暴巨人中，因年老而和平死亡是一种常见的现象，在石巨人和火巨人中也并不罕见。这在山丘巨人和冰霜巨人中是个例外，他们大多在与人类、龙、其他怪物或同类的战斗中暴毙。",
	"Giants live at a slower pace than humans do. In the space of four heartbeats for a man, a stone giant's great heart beats just once. Giant mothers stay with their child for longer than human mothers do, and giant children grow to adulthood more slowly. Giants' families are small, because a couple seldom has more than a few children, and many have none at all.": "巨人的生活节奏比人类要慢。在一个人四次心跳的时间里，石巨人的巨大心脏只跳动一次。巨人的母亲与他们的孩子在一起的时间比人类的母亲要长，巨人的孩子成长为成年人的速度也更慢。巨人的家庭很小，因为一对夫妇很少有超过几个孩子，许多人根本就没有孩子。",
	"The life spans of the various types of giants are generally in keeping with their place in the ordning; the lowliest giants have the shortest life spans, and the noblest giants are the longest-lived. Stone giants are the exception. Because of their long life spans, despite their low position in the ordning, other giants consider stone giants to be the wisest of all giant types, just as Skoraeus Stonebones is often seen as the wisest of all the giant gods.": "各种类型的巨人的寿命通常与他们在秩序中的地位相一致；最低级的巨人的寿命最短，而最高贵的巨人则最长寿。石头巨人是个例外。由于他们的寿命很长，尽管他们在军团中的地位很低，其他巨人认为石巨人是所有巨人类型中最聪明的，就像斯科雷斯-石骨经常被视为所有巨神中最聪明的。",

A select few-those at the apex of the clan's ordning-claim the last of the ancient cloud castles that still drift across the sky.": "云中巨人的名字很贴切，或者至少曾经是。他们中很少有人真正生活在云上，但大多数人确实居住在高山之上，在近乎永久的云层内甚至之上。少数人--那些处于氏族秩序顶点的人--声称拥有最后的古老云堡，这些云堡仍然在天空中飘荡。",
	"No one can build those majestic structures any longer. The methods of their construction were lost (along with much other knowledge) when Ostoria fell. Some cloud giants believe the information might yet be buried in some long-forgotten, ruined library. Rumors of its existence crop up from time to time, stirring debate and dreams of resurgent glory among the cloud giants, but definite information has proven impossible to obtain. Many cloud giants think that someday, a hero will unearth this ancient secret. Until then, they must be satisfied with watching clouds drift past their mountaintop  homes instead of living atop those clouds as in days of yore.": "没有人能够再建造这些雄伟的建筑。它们的建造方法在奥斯托利亚陷落时丢失了（连同许多其他知识）。一些云端的巨人相信，这些信息可能还埋藏在某个早已被遗忘的废墟图书馆中。关于它存在的传言不时出现，在云端巨人中激起了辩论和复兴荣耀的梦想，但事实证明不可能获得确切的信息。许多云端巨人认为，总有一天，一个英雄会揭开这个古老的秘密。在那之前，他们必须满足于看着云彩飘过他们的山顶家园，而不是像过去那样生活在云彩之上。",
	"Most types of giants live communally in large groups of clan mates, but the central unit of cloud giant life is the family-a mated pair, their offspring (if any), and perhaps a couple of close relatives. Cloud giants prefer not to congregate in great numbers in any one place, to avoid drawing too much attention. It's not that they fear attack from humanoids or monsters, because few creatures other than dragons can challenge them. But if more than a few lived in the same place, the size of their combined treasure hoard would attract an incessant stream of adventurers and other would-be thieves-a nuisance on the order of rats in the larder.": "大多数类型的巨人都生活在由氏族伴侣组成的大群体中，但云巨人生活的核心单位是家庭--一对交配的夫妇、他们的后代（如果有的话），也许还有几个近亲。云巨人不喜欢在任何一个地方大量聚集，以避免引起太多的注意。这并不是说他们害怕来自人类或怪物的攻击，因为除了龙以外，很少有生物可以挑战他们。但是，如果在同一个地方住的人多了，他们的财宝囤积量就会吸引源源不断的冒险家和其他可能的盗贼--就像储藏室里的老鼠一样令人讨厌。",
	"Despite the distances that separate the homes of families, cloud giants aren't isolated. Every family or individual knows where its nearest neighbors are, even if the location is hundreds of miles away, and those neighbors know where their nearest neighbors are, and so on across the world. In a crisis, word is spread from family to family, so that a mighty squad of cloud giants could be assembled, in time, if need arises.": "尽管家庭之间的距离很远，但云巨人并不是孤立的。每个家庭或个人都知道其最近的邻居在哪里，即使位置在几百英里之外，而这些邻居也知道他们最近的邻居在哪里，以此类推，遍布全球。在危机中，消息从一个家庭传到另一个家庭，因此，如果有需要，可以及时召集一支强大的云端巨人队伍。",
	"Most cloud giant homes include one or more pets. Wyverns, griffons, giant eagles and owls, and other beasts of the sky are popular choices. Pets aren't limited to flying creatures, though. Any sort of creature might be found in a cloud giant menagerie, with rare specimens treated more as status symbol than as companions.": "大多数云中巨人的家包括一个或多个宠物。怀俄明，狮鹫，巨鹰和猫头鹰，以及其他天空中的野兽都是受欢迎的选择。不过，宠物并不局限于飞行生物。任何种类的生物都可以在云巨人的动物园里找到，稀有的标本更多的是作为地位的象征，而不是作为伙伴。",
	"Cloud giants are famous (or infamous) for demanding tribute from the humanoids that live beneath them. Such tribute is only proper from their perspective, for two reasons. First, their presence in an area benefits everyone by driving away many evils, especially flying predators such as manticores and wyverns. Second, the giants believe they deserve to be rewarded for their forbearance; no one could stop them from simply taking what they want, but instead of doing that they allow their tribute to be freely given. (The logic of that position is clearer to the giants than it is to those on the other end of the arrangement.)": "云巨人因要求生活在他们下面的人类进贡而闻名（或臭名昭著）。从他们的角度来看，这种进贡是恰当的，原因有二。首先，他们在一个地区的存在对每个人都有好处，因为他们赶走了许多邪恶的东西，特别是飞行掠食者，如尾兽和狼獾。第二，巨人认为他们的宽容应该得到回报；没有人可以阻止他们简单地拿走他们想要的东西，但他们没有这样做，而是让他们的贡品免费提供。(这一立场的逻辑对巨人来说比对安排的另一端的人更清楚）。",
	"Much of the tribute that cloud giants accept is in the form of livestock and crops, but this isn't their only source of food. Cloud giants are avid gardeners. Almost all cloud giant strongholds devote space to a garden that produces enormous yields: beans as big as turnips, turnips as big as pumpkins, and pumpkins as big as carriages.": "云巨人接受的大部分贡品是以牲畜和农作物的形式，但这并不是他们唯一的食物来源。云巨人是狂热的园艺家。几乎所有的云雾巨人据点都将空间用于生产巨大产量的花园：像萝卜一样大的豆子，像南瓜一样大的萝卜，和像马车一样大的南瓜。",
	"The garden of a cloud giant family is seldom affected by drought, frost, or locusts. When such a calamity strikes nearby farms, families have been known to share their bounty to ease the humanoids' food shortage.": "云巨人家庭的花园很少受到干旱、霜冻或蝗虫的影响。当这种灾难袭击附近的农场时，人们知道家庭会分享他们的赏赐，以缓解人类的食物短缺。",
	"The chief deity of cloud giants is Memnor, the cleverest of Annam's offspring. But Memnor isn't only clever, he's sly and deceitful. Tales of his exploits emphasize his charisma, his smooth manner, and his ability to manipulate and mislead his siblings and other legendary figures into doing exactly what he wants, usually to their great detriment.": "云巨人的主要神灵是梅姆诺，他是安南最聪明的后代。但梅姆诺尔不仅聪明，而且狡猾、奸诈。有关他的故事强调了他的魅力、他的圆滑，以及他操纵和误导他的兄弟姐妹和其他传奇人物做他想做的事的能力，通常对他们造成极大的伤害。",
	"Thus, cloud giants have two distinct aspects of Memnor to admire and emulate. Those of a benign disposition revere him for his charm, intelligence, and persuasiveness, while those of a more malign bent take Memnor's self-interest to heart and imitate his trickery. Cloud giants that take a particular interest in trickery, known as \"smiling ones,\" wear two-faced masks as they practice their deceptions and prey on those who are susceptible to their charms. Statistics for cloud giant smiling ones appear in chapter 3 of this book.": "因此，云中巨人对梅姆诺有两种截然不同的钦佩和效仿。那些性格善良的人崇尚他的魅力、智慧和说服力，而那些性格比较恶毒的人则把梅姆诺尔的自我利益放在心上，模仿他的诡计。对诡计特别感兴趣的云巨人，被称为 \"微笑者\"，他们戴着两面的面具进行欺骗，并捕食那些容易受其魅力影响的人。本书第三章中出现了关于云雾巨人微笑者的统计数字。",
	"Such events are at the root of tales about magic beans and others about a human family living in a cottage carved from a single, enormous gourd. Beyond that, the cloud giants' generosity in times of want helps to cement their reputation as friends of humankind-a reputation that serves them well, even though it's not entirely deserved.": "这类事件是关于魔豆的故事的根源，也是关于一个人类家庭生活在由一个巨大的葫芦雕刻而成的小屋的故事的根源。除此之外，云雾巨人在匮乏时期的慷慨帮助巩固了他们作为人类朋友的声誉--这种声誉对他们很有利，尽管这并不是完全应得的。",
	"A cloud giant's position within the ordning doesn't depend on talent or skill. It depends on wealth. The more treasure a cloud giant possesses, the higher its standing. It's as simple as that. Almost.": "一个云计算巨人在条例中的地位并不取决于天赋或技能。它取决于财富。一个云端巨人拥有的财富越多，其地位就越高。就这么简单。差不多了。",
	"Ownership is one thing, but wealth that's kept locked away means little. To fully contribute to one's status, wealth must be displayed, and the more ostentatious the display, the better. In a cloud giant family's home, extravagance is omnipresent. One might boast windows framed in gold leaf, rare perfume stored in vials of crystal with silver lids, or a scene in the sky depicted in a tapestry composed entirely of pearls.": "拥有权是一回事，但被锁起来的财富没有什么意义。为了充分提升自己的地位，财富必须被展示出来，而且展示得越夸张越好。在一个云端巨人的家里，奢侈是无处不在的。人们可能会夸耀用金叶子镶成的窗户，稀有的香水储存在带银盖的水晶瓶中，或者用完全由珍珠组成的挂毯描绘天空中的场景。",
	"Another way for a family to demonstrate its wealth is by bestowing lavish gifts on other families. (A gift from one family member to another doesn't prove anything about the family's largesse.) No cloud giant truly believes that it's better to give than to receive; a family does so only with an eye toward how the giving can elevate its status. Memnor and his trickery play a role in this \"game.\" The very best gift (from the giver's perspective) is one that everyone believes to be far more valuable than it truly is. Only the giver and the receiver will ever know a gift's true value, and neither of them would ever reveal that a gift is worth less than it appears to be, because to do so would reduce the status of both.": "一个家庭展示其财富的另一种方式是向其他家庭赠送奢华的礼物。(一个家庭成员给另一个成员的礼物并不能证明这个家庭的慷慨。） 没有一个云端的巨人真正相信施比受更好；一个家庭这样做只是为了考虑如何通过给予来提高自己的地位。梅姆诺尔和他的诡计在这个 \"游戏 \"中扮演了一个角色。最好的礼物（从赠送者的角度来看）是每个人都认为比它真正的价值高得多的礼物。只有送礼人和收礼人知道一份礼物的真正价值，他们都不会透露一份礼物的价值低于它看起来的价值，因为这样做会降低两人的地位。",
	"Wealth also changes hands between cloud giants when they indulge their obsession for gambling and wagering. Cloud giants don't engage in betting for enjoyment; it is less a form of entertainment than a type of bloodless feud. No cloud giant is a good loser, and one would be aghast to hear someone else say, \"I lost 40 pounds of gold, but I had a good time.\" Betting wars between families can go on for generations, with fortunes and estates (and the position in the ordning that goes with them) passing back and forth repeatedly. What a parent loses, a child hopes someday to win back, plus more; what the child wins back, a grandchild probably will eventually lose again. The tales that cloud giants tell of their ancestors are seldom about wars or magic or battles against dragons-they're about brilliant wagers won through boldness or deceit, and rival families brought to disgrace and ruin by the same.": "当云端巨人沉迷于赌博和下注时，财富也在他们之间易手。云雾巨人参与赌博并不是为了享受；与其说这是一种娱乐，不如说是一种不流血的争斗。没有一个云雾巨人是好的输家，如果听到别人说：\"我输了40磅黄金，但我玩得很开心\"，人们会感到惊奇。家庭之间的赌战可以持续几代人，财富和财产（以及与之相伴的在军团中的地位）反复传递。父母失去的东西，孩子希望有一天能赢回来，再加上更多；孩子赢回来的东西，孙子可能最终会再次失去。云端巨人讲述他们祖先的故事，很少是关于战争、魔法或与龙的战斗--它们是关于通过大胆或欺骗赢得的辉煌赌注，以及竞争对手的家族因同样的事情而蒙羞和毁灭。",
	"Ancient depictions of Memnor often showed him wearing a two-faced mask. Because of this, cloud giant nobles seldom show their faces, but instead wear exquisite masks made of precious materials adorned with gemstones. Each noble has a collection of these masks that it wears to conceal its face but still reflect its current mood; an individual might change masks many times during the day as its emotions shift.": "古代对梅姆诺尔的描绘经常显示他戴着两面的面具。正因为如此，云巨人贵族很少露出他们的脸，而是戴着用宝石装饰的珍贵材料制成的精致面具。每个贵族都有一套这样的面具，戴着它可以掩盖自己的脸，但仍能反映其当前的心情；一个人在一天中可能会随着情绪的变化而多次更换面具。",
	"A mask is prized both for its material value and for its accuracy in expressing the mood it represents. Only the richest of cloud giants can afford the dozens of masks necessary to show all the subtle differences in emotion possible among their kind. Artisans who can sculpt and craft masks that meet the cloud giants' exacting standards in such matters are richly rewarded for their skill.": "面具的珍贵之处在于它的物质价值和它在表达情绪方面的准确性。只有最富有的云雾巨人才能买得起几十个必要的面具，以显示他们之间可能存在的所有微妙的情感差异。能够雕刻和制作符合云雾巨人在这些方面的严格标准的面具的工匠，会因为他们的技能而得到丰厚的回报。",
	"The fire giants were the officers, engineers, and crafters of ancient Ostoria. Their position and unparalleled skill, along with their domineering outlook, make them haughty and arrogant.": "火巨人是古代奥斯托利亚的官员、工程师和工匠。他们的地位和无与伦比的技能，加上他们的霸气外露，使他们傲慢自大。",
	"Fire giants are the greatest smiths, architects, and technicians among giantkind. The iron-lined halls of a fire giant stronghold, deep inside a mountain or a volcano, support the unimaginable weight of the stone above them and enable the giants to harness the heat of rivers of magma to power their forges.": "火巨人是巨人族中最伟大的铁匠、建筑师和技术人员。火巨人据点的铁制大厅位于山体或火山深处，支撑着上面的石头的难以想象的重量，使巨人能够利用岩浆河的热量为他们的锻造提供动力。",
	"A fire giant's prowess in the occupations of crafting determines its place in the ordning. Although fire giants put stock in combat skill, they recognize that success in battle or on the hunt derives mainly from the quality of one's weapons and armor, and those that can fashion the finest gear enjoy the highest status in the clan. Maser artisans, architects, and engineers select the best disciples to pass their knowledge on to, along with their standing. Often pupils are children or siblings of their teachers, but that's not always so. Leaders are chosen by general recognition from among the best crafters in the clan.": "一个火巨人在工艺方面的能力决定了他在军团中的地位。虽然火巨人重视战斗技巧，但他们认识到，在战斗或狩猎中的成功主要来自于武器和盔甲的质量，那些能够制造出最好装备的人在族中享有最高的地位。玛瑟工匠、建筑师和工程师选择最好的弟子来传授他们的知识，以及他们的地位。学生通常是他们老师的孩子或兄弟姐妹，但这并不总是如此。领袖是通过普遍认可的方式从族中最好的工匠中选出的。",
	"One group of fire giants, known as the dreadnoughts, owe their place in the ordning not to their crafting ability but to their extraordinary physical prowess. They take on a lot of the work of guarding the forges and keeping them stoked-effort without which the crafters couldn't succeed. (See chapter 3 of this book for more information on fire giant dreadnoughts.)": "有一群火巨人，被称为 \"无畏\"，他们在军团中的地位不是因为他们的工艺能力，而是因为他们非凡的体能。他们承担了大量守卫锻造厂并保持其燃烧的工作--没有这些工作，手工业者就无法成功。(关于火巨人无畏舰的更多信息，请参见本书第三章）。",
	"Fire giants don't spend a lot of time crafting works of art, although they would maintain that all of their feats of metalworking and engineering are themselves forms of artistic expression. Beyond such accomplishments, true artwork is scarce among fire giants, and most of what exists is jewelry, made from gems and ore that they mine and then refine. A unique form of art that some fire giants produce involves manipulating magma as it cools, forming it into fantastical, one-of-a-kind shapes. The most striking of these works are collected and displayed inside the stronghold, not unlike how other cultures create topiary gardens.": "火巨人不会花很多时间来制作艺术作品，尽管他们会坚持认为他们所有的金属加工和工程成就本身就是艺术表达的形式。除了这些成就之外，真正的艺术品在火巨人中是很少的，大部分是珠宝，由他们开采的宝石和矿石制成，然后再进行提炼。一些火巨人制作的独特艺术形式包括在岩浆冷却时对其进行操纵，使其形成奇异的、独一无二的形状。这些作品中最引人注目的被收集起来，并在据点内展示，这与其他文化中创建装饰花园的方式不一样。",
	"When fire giants aren't honing their crafting skills, they're drilling with weapons or exercising to keep themselves fit for battle. The typical fire giant has a mastery of combat tactics that few other warriors can match, but the giants' understanding of strategy is rudimentary.": "当火巨人不磨练他们的工艺技能时，他们会钻研武器或锻炼身体，以保持自己的战斗力。典型的火巨人对战斗战术的掌握是其他战士所无法比拟的，但巨人对战略的理解是初级的。",
	"This deficiency isn't born from a lack of ability, but has its roots in tradition. In ages past, when the giants worked together to dominate the world, strategy was determined by the cloud giants and the storm giants. Ever since the clans went their separate ways after Ostoria's wars against the dragons, the fire giants have not mounted a grand, strategic effort to extend their sway, but they have fought countless skirmishes and other tactical engagements, mainly to solidify their hold on territory they have already claimed. If an ambitious fire giant ever became a master of strategic planning (or captured and enslaved a cooperative general), little could stop a tribe of fire giants that enjoyed this additional advantage over their neighbors.": "这种缺陷并不是因为缺乏能力而产生的，而是源于传统。在过去的岁月里，当巨人们一起努力主宰世界时，战略是由云巨人和风暴巨人决定的。自从奥斯托里亚与龙族的战争结束后，这两个部族分道扬镳后，火巨人并没有为扩大他们的影响力而进行宏大的战略努力，但他们进行了无数次的小规模战斗和其他战术交锋，主要是为了巩固他们对已宣称的领土的控制。如果有一天，一个雄心勃勃的火巨人成为了战略规划的大师（或者俘虏并奴役了一个合作的将军），那么几乎没有什么能阻止一个享有这种对邻居的额外优势的火巨人部落。",
	"Fire giants raise and train hell hounds as war dogs, and they sometimes persuade human wizards (free or enslaved) to harness fire elementals as guardians for their strongholds. Some allow trolls to roam free in rarely used parts of their fortresses, serving as perimeter guards of a sort. Trolls require little maintenance, able to survive on the fire giants' scraps and on dead or diseased slaves; they're tough enough to deter most intruders; and their susceptibility to fire makes them little threat to a fire giant.": "火巨人饲养和训练地狱猎犬作为战犬，他们有时会说服人类巫师（自由的或被奴役的）来驾驭火元素作为他们据点的守护者。有些人允许巨魔在他们的堡垒中很少使用的地方自由游荡，充当某种周边的守卫。巨魔不需要什么维护，它们能够靠火巨人的残羹剩饭和死去或生病的奴隶生存；它们足够强壮，足以阻止大多数入侵者；而且它们对火的敏感性使它们对火巨人没有什么威胁。",
	"Surtur, the chief deity of fire giants, is believed to have been born alongside Thrym. Each twin then tried to be the first to cry out, the first to walk, and the first to talk, and they have competed with one another ever since. Often in legends these contests are bloody battles, but some tales have the brothers acting side by side on grand adventures. Surtur is seen as the more clever of the two, and fire giants emulate his unsurpassed skill at creating and building things.": "火巨人的主神苏尔图尔（Surtur），据说是与特里姆一起出生的。然后，每对双胞胎都试图成为第一个哭出来的人，第一个会走路的人，第一个会说话的人，从那时起他们就开始相互竞争。在传说中，这些竞争往往是血腥的战斗，但有些故事中，这对兄弟并肩作战，进行大冒险。苏尔图尔被认为是两个人中更聪明的，火巨人模仿他在创造和建造东西方面无与伦比的技能。",
	"In the fire giants' world, fire is strength. It burns away impurities and leaves behind only what is strong enough to withstand the heat, such as the best steel from the forge. When fire is controlled, it is the giants' most powerful tool; when it rages unchecked, it can bring down forests and lay waste to cities.": "在火巨人的世界里，火就是力量。它能烧掉杂质，只留下足以承受高温的东西，如来自锻造厂的最好的钢。当火被控制时，它是巨人最强大的工具；当它肆虐时，它可以使森林倒塌，使城市荒废。",
	"Because of the destructive power of fire, the worship of Surtur is tinged with an apocalyptic air. Some observers suspect that priests of Surtur maintain clandestine workshops and armories where they manufacture and stockpile battle gear in preparation for a final, all-encompassing battle that will decide the fate of the world. If the suspicions are true, these sites are expertly hidden and kept secret even from most fire giants.": "由于火的破坏力，对苏尔图尔的崇拜带有一种世界末日的气息。一些观察家怀疑，苏尔图尔的祭司们保持着秘密的工场和军械库，他们在那里制造和储存战斗装备，为决定世界命运的最后一场包罗万象的战斗做准备。如果怀疑是真的，这些场所被专业地隐藏起来，甚至对大多数火巨人都是保密的。",
	"It takes a lot of work to build and maintain a fire giant stronghold. Most of that effort comes not from the giants themselves, but from the slaves that they keep. Fire giants enslave other creatures to accomplish unskilled labor, so the giants can concentrate on the more vital aspects of foundry operation and crafting that only they are capable of. They aren't overly cruel masters, but neither are they particularly kind-they are uncaring about their slaves, because slaves aren't giants, and there are always more to be had if the supply runs low.": "建造和维护一个火巨人的据点需要大量的工作。大部分的努力不是来自巨人本身，而是来自他们豢养的奴隶。火巨人奴役其他生物来完成非技术性的劳动，这样巨人就可以集中精力进行只有他们才能胜任的铸造操作和工艺制作的更重要的方面。他们不是过于残忍的主人，但也不是特别善良--他们不关心他们的奴隶，因为奴隶不是巨人，而且如果供应不足，总是可以得到更多。",
	"Most creatures that fire giants capture are put to work in the giants' mines or on surface farms the giants claim as part of their domain. Even master crafters of other races are consigned to unskilled labor, because so few of them have talents the fire giants consider \"skilled.\" Only creatures that have skills the fire giants need but don't practice (because they aren't valued in the ordning), such as accounting, brewing, and medicine, are allowed to continue plying their trades.": "大多数被火巨人捕获的生物都被安排在巨人的矿场或巨人声称属于他们领域的地面农场工作。即使是其他种族的手工艺大师也会被派去做非技术性的工作，因为他们中很少有人拥有火巨人认为的 \"技能\"。只有那些拥有火巨人需要的技能但却没有实践的生物，比如会计、酿酒和医药，才被允许继续从事他们的工作。",
	"Skilled slaves receive better treatment, at least in the sense that an owner uses less force with a delicate tool, but as a rule fire giants view humans in much the same way that humans view horses: they have utility if properly directed, and some might be prized for rare qualities, but even the smartest, best trained horse isn't a person. That said, it's not unheard of for a fire giant to \"consult with\" a slave physician when it falls ill, or with a slave engineer right before beginning a difficult stage of tunnel excavation. (Such a consultation would only be to ensure that the right tools and materials are on hand for the excavation, not to solicit a second opinion on the giant's personal assessment of the structure's integrity.)": "熟练的奴隶会得到更好的待遇，至少在主人对精致的工具使用较少的力量的意义上，但作为一项规则，火巨人看待人类的方式与人类看待马的方式基本相同：如果指导得当，他们有实用性，有些可能因罕见的品质而受到珍视，但即使是最聪明、训练最好的马也不是一个人。也就是说，火巨人在生病时向奴隶医生 \"咨询\"，或在开始隧道挖掘的困难阶段前向奴隶工程师 \"咨询\"，这并非闻所未闻。(这样的咨询只是为了确保挖掘时有合适的工具和材料，而不是为了征求巨人对结构完整性的个人评估的第二个意见）。",
	"Giants that stand low in the ordning are assigned to manage slaves and mining operations. Excavating mine shafts and digging out ore is important work, but smelting and metalwork are valued more highly than effort spent keeping a tunnel from collapsing on slaves.": "站在低处的巨人被指派管理奴隶和采矿作业。挖掘矿井和挖出矿石是很重要的工作，但冶炼和金属制品的价值要高于为防止隧道坍塌而花在奴隶身上的精力。",
	"Frost giants dwell in the remote, frozen places of the world. Anything warmer than the flesh of a recently killed elk is as flame to them. As a sailor fears the howl of the wind heralding a storm, the denizens of ice-capped mountains and northern steppes shudder at the war horns that presage the arrival of Thrym's blue-skinned, icy children.": "霜巨人居住在世界偏远的冰冻地区。对他们来说，任何比刚被杀死的麋鹿的肉更温暖的东西都是火焰。就像水手害怕预示风暴的风声一样，冰雪覆盖的山脉和北方草原上的居民对预示着特里姆的蓝皮肤冰雪之子到来的战争号角不寒而栗。",
	"Position within the frost giant ordning is determined by sheer, brute strength. Frost giants know that those that use cunning, agility, and magic are dangerous foes and can sometimes overcome pure strength, but never in a straightforward, fair manner; enemies that act that way are maug, and strength alone is maat.": "在冰霜巨人军团中的地位是由纯粹的、粗暴的力量决定的。霜巨人知道，那些使用狡猾、敏捷和魔法的人是危险的敌人，有时可以战胜纯粹的力量，但绝不是以直接的、公平的方式；这样的敌人是maug，而单独的力量是maat。",
	"Doubt or disagreement between frost giants over which is strongest is settled by a trial of strength. Such a contest typically involves wrestling but can also be a rock-throwing competition, a hunt, or one-on-one combat.": "霜巨人之间关于谁最强的疑虑或分歧是通过力量的考验来解决的。这种竞赛通常涉及摔跤，但也可以是投石比赛、狩猎，或一对一的战斗。",
	"To show proof of their superiority, frost giants keep and display trophies of their victims. Mammoth tusks, griffon beaks, and manticore tails adorn the walls of frost giant lairs. Formidable humanoid enemies are memorialized in trophies, too, but only rarely do giants put the heads or bodies on display. A human hero's greatsword or a wizard's staff is a more appropriate trophy  in such cases.": "为了证明自己的优越性，冰霜巨人保留并展示他们受害者的战利品。猛犸象的獠牙、狮鹫的喙和尾兽的尾巴都装饰在冰霜巨人巢穴的墙上。可怕的人形敌人也会以战利品的形式加以纪念，但巨人很少把头或身体展示出来。在这种情况下，人类英雄的大剑或巫师的法杖是更合适的战利品。",
	"A frost giant's armor and weapons are as much a record of its battle honors as its trophy collection is, for those who know how to read the signs. Notches carved into the haft of a weapon show the number and type of foes it has brought down. Horns, feathers, claws, and tusks affixed to helmets and armor serve as decorations commemorating the giant's greatest feats of strength.": "对于那些知道如何读懂标志的人来说，冰霜巨人的盔甲和武器就像其奖杯收藏一样，是其战斗荣誉的记录。刻在武器柄上的凹槽显示了它所击倒的敌人的数量和类型。贴在头盔和盔甲上的角、羽毛、爪子和獠牙则是纪念巨人最伟大力量的装饰品。",
	"The ordning is determined by strength and strength alone, and there is no difference in physical prowess between the genders of frost giants. (Most child-rearing duties are handled by the elderly of both sexes, not solely by females.) It is considered highly maug to attack or challenge a pregnant female, even to improve one's standing, just as it would be to attack a frost giant as it slept.": "秩序仅由力量和实力决定，冰霜巨人的性别之间在体能上没有区别。(大多数养育孩子的职责是由两性中的老人负责的，而不是只由女性负责）。攻击或挑战一个怀孕的女性，即使是为了提高自己的地位，也被认为是非常愚蠢的，就像攻击一个正在睡觉的冰霜巨人一样。",
	"A frost giant that is innately weaker than its kin has a low rank in the ordning and practically no chance of rising any higher. At times, when a giant becomes intensely frustrated with that situation, it turns to clandestine worship of Vaprak, the deity of trolls and ogres. An individual touched by Vaprak's favor is transformed into an everlasting one-a giant with enough strength to rival the leaders of the clan, but destined to be cast out or destroyed if its secret allegiance becomes known.": "一个先天性弱于其亲属的冰霜巨人在军团中的地位很低，几乎没有机会再上升。有时，当一个巨人对这种情况感到非常沮丧时，就会转向对巨魔和食人魔的神灵瓦普拉克的秘密崇拜。一个受到瓦普拉克恩惠的人将会变成一个永恒的巨人，这个巨人有足够的力量与氏族的领袖相抗衡，但如果它的秘密效忠被人知道，就注定要被驱逐或毁灭。",
	"Because strength is their only standard of measurement, frost giants are more likely than other giants to welcome a non-giant into their group. The might of a human who hunts polar bears bare-handed as frost giants do, or who wrestles a frost giant into submission, can't be denied. Such a human could never become the chieftain of a tribe but could earn a place of honor as one blessed by Thrym.": "由于力量是他们唯一的衡量标准，霜巨人比其他巨人更可能欢迎非巨人加入他们的群体。一个像冰霜巨人那样赤手空拳猎杀北极熊的人类，或者把冰霜巨人摔得服服帖帖的人类，其力量是不可否认的。这样的人类不可能成为一个部落的首领，但却可以作为受到泰瑞姆祝福的人赢得一席荣耀。",
	"Frost giant society has no industry to speak of. It takes what it needs from others, and if it can't take something, it has no need for it. Frost giants do make leather, clothes, and bone tools and adornments from the animals they hunt, but those activities account for almost all of their craftwork.": "霜巨人社会没有工业可言。它从别人那里获取它所需要的东西，如果它不能获取某样东西，它就不需要它。冰霜巨人的确用他们猎杀的动物制作皮革、衣服、骨质工具和装饰品，但这些活动几乎占了他们所有的手工艺品。",
	"When frost giants plan a raid on a nearby settlement or outpost, they time it to take place under the cover of a blizzard, believing the storm to be a sign from Thrym that the weak-boned humanoids are ready to be plundered, in the same way that a farmer might look at a rainstorm as a blessing from the harvest god.": "当霜巨人计划突袭附近的定居点或前哨站时，他们会把时间安排在暴风雪的掩护下，认为暴风雪是来自特里姆的信号，表明这些骨瘦如柴的人类已经准备好被掠夺了，就像农民可能把暴雨看成是收获之神的祝福一样。",
	"Frost giants recognize two kinds of loot: rod and kvit. Rod (\"red\") plunder consists of living creatures, either livestock or slaves. Kvit refers to material goods, the most prized being objects of steel, alcohol, and large gems. Frost giants like to grab gems for adorning their clothing, but ordinary currency is usually left behind after a raid. Tiny, round coins simply have no worth to a frost giant.": "冰霜巨人承认有两种掠夺物：棒状物和Kvit。Rod（\"红色\"）掠夺物包括生物，不是牲畜就是奴隶。Kvit指的是物质产品，最珍贵的是钢铁、酒精和大型宝石等物品。冰霜巨人喜欢抓取宝石来装饰他们的衣服，但普通的货币通常是在突袭后留下的。小而圆的硬币对冰霜巨人来说根本没有价值。",
	"Thrym has long rivaled his twin brother Surtur for Annam's affection and pride. Frost giants pride themselves on Thrym's victories over Surtur and other legendary threats when he proved to have more strength or a steadier heart. Yet, Annam was swayed more by Surtur's well-crafted gifts than by the trophy heads Thrym laid at his feet. For this reason, frost giants bear more ill will toward Annam than most other giants do.": "Thrym长期以来一直与他的孪生兄弟Surtur争夺Annam的爱戴和骄傲。冰霜巨人以特里姆对苏尔图尔和其他传奇威胁的胜利为荣，当时他被证明有更多的力量或更稳定的心。然而，安纳姆更多的是被苏尔图尔精心制作的礼物所动摇，而不是被特里姆放在他脚下的战利品头颅所动摇。由于这个原因，冰霜巨人对安南的敌意比其他大多数巨人要多。",
	"Unlike his brothers, Thrym is seldom depicted alone. He is usually accompanied by up to ten shield-brothers and shield-sisters, heroic frost giants that won such great glory during the war between giants and dragons that Thrym granted them the honor of fighting forever at his side.": "与他的兄弟们不同，泰瑞姆很少被单独描绘。他身边通常有多达10个盾牌兄弟和盾牌姐妹，这些英雄的冰霜巨人在巨人和龙的战争中赢得了巨大的荣耀，因此特里姆授予他们永远在他身边战斗的荣誉。",
	"Because frost giants can't stand the heat of a forge, they don't mine their own metal or craft their own weapons and armor. The fire-forged items of steel and iron that they wield and wear are prized as though they were made of gold. The giants are always on the lookout for such booty on their raids, but they don't often come across gear that is large enough for them to wear. Many of the giants in a tribe boast arms and armor handed down from their ancestors; others make do with items cobbled together from smaller parts. Shields sized for a human, for example, can be lashed together into a crude suit of scale armor; an anvil riveted onto a log serves as a warhammer.": "因为冰霜巨人无法忍受锻造的热量，所以他们不开采自己的金属，也不制作自己的武器和盔甲。他们所挥舞和穿戴的钢和铁的火锻物品，就像金子做的一样珍贵。巨人在突袭中总是在寻找这样的战利品，但他们并不经常遇到足以让他们穿戴的装备。一个部落中的许多巨人都拥有祖先传下来的武器和盔甲；其他的则是用小零件拼凑起来的物品。例如，人类用的盾牌，可以用绳索捆绑成一套粗糙的鳞甲；一个铆在木头上的铁砧可以作为战锤。",
	"Frost giants dominate wild creatures both as evidence of their strength and to use them as hunting companions. They don't, however, have much grasp of animal husbandry, so their \"pets\" are bullied and beaten into submission more than they're trained. When a frost giant commands a beast to attack, it's less a command than an acknowledgment to the creature that the giant won't beat it for satisfying its hunger. A creature that proves willful or that resists \"training\" is fated to end up on the giant's dinner table.": "冰霜巨人支配野生动物，既是为了证明他们的力量，也是为了将它们作为狩猎的伙伴。然而，他们并不掌握动物的饲养方法，所以他们的 \"宠物 \"更多的是被欺负和殴打而不是被训练。当冰霜巨人命令一只野兽进攻时，与其说是命令，不如说是承认巨人不会因为满足它的饥饿感而打它。一个被证明有意志力或抗拒 \"训练 \"的生物，注定要在巨人的餐桌上结束。",
	"The roster of creatures in a frost giant lair can include polar bears, winter wolves, and mammoths, but the giants' most prized living possessions are remorhazes. Adult remorhazes are untrainable by anything short of powerful magical compulsion, but one taken as an egg can be trained as it is raised. In fact, remorhaz hatchlings are surprisingly pliant to the frost giants' manner of teaching by bullying.": "霜巨人巢穴中的生物名册可以包括北极熊、冬狼和猛犸象，但巨人最珍贵的生活财产是雷莫哈兹。成年的remorhazes是无法被任何东西训练的，除非有强大的魔法强制力，但作为蛋的remorhazes可以在长大后被训练。事实上，雷莫哈兹的幼崽对冰霜巨人的欺凌式教学方式出奇的顺从。",
	"Hill giants live to eat. Anyone who understands this one fact about them knows everything there is to know.": "山地巨兽以吃为生。任何人只要了解关于他们的这一事实，就会知道所有要知道的事情。",
	"Hill giants are the weakest of the true giants. They have the shortest stature, the smallest brains, and the least ambition. The only area in which they excel is girth.": "山地巨人是真正的巨人中最弱的。他们的身材最矮小，大脑最小，野心也最小。他们唯一擅长的领域是腰围。",
	"Since eating is the only thing hill giants care about, a tribe is always led by its fattest, heaviest member-the most successful and thus the most admired one in the group. The qualities that other creatures expect or demand of their leaders-such as intellect, decision-making ability, and personal magnetism-have no importance to hill giants. They are neither recognized nor rewarded, except to the extent that a hill giant with slightly above average smarts might use trickery or intimidation to grab more food than its neighbors.": "由于吃是山地巨人唯一关心的事情，一个部落总是由其最胖、最重的成员领导--最成功的，因此也是群体中最令人钦佩的成员。其他生物对其领袖的期望或要求的品质--如智力、决策能力和个人魅力--对山地巨兽来说并不重要。它们既不被认可，也不被奖励，除非一个稍稍高于平均水平的山地巨人可能会使用诡计或恐吓来抢夺比其邻居更多的食物。",
	"Hill giants stuff the most repulsive, rotting things into their mouths without hesitation, suggesting that either they have no sense of taste or their hunger is so all-consuming that flavor isn't a consideration. Whatever the reason, the upshot is that hill giant dens are filthy, reeking places. Decaying carcasses and cracked bones are strewn about. The ground is saturated with blood and with the giants' own filth.": "山地巨人毫不犹豫地把最令人厌恶的、腐烂的东西塞进他们的嘴里，这说明他们要么没有味觉，要么他们的饥饿感是如此的强烈，以至于味道都不在考虑之列。不管是什么原因，结果是山丘巨兽的巢穴是肮脏的、发臭的地方。腐烂的尸体和破裂的骨头散落一地。地面被血和巨人自己的污秽物浸透了。",
	"Not every hill giant's digestive system is so indiscriminate; from time to time a giant does get sick, but most of them recover and don't learn anything from the experience. The rare exceptions are called mouths of Grolantor-giants that are confined and starved to the point of emaciation before being unleashed during a battle or a raid.": "并非每个山丘巨人的消化系统都是如此不分青红皂白；不时有巨人生病，但大多数都会恢复，而且不会从经验中吸取任何教训。罕见的例外是被称为Grolantor之口的巨人，它们在战斗或突袭中被释放之前，被禁锢和饥饿到憔悴的地步。",
	"The stench that exudes from a hill giant den might attract monstrous scavengers such as oozes, ropers, carrion crawlers, or otyughs. Hill giants don't domesticate or tend these creatures but do tolerate their presence. A visit from a gelatinous cube or a carrion crawler probably is the only \"housekeeping\" a hill giant's den ever sees.": "山地巨人巢穴中散发的恶臭可能会吸引可怕的食腐动物，如Oozes、Ropers、腐肉爬虫或Otyughs。山地巨人不会驯化或照料这些生物，但会容忍它们的存在。一个胶质立方体或腐肉爬虫的来访，可能是山地巨兽的巢穴唯一的 \"家务\"。",
	"Ghouls are known to lurk around the edges of hill giant encampments, but they're less welcome than other kinds of scavengers.": "众所周知，食尸鬼潜伏在山丘巨人营地的边缘，但它们比其他种类的食腐动物更不受欢迎。",
	"The deity most revered by hill giants is Grolantor, the least of Annam's six sons, the black sheep of the family who was scorned by his siblings and his parents. Most of Grolantor's problems, however, were of his own doing.": "山地巨人最崇敬的神灵是Grolantor，他是安南六个儿子中最小的一个，是家里的害群之马，被他的兄弟姐妹和父母所蔑视。然而，Grolantor的大部分问题都是他自己造成的。",
	"Proud of his great strength (his only redeeming quality), Grolantor refused to recognize the superiority of his older, smarter, stronger siblings, and insisted on being treated as their equal. He complained constantly of his endless hunger, but rather than hunt for himself, he snatched food from the plates of his siblings and his parents.": "Grolantor为自己强大的力量（他唯一值得称道的品质）感到骄傲，他拒绝承认他年长、聪明、强壮的兄弟姐妹的优越性，并坚持被当作他们的平等对待。他不断抱怨自己无休止的饥饿，但他没有为自己打猎，而是从他的兄弟姐妹和父母的盘子里抢夺食物。",
	"This behavior caused many fights between Grolantor and his siblings, most of which Grolantor lost. Tales about Grolantor invariably end with his gaining yet another scar on his back, received as he escaped the wrath of a family member who had been pushed too far by Grolantor's insulting boasts and selfishness.": "这种行为在格罗兰托和他的兄弟姐妹之间引起了许多争吵，其中大部分都是格罗兰托输了。关于Grolantor的故事总是以他背上的另一道伤疤结束，这道伤疤是他在躲避一个被Grolantor的侮辱性吹嘘和自私心态逼得太紧的家庭成员的愤怒时留下的。",
	"With their greater craftiness-especially if they're led by a ghast-ghouls can use simple trickery to steal the giants' meals. A hill giant wouldn't mind if a roper dragged away a few scraps, but it would be angry if a trio of ghouls stole an entire carcass.": "凭借他们更高的手艺--特别是如果他们由一个山丘巨人领导--食尸鬼可以用简单的诡计来偷取巨人的食物。一个山丘巨人不会介意一个牧羊人拖走一些残羹剩饭，但如果三个食尸鬼偷走了整个尸体，它就会很生气。",
	"Hill giants sometimes amuse themselves with inane games that typically involve food or eating. One such game is called stuff-stuff, in which hill giants see how many halflings, gnomes, or goblins they can fit into their mouths at once without swallowing.": "山地巨人有时会用一些无意义的游戏来消遣自己，这些游戏通常涉及食物或吃东西。其中一个游戏被称为 \"东西-东西\"，在这个游戏中，山地巨人们要看他们能把多少个半身人、地精或妖精同时塞进嘴里而不被吞下。",
	"Stone giants-reclusive, reflective, and inscrutable-take pains to remain apart from the world of sunlight and sky. Only when they're surrounded by stone do they consider themselves to be in reality. A world of all-encompassing stone is a realm of permanence and solidity, one where a lifetime of laborious carving can last through countless eons. The surface world, with its shifting light, endless sky, changing climate, and eroding wind, represents a dream state, an unreality where nothing lasts and therefore nothing has significance.": "石头巨人--隐蔽的、反思的、不可捉摸的--努力与阳光和天空的世界保持距离。只有当他们被石头包围时，他们才认为自己是在现实中。一个由包罗万象的石头组成的世界是一个永久和坚实的领域，在这里，一生的辛勤雕刻可以持续无数个纪元。表面的世界，有变化的光线、无尽的天空、变化的气候和侵蚀的风，代表了一种梦境，一种不真实的状态，在那里没有什么可以持续，因此没有什么意义。",
	"Among stone giants, mastery of an art ranks as the greatest virtue, and among all the arts, stone carving is held in highest regard. Most stone giants spend their lives in unending pursuit of the perfect artistic creation. Young stone giants practice tirelessly, hoping to prove themselves worthy of assisting the tribe's best carvers. A stone giant master carver might devote years to finding the best stone before beginning a great work. The best carvers are honored as the leaders and shamans of the tribe, and their hands are seen as holy-literally becoming the hands of Skoraeus Stonebones as they work.": "在石头巨人中，掌握一门艺术是最伟大的美德，而在所有的艺术中，石雕被赋予了最高的地位。大多数石雕巨人一生都在不停地追求完美的艺术创作。年轻的石巨人不知疲倦地练习，希望能证明自己有资格协助部落最好的雕刻师。一个石巨人雕刻大师可能会在开始一项伟大的工作之前，花数年时间寻找最好的石头。最好的雕刻师被尊称为部落的领袖和巫师，他们的手被视为神圣的--在他们工作的时候，简直就成了斯科雷欧斯-石骨的手。",
	"Of course, not all stone giants have the hands of a god. Those who show little skill in carving are considered pathetic and viewed with a combination of pity and contempt. To determine the ordning beneath the highest levels of artistry, stone giants compete in games of boulder hurling and catching. Their rock-throwing skills suit stone giants well when they have cause to defend their homes or attack enemies. But even where boulder tossing is concerned, artistry is fundamental to the effort. A stone giant hurling a boulder isn't only performing a feat of strength but is also striving to display consummate athleticism and grace.": "当然，并不是所有的石像巨人都有一双神的手。那些在雕刻方面没有什么技巧的人被认为是可悲的，并被视为怜悯和蔑视的结合。为了确定最高艺术水平之下的秩序，石巨人在投掷和捕捉巨石的游戏中竞争。当石巨人有理由保卫自己的家园或攻击敌人时，他们的投石技能很适合石巨人。但是，即使是投掷巨石，艺术性也是努力的根本。石头巨人投掷巨石不仅是一种力量上的壮举，而且还在努力展示完美的运动能力和优雅。",
	"Those who can't infuse artistry into every aspect of their lives fall to the lowest rungs of the ordning and are often pushed literally to the perimeter of stone giant society, to serve as guards on the tribe's most distant borders or as hunters that wander beyond those borders. As such, the stone giants that are first encountered by outsiders are almost always the least successful members of stone giant society and the poorest examples of the ideals stone giants aspire to. They are the brutes and boors cast out by a society of artists and philosophers.": "那些不能将艺术性注入生活的方方面面的人，就会沦落到秩序的最底层，常常被推到石巨人社会的边缘，在部落最遥远的边界上担任守卫，或作为猎人游荡在边界之外。因此，外人最先遇到的石巨人几乎都是石巨人社会中最不成功的成员，也是石巨人所追求的理想的最糟糕的例子。他们是被艺术家和哲学家的社会所抛弃的野蛮人和粗人。",
	"For a people that spend their lives mostly in darkness, stone giants have a nuanced appreciation of the effects of shadow and light. They design carvings to produce shadows in specific ways when a light source is placed in the proper location. Without both the light and the shadow, the carving is incomplete and can't be viewed in its true form. For example, a tale carving made with these special techniques tells one story when it's viewed in flat, dim light, but it reveals a second, much deeper tale with the addition of proper illumination.": "对于一个大部分时间在黑暗中度过的民族来说，石雕巨人对阴影和光线的影响有着细微的体会。他们设计的雕刻品在光源放置在适当的位置时，会产生特定的影子。如果没有光和影，雕刻就不完整，不能以其真实的形式来观看。例如，用这些特殊技术制作的故事雕刻，当它在平坦、昏暗的光线下观看时，讲述的是一个故事，但如果加上适当的照明，就会发现第二个更深的故事。",
	"Stone giants worship Skoraeus Stonebones as the Great Creator, second in skill to Annam, but master of the other deities in his father's absence. He appears in stone giant art in two ways: as a pair of hands, one holding a chisel and the other a hammer, and as the largest statue or relief carving of a stone giant in a tribe's caves. Typically, Skoraeus is depicted twice as tall as any other stone giant.": "石巨人崇拜斯科雷欧斯-石骨为伟大的造物主，他的技能仅次于安南，但在他父亲不在时，他是其他神祗的主人。他以两种方式出现在石巨人艺术中：一是作为一双手，一手持凿子，一手持锤子；二是作为部落洞穴中最大的石巨人雕像或浮雕。通常情况下，Skoraeus被描绘成比其他石巨人高一倍的样子。",
	"In the legends of the giants, Skoraeus often sits on the sidelines during the schemes and battles of his siblings. He acts as an observer, a confidant to the other gods, and a keeper of secrets that he must be forced or tricked into divulging.": "在巨人的传说中，斯科雷欧斯经常在他的兄弟姐妹们的计划和战斗中袖手旁观。他充当观察者，是其他神的知己，也是一个必须被迫或被骗才能泄露的秘密的守护者。",
	"In a classic tale, Memnor came to Skoraeus and whispered something in his ear. When Surtur demanded to know what Memnor had said, Skoraeus told his brother exactly what he had heard. Surtur brooded on that message, which was misleading when taken out of context, and eventually reacted rashly, but the consequences of his acts were seen as no fault of Skoraeus. If Surtur had instead asked Skoraeus for advice about Memnor's words, the legend would have ended differently.": "在一个经典的故事中，Memnor来到Skoraeus身边，在他耳边说了一些话。当Surtur要求知道Memnor说了什么时，Skoraeus准确地告诉了他哥哥他所听到的内容。苏尔图尔对这句话耿耿于怀，如果断章取义，就会产生误导，最终做出了轻率的反应，但他的行为的后果被认为不是斯科雷俄的错。如果Surtur没有就Memnor的话向Skoraeus征求意见，这个传说就会有不同的结局。",
	"Skoraeus is considered the most knowledgeable of the giant gods about magic, wards, banes, hidden treasures, and the secrets of the earth. Skoraeus gave the secret of smelting to Surtur. Skoraeus showed Thrym how to carve runes on his old weapons to imbue them with magic when Surtur refused to forge new ones for him. Skoraeus crafted spears for Hiatea so she could complete her ten tasks of valor. Skoraeus tapped with his hammer on the stone under the sea, so that Stronmaus could find the chain-tunnels that allowed him to pull the tarrasque down to the bed of the ocean where at last it would drown.": "斯科雷俄斯被认为是巨神中最了解魔法、护卫、禁令、隐藏的宝藏和地球的秘密的人。斯科雷欧把冶炼的秘密交给了苏尔图尔。当苏尔图尔拒绝为他锻造新的武器时，斯科雷欧向特里姆展示了如何在他的旧武器上雕刻符文，使其充满魔力。斯科雷欧为希亚提亚制作了长矛，使她能够完成她的十项英勇任务。斯科雷欧用他的锤子敲打着海底的石头，这样斯特朗莫斯就能找到链式隧道，让他把塔拉斯克拉到海床上，最后淹死。",
	"Although they are unsurpassed masters of tale carving, stone giants also employ mundane writing in their stone tableaux. Names, dates, and descriptions appear in their tales, often as part of an image (a character's arms or armor might incorporate runic letterforms, for example).": "虽然他们是无与伦比的故事雕刻大师，但石像巨人也在他们的石雕作品中使用世俗的文字。名字、日期和描述出现在他们的故事中，通常是作为图像的一部分（例如，一个人物的手臂或盔甲可能包含了符文字母）。",
	"Stone giants also make extensive use of the carved word through \"speaking stones.\" A speaking stone is an upright stone cylinder into which writing is carved in a descending spiral. When the cylinder is turned in one's hands (a feat impossible for any creature of human size and strength) or when it's rotated with its base placed in a cradle designed to balance it upright, the writing can be read as the cylinder goes around. The message wraps around the pillar like the threads of a screw, but in two alternating spirals. The first is read from top to bottom as the cylinder rotates; then the cylinder must be flipped over to reveal the second line of script, also read from top to bottom.": "石头巨人还通过 \"说话石 \"广泛使用雕刻的文字。说话石是一个直立的石柱，上面以螺旋形下降的方式刻着文字。当人们用手转动圆柱体时（这对任何人类体型和力量的生物来说都是不可能完成的壮举），或者当它的底座被放在一个旨在平衡它直立的摇篮中旋转时，圆柱体转动时可以读到文字。信息像螺丝钉的螺纹一样缠绕在柱子上，但有两个交替的螺旋线。当圆柱体旋转时，第一行文字从上到下阅读；然后圆柱体必须翻转过来，以显示第二行文字，同样从上到下阅读。",
	"Speaking stones are sized to match the length of the message they carry, so there is no blank space on a stone. A cylinder that turns out to be too long or too thick, so that the message ends before the entire surface of the stone is used, is considered poor artistry. Tradition and honor demand that it be crushed into gravel and a new speaking stone begun.": "说话石的大小与它们所承载的信息的长度一致，所以石头上没有空白。如果一个圆柱体太长或太厚，以至于信息在整个石头表面被使用之前就结束了，那就被认为是糟糕的艺术。传统和荣誉要求将其碾碎成砾石，并开始新的发言石。",
	"Newcomers who know only about the stone giants' focus on artistry might think them to be a peaceful and reasonable people. Among their own kind, they tend to be so. But outsiders, particularly non-giants of any sort, are unwelcome in the stone giants' caverns, and trespassers aren't treated politely.": "只知道石巨人专注于艺术的新人可能会认为他们是一个和平和讲道理的民族。在他们的同类中，他们往往是如此。但是外人，尤其是任何种类的非巨人，在石巨人的洞穴中都是不受欢迎的，而且闯入者也不会被礼貌对待。",
	"A creature's first sign that it has intruded into stone giant territory might be a boulder, thrown seemingly from nowhere and exploding into shards against a nearby rock. Those who know anything about stone giants understand that this wasn't a miss; it was a measured warning, and the next stone won't land so harmlessly.": "一个生物闯入石巨人领地的第一个迹象可能是一块巨石，它似乎是从哪里扔出来的，在附近的岩石上炸成碎片。那些对石巨人有所了解的人明白，这不是一次失手；这是一个有分寸的警告，下一块石头不会如此无害地落地。",
	"It's possible for travelers to negotiate with stone giants for safe passage through their territory, if someone in the group speaks Giant and the giants are offered a tribute Beautiful and large furs, exotic food, or art objects are suitable tributes; money is a weak inducement for all but the lowest of stone giants. If offered such enticements, one or two giants might come forward to negotiate while others remain at rock-throwing range.": "如果旅行者中有人会说巨人语，并向巨人提供贡品，那么他们就有可能与石巨人谈判，以便安全通过他们的领地；大毛皮、异国食物或艺术品都是合适的贡品；除了最低等的石巨人，金钱是一种微弱的诱惑。如果得到这样的诱惑，一两个巨人可能会上前谈判，而其他巨人则保持在投掷石头的范围内。",
	"To unfamiliar eyes, stone giants encountered on the fringes of their territory look and behave like primitives. First, personal adornment has little value in the ordning of stone giants, so their clothing tends to be simple and practical. Second, these giants are the least accomplished members of the clan. They are good at ambushing and throwing rocks, but they aren't leaders or even typical examples of their kind.": "在不熟悉的人眼里，在其领地边缘遇到的石巨人看起来和行为都像原始人。首先，个人装饰在石巨人的生活中没有什么价值，所以他们的衣服往往是简单而实用的。其次，这些巨人是氏族中最没有成就的成员。他们擅长伏击和投掷石块，但他们不是领导者，甚至不是同类的典型例子。",
	"Even if the giants accept the offered tribute as permission  to enter their territory, they might demand a higher price to pass through it. Usually this \"gift\" is a service of some kind-a task the giants would rather not do or that they're unable to perform, such as chasing kobolds out of a narrow cave or retrieving something from deep within a lake. (Stone giants are poor swimmers; they dislike entering water at all unless they can easily walk across the bottom.)": "即使巨人接受所提供的贡品作为进入其领地的许可，他们也可能要求更高的价格来通过它。通常这种 \"礼物 \"是某种服务--一种巨人们不愿做或无法完成的任务，比如把哥布林赶出一个狭窄的洞穴，或从湖的深处取回一些东西。 (石巨人的游泳能力很差；他们根本不喜欢进入水里，除非他们能轻易走过水底。)",
	"Stone giants rarely keep pets. They sometimes cultivate colonies of giant bats at the edges of their territory, both for a food source and as a warning system against intruders. They also don't mind sharing their caves or warrens with cave bears, fire beetles, and other beasts that mean them no harm. They keep their other subterranean neighbors at arm's length. Purple worms are their greatest bane, because a hungry worm chews through everything it encounters, including the giants' finest carvings and sculptures. Xorns are among the few creatures that are appreciated by stone giants; their passage through the earth causes no damage, and their alien modes of thought make them interesting to talk with.": "石巨人很少养宠物。他们有时会在自己领地的边缘培养巨型蝙蝠群，既是为了获得食物来源，也是对入侵者的一种警告系统。他们也不介意与洞熊、火甲虫和其他对他们无害的野兽分享他们的洞穴或巢穴。它们与其他地下邻居保持一定距离。紫色蠕虫是它们最大的祸害，因为饥饿的蠕虫会咬碎它所遇到的一切，包括巨人最好的雕刻品和雕像。Xorns是为数不多的被石巨人欣赏的生物之一；它们穿过地球不会造成任何损害，而且它们的异类思维模式使它们的谈话很有趣。",
	"Stone giants see well in darkness, and the caves and grottoes where they live are kept dark most of the time. They don't prefer to use illumination for any purpose that's not related to creating or displaying art.": "石巨人在黑暗中看得很清楚，他们居住的洞穴和石窟大部分时间都保持黑暗。他们不喜欢将照明用于任何与创造或展示艺术无关的目的。",
	"Most of a giant's waking hours are taken up with meeting its responsibilities, whether that is a low-ranking pursuit or an artistic one. A tribe's chieftain or another leader such as a shaman determines when the tribe's guards and hunters are on or off duty. Other giants align their sleeping and waking schedules with stone giants higher in the ordning from whom they seek to learn.": "一个巨人的大部分清醒时间都被满足其责任所占用，无论那是低级别的追求还是艺术性的追求。一个部落的首领或其他领导人，如萨满，决定了部落的警卫和猎人何时上岗或下班。其他巨人则将他们的睡眠和觉醒时间与他们想要学习的更高等级的石像巨人一致。",
	"Masters of the arts can ask much of lower-ranking students, including waking early to be sure the master has food upon rising, or staying awake while the master sleeps to create something the master will need (or will judge) upon waking. For one reason or another, about three quarters of a tribe's members are awake at any given time.": "艺术大师可以对低级别的学生提出很多要求，包括早起以确保大师起床后有食物，或在大师睡觉时保持清醒，以创造大师醒来后需要（或会判断）的东西。由于这样或那样的原因，一个部落的成员中约有四分之三在任何时候都是清醒的。",
	"When outside their settlements, stone giants travel almost exclusively in darkness or-when they dare to visit the surface world-at night, the better to avoid the glaring dreams and visions that would assail them during daylight. A stone giant that visits the surface for too long or is forced out from underground risks becoming lost in the realm of dreams, living ever after as a twisted version of its former self that the giants call a dreamwalker (see chapter 3 for more information on this creature).": "当离开他们的定居点时，石巨人几乎只在黑暗中旅行，或者--当他们敢于访问地表世界时--在夜间旅行，以便更好地避免在白天袭击他们的刺眼的梦境和幻觉。如果石巨人在地表停留时间过长，或者被迫从地下出来，就有可能迷失在梦境中，从此过着扭曲的生活，巨人们称之为梦游者（关于这种生物的更多信息，见第三章）。",
	"When a stone giant reaches the end of its tremendously long life, it joins the {@i Linjenstein} (\"ancestors of stone\"). The term refers both to the giants' forebears and to the chamber inside each stone giant settlement where they \"reside.\"": "当一个石巨人达到其巨大的生命终点时，它就加入了（%0%）（\"石之祖先\"）。这个词既指巨人的祖先，也指每个石巨人聚居地内他们 \"居住 \"的房间。",
	"A dead (or sometimes merely dying) stone giant is carried into the ancestors' chamber and leaned upright against the end of one of the rows of dead already there. The body gradually calcifies over many decades, until it becomes indistinguishable from an enormous stalagmite.": "一个死去的（有时仅仅是垂死的）石巨人被抬进祖先的房间，直立地靠在已经在那里的一排死者的末端。几十年来，尸体逐渐钙化，直到变得与巨大的石笋无异。",
	"Family members visit this tomb-chamber often to pay respects to their ancestors. Some of these visits, especially by elderly giants who know they will soon take their place there, last for weeks or even months.": "家庭成员经常访问这个墓室，向他们的祖先表示敬意。其中一些访问，特别是那些知道自己很快就会在那里占有一席之地的老年巨人，会持续数周，甚至数月。",
	"Storm giants, the most powerful and majestic of giant-kind, are also the most aloof and the least understood. Uvarjotens aren't just forces of nature; they are bound to nature, and are extensions of it, in mystical ways that humans find hard to comprehend.": "风暴巨人，是巨人中最强大、最威严的，也是最冷漠、最不被理解的。乌瓦乔坦不仅仅是自然界的力量；他们与自然界紧密相连，是自然界的延伸，以人类难以理解的神秘方式。",
	"Each storm giant knows its status in the ordning by the signals the universe sends them. Omens might be seen in the wheeling flight of a flock of birds, the patterns in sand left by a receding tide, the shapes of clouds, or any number of other natural phenomena. Storm giants that receive the greatest number of such messages generally rank highest, but the significance of individual signs can also affect one's status. On the rare occasions when storm giants meet, omens and signs accompany each individual, making it plain to all present who ranks where. Arguments about ranking within the ordning are rare, but all the giants in the group studiously examine every sign for evidence that one among them might be the greatest yet, since the revelation of that fact would herald Annam's return.": "每个风暴巨人都通过宇宙向他们发出的信号知道自己在秩序中的地位。预兆可以从鸟群的旋转飞行、潮水退去留下的沙子图案、云的形状或任何其他自然现象中看到。收到此类信息数量最多的风暴巨人通常排名最高，但个别迹象的意义也会影响一个人的地位。在风暴巨人聚会的罕见场合，预兆和征兆伴随着每个人，使所有在场的人都能清楚地看到谁的排名。关于军团内部排名的争论很罕见，但军团中的所有巨人都会认真研究每一个征兆，寻找他们中的一个人可能是最伟大的证据，因为这个事实的揭示将预示着安南的回归。",
	"Ever since Ostoria fell and Annam abandoned his children, no sole king or emperor has ruled over giantkind. According to legend, the arrival of such a leader will be presaged by signs and omens in all the elements of the world: the sky (air), the sea (water), the continents (earth), and the underworld (fire). All of these are realms of the storm giants, which maintain a constant watch for the all-important signs. In ages past, when giant dynasties reigned, the signs that accompanied the leader of them all were clear and unmistakable. In the crawl of centuries since the empire's collapse, the few signs manifested have been muddied, conflicting, and contentious.": "自从奥斯托利亚陷落，安南抛弃了他的孩子后，就没有一个唯一的国王或皇帝统治过巨人族。根据传说，这样一位领袖的到来将由世界上所有元素的迹象和预兆来预示：天空（空气）、海洋（水）、大陆（土）和冥界（火）。所有这些都是风暴巨人的领域，它们一直在观察所有重要的迹象。在过去的时代，当巨人王朝统治时，伴随着他们所有人的领袖的征兆是清晰无误的。在帝国崩溃后的几个世纪里，表现出来的少数征兆已经变得泥沙俱下、相互冲突和争论不休。",
	"For an obvious reason, every storm giant has a strong personal interest in how soon Annam's return comes to pass-they all want to live to see it. Some individuals gain a measure of immortality for themselves by merging with elemental forces. These storm giant quintessents are the most reclusive of their kind, lairing in remote and inhospitable sites surrounded by brutal winds and murderous weather (see chapter 3 for more information on these creatures).": "出于一个明显的原因，每个风暴巨人都对安南的回归多久实现有强烈的个人兴趣--他们都想活着看到它。有些人通过与元素力量的融合，为自己获得了一定程度的不朽。这些风暴巨人五人组是最隐蔽的一类，他们的巢穴在偏远和荒凉的地方，周围是残酷的风和杀人的天气（关于这些生物的更多信息，见第三章）。",
	"Without an emperor to serve as their political and spiritual head, the storm giants are adrift on an uncertain sea. Every possibility encapsulated in every sign is exhaustively examined. Debates over the meaning and validity of this or that omen are conducted across human kingdoms and spanning human lifetimes.": "没有一个皇帝作为他们的政治和精神领袖，风暴巨人在一个不确定的海上漂流。每个预兆所包含的每一种可能性都被详尽地研究。对这个或那个预兆的意义和有效性的争论跨越了人类的王国，跨越了人类的一生。",
	"Storm giants pay homage to Stronmaus, the eldest of Annam's children, who is also the most joyful and the most prone to laughter and enjoying fellowship with his siblings. That image of Stronmaus is in sharp contrast to how storm giants are perceived in the world: aloof and dour. Nonetheless, it is an accurate one.": "风暴巨人们向斯特朗莫斯致敬，他是安南最年长的孩子，也是最快乐的，最容易发出笑声和享受与兄弟姐妹们的友谊。斯特朗莫斯的这一形象与世界上对风暴巨人的看法形成了鲜明的对比：冷漠和沉闷。尽管如此，这也是一个准确的形象。",
	"In the giants' legends, Stronmaus is subject to gray moods and deep brooding that are just as intense as his moments of good humor. It is also true that storm giants aren't as humorless as popular notions paint them to be. They're quiet and reserved when they're by themselves, which is how they spend most of their time. But when they get together with others of their kind, they enjoy mirth, song, and drink as much as Stronmaus does. For the sake of their privacy and for the safety of smaller beings in the vicinity, these rare gatherings occur far from the presence of other creatures, thus perpetuating the giants' reputation for always being gloomy and grim.": "在巨人的传说中，斯特朗莫斯会有灰暗的情绪和深沉的忧郁，这与他的良好幽默时刻一样强烈。事实也是如此，风暴巨人并不像流行的观念所描述的那样没有幽默感。当他们自己一个人的时候，他们很安静和拘谨，这就是他们大部分时间的生活方式。但是，当他们与其他同类聚集在一起时，他们会像斯特朗莫斯一样享受欢笑、歌唱和饮酒。为了他们的隐私和附近小型生物的安全，这些罕见的聚会都是在远离其他生物的地方举行的，从而延续了巨人总是阴沉和严峻的名声。",
	"Explorers and adventurers can find opportunity in this situation, since the giants sometimes hire agents that they dispatch to investigate portents and to retrieve items the giants need for their oracles. It's dangerous work, for two reasons. The obvious one is that the task involves delving into Ostorian ruins that have been sealed for millennia. The less obvious one is that certain portents, if confirmed to be true, would indeed bring about the return of Annam, upending the giants' social order and initiating a new age. Some would welcome such a change; others would oppose it bitterly and do all they could to stop it, possibly resorting to all-out war.": "探险家和冒险家可以在这种情况下找到机会，因为巨人有时会雇佣他们派遣的特工去调查预兆，并取回巨人的神谕所需的物品。这是一项危险的工作，原因有二。显而易见的是，这项任务涉及到深入到被封存了几千年的奥斯托利亚遗迹。不太明显的原因是，某些预兆，如果被证实是真的，确实会带来安南的回归，颠覆巨人的社会秩序，开启一个新时代。一些人欢迎这样的变化；另一些人则会激烈反对，并尽其所能阻止它，可能会诉诸于全面战争。",
	"In the absence of both Annam and a worldly emperor, storm giants recognize no higher authority. Human, elf, and dwarf kings, liches, grand sorcerers and wizards—all might amass what they consider great power, but they have no influence over the storm giants. Any who try extending their reach in that direction are guaranteed to come to grief.": "在没有安南和世俗的皇帝的情况下，风暴巨人们不承认更高的权威。人类、精灵和矮人的国王、地衣、大巫师和巫师--都可能积累他们认为强大的力量，但他们对风暴巨人没有影响力。任何试图将他们的触角延伸到那个方向的人，都保证会受到伤害。",
	"But as long as the world leaves the storm giants alone, the giants will leave the world alone. They wish neither good nor ill on the realms of humanity; they simply don't give much thought to the matter, except on the rare occasions when humans crop up in a prophecy or are hinted at by an omen.": "但只要世界不打扰风暴巨人，巨人也会不打扰世界。他们对人类领域既不希望有好的，也不希望有坏的；他们只是不怎么考虑这个问题，除了在预言中出现人类或被预兆暗示的罕见情况下。",
	"When storm giants do interact with non-giants, those on the receiving end of their attention might question the notion that storm giants are \"good\" creatures. They respect the principle of the sanctity of life, but even the calmest of storm giants has a tremendous temper. When one is roused to anger, principle gives way to fury, and an offense committed by one person against a giant can bring furious retribution down on an entire community.": "当风暴巨兽与非巨兽互动时，那些受到它们关注的人可能会质疑风暴巨兽是 \"善良 \"生物的说法。他们尊重生命的神圣性原则，但即使是最平静的风暴巨人也有巨大的脾气。当一个人被激怒时，原则会让位于愤怒，一个人对巨人的冒犯会给整个社区带来愤怒的报应。",
	"A storm giant that destroys a town and kills innocents in a fit of rage is likely to regret it afterward and might offer payment to make amends, though a sack of gold is likely little comfort to those who lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods. It's always wise to tread softly, speak deferentially, and act respectfully in the presence of a giant, but this is especially true of storm giants.": "风暴巨人如果在愤怒中摧毁了一个城镇并杀害了无辜的人，事后很可能会后悔，并可能提供报酬以示补偿，尽管一袋金子对那些失去亲人、家园和生计的人来说可能没什么安慰。在巨人面前，轻声细语、恭恭敬敬地说话和行事总是明智的，但这对风暴巨人来说尤其如此。",
	"Once they're old enough to fend for themselves, storm giants spend most of their lives in contemplative isolation. Storm giants are capable of living wherever they choose, whether that's atop a mountain, in a glacial cave, or at the bottom of the deepest oceanic trench. One kind of location that invariably draws their attention is an elemental crossing-where the Material Plane and the Elemental Planes intersect and interact. Elemental influence pervades the architecture of storm giants and lends a tempestuous, unearthly quality to their homes.": "一旦他们长大到可以自食其力，风暴巨兽就会在沉思中度过他们大部分的生活。风暴巨人们能够住在他们选择的任何地方，无论是在山顶、冰川洞穴，还是在最深的海洋海沟底部。有一种地点总是能吸引他们的注意，那就是元素交叉点--物质界和元素界相交和互动的地方。元素的影响弥漫在风暴巨人的建筑中，使他们的家园呈现出动荡不安、超凡脱俗的品质。",
	"Storm giants use elemental crossings for their own transplanar wandering, especially into the Elemental Plane of Air and the Elemental Plane of Water. The frequent whirlpools, tornadoes, and lashing rainstorms that buffet the passages to those two planes help to safeguard the giants' homes and ensure their privacy.": "风暴巨人们利用元素交叉点进行他们自己的跨位面游荡，特别是进入空气元素位面和水元素位面。频繁的漩涡、龙卷风和猛烈的暴雨冲击着通往这两个位面的通道，有助于保护巨人们的家园，确保他们的隐私。",
	"Although a storm giant prefers to live outside the company of other giants, it isn't necessarily alone in its stronghold. Storm giants share their abodes with other creatures that are comfortable in the environment.": "虽然风暴巨人喜欢住在其他巨人的公司之外，但它在自己的据点里不一定是孤独的。风暴巨兽会与其他适应环境的生物分享它们的住所。",
	"A sea-dwelling storm giant, for example, might have a few merfolk, water weirds, or even a dragon turtle for companions, while a storm giant living on a mountain peak would extend a friendly hand to any pegasus that happened by, and might even welcome yetis into its home for a time if it believed they could be trusted. The giant's guests are expected to be respectful, to make themselves useful, and to provide interesting conversation or other entertainment when the giant feels like being sociable.": "例如，住在海里的风暴巨人可能会有一些人鱼、水鸟，甚至是龙龟作为伙伴，而住在山峰上的风暴巨人会向任何碰巧经过的飞马伸出友好之手，甚至可能欢迎雪人进入它的家一段时间，如果它认为他们可以信任的话。巨人的客人应该受到尊重，让自己变得有用，并在巨人觉得可以交际的时候提供有趣的谈话或其他娱乐。",
	"Gnolls remind the world of the horrors posed by the hordes of the Abyss, and the damage that even the briefest demonic incursion can inflict on the world.": "地精提醒世人，深渊的成群结队所带来的恐怖，以及即使是最短暂的恶魔入侵也会对世界造成的伤害。",
	"Whenever the demon lord Yeenoghu enters the Material Plane and goes on a rampage, he leaves a great trail of corpses in his wake. As the Lord of Savagery despoils the land, packs of hyenas trail him and feast on the victims until the dead flesh of Yeenoghu's prey leave them bloated and unable to move. Then, in a shower of blood and gristle, the hyenas transform into gnolls, which take up Yeenoghu's awful mission to kill and destroy anything in their path.": "每当恶魔领主耶诺古进入物质世界并大肆掠夺时，他都会留下一大堆尸体。当野蛮之王掠夺土地时，成群的鬣狗跟在他身后，在受害者身上大快朵颐，直到耶诺古的猎物的死肉让它们变得臃肿而无法动弹。然后，在一片血雨腥风中，鬣狗变成了地精，它们承担起耶诺古的可怕使命，杀死并摧毁挡在它们面前的一切。",
	"Gnolls embody the dark urges of Yeenoghu, the demon lord of slaughter and senseless destruction. Although Yeenoghu has been defeated and cast back into the Abyss more than once, gnolls continue to pursue his horrid, apocalyptic vision of a world transformed into a barren, empty ruin, with only the decaying corpses of the last few surviving gnolls left to mark its passing.": "地精体现了耶诺古的黑暗冲动，耶诺古是屠杀和无意义破坏的恶魔领主。尽管耶诺古不止一次被打败并被扔回深渊，但地精仍在继续追求他那可怕的、世界末日般的愿景，即把世界变成一片荒芜、空旷的废墟，只留下最后几个幸存的地精的腐烂尸体来纪念它的过去。",
	"As creatures that sprang up in the wake of a demon lord, gnolls are creatures of savage blood lust, incapable of understanding or acting on any other impulse. They are extensions of Yeenoghu's will. They pause only to devour what they have killed, and to fashion crude weapons and armor from their victims' corpses.": "作为在恶魔领主之后出现的生物，地精是野蛮的血欲生物，无法理解或按照任何其他冲动行事。它们是耶诺古意志的延伸。它们只停留在吞噬它们所杀的东西上，并用受害者的尸体制造粗糙的武器和盔甲。",
	"A gnoll war band exemplifies Yeenoghu's plans for the world. He wants to transform it into a vicious realm of endless fighting. When the last battle ends, Yeenoghu will enter the world, slay its last surviving champion, and preside over a wasteland of rotting corpses. To Yeenoghu, pure destruction is beauty.": "一个地精战队体现了耶诺古对这个世界的计划。他想把它变成一个无休止战斗的恶性境界。当最后一场战斗结束时，耶诺古将进入这个世界，杀死最后一个幸存的冠军，并主持一个腐烂尸体的荒地。对Yeenoghu来说，纯粹的破坏就是美。",
	"Yeenoghu imparts to the minds of his followers an unquenchable, supernatural hunger, both for violence and for the flesh of intelligent creatures. A gnoll feels a constant, gnawing demand for blood and destruction that abates only when it kills and eats intelligent creatures. Other prey might provide temporary sustenance, but it does nothing to quell Yeenoghu's hunger.": "Yeenoghu给他的追随者的头脑中灌输了一种无法抑制的超自然的饥饿感，既对暴力又对智慧生物的肉体。地精对血液和破坏有一种持续的、咬牙切齿的需求，这种需求只有在它杀死和吃掉智慧生物时才会减弱。其他的猎物可能会提供暂时的养料，但这并不能平息耶诺古的饥饿感。",
	"Gnolls wander the land continually in search of new victims, rarely sleeping and never settling down. Only a large-scale assault, such as the massacre of an entire village, can satisfy their desire even temporarily. A sated gnoll rests, knowing that it has pleased Yeenoghu. Its relief is short, no more than a few days, before the gnoll once again becomes a slave to its desires.": "地精在这片土地上不断游荡，寻找新的受害者，很少睡觉，也从不安顿下来。只有大规模的攻击，如屠杀整个村庄，才能满足它们的欲望，即使是暂时的。吃饱了的地精会休息，因为它知道自己已经取悦了耶诺古。它的解脱是短暂的，不超过几天，然后地精再次成为其欲望的奴隶。",
	"Strength, hunger, and fear are the three concepts that every gnoll extols. Strength allows a gnoll to overwhelm, kill, and devour a foe. Hunger motivates a gnoll to go forth and slay in Yeenoghu's name. Fear is a weapon used against enemies to make them easy prey. In concert, all three play a role in advancing Yeenoghu's goals.": "力量、饥饿和恐惧是每个地精都推崇的三个概念。力量使地精能够压倒、杀死和吞噬敌人。饥饿感促使地精以耶诺古的名义前行和杀戮。恐惧是用来对付敌人的武器，使他们成为轻松的猎物。三者结合起来，在推进耶诺古的目标方面发挥着作用。",
	"From a journal recovered from a slain cultist of Yeenoghu:": "从一个被杀的耶诺古邪教徒身上找到的日记。",
	"{@i Day 2:} The subject continues to growl and struggle, despite the removal of its arms and legs. I will let it starve for a few days to weaken its mental fortitude. If the gnoll does have some sort of tie to the Abyss, I must keep my focus on exploiting that link, even though the creature's mind might remain aware.": "{@i Day 2:}尽管它的胳膊和腿被切除了，但它仍然在咆哮和挣扎。我将让它饿上几天，以削弱它的精神毅力。如果这只地精确实与深渊有某种联系，我必须把注意力集中在利用这种联系上，即使这只生物的头脑可能仍有意识。",
	"{@i Day 6:} No appreciable loss of vigor.": "{@i Day 6:} 没有明显的活力损失。",
	"{@i Day 11:} Still no appreciable loss of vigor.": "{@i Day 11:} 仍然没有明显的活力损失。",
	"{@i Day 13:} Ritual must commence tomorrow despite subject's high level of mental activity.": "{@i Day 13:} 尽管主体的精神活动水平很高，但仪式必须在明天开始。",
	"{@i Day 14:} The ritual brought our minds together. I was assailed simultaneously by hunger and rage, as if some great force from beyond had reached out and commanded me only to kill and eat. Though it lasted only a short time, it was a terrifying feeling to my human mind, but in a way it was also comforting to feel myself a part of a much greater design. What I felt was not the hunger of one beast, but the hunger of all of them.": "{@i Day 14:}这个仪式把我们的思想带到一起。我同时受到饥饿和愤怒的袭击，仿佛某种来自外部的巨大力量伸出手来，命令我只能杀人和吃东西。虽然它只持续了很短的时间，但对我的人类思维来说，这是一种可怕的感觉，但在某种程度上，感觉自己是一个更伟大的设计的一部分，也是一种安慰。我感到的不是一只野兽的饥饿，而是所有野兽的饥饿。",
	"{@i Day 15:} Used the ritual to join our minds again. This time I realized where the hunger began. I was consumed by the infinite hunger and boundless rage of great Yeenoghu, and I knew it could never be sated. Yet I felt driven to feed my lord. I killed and devoured a goat while linked to the gnoll's mind. I had set aside a knife for the deed but killed it with my bare hands instead. The flesh was warm. I fed myself. I fed Yeenoghu.": "{@i Day 15:}使用了仪式，再次将我们的思想结合起来。这一次，我意识到饥饿的开始。我被伟大的耶诺古的无限饥饿和无边的愤怒所吞噬，我知道它永远不可能被满足。然而，我感到被驱使着去喂养我的主宰。我杀了一只山羊，并吞下了它，同时与地精的思想相连。我把刀放在一边，但却用我的双手杀死了它。羊肉是温暖的。我喂了自己。我喂了耶诺古。",
	"{@i Day 16:} Third use of ritual. As my connection to my lord deepens, I leave my old concerns behind. His hunger is all that matters. It is greater than me; it is greater than us all. It is His mark. He made us. He drives us. He eats what we eat. He kills what we kill. He will come if we eat well. He will come if we kill well. He will come if we eat well. He will come if we kill well. We will kill and He will eat, and we shall be He and He shall be we, never alone, never afraid, never hungry.": "{@i Day 16:} 仪式的第三次使用。随着我与我的主人的联系加深，我把以前的担忧抛在脑后。他的饥饿感是最重要的。它比我更伟大；它比我们所有人都伟大。这是他的标记。他创造了我们。他驱使我们。他吃我们所吃的。我们杀什么，他就杀什么。如果我们吃得好，他就会来。如果我们杀得好，他就会来。如果我们吃得好，他就会来。如果我们杀得好，他就会来。我们要杀，他要吃，我们要成为他，他要成为我们，永不孤独，永不恐惧，永不饥饿。",
	"Of all the demon lords, Yeenoghu is perhaps the most active on the Material Plane. He shows support to his followers by sending them omens in the form of visions, dreams, and signs. As such, gnolls instinctively look for such omens to guide their activities, and they find them in many places.": "在所有的恶魔领主中，耶诺古可能是在物质世界中最活跃的一个。他向他的追随者表示支持，以幻象、梦境和征兆的形式向他们发送预兆。因此，地精本能地寻找这种预兆来指导他们的活动，而且他们在许多地方都能找到。",
	"Among the signs that gnolls rely on are the blood trails and spatters left behind after making a meal of an intelligent humanoid. They attach significance to a number of other phenomena as well, including the sight of arrows in flight, the rush of the wind, and sounds of howling or cackling laughter that have no discernible source.": "在地精依赖的迹象中，包括在吃掉一个聪明的类人后留下的血迹和飞溅物。他们还重视其他一些现象，包括看到飞行中的箭、急促的风声，以及没有明显来源的嚎叫或咯咯的笑声。",
	"Few creatures aside from gnolls worship Yeenoghu, and those that do mimic gnolls in their actions and beliefs. Yeenoghu's cultists are folk who lack all hope and have descended into nihilism. One might have suffered a tremendous  personal loss, been banished from its home, or been the victim of a terrible betrayal. Whatever the reason, the would-be cultist is left isolated and abandoned, making it vulnerable to Yeenoghu's teachings.": "除了地精之外，很少有生物崇拜Yeenoghu，而那些模仿地精的行为和信仰的生物。Yeenoghu的崇拜者是那些缺乏所有希望并陷入虚无主义的人。他们可能遭受了巨大的个人损失，被放逐出家园，或成为可怕背叛的受害者。不管是什么原因，可能成为邪教者的人被孤立和遗弃，使其容易受到耶诺古的教诲。",
	"The creature's thoughts and dreams are plagued by visions sent by Yeenoghu. The promise of ultimate power, fueled by acts of brutality, tempt and torment it. Most folk ascribe these feelings to a fleeting bout of depression  or madness and are able to resist the call to violence, but a few cannot. For these rare individuals, the true lure of Yeenoghu's promises lies not in the power they offer, but in the deep sense of belonging they create.": "这个生物的思想和梦境被耶诺古发出的幻觉所困扰。终极力量的承诺，在残暴行为的刺激下，诱惑并折磨着它。大多数人把这些感觉归结为短暂的抑郁或疯狂，并能抵制暴力的召唤，但也有少数人不能。对于这些罕见的人来说，Yeenoghu的承诺的真正诱惑不在于它们提供的力量，而在于它们创造的深刻的归属感。",
	"Those that are swayed by this offer consider themselves gnolls in mind and deed, and soon set out to commit their first atrocities in Yeenoghu's name. Most of these cultists are almost as quickly killed by guards or other authorities. A few escape into the wilderness and continue to rampage on their own, perhaps eventually falling in league with a gnoll war band.": "那些被这一提议所动摇的人认为自己在思想和行为上都是地精，并很快以耶诺古的名义开始实施他们的第一次暴行。这些邪教徒中的大多数人几乎很快就被守卫或其他当局杀死。少数人逃进了荒野，继续自己横行霸道，也许最终会与地精的战队结成联盟。",
	"Gnolls might seem to throw themselves into battle mindlessly, driven only by fury and hunger, but they do possess a rudimentary form of cunning that is borne out by several tactics they use consistently.": "地精看起来似乎是无意识地投入战斗，只受愤怒和饥饿的驱使，但他们确实拥有一种基本的狡猾，这在他们一贯使用的几种战术中得到了证实。",
	"Gnolls seek only to kill, and as such prefer to deal with weak, easy targets.": "地精只寻求杀戮，因此更喜欢对付弱小、容易的目标。",
	"An enemy that can fight back is an enemy to save for later. Gnolls have no sense of honor, glory, or individual achievement. They care only for the raw number of creatures they can slay. In the face of a gnoll incursion, it is best for refugees to seek shelter in castles and other fortified positions. Gnolls avoid protracted battles if they can, much preferring to slaughter those that can't defend themselves.": "一个能够反击的敌人是要留待以后的敌人。地精没有荣誉感，没有荣耀，也没有个人成就。他们只关心他们能够杀死的生物的原始数量。面对地精的入侵，难民最好是在城堡和其他坚固的位置寻求庇护。如果可以的话，地精会避免长时间的战斗，他们更喜欢屠杀那些不能保护自己的人。",
	"Gnolls attack intelligent prey that is capable of resisting them only when the most powerful omens from Yeenoghu compel them to do so. They cooperate to gang up on each of the individuals in a group of explorers or adventurers, or if the prey is more numerous they rush forward in waves. The creatures will crawl over their own dead to climb a castle's walls and kill all within it. A commonly held belief is that a fortress besieged by gnolls needs ten arrows for each one to keep the creatures from scaling the walls.": "地精只有在来自Yeenoghu的最强大的预兆迫使它们这样做时，才会攻击有能力抵抗它们的智能猎物。它们会合作，对一群探险家或冒险家中的每一个人进行群殴，如果猎物数量较多，它们会一波一波地冲上去。这些生物会爬过自己的尸体，爬上城堡的墙壁，杀死里面的所有人。一个普遍的看法是，被地精围困的堡垒，每一个人需要十支箭才能阻止这些生物爬上城墙。",
	"Gnolls never set up permanent camps, though they might linger for a few days at the site of a particularly great slaughter as they devour the corpses of both their victims and the gnolls killed in battle. During this time, the hyenas that follow a pack of gnolls feast until they become bloated, then burst open to spawn more gnolls. In this manner, gnolls replenish their ranks before wandering off in ragged bands to continue their rampage.": "地精从不建立永久的营地，不过它们可能会在特别大的屠杀现场逗留几天，因为它们会吞噬受害者和阵亡地精的尸体。在这期间，跟随一群地精的鬣狗会大吃一顿，直到它们变得臃肿，然后爆裂开来，催生出更多的地精。通过这种方式，地精补充了自己的队伍，然后成群结队地游荡，继续它们的横行霸道。",
	"Almost every gnoll carries a bow scavenged from a past victim. Gnolls use ranged attacks mainly to prevent their prey from fleeing, rather than softening up their targets with an initial barrage of arrows before an assault. A target wounded by a bow shot becomes easy prey for any gnolls near it. Some particularly clever gnolls have been known to use burning arrows to spark fires, cutting off their prey's escape routes and driving victims into their jaws.": "几乎每个地精都带着一张从过去的受害者身上搜刮来的弓。地精使用远程攻击主要是为了防止他们的猎物逃跑，而不是在攻击前先用箭矢软化他们的目标。被弓箭射伤的目标很容易成为附近任何地精的猎物。一些特别聪明的地精已经知道用燃烧的箭来引发大火，切断猎物的逃跑路线，把受害者赶进他们的下颚。",
	"A band of gnolls lives in a state of eternal war with everything it encounters, aside from fellow worshipers of Yeenoghu. To keep from being detected between major raids, the gnolls move through the wilderness with as much stealth as they can marshal. They never leave survivors in any group they set upon, and will pursue a fleeing enemy for days to prevent it from getting to a town or a city and raising an alarm.": "一群地精生活在与所遇到的一切事物的永恒战争中，除了耶诺古的崇拜者之外。为了避免在重大突袭之间被发现，地精们在荒野中移动时尽可能地隐蔽。他们从不在任何群体中留下生还者，并且会追赶逃亡的敌人好几天，以防止其进入城镇或城市并发出警报。",
	"If the area they hunt in becomes too well-defended, the gnolls relocate in search of easier prey. Large tracts along the fringe of civilization might be devastated before the wider world becomes aware of a gnoll threat.": "如果他们狩猎的地区变得防卫过严，地精就会迁移到其他地方去寻找更容易的猎物。在更广泛的世界意识到地精的威胁之前，文明边缘的大片区域可能已经被破坏。",
	"An excerpt from {@i One Hundred Years of War,} a famous manual of dwarven battle tactics:": "节选自{@i One Hundred Years of War,}一本著名的矮人战斗战术手册。",
	"Gnolls remain a threat across all seasons. Happily, our redoubts are too fortified for their tastes, but caravans, foraging expeditions, and patrols must deal with them.": "地精在所有季节都是一种威胁。令人高兴的是，我们的堡垒对他们来说太坚固了，但商队、觅食探险队和巡逻队必须对付他们。",
	"Gnolls take care to move quietly when they are on the hunt for prey. The events that presage their presence are easy to misinterpret as the results of other threats. A scout might go missing, a caravan fail to arrive on time, or a village be left deserted. Several kinds of creatures, such as orcs and goblins, can cause such events, but the evidence that gnolls leave of their involvement is unmistakable. Their enemies aren't merely killed, they are dismembered and devoured. The loot that other marauders would scoop up is left where it falls, of no use to a creature that requires only flesh to feed its urges.": "地精在猎取猎物时，会注意悄悄地移动。预示它们出现的事件很容易被误解为其他威胁的结果。一个侦察兵可能失踪，一个商队不能按时到达，或者一个村庄被遗弃。有几种生物，如兽人和地精，可以造成这种事件，但地精留下的参与证据是明确无误的。他们的敌人不仅仅是被杀死，而是被肢解和吞噬。其他掠夺者会舀起的战利品被留在原地，对一个只需要肉体来满足其欲望的生物来说毫无用处。",
	"If you suspect that gnolls are encroaching on dwarven territory, send reliable spies to human settlements in the region, while pulling back as many of our folk as you can manage. Instruct the spies to pass along updates each day, preferably by messenger bird. Do not tell the spies of your suspicions. Invent a story, such as the search for an outlaw or some other deception.": "如果你怀疑地精侵占了矮人的领地，请向该地区的人类定居点派出可靠的间谍，同时尽可能多地拉回我们的民夫。指示间谍每天传递最新信息，最好是通过信使鸟来传递。不要把你的怀疑告诉探子们。编造一个故事，比如说寻找一个逃犯或其他的欺骗行为。",
	"If a spy fails to report, you must strike quickly. Send your fastest warriors and strongest spellcasters to the spy's location. If the gnolls have struck a settlement, they will rest for up to a week, bloated on their kills. In this state, they are their most vulnerable. Surround the place in silence, and advance as one to catch them in a vise. Let none survive. A single gnoll can, over time, create a new war band.": "如果一个间谍没有报告，你必须迅速出击。派出你最快的战士和最强的法术师到间谍的所在地。如果地精袭击了一个定居点，他们会休息一个星期，在杀戮中膨胀。在这种状态下，它们是最脆弱的。悄悄地包围这个地方，然后像一个人一样前进，用钳子抓住它们。不要让任何一个活下来。随着时间的推移，一个地精可以创造一个新的战队。",
	"Some may argue for an approach that doesn't rely on the loss of human life to see it succeed. I would gladly suggest one if such existed. Your best strategy is to defend our halls and let the humans serve as bait. Moradin knows they multiply quickly enough that their losses will soon be recouped.": "有些人可能会主张采用一种不依赖人命损失的方法，以确保其成功。如果有这样的方法，我很乐意建议。你们最好的策略是保卫我们的大厅，让人类充当诱饵。莫拉丁知道他们繁殖的速度足够快，他们的损失很快就会被收回来。",
	"A cautious and skilled gang can follow in the tracks of a gnoll war band, keeping hidden and waiting for the creatures to move on after ravaging a village or a town. The gnolls leave the town's gold and gems and other durable goods battered and gnawed, but still intact, though they invariably ruin delicate or flammable objects in their fits of destruction.": "一个谨慎而熟练的团伙可以跟随地精战队的脚步，保持隐蔽，等待这些生物在蹂躏一个村庄或一个城镇后继续前进。地精会把镇上的黄金、宝石和其他耐用品咬得稀巴烂，但仍然完好无损，不过它们在破坏过程中总是会毁坏精致或易燃的物品。",
	"Gnolls do possess a basic understanding of the value of weapons and armor, so one might decide to hold onto an object seen as useful. In this way, a gnoll might come to possess a magic item, though it might not know exactly how to use it. Gnolls regard objects of \"treasure\" only in terms of their ability to cause harm or preserve a gnoll's life. Everything else is fit only for destruction.": "地精确实对武器和盔甲的价值有基本的了解，所以它可能会决定保留一个被认为有用的物品。通过这种方式，地精可能会拥有一件魔法物品，尽管它可能并不确切知道如何使用它。地精对 \"宝物 \"的看法只限于它们能够造成伤害或保护地精的生命。其他的东西都只适合于毁灭。",
	"The language of gnolls, such as it is, consists of whines, cackles, and howls mixed with gestures and expressions. Gnolls use it to communicate only basic concepts, such as an alert about approaching prey or a call to their allies to join the fray. When gnolls fight among themselves, they rarely bother with threats or words before leaping at each other's throats.": "地精的语言，比如说，由呜呜声、咯咯声和嚎叫声与手势和表情混合组成。地精只用它来交流基本概念，如提醒猎物的接近，或召唤他们的盟友加入战局。当地精之间发生争斗时，它们很少在跳入对方的喉咙之前用威胁或言语来打扰。",
	"When gnoll leaders must share complex concepts with each other, they use a broken form of Abyssal gifted to them by Yeenoghu. The gnoll language lacks a script or written form, though elite gnolls can use their limited knowledge of Abyssal to leave messages. In most cases, though, a gnoll war band has little use for written notes or signs. Gnolls simply wander, attack, kill, and feed. Anything more sophisticated is beyond the band's concern.": "当地精领导人必须与对方分享复杂的概念时，他们使用耶诺古赠予他们的一种残缺的深渊语。地精语言缺乏文字或书面形式，尽管精英地精可以使用他们有限的深渊语知识来留下信息。不过，在大多数情况下，地精战队对书面笔记或标志没有什么用处。地精们只是游荡、攻击、杀戮和觅食。任何更复杂的事情都不在乐队的考虑范围之内。",
	"When you're roleplaying a cultist or gnoll of Yeenoghu, the following tables contain possible inspiration. They suggest characteristics that the NPC might possess.": "当你在扮演一个Yeenoghu的邪教徒或地精时，以下表格包含了可能的灵感。他们建议NPC可能拥有的特征。",

	"My arrogance causes me to overlook opportunities.": "我的傲慢导致我忽视了机会。",
	"As befits creatures with a language that is little more than whines, growls, and shrieks, most gnolls lack a name and would have little use for one.

The same applies to Yeenoghu's blessed followers among humans, orcs, and other races.": "与那些语言不外乎是抱怨、咆哮和尖叫的生物一样，大多数地精没有名字，也没有什么用。有权势的地精，通常是獠牙、狼群领主和风人，直接从耶诺古那里获得名字。这也适用于人类、兽人和其他种族中耶诺古的受祝福追随者。",

	"A gnoll war band is likely to contain a variety of gnolls and other creatures, and no two of these groups have the same composition.": "一个地精战队很可能包含各种地精和其他生物，而且没有两个战队的组成是相同的。",
	"The gnolls that make up the rank and file have different attributes and thus different roles in the war band's assaults. Augmenting the warriors that comprise the bulk of the force are the hunters, specialists in sneaking and attacking at range, and the flesh gnawers, which rely on natural savagery rather than weapons to tear apart their foes. A pack of hyenas is always part of the band, and sometimes these beasts are as numerous as the gnolls themselves. A war band that has been through hard times might contain a number of gnoll witherlings, while one that enjoys Yeenoghu's favor might be led by a flind-the scarcest and strongest of all gnolls. It's also possible, though quite rare, for a war band to include cultists-other humanoids that have dedicated themselves to Yeenoghu and attached themselves to the war band to prove their loyalty.": "组成官兵的地精有不同的属性，因此在战队的攻击中也有不同的作用。猎手和啃食者是组成战队的主要力量，猎手擅长潜行和远程攻击，而啃食者则依靠天然的野性而非武器来撕碎敌人。一群鬣狗总是乐队的一部分，有时这些野兽的数量和地精本身一样多。一个经历过艰难岁月的战队可能包含一些地精的小弟，而一个得到耶诺古青睐的战队可能由一只风信子领导--所有地精中最稀缺、最强壮的人。也有可能，虽然很罕见，一个战队中会有崇拜者--其他致力于Yeenoghu并加入战队以证明其忠诚的人形生物。",
	"Each of these elements of a war band is further described below. Statistics for gnoll flesh gnawers, gnoll hunters, gnoll witherlings, and flinds appear in chapter 3 of this book.": "下面将进一步介绍战团的每一个要素。关于地精啃肉者、地精猎人、地精凋零者和弗林德的统计资料见本书第三章。",
	"Most war bands are led by pack lords. These champions of Yeenoghu curry their lord's favor with living sacrifices. They mark their hides with bloody runes, which sometimes grant supernatural power conferred by Yeenoghu himself. Pack lords favor big, heavy weapons, such as glaives and axes.": "大多数战队都是由族群领主领导的。这些耶诺古的拥护者以活人为祭品来讨好他们的领主。他们在自己的皮毛上刻上血腥的符文，这些符文有时会赋予耶诺古自己所赋予的超自然的力量。领主们喜欢大型的重型武器，如青刀和斧头。",
	"Fangs of Yeenoghu are gifted with the power to spawn more gnolls. They anoint the remains of their foes using bizarre rituals. A hyena that feeds on such a corpse spawns a gnoll, while other humanoids who join in the feast become cultists of Yeenoghu. Fangs use their claws in battle, the better to imbue their victims with the magic needed to spawn more gnolls.": "Yeenoghu的獠牙被赋予了催生更多地精的力量。他们用怪异的仪式将敌人的遗体涂抹在身上。以这种尸体为食的鬣狗会生出地精，而其他加入盛宴的人类则成为耶诺古的崇拜者。獠牙在战斗中使用他们的爪子，以更好地给他们的受害者注入催生更多地精所需的魔法。",
	"Common gnolls comprise the bulk of a war band. They fight mainly with spears fashioned from wood and bone. While they lack any particular blessing of Yeenoghu, their ferocity makes them formidable enemies.": "普通地精构成了战队的主体。他们主要用木头和骨头制成的长矛作战。虽然他们缺乏耶诺古的任何特殊祝福，但他们的凶猛使他们成为可怕的敌人。",
	"When a war band is on the move, the hunters travel in a wide arc around the perimeter of the force. Hunters are more adept than other gnolls at sneaking and moving through an area undetected, which makes them useful for reconnaissance. Sometimes a team of hunters is used to silently pick off sentries on patrol before they can raise an alarm, which makes the upcoming onslaught by the rest of the war band even more lethal. Another function that hunters perform is to trail along behind a war band, making quick work of wounded gnolls and those who can't keep up the pace.": "当一个战队在行动时，猎手们会在部队的周围划出一个宽阔的弧线。猎人比其他地精更善于潜行，在一个区域内移动而不被发现，这使他们在侦察方面很有用。有时，一队猎人会在巡逻的哨兵发出警报之前，悄悄地把他们挑走，这使得战队其他成员即将发起的攻击更加致命。猎人的另一个功能是跟在战队后面，快速处理受伤的地精和那些跟不上步伐的地精。",
	"All gnolls are ruthless and brutal, but the flesh gnawers in a war band use their quickness and agility to augment their savagery. At the start of a raid, flesh gnawers lurk around the edges of the gnoll forces, hoping to jump on enemies that become isolated. When a flesh gnawer springs into action, its blades and teeth turn it into a whirling dealer of death, able to dash from one target to the next as though it had been shot from a bow.": "所有的地精都是无情和残忍的，但战队中的肉食者利用他们的快速和敏捷来增强他们的野蛮性。在突袭开始时，啃食者潜伏在地精部队的边缘，希望能扑向那些被孤立的敌人。当啃肉者开始行动时，它的刀片和牙齿将它变成一个旋转的死亡交易者，能够从一个目标冲向另一个目标，就像从弓上射下来一样。",
	"A war band might go for weeks without coming across the sort of prey it craves. Gnolls can eat wild animals for sustenance, but only the flesh of intelligent humanoids can calm the endless hunger bestowed upon them by Yeenoghu.": "一支战队可能会连续数周没有遇到它渴望的那种猎物。地精可以吃野生动物来维持生计，但只有聪明的人类的肉体才能平息耶诺古赋予他们的无尽饥饿感。",
	"When a war band grows desperate for food, its members turn on each other. Those who succumb to the violence are devoured, but their service to the war band doesn't end at that point. The survivors preserve the bones of their fallen comrades, so that a pack lord or a flind can perform a ritual to Yeenoghu to turn them into loyal, undead followers known as witherlings.": "当一个战团对食物越来越绝望时，其成员就会互相残杀。那些屈服于暴力的人被吞噬，但他们对战团的服务并没有因此而结束。幸存者保留了他们死去的战友的骨头，这样狼群的领主或弗林德就可以向耶诺古举行仪式，把他们变成忠诚的、不死的追随者，也就是枯萎者。",
	"Even after death, gnoll witherlings serve the war band much as their comrades do. Although not as formidable in battle as warriors or hunters, they are just as relentless.": "即使在死后，地精的凋零者也会像他们的战友那样为战团服务。虽然在战斗中不像战士或猎人那样可怕，但他们也同样无情。",
	"A flind is an exceptionally large and strong gnoll. No war band contains more than one flind, and such a creature is always the leader of its band. A flind wields a weapon that carries Yeenoghu's blessing: a magical flail that saps the body and the mind of any foe that feels its touch.": "弗林德是一种特别大、特别强壮的地精。没有一个战队包含一个以上的弗林德，而且这样的生物总是它的战队的领导者。弗林德挥舞着一种带有耶诺古祝福的武器：一种神奇的连枷，它能使任何感受到它的敌人的身体和心灵都被抽走。",
	"Because flinds are so rare, other gnolls see them as Yeenoghu's special messengers, gifted with a keen eye for omens and an ear for Yeenoghu's whispers. Each day, a flind consults the signs around it and determines the war band's direction.": "由于风铃是如此稀少，其他地精将它们视为耶诺古的特殊信使，它们拥有敏锐的预兆之眼和听从耶诺古耳语的天赋。每天，风铃都会查看周围的迹象，并确定战队的方向。",
	"During a battle, a gnoll that delivers the death blow to a flind claims its flail and, in a burst of abyssal energy, is touched by Yeenoghu and turns into a flind itself. The death or disappearance of a flind for any other reason causes a war band to descend into brutal infighting. Sometimes a new leader emerges from the pack after putting down its rivals; more often, the band fragments and the survivors go their separate ways.": "在一场战斗中，一个给风人以致命一击的地精，在深渊能量的爆发中，被耶诺古触动，变成了风人本身。猎犬的死亡或因任何其他原因而消失，都会使一个战队陷入残酷的内讧。有时，在打倒对手后，一个新的领袖会从族群中出现；更多的时候，族群会四分五裂，幸存者各奔东西。",
	"Rarely, a war band includes orcs, humans, or other humanoids that have sworn loyalty to Yeenoghu. The gnolls treat these cultists as they would other gnolls, refraining from killing them so long as they join in the slaughter when the band finds prey.": "罕见的是，战队中包括兽人、人类或其他对耶诺古宣誓效忠的人形生物。地精对待这些崇拜者就像对待其他地精一样，只要他们在战队找到猎物时加入屠杀，就不会杀他们。",
	"Almost all cultists are brutish individuals touched by insanity, one step above the hyenas that trail behind the war band's path. They aren't gnolls, and thus don't receive their inspiration directly from Yeenoghu. Yet exceptions do occur. If an individual of great intelligence and great ability heeds Yeenoghu's call, the Lord of Savagery might elevate it to the leadership of its band. Such champions are rare, and a band led by a cultist is capable of feats that are beyond a group of gnolls-accomplishments that combine the gnolls' savagery with a humanlike level of intelligence and planning.": "几乎所有的邪教徒都是被精神错乱触动的野蛮人，比跟在战团道路后面的土狼高一等。他们不是地精，因此不能直接从耶诺古那里获得灵感。然而，也有例外情况。如果一个拥有巨大智慧和能力的人听从耶诺古的召唤，野蛮人之主可能会将其提升为战队的领导。这样的冠军是罕见的，而由邪教徒领导的队伍有能力做出超越一群地精的壮举--将地精的野蛮与人类的智慧和计划水平相结合。",
	"Gnolls wage war against any creatures they meet, except for those that have dedicated themselves to Yeenoghu and those that act in accordance with his wishes. The Lord of Savagery stains the souls of his followers and kindred creatures in such a way that they and his gnolls recognize one another on sight and don't immediately leap into battle. Thus, a war band might include or be accompanied by other beings of evil.": "地精对他们遇到的任何生物发动战争，除了那些献身于耶诺古和按照他的意愿行事的人。野蛮之主将他的追随者和同类生物的灵魂染色，使他们和他的地精一见如故，不会立即跃入战斗。因此，一个战队可能包括或伴随着其他邪恶的生命。",
	"A fang of Yeenoghu is sometimes gifted with the cosmic insight needed to summon forth mindless demons. When Yeenoghu deigns to allow it, a war band might find itself augmented by some of his favorite demons, such as barlguras, dretches, hezrous, or manes. The Lord of Savagery also has a special affinity for maw demons, which share his insatiable hunger.": "Yeenoghu的方士有时会被赋予召唤无意识恶魔所需的宇宙洞察力。当耶诺古允许的时候，一个战队可能会发现自己被他最喜欢的一些恶魔所增强，比如巴尔古拉（barlguras）、拉塔斯（dretches）、赫兹鲁斯（hezrous）或鬃毛。野蛮之王对大嘴恶魔也有一种特殊的亲和力，这些恶魔与他一样贪得无厌。",
	"Demonic hyenas known as shoosuvas are dispatched by Yeenoghu to aid his most exalted champions. Among the gnolls, the appearance of a shoosuva is a reward for recent triumphs and a harbinger of great victories and much feasting to come. A shoosuva protects the war band's most powerful members and serves as a companion to the strongest fang of Yeenoghu in the group.": "被称为shoosuvas的恶魔土狼是由Yeenoghu派遣来帮助他最崇高的冠军。在地精中，shoosuva的出现是对最近胜利的奖励，也预示着伟大的胜利和许多盛宴即将到来。咻咻娃保护着战团中最强大的成员，并作为战团中最强大的耶诺古之獠的伙伴。",
	"For more information on maw demons and shoosuvas, see chapter 3 of this book.": "欲了解更多关于口妖和shosuvas的信息，请参见本书第三章。",
	"Ghoul packs emerge from graveyards and dungeons to trail in the wake of a war band, feasting on the remains of its victims and sometimes eventually merging with the group. Although ghouls typically revere Orcus, their endless hunger can prompt them to turn to Yeenoghu.": "食尸鬼群从墓地和地牢中出现，跟随战队的脚步，以受害者的遗体为食，有时最终与战队合并。虽然食尸鬼通常崇尚奥库斯，但他们无尽的饥饿感会促使他们转向耶诺古。",
	"This simple declaration of Yeenoghu's power was devised by a small cult to the demon lord discovered deep in the forest. A group of woodcutters, facing starvation, turned to cannibalism to survive and ultimately fell under Yeenoghu's sway. Gnolls sing a similar chant in their language while they seek out prey.": "这个关于Yeenoghu力量的简单声明是由森林深处发现的一个对恶魔领主的小崇拜者设计的。一群樵夫在面临饥饿的情况下，为了生存而转向吃人，最终落入耶诺古的控制之下。地精在寻找猎物时用自己的语言唱出了类似的颂歌。",

	"Large packs of hyenas follow gnoll war bands. For their part, the gnolls largely ignore these animals. They tend to gather around fangs in battle, eager to partake of Yeenoghu's blessing and its horrid transformation.": "大群的鬣狗跟着地精的战队。就他们而言，地精们基本上不理会这些动物。他们倾向于在战斗中聚集在獠牙周围，渴望分享耶诺古的祝福和它可怕的转变。",
	"Brought forth during Yeenoghu's ancient incursions into the world, leucrottas are bigger, smarter, and faster than gnolls. When one joins a war band, it doesn't strive to lead the group (which would cause unneeded conflict) but rather to serve and protect its leader. A leucrotta's dedication to Yeenoghu is as fervent as that of any gnoll, and its main goal is always to advance the cause of the Lord of Savagery over its own.": "Leucrottas是在Yeenoghu的古代入侵世界时产生的，它比地精更大、更聪明、更快。当它加入一个战队时，它并不努力领导这个团体（这将导致不必要的冲突），而是服务和保护它的领袖。利古塔对耶诺古的奉献与任何地精一样狂热，它的主要目标始终是推动野蛮之主的事业，而不是自己的事业。",
	"For more information on leucrottas, see chapter 3 of this book.": "关于白喉的更多信息，见本书第三章。",
	"Of all the creatures encountered by gnolls, trolls are the most likely to join them simply because the gnolls' way of life appeals to them. As ravenous creatures with incredible toughness, trolls fit well into the loose scheme of a gnoll war band.": "在地精遇到的所有生物中，巨魔是最有可能加入他们的，只因为地精的生活方式对他们有吸引力。作为具有难以置信的韧性的贪婪的生物，巨魔很适合地精战队的松散计划。",
	"To include a gnoll war band in your campaign, or if you need to generate one quickly for use in an encounter, use the tables in this section. Roll on each one in turn to determine the war band's name, components, and unique traits.": "要在你的战役中加入一个地精战队，或者如果你需要快速生成一个用于遭遇战，请使用本节中的表格。依次对每个表格进行滚动，以确定战队的名称、组成部分和独特的特征。",
	"The War Band Name table is set up to create two word names. Some war bands become infamous enough to earn an epithet from their enemies, but only the most powerful flinds and pack lords bother to name the groups they lead.": "战队名称表的设置是为了创造两个字的名字。一些战队变得臭名昭著，足以从他们的敌人那里获得一个外号，但只有最强大的弗林德和群主才会为他们领导的团体命名。",
	"The War Band Composition table determines how many gnolls and hyenas the band contains. The War Band Leadership table indicates the war band's commander (if it has one) and gives a modifier to apply to the composition results: for a band led by a flind, double  all the results, and for a band that lacks a leader, halve them.": "战队组成表决定了该战队包含多少地精和鬣狗。战队领导力表指出了战队的指挥官（如果它有的话），并给出了适用于组成结果的修正值：对于一个由弗林德领导的战队，所有的结果都是双倍的，而对于一个缺乏领导的战队，则是减半。",
	"Roll once on the Special Creatures table to see which special creature is part of the war band and in what numbers. The Shared Physical Trait and Notable Behavior or Tactics tables add some distinctive flavor to the war band. Finally, the Demonic Influence table adds an abyssal tinge to the group: owing to the gnolls' supernatural link with the Abyss, their advance toward a community might be heralded by strange effects that afflict the area or the people in it a day or so before they strike the settlement.": "在特殊生物表上掷一次骰子，看看哪种特殊生物是战队的一部分，数量是多少。共同的身体特征和显著的行为或战术表为这个战队增添了一些独特的味道。最后，\"恶魔影响 \"表为这支队伍添加了深渊的色彩：由于地精与深渊的超自然联系，他们在向一个社区前进时，可能会在袭击定居点的前一天左右，受到影响该地区或其中的人们的奇怪影响。",

	"Maglubiyet is truly the Conquering God. He stiffens the spines of cowardly goblins. He rouses bugbears from their lazy slumber. He sets the thunderous step of hobgoblin legions. Maglubiyet takes three races and turns them into one people.": "马格鲁比耶特是真正的征服之神。他使懦弱的妖精们的脊梁骨僵硬。他把虫族从懒散的沉睡中唤醒。他让妖精军团迈出了雷鸣般的步伐。马格卢比耶特将三个种族变成一个民族。",
	"In bygone times the goblinoids were distinct from one another, with separate faiths and different customs. Then Maglubiyet came and conquered all who stood before him, mortals and deities alike. Gods and heroes who wouldn't bend to his will were broken and discarded. He put his foot on the neck of mighty Khurgorbaeyag, bound the will of intractable Hruggek, and forced sadistic Nomog-Geaya to fall in line. What the goblins, the bugbears, and the hobgoblins were before their gods bowed to Maglubiyet no longer matters. Now they are, first of all, followers of Maglubiyet.": "在过去的时代，妖精们彼此不同，有着不同的信仰和不同的习俗。然后马格卢比耶特来了，征服了所有站在他面前的人，包括凡人和神灵。那些不愿屈服于他的意志的神灵和英雄都被打碎和抛弃了。他把脚踩在强大的Khurgorbaeyag的脖子上，束缚了难缠的Hruggek的意志，并迫使虐待狂Nomog-Geaya服从命令。妖精、虫兽和妖精在他们的神灵向马格鲁比耶特鞠躬之前是什么样子已经不重要了。现在，他们首先是马格鲁比耶特的追随者。",
	"On the surface, goblins, bugbears, and hobgoblins are as different as halflings, dwarves, and elves. Each race has its own tendencies, outlook, culture, and gods. But Maglubiyet's hand joins them together, just as he made all their other gods parts within a greater whole. When one kind of goblinoid encounters another kind, the two groups don't see one another as strangers or foes. Instead they know that by the fact of their meeting alone, Maglubiyet has commanded them to come together. They know the time has come to form a host.": "从表面上看，地精、虫熊和霍布林就像半身人、矮人和精灵一样不同。每个种族都有自己的倾向、前景、文化和神灵。但马格卢比耶特的手将它们连接在一起，就像他使他们所有其他的神成为一个更大的整体中的一部分。当一种地精遇到另一种地精时，这两个群体并不把对方视为陌生人或敌人。相反，他们知道，仅凭他们相遇的事实，马格鲁比耶特就命令他们走到一起。他们知道，形成宿主的时机已经到来。",
	"Goblins occupy an uneasy place in a dangerous world, and they react by lashing out at any creatures they believe they can bully. Cunning in battle and cruel in victory, goblins are fawning and servile in defeat, just as in their own society lower castes must scrape before those of greater status and as goblin tribes bow before other goblinoids.": "妖精在一个危险的世界中占据了一个不安的位置，他们的反应是对任何他们认为可以欺负的生物进行抨击。妖精在战斗中很狡猾，在胜利中很残酷，但在失败中却很媚俗和奴性，就像在他们自己的社会中，低等种姓的人必须在地位更高的人面前卑躬屈膝，就像妖精部落在其他妖精面前鞠躬一样。",
	"Goblins know they are a weak, unsophisticated race that can be easily dominated by bigger, smarter, more organized, more ferocious, or more magical creatures. Their god was conquered by Maglubiyet, after all, and now when the Mighty One calls for it, even their souls are forfeit. It is this realization that drives them to dominate other creatures whenever they can-for goblins, life is short.": "地精知道他们是一个弱小、不成熟的种族，很容易被更大、更聪明、更有组织、更凶猛或更有魔力的生物所支配。他们的神毕竟被马格鲁比耶征服了，现在当全能者号召的时候，连他们的灵魂都被没收了。正是这种认识驱使他们随时支配其他生物--对于地精来说，生命是短暂的。",
	"Goblins seek to trap and enslave any creatures they encounter, but they flee from opposition that seems too daunting.": "妖精试图困住并奴役他们遇到的任何生物，但他们会逃离那些似乎太过艰巨的反对。",
	"For miles around their lair, they employ pit traps, snares, and nets to catch the unwary, and when their hunting patrols encounter other beings, they always look for ways to capture their foes instead of killing them. Goblins that run up against the fringes of a society first test its defenses by stealing objects, and if these crimes go unpunished, they begin stealing people.": "在他们的巢穴周围数英里的范围内，他们采用坑道陷阱、陷阱和网来捕捉不小心的人，当他们的狩猎巡逻队遇到其他生物时，他们总是寻找方法来捕获他们的敌人而不是杀死他们。遇到社会边缘的哥布林，首先通过偷窃物品来测试其防御能力，如果这些罪行没有得到惩罚，他们就开始偷人。",
	"Enslaved creatures receive the worst treatment the goblins can dish out while still getting decent performance out of the slaves. But humanoids and monsters that are especially capable or that provide unusual services find themselves treated like favored (though occasionally  abused) pets.": "被奴役的生物会受到地精所能提供的最糟糕的待遇，同时还能从奴隶身上得到体面的表现。但那些特别有能力或提供不寻常服务的类人和怪物会发现自己被当作受宠的（尽管偶尔会被虐待）宠物。",
	"Virtually any kind of creature that can be browbeaten into service might be found with a goblin tribe, but rats and wolves are nearly always present. Both have lived in concert with goblins for at least as long as humans have worked with dogs and horses, and in goblin society those two animals serve similar purposes.": "几乎任何一种可以被敲打着服役的生物都可以在地精部落中找到，但老鼠和狼几乎总是存在。这两种动物与地精共同生活的时间至少与人类与狗和马合作的时间一样长，而且在地精社会中，这两种动物的用途也很相似。",
	"A goblin tribe is organized in a four-tiered caste system made up of lashers, hunters, gatherers, and pariahs. The status of every family in the tribe is based on its importance to the tribe's survival. Families that belong to the higher-ranking castes keep their status by not sharing their knowledge and skills with other families, while those in the lower castes have little hope of escaping their plight.": "妖精部落的组织形式为四级种姓制度，由拉什、猎手、采集者和贱民组成。部落中每个家庭的地位是基于其对部落生存的重要性。属于高级种姓的家庭通过不与其他家庭分享他们的知识和技能来保持他们的地位，而那些处于低级种姓的家庭几乎没有希望摆脱他们的困境。",
	"Outsiders who don't understand the goblins' social system are sometimes surprised by how different castes interact with them. A single human warrior might frighten away a dozen gatherers, only to be shocked when two hunters viciously attack. A captured group of invaders might hang in a net while dozens of goblins pass by and pay them no heed until a group of gatherers shows up.": "不了解地精社会体系的外人有时会对不同种姓与他们的互动感到惊讶。一个人类战士可能会吓跑十几个采集者，但当两个猎人恶狠狠地攻击时，他们会感到震惊。一群被俘的入侵者可能会被挂在网里，而几十个地精经过时却对他们不闻不问，直到一群采集者的出现。",
	"The closest thing a goblin tribe has to nobility is the caste of lashers-families of goblins trained in the ways of battle, and also possessed of key skills such as strategy, trap-building, beast taming, mining, smelting, forging, and religion. If the tribe has any spellcasters, this caste includes them. Lashers follow the lead of the tribe's boss, and enforce their will on other goblins with whips.": "一个地精部落最接近贵族的东西是 \"刺客 \"种姓--由接受过战斗训练的地精组成，同时也拥有一些关键的技能，如战略、建造陷阱、驯服野兽、采矿、冶炼、锻造和宗教。如果部落里有任何施法者，这个种姓就包括他们。鞭挞者跟随部落老大的脚步，用鞭子将他们的意志强加给其他地精。",
	"The families of goblins that are skilled in the use of weapons but not privy to any other special knowledge have the second highest status in the tribe. Hunters are often the best wolf riders and know the most about the territory farthest from the tribe's lair. These individuals hunt game in peaceful times, and in combat they serve as scouts, foot soldiers, and cavalry.": "擅长使用武器但不懂其他特殊知识的妖精家族在部落中的地位次之。猎人通常是最好的狼骑手，对离部落巢穴最远的领地最了解。这些人在和平时期打猎，在战斗中他们充当侦察兵、步兵和骑兵。",
	"Families in the second lowest caste are responsible for getting food from the surrounding area, taking what's naturally available or stealing whatever they can. Gatherers also do the little amount of farming of which goblins are capable and are charged with checking traps for captured people or beasts. Gatherers aren't usually armed with weapons more deadly than a sling or a knife, but they frequently carry nets, caltrops, lassos, and nooses on poles for controlling captured creatures. These goblins cook for the tribe, and in times of war they are also responsible for making poison.": "处于第二低种姓的家庭负责从周围地区获取食物，取用自然界可得到的东西或偷取任何他们能得到的东西。采集者也做一些地精有能力做的少量农活，并负责检查捕获人或野兽的陷阱。采集者通常没有比吊索或小刀更致命的武器，但他们经常带着网、卡尔特罗、拉索和套在杆子上的绳索，用于控制捕获的生物。这些妖精为部落做饭，在战争时期他们也负责制作毒药。",
	"Gatherers, and the pariahs beneath them, greatly fear for their lives in battle, believing that the lashers and the hunters have special knowledge of how to survive. It is the members of the lower castes that give goblins their reputation for cowardice.": "采集者和他们下面的贱民，在战斗中非常担心自己的生命，认为拉什和猎人有如何生存的特殊知识。正是这些低等种姓的成员让地精有了懦弱的名声。",
	"Some goblin families are the lowest of the low, composed of the most dimwitted, least educated, and weakest goblins. They get the worst jobs: mucking out animal pens, cleaning up after other goblins, and doing any hard labor such as digging mines. If the goblin tribe has slaves to do some of this work, the pariah families enjoy the opportunity to supervise and dominate such creatures, which have no status at all.": "有些妖精家庭是最底层的，由最愚钝、受教育程度最低、最弱小的妖精组成。他们得到的是最差的工作：给动物围栏打扫卫生，为其他妖精打扫卫生，以及做任何艰苦的劳动，如挖矿。如果地精部落有奴隶来做其中的一些工作，贱民家庭就会享受监督和支配这种根本没有地位的生物的机会。",
	"Goblins once had many gods, but the only one who survived Maglubiyet's ascendancy is cruel Khurgorbaeyag, known as the Overseer. Khurgorbaeyag drives his worshipers to be the masters of others. Only by wielding the whip can they hope to escape its lash. Khurgorbaeyag sometimes makes his presence or his desires known through wrathful signs and magical blessings: the crack of a whip without a visible source, chains or ropes that move of their own accord, or a glowing cage that appears to trap foes or those who displease him. Worshipers of Khurgorbaeyag are sometimes overtaken by sudden onsets of depression, which they take as a sign that they have somehow displeased their god. When they rouse themselves from this despondency, they take up the master's whip with renewed zeal and seek out more creatures upon which they can wield it.": "哥布林曾经有很多神，但唯一在马格鲁比耶特的统治下幸存下来的是残忍的胡戈尔巴耶格，被称为监督者。Khurgorbaeyag驱使他的崇拜者成为他人的主人。只有挥舞着鞭子，他们才有希望摆脱鞭子的鞭打。胡戈尔巴亚格有时会通过愤怒的征兆和神奇的祝福来表明他的存在或他的愿望：没有明显来源的鞭子的响声，自动移动的链条或绳索，或一个发光的笼子，似乎是为了困住敌人或那些让他不高兴的人。Khurgorbaeyag的崇拜者有时会被突然发作的抑郁症所笼罩，他们认为这表明他们在某种程度上让他们的神不高兴。当他们从这种沮丧中振作起来时，就会以新的热情拿起主人的鞭子，寻找更多可以挥舞鞭子的生物。",
	"Khurgorbaeyag's holy symbol is a yellow-and-red striped whip made of leather. This mark of his authority is used by its wielder against goblins of a lower caste as well as on slaves and enemies. The knowledge of how to make such a whip is enough to elevate a goblin to the master caste of lashers. Often the secret is guarded by one family in a tribe, which enjoys prestige and influence because it controls the supply of whips.": "胡戈尔巴耶格的神圣标志是一条由皮革制成的黄红相间的条纹鞭子。他的这一权威标志被持鞭者用来对付低等种姓的妖精，以及奴隶和敌人。掌握了如何制作这种鞭子的知识，就足以使一个地精提升到鞭子的主人地位。这个秘密通常由一个部落中的一个家庭来守护，这个家庭因为控制着鞭子的供应而享有威望和影响力。",
	"Goblins love symbols of authority, and thus the tribe's boss often has such trappings wherever he or she goes. Such a symbol can take a typical form, perhaps a crown or a throne, but also can be a more distinctive objects like a high-backed wolf saddle or colorful boots. The castes in a tribe also adopt symbols to indicate membership or kinship, but the symbols used are rarely the same between different tribes and often make little sense to other creatures. Some possible status symbols are given in the Status Symbols table. A caste or a boss might display more than one of these items.": "哥布林喜欢权威的象征，因此部落的老大无论走到哪里都会有这样的饰物。这种象征可以采取典型的形式，也许是一顶王冠或一个宝座，但也可以是更有特色的物品，如高背的狼鞍或彩色的靴子。部落中的种姓也采用符号来表示成员身份或亲属关系，但不同部落之间使用的符号很少相同，而且对其他生物来说往往没有什么意义。一些可能的地位符号在地位符号表中给出。一个种姓或一个老板可能会显示这些项目中的一个以上。",

	"Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.": "妖精中的任何类型的施法者都是罕见的。妖精通常缺乏学习和练习巫术所需的智慧和耐心，即使获得了必要的训练和知识，他们的表现也很差。巫师在他们中间比许多其他种族要少，而且Khurgorbaeyag似乎不喜欢与他的信徒分享他的神力。尽管许多地精愿意提供任何东西来获得术士的能力，但授予这种力量的赞助人知道地精不太可能坚持其在任何交易中的立场。",
	"Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a couple of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is \"booyahg,\" and the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners.": "即使一个地精生来就有成为施法者的能力，但继承传统所需的知识和天赋很少能持续超过几代。因为他们对魔法的经验太少，地精对魔法的形式不加区分。对他们来说，所有的魔法都是 \"booyahg\"，而且这个词是他们给任何魔法从业者的名字的一部分。",

	"Goblins pattern the rule of their tribes after the whip-cracking rule of their god, Khurgorbaeyag, and thus each group has one leader that exerts autocratic control. But as with many tyrannies, the passing of a leader often results in a chaotic transition to the next. Sometimes a goblin boss has the foresight to declare a successor, often a child or other family member the boss has been able to trust. But such a declaration doesn't always prevent a mad scramble for influence and allies, or secret backstabbing and outright fights over the title. Most often, the victor in such a struggle comes from another family of the lasher caste, and any allies of the previous boss count themselves lucky if their only punishment is demotion to the pariah caste.": "妖精们以他们的神Khurgorbaeyag的皮鞭统治为模式来统治他们的部落，因此每个团体都有一个领袖来实施专制控制。但就像许多暴政一样，一个领袖的逝去往往会导致向下一个领袖的混乱过渡。有时，一个地精老板有先见之明，会宣布一个继任者，通常是老板一直能够信任的孩子或其他家庭成员。但这样的声明并不总是能阻止对影响力和盟友的疯狂争夺，或秘密的背信弃义和对头衔的公然争斗。大多数情况下，这种斗争的胜利者来自另一个鞭笞者种姓的家庭，如果前任老板的任何盟友受到的唯一惩罚是被降级为贱民种姓，那么他们算幸运的。",
	"Sometimes another creature assumes control of a goblin tribe, by killing or subjugating the current boss and cowing most of the rest of the tribe. If the creature is dimwitted, like a troll or ogre, the lower-class goblins give it obeisance, but before long the upper-class goblins begin to think that whoever can bend the ear of the new leader can act as the real boss. If the creature brushes aside such manipulation, the tribe falls into line behind the new tyrant-better to abide the new rule than conspire against it and be called out as a traitor.": "有时，另一种生物通过杀死或征服当前的老大，并使部落中的大多数人胆怯，从而控制了一个地精部落。如果这个生物是愚蠢的，比如巨魔或食人魔，低级别的地精会对它俯首称臣，但不久之后，高级别的地精开始认为，谁能屈服于新领袖的耳朵，谁就能充当真正的老大。如果这个生物对这种操纵不屑一顾，部落就会在新的暴君身后排成一排--与其阴谋反对新规则，不如遵守新规则，被称为叛徒。",
	"A nilbog (\"goblin\" spelled backward) is a goblin possessed by the spirit of a mischievous prankster god.

Their need for iron and other metals sometimes puts them in conflict with other races, but just as often, goblins get what they need by claiming mines abandoned by other races and scratching away at veins thought to be played out.": "妖精部落居住在被遮蔽的山谷、阴暗的森林，以及世界表面下的洞穴和隧道中。他们是有能力的矿工和手工业者，他们寻求定居在可以获得原材料来制造武器和盔甲的地方。他们对铁和其他金属的需求有时会使他们与其他种族发生冲突，但同样经常的是，地精通过索取被其他种族遗弃的矿井和抓取被认为已经被开发的矿脉来获得他们需要的东西。",
	"When goblins expand a mine, the tunnels they dig are narrow and warren-like. Goblins live both within these tunnels and on the surface around the outside of the area. They guard the territory around the mine for miles, sending out patrols of hunters equipped with war horns and using wolves as watchdogs to alert them to intruders.": "当地精扩张矿井时，它们所挖的隧道是狭窄的，像战壕一样。妖精既生活在这些隧道内，也生活在地表上，围绕着该地区的外部。他们守卫着矿区周围数英里的领地，派出配备战角的猎人巡逻，并利用狼作为看门狗来提醒他们注意入侵者。",
	"The territory around a goblin lair has several hallmarks, most of which aren't readily apparent. Packs of wolves allied with the goblins serve as effective perimeter guards, without giving away the fact that a tribe of goblins lives nearby. Hunters take up guard posts in tall trees and atop high rocky outcrops from where they can view the terrain while staying unseen. Any obvious path through the territory (a valley, a clear trail, or a river) might be turned into an ambush point where a force of goblins can capture intruders. Such places might also be set with net traps, snare traps, or hidden pit traps that gatherers regularly check for new slaves. The area also includes burial grounds for each caste, always placed far from the lair.": "妖精巢穴周围的领地有几个特征，其中大部分并不明显。与地精结盟的狼群可以作为有效的外围守卫，而不会泄露附近有地精部落的事实。猎人在高大的树上和高大的岩石上设立岗哨，在那里他们可以观察到地形，同时保持不被发现。任何穿过领地的明显路径（山谷、清晰的小路或河流）都可能被变成一个伏击点，在那里，妖精部队可以捕获入侵者。这样的地方也可能设置了网状陷阱、陷阱或隐藏的坑道陷阱，采集者定期检查新的奴隶。该地区还包括每个种姓的埋葬地，总是放在离巢穴很远的地方。",
	"Anyone who is skilled or fortunate enough to pass through the territory of a goblin tribe without being detected is likely to come upon some tell-tale signs of habitation-complete with goblins at work and other goblins standing guard over them.": "任何有技能或幸运地通过地精部落的领地而不被发现的人，都有可能遇到一些明显的居住迹象--完整的地精在工作，其他地精在站岗。",
	"If the lair was built around a mine, the tribe's smelting furnace and forge will be in the vicinity. A lair inside a forest likely has piles of cut timber (and suitable tools) nearby. In appropriate terrain, the goblins might set aside some land for simple farming (raising mushrooms and gourds). If the lair doesn't have enough space underground for everyone, gatherers and pariahs are housed in huts on the surface, near the areas where they work.": "如果巢穴建在矿山周围，那么部落的冶炼炉和锻造厂就会在附近。在森林里的巢穴，附近可能有成堆的切割木材（和合适的工具）。在适当的地形上，地精们可能会留出一些土地进行简单的耕作（养蘑菇和葫芦）。如果巢穴在地下没有足够的空间容纳所有人，采集者和贱民就会被安置在地面上的小屋，靠近他们工作的地方。",
	"The ideal place for a goblin lair is an abandoned mine that features two or three large chambers and a few smaller ones, with tunnels connecting them. In such a place, the tribe can protect its most valuable assets while providing for a modicum of comfort. Most lairs have only a single entrance, but the goblins might build a number of escape tunnels that emerge far from that location.": "妖精巢穴的理想场所是一个废弃的矿井，它有两到三个大房间和一些小房间，并有隧道连接它们。在这样的地方，部落可以保护其最有价值的资产，同时提供适度的舒适。大多数巢穴只有一个入口，但地精们可能会建造一些远离该地点的逃生隧道。",
	"Close inside the entrance, if a suitable area exists, the goblins set up a den for their wolves. The animals come and go as they please, unless the goblins have use for them. Any tunnel in the lair, whether dug by goblins or not, is likely to be trapped, typically in a way that not only injures the enemy but also collapses the passage.": "在入口处附近，如果有合适的地方，地精们就会为他们的狼建立一个洞穴。这些动物想来就来，想走就走，除非地精们对它们有利用价值。巢穴中的任何通道，无论是否由地精挖掘，都有可能被困住，典型的方式是不仅使敌人受伤，还能使通道坍塌。",
	"Open spaces inside a lair are useful for a number of reasons, and the goblins will hollow out chambers for their use if need be. Slaves and tamed monsters are best kept in large areas with limited access, making them easier to guard. The tribe's boss lays claim to a space that's treated as a throne room of sorts. The lashers and hunters of a tribe occupy other caverns and chambers, enjoying the comfort and safety of underground living as a reward for their status and their value to the group.": "巢穴内的开放空间因多种原因而有用，如果需要，地精们会挖出一些房间供他们使用。奴隶和被驯服的怪物最好被关在通道有限的大区域，这样更容易看守。部落的老大对一个空间提出要求，被当作某种意义上的王室。部落中的闪电人和猎人占据着其他洞穴和房间，享受着地下生活的舒适和安全，作为对他们地位和对团体价值的奖励。",
	"Bugbears feature in the nightmare tales of many races—great, hairy beasts that creep through the shadows as quiet as cats. If you walk alone in the woods, a bugbear will reach out of the bushes and strangle you. If you stray too far from the house at night, bugbears will scoop you up to devour you in their den. If a bugbear cuts off your head, your soul stays trapped inside, and the bugbears use your head to magically command all whom you once knew.": "在许多种族的噩梦故事中都有虫熊的身影--巨大的、多毛的野兽，像猫一样安静地在阴影中爬行。如果你独自走在树林里，一只虫熊会从灌木丛中伸出手来勒死你。如果你在晚上离家太远，虫熊会把你抓起来，在它们的巢穴里吞噬你。如果虫熊砍掉你的头，你的灵魂就会被困在里面，虫熊就会用你的头来神奇地指挥所有你曾经认识的人。",
	"Lurid tales such as these have flowered from the seeds of truth. Bugbears do rely on stealth and strength to attack, preferring to operate at night. They do take the heads of enemy leaders, but they are no more likely to eat people indiscriminately than humans are. Bugbears aren't likely to attack lone travelers or wandering children unless they clearly have something to gain by doing so. From the viewpoint of the rest of the world, their aggression and savagery are thankfully offset by their rarity and lethargy.": "诸如此类的荒诞故事都是从真理的种子中开花结果的。虫熊确实依靠隐蔽性和力量进行攻击，更喜欢在夜间行动。它们的确会取走敌人首领的头颅，但它们并不比人类更可能不分青红皂白地吃人。虫熊不可能攻击孤独的旅行者或流浪的孩子，除非他们明显有什么好处。从世界其他地区的角度来看，它们的侵略性和野蛮性幸好被它们的稀有性和慵懒性所抵消。",
	"When they're not in battle, bugbears spend much of their time resting or dozing. They don't engage in crafting or agriculture to any great extent, or otherwise produce anything of value. They bully weaker creatures into doing their bidding, so they can take it easy. When a superior force tries to intimidate bugbears into service, they will try to escape rather than perform the work or confront the foe. Even when subsumed into a goblinoid host and drawn into war, bugbears must often be roused from naps and bribed to get them to do their duties.": "当他们不在战斗中时，虫族大部分时间都在休息或打瞌睡。他们不从事任何程度的手工业或农业，也不生产任何有价值的东西。它们欺负弱小的生物，让它们听命于自己，这样它们就可以轻松地生活了。当优势力量试图恐吓虫族为其服务时，它们会试图逃跑，而不是进行工作或与敌人对抗。即使被归入地精宿主并被卷入战争，虫族也必须经常从睡梦中被唤醒并被收买，才能让它们履行职责。",
	"This indolence offers no clue to how vicious the creatures  are. Bugbears are capable of bouts of incredible ferocity, using their muscular bodies to exact swift and ruthless violence. At their core, bugbears are ambush predators accustomed to long periods of inactivity broken by short bursts of murderous energy. Ferocious though they may be, bugbears aren't built for extended periods of exertion.": "这种懒散的态度并不能说明这些生物有多么凶残。虫熊能够爆发出令人难以置信的凶猛，利用它们肌肉发达的身体来实施迅速而无情的暴力。就其核心而言，虫熊是一种伏击性的掠食者，习惯于通过短暂的杀戮能量来打破长时间的不活动。尽管它们很凶猛，但虫熊并不是为长时间的消耗而生的。",
	"Since bugbears aren't a particularly fecund race, their overall population is small and spread over a wide area. Bugbears live in family groups that operate much like gangs. The individuals in a group typically number fewer than a dozen, consisting of siblings and their mates as well as a handful of offspring and an elder or two. A gang lives in and around a small enclosure, often a natural cave or an old bear den, and it might have supplementary dens elsewhere in its territory that it uses temporarily when it goes on long forays for food.": "由于虫族不是一个特别能繁殖的种族，他们的总人口不多，而且分布在很广的地区。虫熊生活在家庭团体中，其运作方式很像帮派。一个群体中的个体数量通常少于十几个，由兄弟姐妹和他们的配偶以及少数后代和一两个长者组成。一个群体生活在一个小的围墙内和周围，通常是一个天然的洞穴或一个老熊的巢穴，它可能在其领地的其他地方有辅助的巢穴，当它去长途跋涉寻找食物时，会临时使用。",
	"In good times, a bugbear gang is tight-knit, and its members cooperate well when hunting or bullying other creatures. But when the fortunes of a gang turn sour, the individuals become selfish, and might sabotage one another to remove opposition or exile weaker or unpopular members to keep the rest of the gang strong. Fortunately for the race as a whole, even young and elderly bugbears have the ability to survive alone in the wild, and the cast-off members of a gang might eventually catch on with a different group.": "在顺境中，一个虫族帮派是紧密的，其成员在狩猎或欺负其他生物时合作良好。但是，当一个帮派的命运变坏时，个人就会变得自私自利，可能会互相破坏，以消除反对意见，或流放较弱或不受欢迎的成员，以保持帮派其他成员的强大。对整个种族来说，幸运的是，即使是年轻和年老的虫族也有能力在野外独自生存，一个团伙中被抛弃的成员最终可能会加入另一个团体。",
	"Left to their own devices, bugbears have little more impact on the world than wolf packs. They subsist by crafting simple tools and hunting and gathering food, and gangs sometimes come together peacefully to exchange members and goods between them.": "如果任其发展，虫族对世界的影响比狼群大得多。他们通过制作简单的工具、狩猎和采集食物来维持生计，团伙有时会和平地走到一起，在他们之间交换成员和货物。",
	"Bugbears worship two deities who are brothers, Hruggek and Grankhul. Hruggek is the fearsome elder sibling, possessed of legendary might and prowess in battle. Bugbears believe their strength and bravery come from him. Cunning Grankhul is the younger one, and in the stories bugbears tell, he gifted them with stealth but in return he sapped their vigor, so that bugbears sleep in his stead while he remains eternally alert and awake.": "虫族崇拜两个神灵，他们是兄弟，Hruggek和Grankhul。Hruggek是可怕的兄长，拥有传奇般的力量和战斗力。虫族相信他们的力量和勇敢来自于他。狡猾的Grankhul是弟弟，在虫人讲述的故事中，他为他们提供了隐身术，但作为回报，他抽走了他们的活力，因此，虫人代替他睡觉，而他却永远保持警惕和清醒。",
	"According to bugbear legends, Hruggek and Grankhul often fight alongside each other, preying upon all they encounter as is their right as superior warriors. Hruggek takes the heads of those he kills and puts them on spikes in his den, where they utter pleas for mercy and sing paeans to his might. Grankhul watches over Hruggek when he sleeps, but if he must be elsewhere, he whispers commands to the severed heads to wake Hruggek if any danger threatens him.": "根据虫族的传说，Hruggek和Grankhul经常并肩作战，捕杀所有他们遇到的人，这是他们作为高级战士的权利。Hruggek把他杀死的人的头放在他的巢穴里的钉子上，他们在那里发出求饶的声音，并为他的力量唱颂歌。格兰库尔在赫鲁格克睡觉的时候看着他，但如果他必须在其他地方，他就会对被砍下的头颅低声下气，在有任何危险威胁到赫鲁格克的时候叫醒他。",
	"Bugbears admire the qualities of both brothers. Because of Hruggek, they consider bravery and physical superiority to be their natural state. Thanks to Grankhul, they can use their size and strength to work as stealthy assassins rather than blundering around like ogres.": "虫族钦佩两兄弟的品质。因为赫鲁格克，他们认为勇敢和身体优势是他们的自然状态。由于格兰库尔的存在，他们可以利用自己的体型和力量作为隐秘的刺客，而不是像食人魔一样到处乱闯。",
	"Bullying, murder, and engaging in battle are all holy acts for bugbears. Garroting an unsuspecting creature and defeating foes in open battle are seen as acts of worship, in the same way that dwarves consider metalsmithing to be sacred to Moradin.": "欺凌、谋杀和参与战斗对虫族来说都是神圣的行为。掠夺毫无戒心的生物和在公开的战斗中击败敌人被视为崇拜的行为，就像矮人认为金属加工对莫拉丁来说是神圣的一样。",
	"The bugbears recognize two other gods, both of which they disdain and fear: Maglubiyet and Skiggaret.": "虫族认识到另外两个神，他们对这两个神都不屑一顾，并感到害怕：马格卢比耶特和斯基格瑞特。",
	"Maglubiyet, the leader of the goblinoid pantheon, forced both brothers to submit to his rule, but instead of killing them, he showed mercy and even honored them in a way by setting them free-under his control-so that bugbears could continue to employ their talents against his enemies. Bugbears understand that by venerating Hruggek and Grankhul, they also give tribute to Maglubiyet, even though they don't openly pay homage to their overlord. When bugbears are called to join a host, bugbears believe Maglubiyet has again corralled the brothers into a divine battle, and they honor their gods by following suit.": "Maglubiyet，地精神殿的领袖，强迫这两兄弟服从他的统治，但他并没有杀死他们，而是对他们表示怜悯，甚至在某种程度上尊重他们，让他们在他的控制下获得自由--这样虫人就可以继续利用他们的才能来对付他的敌人。虫族明白，通过崇敬Hruggek和Grankhul，他们也向Maglubiyet致敬，尽管他们没有公开向他们的霸主致敬。当虫族被召唤加入宿主时，虫族相信马格鲁比耶特又把兄弟们拉进了一场神圣的战斗中，他们也跟着向他们的神致敬。",
	"Skiggaret is the bugbear version of the bogeyman, as hateful and terrifying to them as bugbears are in the eyes of many other races. His name is rarely spoken, and never above a whisper. Skiggaret's influence manifests at times when bugbears are forced to act in a cowardly fashion; a bugbear that knows or feels itself to be in mortal danger is affected by a form of madness and will do anything, including trying to flee, in order to stay alive.": "斯基格瑞特是虫族版的妖怪，对他们来说，就像虫族在许多其他种族眼中一样可恨和可怕。他的名字很少被人提起，也从未超过耳语。斯基格瑞特的影响表现在当虫熊被迫以懦弱的方式行事时；知道或感觉自己处于致命危险中的虫熊会受到一种疯狂的影响，并会做任何事情，包括试图逃跑，以保持生命。",
	"Bugbears believe that this feeling of fear comes from being possessed by Skiggaret, and they don't relish experiencing it. After the madness has passed, bugbears don't dwell on things that were done in the presence of Skiggaret. Talking about such acts might call him back.": "虫族认为这种恐惧感来自于被斯基格瑞特附身，他们并不喜欢经历这种感觉。疯狂过后，虫人不会再纠缠于在斯基格莱特面前所做的事情。谈论这样的行为可能会唤回他。",
	"Bugbears have no use for priests or shamans. No one needs to tell them what their gods want. If the brother gods are angry with them, they let the bugbears know with bolts of lightning (Hruggek) or by striking them blind or dead (Grankhul). Bugbears worship their gods simply by preying on other creatures, using no other sort of ceremony to show obeisance-with one exception.": "虫族对祭司或巫师没有用处。没有人需要告诉他们，他们的神想要什么。如果兄弟之神对他们生气，他们会用闪电（Hruggek）或通过打击他们的眼睛或死亡（Grankhul）让虫族知道。虫族对他们的神的崇拜仅仅是通过捕食其他生物，不使用其他种类的仪式来表示敬意--但有一个例外。",
	"In an act of worship that also sometimes attracts favorable attention from their gods, bugbears sever the heads of defeated foes, cut away or stitch open the eyelids, and leave the mouths hanging open. The heads are then placed on spikes or hung from cords around a bugbear den. The heads themselves are trophies that honor Hruggek, and their ever-staring eyes are an homage to sleepless Grankhul.": "在一种崇拜行为中，有时也会吸引他们的神灵的关注，虫族会砍掉被打败的敌人的头，切掉或缝开眼皮，让嘴张开。然后将头颅放在钉子上或用绳索挂在虫穴周围。这些头颅本身就是向赫鲁格克致敬的战利品，而它们永远瞪大的眼睛则是对不眠不休的格兰库尔的敬意。",
	"The heads of leaders and mighty opponents are particularly sacred, and offering up such a trophy can provide a bugbear gang with a special boon. A gang that gains the favor of Hruggek and Grankhul in this way might find that the head will emit a shout when an enemy gets too close (in the fashion of an alarm spell). Sometimes the heads of people who have information the bugbears need speak their secrets amid blubbered pleas for mercy (as with the {@spell speak with dead} spell).": "领袖和强大对手的头颅是特别神圣的，提供这样的战利品可以为虫族帮派提供特殊的恩惠。一个以这种方式获得赫鲁格克和格兰库尔青睐的团伙可能会发现，当敌人靠得太近时，头颅会发出喊叫声（就像警报咒语一样）。有时，拥有虫族需要的信息的人的头颅会在哭泣的求饶声中说出他们的秘密（如（%0%）法术）。",
	"War is the lifeblood of hobgoblins. Its glories are the dreams that inspire them. Its horrors don't feature in their nightmares. Cowardice is more terrible to hobgoblins than dying, for they carry their living acts into the afterlife. A hero in death becomes a hero eternal.": "战争是霍比特人的命脉。战争的辉煌是激励他们的梦想。战争的恐怖并不在他们的噩梦中出现。对妖精来说，懦弱比死亡更可怕，因为他们把活着的行为带到了来世。一个死亡的英雄会成为一个永恒的英雄。",
	"Young hobgoblins start soldiering when they can walk and heed the mustering call as soon as they can wield their weapons capably. Every legion in the hobgoblins' entire society forever stands prepared for war.": "年轻的妖精在能走路的时候就开始当兵，一旦他们能熟练地挥舞武器，就会听从征召。妖精的整个社会中的每一个军团都永远为战争做准备。",
	"Hobgoblins hold themselves to high standards of military honor. The race has a long history of shared traditions, recorded and retold to keep the knowledge fresh for new generations. When hobgoblins aren't waging war, they farm, they build, and they practice both martial and arcane arts.": "霍布林人以高标准的军事荣誉为己任。这个种族有着悠久的历史和共同的传统，通过记录和重述来保持新一代人的知识。当妖精不发动战争的时候，他们耕种，他们建造，他们练习武术和奥术。",
	"These trappings of civil society do little to conceal an underlying brutality that hobgoblins practice on each other and perfect upon other races. Punishment for infractions of hobgoblin law are swift and merciless. Beauty is something hobgoblins associate only with images of conflict and warfare.": "这些文明社会的外衣并不能掩盖妖精们彼此之间的残暴行为，而且对其他种族也是如此。对违反妖精法律的行为的惩罚是迅速而无情的。美是妖精们只与冲突和战争的形象联系在一起的东西。",
	"The iron grip their philosophy holds on their hearts blinds hobgoblins to the accomplishments of other peoples. Hobgoblins have little appreciation or patience for art. They leave little space for joy or leisure in their lives, and thus have no reserves of faith to call upon when in dire straits.": "他们的哲学对他们内心的铁腕控制，使霍布金人对其他民族的成就视而不见。妖精对艺术没有什么鉴赏力和耐心。他们的生活中几乎没有留下快乐或休闲的空间，因此在陷入困境时没有信仰的储备可以调用。",
	"Hobgoblins revere two gods unique to their race, the only survivors of a pantheon that was decimated by Maglubiyet so long ago that hobgoblins don't remember the names of the fallen. Nomog-Geaya is the greater of the two and the more frequently honored. He is seen as a stoic, cold-blooded, and tyrannical leader, and hobgoblins believe he expects the same behavior from them. Bargrivyek is a god of duty, unity, and discipline, and he is thought to be pleased by displays of those principles.": "霍布林人崇尚两个他们种族特有的神，这是很久以前被马格鲁比耶特消灭的万神殿的唯一幸存者，以至于霍布林人都不记得死去的人的名字。诺莫格-盖亚是两者中最伟大的，也是最经常受到尊敬的。他被视为一个坚忍不拔、冷血和暴虐的领袖，霍布林人相信他期望他们有同样的行为。巴格利弗耶克是一个关于责任、团结和纪律的神，他被认为对这些原则的表现感到高兴。",
	"In the stories that hobgoblins tell one another, Bargrivyek serves as Nomog-Geaya's second in command. Nomog-Geaya would prefer the position were filled by someone more like himself, but Bargrivyek was all he was left with after Maglubiyet's conquest. Although both deities are ultimately beholden to Maglubiyet, the greater god allows them to retain a measure of their influence over the hobgoblins because their philosophies are in line with his own.": "在妖精们相互讲述的故事中，巴格里夫耶克是诺莫格-格亚的第二把手。Nomog-Geaya希望这个职位由更像他自己的人担任，但Bargrivyek是他在Maglubiyet征服后留下的唯一人选。虽然这两位神灵最终都要听命于马格鲁比耶特，但这位大神允许他们在一定程度上保留对霍布林的影响力，因为他们的理念与他自己的理念一致。",
	"Hobgoblins don't build temples to their gods, lest they displease Maglubiyet, but the few priests among them do tend small shrines and interpret the body of legends about their gods. Nomog-Geaya's priests always wield his favored weapons, a longsword and a handaxe. They are responsible for martial training as well as instruction in strategy and battlefield tactics. Bargrivyek's priests wield his symbol, a flail with a head dipped in white paint. They work as a police force in hobgoblin society, making judgments about honor, mediating disputes, and otherwise enforcing discipline.": "霍布林人不为他们的神建造庙宇，以免惹得马格鲁比耶特不高兴，但他们中的少数祭司确实在照看小神龛，并解释有关他们的神的传说体。诺莫格-格亚的祭司们总是挥舞着他最喜欢的武器，一把长剑和一把手斧。他们负责武术训练，以及战略和战场战术的指导。巴格利耶克的祭司们挥舞着他的标志--一把头部蘸有白漆的连枷。他们在妖精社会中扮演着警察的角色，对荣誉做出判断，调解争端，并以其他方式执行纪律。",
	"As in any strict military hierarchy, every hobgoblin in a legion has a rank, from the warlord down through a cadre of officers to the soldiers that make up most of its number. These ranks, using the titles most often applied to them, are as follows:": "就像任何严格的军事等级制度一样，军团中的每个妖精都有一个等级，从军阀到军官骨干，再到占军团人数大多数的士兵。这些军衔，用最常用的头衔来表示，具体如下。",
	"1st rank: Warlord": "一级：战神",
	"5th rank: Spear": "五级：长矛",
	"2nd rank: General": "2级：将军",
	"6th rank: Fist": "六级。拳头",
	"3rd rank: Captain": "三级。队长",
	"7th rank: Soldier": "第七级：士兵",
	"4th rank: Fatal Axe": "第四等级。致命之斧",
	"A legion is organized into units called banners, each one made up of a group of interrelated families.": "一个军团被组织成称为旗帜的单位，每个旗帜由一群相互关联的家族组成。",
	"Members of a banner live, work, and fight together, and each banner has a separate status within the legion that is reflected in the power of its officers. For instance, the captains of the highest-ranking banners can expect their orders to be followed by the captains of any banners of lower rank.": "旗帜的成员共同生活、工作和战斗，每个旗帜在军团中都有独立的地位，这反映在其军官的权力上。例如，等级最高的旗帜的队长可以期望他们的命令被任何等级较低的旗帜的队长遵循。",
	"Rank and responsibility aren't necessarily commensurate from one legion to another or even between banners in the same legion. A phalanx of foot soldiers led by a captain in one legion might be two hundred strong, while in another such a force numbers just twenty. One banner might have four warriors mounted on worgs led by a fist, while a fist in another banner of the same legion might lead ten mounted warriors. If any rank doesn't serve a purpose in the legion, the warlord eliminates it from the hierarchy to maximize efficiency.": "军团与军团之间，甚至同一军团的旗帜之间，军衔和责任不一定相称。一个军团中由队长带领的步兵方阵可能有两百人，而另一个军团中这样的部队只有二十人。一个军团可能有四名骑兵，由一名拳师带领，而同一军团另一军团的一名拳师可能带领十名骑兵战士。如果任何军衔在军团中没有作用，军阀就会将其从等级制度中剔除，以实现效率最大化。",
	"Hobgoblins are sometimes born with bright red or blue noses. This attribute is thought to be a sign of potency and potential. Blue and red-nosed hobgoblins receive preferential treatment, and as a result they occupy most of the leadership positions in hobgoblin society.": "霍布格林有时会生出鲜红或蓝色的鼻子。这种属性被认为是效力和潜力的标志。蓝鼻子和红鼻子的妖精受到优待，因此他们在妖精社会中占据了大部分的领导位置。",
	"The noses of all hobgoblins become more colorful when they are enraged or excited, much the way that humans' cheeks can flush with emotion.": "所有妖精的鼻子在被激怒或兴奋时都会变得更加艳丽，就像人类的脸颊会因情绪激动而泛红一样。",
	"Advancement in rank comes as a result of attaining glory, but for the achievement to mean anything, a hobgoblin must abide by the race's code of honor in doing so.": "等级的提升是获得荣耀的结果，但为了使成就有意义，妖精必须遵守种族的荣誉准则。",
	"Glory can be earned by discovery of great resources (such as finding a new vein of iron or a powerful magic item), by fine performances (writing and performing a great ballad about the legion), by designing and constructing a great defense or monument, and through other means. But the greatest respect is reserved for those who earn their glory in battle. In theory, the fortunes of war can elevate the lowest-ranking banner in a legion to the highest status. In practice, warlords are careful to position themselves and their banners to claim the greatest victories in any conflict, and they portion out opportunities and responsibilities to other banners as politics dictate.": "荣耀可以通过发现伟大的资源（如发现新的铁矿脉或强大的魔法物品），通过精彩的表演（撰写和表演关于军团的伟大民谣），通过设计和建造伟大的防御或纪念碑，以及通过其他方式获得。但最大的尊重是保留给那些在战斗中赢得荣耀的人。从理论上讲，战争的财富可以将军团中地位最低的旗帜提升到最高的地位。在实践中，军阀们小心翼翼地给自己和自己的旗帜定位，以便在任何冲突中取得最大的胜利，他们根据政治需要将机会和责任分给其他旗帜。",
	"Each hobgoblin legion has a distinct code of honor and law, but all follow a few general precepts that are at the heart of the hobgoblin honor system.": "每个妖精军团都有一套独特的荣誉和法律准则，但都遵循一些一般的戒律，这是妖精荣誉体系的核心。",
	"Carrying out orders without question is critical on the battlefield, and hobgoblins follow this dictum in peaceful times as well in order to maintain stability in their society. Hobgoblins don't shrink from following orders that they know will result in death if the act will bring glory to the banner or the legion.": "在战场上，毫无疑问地执行命令是至关重要的，在和平时期，霍布金人也遵循这一原则，以维持他们社会的稳定。如果服从命令会给旗帜或军团带来荣耀，那么霍布金人不会退缩，他们知道这样做会导致死亡。",
	"Hobgoblins give regular recognition to the deities left to them after Maglubiyet's conquest. Idols of Nomog-Geaya, as well as standards and flags with his image or symbol, receive a bow or salute at all times except emergencies. Bargrivyek's peacemakers receive due deference regardless of rank or banner status. Of course, Maglubiyet's call to conquest is always answered.": "霍布林人对马格鲁比耶特征服后留给他们的神灵给予定期的认可。诺莫格-盖亚的神像，以及带有他的形象或标志的标准和旗帜，除了紧急情况外，在任何时候都会受到鞠躬或敬礼。巴格利耶克的和平使者，无论级别或旗帜地位如何，都会受到应有的尊重。当然，马格鲁比耶特的征服号召总是会得到响应。",
	"As befits their warlike nature, hobgoblins believe that any insult demands a response. Suitably (and somewhat ironically), the outward politeness and civility that they demonstrate among each other enables them to avoid conflicts in daily life. This same form of \"courtesy\" is often extended to other races the hobgoblins have dealings with, much to the outsiders' surprise. When such respect isn't reciprocated, though, relations can swiftly deteriorate.": "与他们好战的天性相称，妖精们认为任何侮辱都需要回应。适当地（也有点讽刺地），他们在彼此之间表现出的外在礼貌和文明使他们能够在日常生活中避免冲突。这种同样形式的 \"礼貌 \"经常被延伸到与之打交道的其他种族，这让外人很惊讶。不过，当这种尊重没有得到回报时，关系就会迅速恶化。",
	"Hobgoblins never deny advancement in status to a banner that has earned it, nor do they withhold higher rank from a deserving individual. If a banner attains great glory in battle but is nearly destroyed, the handful of members who remain are welcomed into another banner, taking their banner's name and colors along with them, and assuming places of leadership in the group.": "霍布格林从来不会拒绝提升一个旗帜的地位，他们也不会扣留一个应得的人的更高等级。如果一个旗帜在战斗中获得了巨大的荣耀，但却几乎被摧毁，那么留下来的少数成员会被欢迎到另一个旗帜中，带着他们旗帜的名字和颜色，并在团体中担任领导职位。",
	"Hobgoblins care more for the survival of their legion than they do for others of their own kind. Two legions might battle over territory, resources, or power, or out of simple pride. Such a feud can continue over generations in an ongoing cycle of retribution. Each legion has a list of grievances against any others it knows about, and any legions meeting for the first time view each other with immediate hostility. Only a truly great warlord can force legions to work together as an army if Maglubiyet has not called forth a host.": "与其他同类相比，霍布林更关心自己军团的生存。两个军团可能会为了争夺领土、资源、权力，或出于简单的骄傲而争斗。这样的争斗可以持续几代人，形成一个持续的报复循环。每个军团都有一份针对它所知道的其他军团的怨恨清单，任何第一次见面的军团都会立即对对方产生敌意。只有真正伟大的军阀才能迫使军团作为一支军队一起工作，如果马格鲁比耶特没有召唤出一支军队。",
	"A few hobgoblins have mastered a system of unarmed combat called the Path of the Iron Shadow. Its practitioners are known as Iron Shadows. They serve as a secret police force and a spy network in hobgoblin society. Statistics for a typical hobgoblin Iron Shadow can be found in chapter 3.": "少数地精掌握了一种叫做 \"铁影之路 \"的徒手格斗系统。它的练习者被称为铁影子。他们在地精社会中充当秘密警察部队和间谍网络。一个典型的哥布林铁影的统计数据可以在第三章中找到。",
	"The Iron Shadows recruit from all ranks of hobgoblin society. They answer only to the priests of Maglubiyet, and use their talents for stealth, disguise, and unarmed combat to squash potential insurrections and treachery before an uprising can flourish.": "铁影团从地精社会的各个阶层招募人员。他们只听命于马格鲁比耶特的牧师，并利用他们的隐蔽性、伪装和徒手搏斗的才能，在起义兴起之前粉碎潜在的叛乱和背叛行为。",
	"These hobgoblins have the ability to command shadow magic to conceal their true nature, create distracting illusions, and walk from one shadow to the next.": "这些妖精有能力指挥影子魔法来掩盖他们的真实本性，制造令人分心的幻觉，并从一个影子走到另一个影子。",
	"When they operate in the open, they wear masks that resemble the leering faces of devils. As befits their role in society, they receive proper deference from all other hobgoblins that cross their path.": "当他们在公开场合活动时，他们戴着面具，就像魔鬼的淫笑脸。与他们在社会中的角色相称，他们从所有与他们擦肩而过的其他妖精那里得到适当的尊重。",
	"Hobgoblins know the value of arcane magic in warfare. Where other cultures treat magic as an individual pursuit, a calling that only a select few can even attempt, hobgoblins practice mass indoctrination and testing to identify every potential caster in their ranks.": "霍布林人知道奥术魔法在战争中的价值。其他文化将魔法视为一种个人追求，一种只有少数人可以尝试的召唤，而霍布林人则实行大规模灌输和测试，以确定他们队伍中每一个潜在的施法者。",
	"The Academy of Devastation is a hobgoblin institution made up of spellcasters. Members are sent abroad to test young hobgoblins. Those who show an aptitude for magic are enrolled in the academy, brought to a hidden school, and subjected to a rigorous regimen of drills, exercises, and study. In the academy's view, every young student is a potential new devastator, destined to be forged into a weapon of war.": "毁灭学院是一个由施法者组成的霍布林机构。成员被派往国外测试年轻的妖精。那些显示出有魔法天赋的人被录取到学院，被带到一所隐藏的学校，接受严格的操练、练习和学习。在学院看来，每个年轻的学生都是一个潜在的新破坏者，注定要被锻造成战争武器。",
	"Hobgoblin devastators have little knowledge of or use for spells that have no use on the battlefield. They are taught potent, destructive spells and also learn the fundamentals of evocation magic. The death and destruction they bring about is worthy of as many accolades as the ruin wrought by traditional warriors. Luckily for their enemies, devastators seldom employ sophisticated tactics, functioning essentially as a mobile artillery battery. They can bring tremendous force to bear, but rarely display the versatility and inventiveness of spellcasting elves and humans. A few do become accomplished tacticians in their own right, and it isn't uncommon for such an individual to serve as the warlord of a legion.": "游民破坏者对那些在战场上没有用处的法术知之甚少，也没有用处。他们被教导强大的破坏性法术，同时也学习唤醒魔法的基本原理。他们带来的死亡和破坏与传统战士造成的破坏一样值得称赞。对他们的敌人来说，幸运的是，破坏者很少采用复杂的战术，基本上是作为一个移动的炮兵连发挥作用。他们可以带来巨大的力量，但很少显示出精灵和人类施法的多功能性和创造性。少数人确实成为了有成就的战术家，这样的人担任军团的军团长并不罕见。",
	"Statistics for a typical hobgoblin devastator can be found in chapter 3.": "一个典型的哥布林破坏者的统计数据可以在第三章中找到。",
	"When hobgoblins aren't on the move, they have a stable lifestyle and society wherein they can raise new generations, train them, and prepare for future battles. If few enemies exist nearby and the hobgoblins in a legion have room to spread out, the members of each banner might live in a separate location, effectively its own settlement, with worg riders and messenger ravens passing communications between the sites.": "当妖精不在移动时，他们有一个稳定的生活方式和社会，在那里他们可以培养新的一代，训练他们，并为未来的战斗做准备。如果附近很少有敌人，而且军团中的妖精有空间可以分散，那么每个旗帜的成员可能会住在一个单独的地方，实际上是自己的定居点，由虫族骑手和信鸦在各个地点之间传递通信。",
	"In lands dominated by other humanoids, hobgoblins will settle for taking up residence in an old dungeon or ruin where they can hide their numbers and keep their presence secret. Such an arrangement isn't desirable, because space is usually at a premium.": "在由其他人类主导的土地上，妖精会选择在一个古老的地牢或废墟中居住，在那里他们可以隐藏自己的数量并保持自己的存在。这样的安排并不理想，因为空间通常很宝贵。",
	"If a hobgoblin legion is looking for a place to set down roots, its first choice is an out-of-the-way area that has adequate resources or can be improved to suit the hobgoblins' needs. Land for farming or grazing is desirable, as is access to lumber, stone, or metal ore. If the hobgoblins find a place that fits the bill, they build non-portable facilities such as forges and sawmills, marking their intention to stay either until all the resources have been harvested or until Maglubiyet calls them off to war. If the hobgoblins are interested in doing business with the outside world, they might erect a trading post on the fringe of their territory where other people can come to exchange goods and coin.": "如果一个哥布林军团正在寻找一个扎根的地方，它的第一选择是一个拥有足够资源或可以改进以满足哥布林需求的偏僻地区。耕种或放牧的土地是可取的，获得木材、石头或金属矿石的机会也是可取的。如果妖精们找到了一个合适的地方，他们就会建造一些非便携式的设施，如锻造厂和锯木厂，并标明他们打算留在这里，直到所有的资源都被收割完，或者直到马格鲁比耶特召集他们去打仗。如果妖精们对与外界做生意感兴趣，他们可能会在其领地的边缘地带建立一个贸易站，让其他人来交换货物和硬币。",
	"A hobgoblin lair resembles nothing so much as a military base. It is always well guarded, whether by lone sentries perched in trees or a stone tower with a full garrison of troops. As space permits, large areas are dedicated for use as training grounds, marshaling fields, target ranges, combat arenas, and similar facilities for the practice of warfare. Monuments, typically statues and pillars, are erected around these areas to remind the legion of past glories.": "妖精的巢穴与军事基地没什么两样。它总是被守卫得很好，无论是栖息在树上的孤独的哨兵，还是有完整的部队驻扎的石塔。在空间允许的情况下，大片区域被专门用作训练场、集结地、靶场、战斗场和类似的战争实践设施。纪念碑，通常是雕像和石柱，被竖立在这些区域周围，以提醒军团过去的辉煌。",
	"Every legion's headquarters includes a command center where the warlord meets with banner leaders and others of high rank. Inside the complex or somewhere near it is the Way to Glory-a road, river, tunnel, or valley on either side of which the honored dead are interred, each burial site complete with a description of the banner, rank, and glories of its occupant.": "每个军团的总部都包括一个指挥中心，军团长在这里与旗帜领袖和其他高官会面。在建筑群内或其附近的某处是通往荣耀之路--道路、河流、隧道或山谷的两边埋葬着受尊敬的死者，每个埋葬点都有关于旗帜、等级和居住者的荣耀的描述。",
	"The quarters for troops are austere but sufficient, as are the necessary stables and dens to hold the legion's animals and beasts. Legions that have need of such amenities also set aside space for a library, which can double as a school and training facility for spellcasters. If a hobgoblin lair has a prison, it's usually a small one—miscreants are incarcerated for only a short time before facing the hobgoblins' harsh justice.": "部队的宿舍很简陋，但也足够了，还有必要的马厩和巢穴来饲养军团的动物和野兽。需要这些设施的军团还为图书馆留出了空间，它可以作为学校和法术师的培训设施。如果一个妖精的巢穴有一个监狱，它通常是一个小的监狱，在面对妖精严厉的司法之前，轻罪犯只被监禁了很短的时间。",
	"When Maglubiyet conquered the goblins' gods, he taught the goblins to fear his cruelty. They bowed in sniveling obeisance to him and then turned their impotent wrath upon others, becoming petty tyrants. When Maglubiyet conquered the bugbears' gods, he taught the bugbears the practicality of cold brutality. When Maglubiyet conquered the hobgoblins' gods, he knew he had to take the hobgoblins firmly in hand. From him they learned discipline, and thus they became the natural leaders among all the goblinoids.": "当马格鲁比耶特征服了地精的神，他教地精们害怕他的残忍。他们对他卑躬屈膝，然后把他们无能的怒火转向其他人，成为小霸王。当马格鲁比耶特征服了虫族的神，他教会了虫族冷酷的残暴的实用性。当马格鲁比耶特征服了霍布林斯的神，他知道他必须把霍布林斯牢牢掌握在手中。从他那里，他们学会了纪律，因此他们成为所有地精中的天然领袖。",
	"The goblinoids are bound together by Maglubiyet's subjugation of their individual deities. All types rightly fear Maglubiyet's wrath, but each carries out the Mighty One's divine will differently. Goblins typically flee from obvious threats, and hobgoblins often have to round up and threaten them before they can make use of them. Bugbears accept hobgoblin demands for assistance only grudgingly, and often they must be bribed with loot, spirits, battle gear, or the severed heads of enemy leaders-a particularly holy gift. Hobgoblins operating on their own will remain in their forts, content to deal with internal politics of rank and matters of defense, but when they encounter other types of goblinoids (or seek them out), it is viewed by all as a divine sign-Maglubiyet has called them together to do his bidding on a grand scale.": "妖精们因为马格鲁比耶特征服了他们各自的神灵而结合在一起。所有类型的人都理所当然地害怕马格鲁比耶特的愤怒，但每个人都以不同的方式执行全能者的神意。妖精通常会从明显的威胁中逃离，而霍布金人往往要在利用他们之前围捕并威胁他们。虫族只勉强接受霍布林的援助要求，而且往往必须用战利品、精神、战斗装备或敌人首领的断头来贿赂他们--这是特别神圣的礼物。独自行动的霍格布林会留在自己的堡垒里，满足于处理内部的等级政治和防御事务，但当他们遇到其他类型的地精（或寻找他们）时，所有人都认为这是一个神圣的标志--马格卢比耶特把他们召集起来，在一个大范围内为他服务。",
	"Goblinoids are indoctrinated from a young age to consider all gods but their own as lesser, false entities. Maglubiyet is the only true deity, they learn, and the world will be wracked by chaos and despair until he one day conquers all pantheons. Goblinoids harbor a special hatred for clerics of enemy deities, focusing on them in battle and desecrating their temples whenever they have the chance. Whether a deity is good, evil, or neutral is immaterial. All gods other than Maglubiyet and his servants are false and must be destroyed.": "妖精们从小就被灌输，认为除了他们自己的神之外，所有的神都是较小的、虚假的实体。他们知道，麦格鲁比耶特是唯一的真神，世界将被混乱和绝望所困扰，直到有一天他征服了所有的万神殿。妖精们对敌方神祗的神职人员怀有特殊的仇恨，在战斗中专注于他们，只要有机会就会亵渎他们的神庙。一个神灵是善的、恶的还是中立的并不重要。除了马格卢比耶特和他的仆人之外，所有的神都是虚假的，必须被摧毁。",
	"When the three types of goblinoids coalesce into a host, this new societal and military arrangement fundamentally changes how virtually every individual behaves.": "当三种类型的妖精凝聚成一个宿主时，这种新的社会和军事安排从根本上改变了几乎每个人的行为方式。",
	"Hobgoblins form the backbone of the new culture, taking up most leadership roles and acting as the strong center in any military action. Hobgoblins that are called to lead a host become fired with purpose, overtaken by a fanaticism that lends new urgency to their every action.": "游民构成了新文化的骨干，承担了大部分的领导角色，并在任何军事行动中充当强大的中心。被要求领导主人的游民变得有目的性，被一种狂热所征服，使他们的每一个行动都有新的紧迫性。",
	"When multiple legions gather into a host, each of those legions has a separate status, just as each banner in a legion does.": "当多个军团聚集成一个东道主时，这些军团中的每一个都有独立的地位，就像一个军团中的每一面旗帜一样。",
	"The legion of the host's warlord has the highest status, and warlords of lower status are demoted to the title of general. A member of the lowest-ranked banner in the warlord's legion has a higher status than those of other legions who share the same rank, but a general at the head of another legion still outranks everyone in the warlord's legion except for the warlord.": "主人的军团长的军团地位最高，地位较低的军团长被降为将军。军阀军团中地位最低的旗帜成员的地位高于其他军团中地位相同的成员，但其他军团的首领的将军的地位仍然高于军阀军团中除军阀之外的所有人。",
	"Hobgoblins in a legion set aside their animosity for other legions when a host forms. The warlords of rival legions don't seek to depose the leader of the host unless the fortunes of war create the opportunity. Each legion records all the insults directed toward it while a member of a host, and when the host disbands, those grudges again come to the forefront.": "当一个军团形成时，军团中的游民将他们对其他军团的敌意放在一边。敌对军团的军阀们不会试图罢免东道主的领袖，除非战争的命运创造了机会。每个军团在作为东道主成员时都会记录下所有针对它的侮辱，而当东道主解散时，这些怨恨又会浮现在眼前。",
	"Bugbears that are subsumed into a host function as a special cadre of spies, assassins, and bodyguards, answering to the senior leadership of the host rather than to others of their own kind.": "归入宿主的虫人作为一支特殊的间谍、刺客和保镖队伍，对宿主的高层领导负责，而不是对其他同类负责。",
	"On occasion, their hobgoblin leaders will see fit to equip the bugbear force with improved equipment, such as metal-tipped javelins in place of stone-tipped ones, or chain shirts instead of the usual hide armor. Bugbears are never outfitted with ranged weapons (which they refuse to use) or with heavy armor (which compromises their stealthiness).": "有时，他们的哥布林首领会认为适合为虫族部队配备改进的装备，例如用金属尖的标枪代替石尖的标枪，或用链子衬衫代替通常的皮甲。虫人从不装备远程武器（他们拒绝使用）或重甲（这影响了他们的隐蔽性）。",
	"If some bugbears demonstrate a particular talent for some facet of combat or subterfuge, the hobgoblins might separate them into squads that employ those skills to best effect (see the \"Bugbear Special Forces\" sidebar).": "如果一些虫族在某些方面表现出特殊的战斗或潜行天赋，霍布林可能会将他们分成若干小队，以运用这些技能达到最佳效果（见 \"虫族特种部队 \"边栏）。",
	"One of the first steps hobgoblins take when a tribe of goblins joins the host is to train the gatherers and the pariahs as soldiers, effectively  elevating those goblins' status to that of hunters and reducing the number of castes in the host to two. Leaders and religious figures of the tribe still maintain some of their authority, but the lowliest hobgoblin or bugbear can give an order to a goblin chief, and that chief must leap to obey or, as is often the case, immediately yell orders for other goblins to do it.": "当一个妖精部落加入宿主时，妖精采取的第一个步骤是把采集者和贱民训练成士兵，有效地把这些妖精的地位提升到猎人的地位，并把宿主的种姓数量减少到两个。部落的领袖和宗教人物仍然保持着一些权威，但最低级的妖精或虫人可以向妖精首领下达命令，而首领必须跃跃欲试地服从，或者像通常情况那样，立即大喊命令让其他妖精去做。",
	"Goblins that are conscripted into a host resign themselves to their fate-which could well be to have their souls claimed by Maglubiyet for eternal war in Acheron. Thus reconciled, they become humorless and show no pity toward whatever meager victims fall under their dominion, usually enslaved laborers or monsters that are pressed into service as battle beasts. When the need arises, they also work as scouts, sappers during sieges, and skirmishers on the battlefront.": "被征召入伍的哥布林对自己的命运心悦诚服--这很可能是让他们的灵魂被马格鲁比耶特（Maglubiyet）领走，在阿克伦进行永恒的战争。这样一来，他们变得毫无幽默感，对任何落入他们统治下的微不足道的受害者都不表示怜悯，通常是被奴役的劳工或被压迫为战斗兽的怪物。当需要的时候，他们也会充当侦察兵，在围攻中充当工兵，在战场上充当小兵。",
	"A host rarely consists of nothing but goblinoids, especially if it has been on the move for a while. In addition to wolf and worg mounts and flocks of squawking ravens, a host might attract or press into service many kinds of creatures. Some possibilities:": "宿主很少只由地精组成，特别是当它已经移动了一段时间。除了狼和虫的坐骑以及成群的乌鸦外，宿主还可能吸引或压制许多种类的生物。一些可能性。",
	"A low, two-wheeled pushcart loaded with small wooden cages containing cockatrices.": "一辆低矮的双轮手推车，上面装着装有鸡冠花的小木笼。",
	"A hydra with goblins riding on each head that direct the beast by controlling the view of its blinkered eyes.": "一个九头蛇，每个头上都骑着妖精，通过控制其失明的眼睛的视线来指挥野兽。",
	"Former slaves, often soldiers who once fought against the host, who now fight alongside the host to gain better treatment and protect loved ones held captive.": "前奴隶，通常是曾经与主人作战的士兵，他们现在与主人并肩作战，以获得更好的待遇并保护被俘的亲人。",
	"A carrion crawler ridden by several goblins in a row and directed by a lead goblin using a long pole to suspend a lantern just out of reach of its tentacles.": "一个腐肉爬虫，由几个妖精连续骑着，并由一个带头的妖精指挥，用一根长杆将一个灯笼悬挂在它的触角所及之处。",
	"A goblinoid host that is prepared for war doesn't wait for the enemy to approach its doorstep. In pursuit of ever greater glory for Maglubiyet, the host's leaders keep the army on the move, occasionally breaking off small garrisons (often of one type of goblinoid) to guard territory that needs to be held.": "一个为战争做好准备的妖精群不会等待敌人靠近它的门口。为了追求玛格鲁比耶特更大的荣耀，主人的领导人让军队不断前进，偶尔会分出一些小的驻军（通常是一种地精）来守卫需要守卫的领土。",
	"A host usually marches at night, with outriders, who carry messenger ravens, traveling ahead, behind, and on both sides of the main group. The ravens can distinguish between individuals from a great height and navigate over long distances. Thus, a raven can fly back to the main body when it is released by someone remote from the group, and it can be sent out again to look for the individual that released it in order to deliver a response.": "一支队伍通常在夜间行进，由携带信使乌鸦的骑兵在主队的前方、后方和两侧行进。乌鸦能从很高的地方区分个体，并能在长距离内导航。因此，当一只乌鸦被远离群体的人释放时，它可以飞回主体，并可以再次被派出去寻找释放它的个体，以便做出回应。",
	"Most of the army travels on foot, and wolf-riding goblins and worg-riding hobgoblins also make up a significant portion of the force. Hobgoblins might ride horses or other mounts they could obtain, such as hippogriffs, axe beaks, or giant vultures. Bugbears don 't ride mounts, but they aren't above hitching a ride in the howdah of an enormous battle beast such as an elephant or a hydra.": "大部分军队都是徒步旅行，骑狼的妖精和骑虫的霍布格林也占了很大一部分。霍布林可能会骑马或其他他们能得到的坐骑，如河马、斧头嘴或巨型秃鹰。虫人不骑坐骑，但他们也不至于搭上大象或九头蛇等巨大战兽的马车。",
	"If the host has slaves, they pull wagons or sledges in the center of the army, dragging along the equipment of war while surrounded by its users. If slaves have yet to be acquired, goblins and beasts of burden perform this function.": "如果主人有奴隶，他们会在军队的中心拉着马车或雪橇，拖着战争装备，同时被其使用者包围。如果尚未获得奴隶，则由地精和负重兽执行这一功能。",
	"Under any circumstances, bugbears are valued members of a goblinoid host. If some of them are specialized (or can be trained) in different aspects of warfare, their value increases, especially when they work in concert.": "在任何情况下，虫族都是地精主人的重要成员。如果他们中的一些人在战争的不同方面有专长（或可以被训练），他们的价值就会增加，特别是当他们协同工作时。",
	"Bugbears that serve as thugs have more of Hruggek than Grankhul in them. They leap in among massed foes and make wide, whirling swings with their weapons to create openings in enemy formations.": "作为打手的虫族有更多的Hruggek而不是Grankhul的特点。他们在密集的敌人中跳跃，用他们的武器进行大范围的、旋转式的挥舞，在敌人的阵型中制造缺口。",
	"The wild attack of a group of thugs is often followed by the charge of one or more bulwarks. A bugbear bulwark carries a spiked shield into battle that it uses like a plow, bashing aside whatever it encounters.": "一群暴徒的疯狂攻击之后，往往是一个或多个斗牛士的冲锋。一个虫族斗牛士带着一个带刺的盾牌进入战斗，它像一个犁一样使用，把遇到的东西撞到一边。",
	"Bugbears that are gifted in stealth are sent out to kill enemy sentries and thus clear the way for others to penetrate the foe's defenses. Murderers carry many javelins with them, which they throw from hiding and wield in melee, and they also carry garrotes to cut off sounds of screaming.": "有隐身天赋的虫人被派去杀死敌人的哨兵，从而为其他人穿透敌人的防线扫清道路。杀手们随身携带许多标枪，他们从隐蔽处投掷标枪，并在近战中挥舞，他们还携带绞盘，以切断尖叫声。",
	"Warfare in the name of Maglubiyet isn't conducted like the raiding of orcs or the wanton slaughter of gnolls. It is instead a practice of claiming territory and subjugating people. Those who surrender to the host with little or no resistance get fair and honest treatment. If they offer proper tribute, they can even look forward to avoiding goblin whips and chains. Warriors among the conquered people might be accepted as auxiliary units in the host, if they prove to be capable and trustworthy.": "以马格鲁比耶特的名义进行的战争并不像兽人的突袭或地精的肆意屠杀。相反，它是一种索取领土和征服人民的做法。那些几乎没有抵抗就向主人投降的人得到公平和诚实的待遇。如果他们提供适当的贡品，他们甚至可以期待避免地精的鞭子和链条。被征服者中的战士可能会被接受为主人的辅助单位，如果他们被证明是有能力和值得信赖的。",
	"Typically, a goblinoid host seeks to retain enough of the population in a conquered settlement for the community to continue to produce goods and services. The labor force likely includes more youngsters and elderly than before the goblinoids' conquest, with a corresponding drop-off in production. In any case, a group of conquered people serves the host best when it continues to produce resources that the goblinoids can use. Only when a settlement offers stiff resistance or has no lasting value to the host do the goblinoids resort to slaughter and slavery to empty it of enemies.": "通常情况下，哥布林人的主人会设法在被征服的定居点保留足够的人口，以便社区继续生产商品和服务。与地精征服前相比，劳动力可能包括更多的年轻人和老人，生产也会相应下降。在任何情况下，当一群被征服的人继续生产地精可以使用的资源时，他们就能最好地服务于主人。只有当一个定居点提供了激烈的抵抗或对主人没有持久的价值时，哥布林诺人才会采用屠杀和奴役的方式来清除敌人。",
	"While a host pursues conquest, it is taboo for its members to copulate. Such proclivities must be suppressed so that all effort is focused on the task at hand. Breach of the taboo can bring summary execution, so it is rare for offspring to be born among the host even when it success fully campaigns for years.": "当宿主追求征服的时候，其成员是禁忌交配的。这种癖好必须被压制，以便所有的努力都集中在手头的任务上。违反禁忌会带来即决处决，因此，即使在宿主成功地进行了多年的运动后，也很少有后代出生。",
	"The taboo doesn't extend to female goblinoids that come into the host already pregnant and give birth while on campaign. Such offspring are called Warborn, a title they keep for life. The Warborn are thought to be blessed by Maglubiyet, and as a result these young goblinoids are carried into battle like a standard and used to rally troops.": "这种禁忌并不延伸到已经怀孕的女妖精，她们在活动期间进入宿主体内并生产。这样的后代被称为 \"战神\"（Warborn），这个头衔他们终身保留。战生被认为是受到马格鲁比耶特（Maglubiyet）的祝福，因此，这些年轻的地精被像标准一样带入战场，用来召集部队。",
	"A host that gains many victories might end up claiming vast amounts of territory and eventually become a true nation. Such an empire might last for generations if the military can continue achieving new conquests or at least claim victories when the goblinoids defend territory they previously took over. If triumphs of some sort don't keep coming, the bonds of allegiance among the goblinoids eventually fray. Legions of hobgoblins begin infighting, and goblins shirk their duties while the hobgoblins are distracted. Then, seeing the disarray of the host as a sign that Maglubiyet is no longer looking, the bugbears turn on their hobgoblin leaders, take a few of their heads as fresh trophies, and leave.": "一个获得许多胜利的主人最终可能会要求获得大量的领土，并最终成为一个真正的国家。如果军队能够继续取得新的征服，或者至少在妖精们保卫他们以前占领的领土时宣称取得了胜利，这样的帝国可能会持续数代。如果某种胜利没有持续到来，地精们之间的忠诚纽带最终会破裂。妖精军团开始内讧，妖精们趁着妖精们分心的时候推卸责任。然后，看到主人的混乱表明马格卢比耶特不再看了，虫子们转向他们的哥布林领袖，拿着他们的几个头颅作为新的战利品，然后离开。",
	"When a host conquers a settlement or a community, the surviving victims quickly learn to adapt to life under goblinoid rule. The hobgoblins bring their own legal code down upon the vassals, and it is liable to be harsher than that to which the inhabitants were accustomed. Yet the host will also respect traditions of law and custom among those they conquer, as an aid to maintaining order by pacifying the population. Some surviving civilian leaders are allowed to retain their positions, often gaining more privilege and power than they previously possessed by serving as agents of the goblinoids, helping to identify any who are disloyal to the host.": "当宿主征服了一个定居点或社区时，幸存的受害者很快就会学会适应妖精统治下的生活。妖精们将他们自己的法律准则强加在附庸身上，而且很可能比居民们所习惯的更为严苛。然而，主人也会尊重他们所征服的人的法律和习俗的传统，作为通过安抚人口来维持秩序的一种帮助。一些幸存的平民领袖被允许保留他们的职位，他们往往通过担任地精的代理人获得比以前更多的特权和权力，帮助识别任何对主人不忠的人。",
	"In matters of religion, there is little or no flexibility. The host eliminates any spiritual leaders or temple servants who offer any resistance. Clergy of gods that are deemed harmless, such as a deity of the harvest, can escape this fate. When the host encounters priests of deities of battle or conquest, they offer them a simple choice: Turn to the worship of Maglubiyet, or prove the superiority of your god in combat. Any such priest who remains faithful to some other god rarely lasts long, because the priest will face a succession of foes-as many as it takes for the priest to succumb and for others to see that resistance is pointless. Maglubiyet ultimately offers only two options: submit or die.": "在宗教问题上，几乎没有任何灵活性。宿主会消灭任何提供任何抵抗的精神领袖或神庙仆人。被认为是无害的神的神职人员，如收获之神，可以逃脱这一命运。当宿主遇到战斗神或征服神的祭司时，他们会给他们一个简单的选择：转向对马格鲁比耶特的崇拜，或者在战斗中证明你的神的优越性。任何忠于其他神的祭司都很少能持续很长时间，因为这个祭司将面临一连串的敌人--只要这个祭司屈服，并让其他人看到抵抗是毫无意义的。马格鲁比耶特最终只提供了两个选择：服从或死亡。",
	"If the settlement has holy sites dedicated to conquered gods, these are converted into shrines to the Mighty One.": "如果定居点有专门供奉被征服的神灵的圣地，那么这些圣地就会被改造成全能者的圣地。",
	"The war horns of the host signal that every goblinoid has the chance to prove his or her worth to Maglubiyet and join his Army of Immortals in Acheron, the plane of eternal battle. There Maglubiyet marshals his host against slavering orc hordes in a bid to bring Gruumsh and the other orc gods to heel, a mythic contest that has pitted the goblinoids and orcs of the world against one another since time immemorial.": "宿主的战争号角预示着每个地精都有机会向马格鲁比耶特证明自己的价值，并加入他的不朽军团，在阿克伦--永恒的战斗之境。在那里，马格卢比耶特调集他的主人，对抗贪婪的兽人群，试图将格鲁姆什和其他兽人之神绳之以法，这是自古以来地精和兽人之间的神话竞赛。",
	"All representations of the defeated gods are thrown down, ruined, or marred. Mosaics are broken apart. Stained glass is shattered. Flags and pennants are soaked in blood. Statues are put in chains. Altars become chopping blocks where Maglubiyet's bloody axe is used to decapitate all who refuse to bow to him.": "所有被打败的神的代表都被扔下，被毁坏，或被破坏。马赛克画被打碎了。彩绘玻璃被打碎。旗帜和旗帜被浸泡在血液中。雕像被戴上枷锁。祭坛变成了砧板，马格卢比耶特的血斧被用来斩杀所有拒绝向他鞠躬的人。",
	"A goblinoid army doesn't stay on the move forever, but when they make camp, it isn't for rest and recreation. A goblinoid war camp is a place that is constantly ready for war, and the hobgoblins run it accordingly.": "妖精军队不会永远停留在移动状态，但当他们扎营时，并不是为了休息和娱乐。妖精的战营是一个不断为战争做准备的地方，而妖精们也相应地管理它。",
	"A war camp might be a permanent settlement that a hobgoblin legion uses as a garrison. The accompanying map depicts one such place, and it can also be used to represent a location constructed to serve as a staging area by a host that is actively campaigning.": "战争营地可能是一个妖精军团作为驻军的永久性定居点。随附的地图描绘了这样一个地方，它也可以用来表示一个由正在积极作战的主人建造的作为中转区的地点。",
	"The basic layout of a war camp is circular. To prepare the site, slaves, goblins, and any beasts fit for the purpose dig a ditch around the desired location, interrupted in places where wide paths provide access to the center of the enclosed area. Inside this ring of excavation are sections of a wooden palisade, each part capped with a gate and a tower on either end. These outer walls and gates aren't regularly manned or patrolled, because the occupants aren't concerned about being taken by surprise. If an enemy force does approach, though, these barriers do a good job of delaying any incursion until the goblinoids can rally their defenses.": "战争营地的基本布局是圆形的。为了准备场地，奴隶、地精和任何适合的野兽在所需地点周围挖出一条沟渠，在一些地方中断，宽阔的道路提供了通往封闭区域中心的通道。在这个挖掘圈内有几段木制的栅栏，每段栅栏的两端都有一个门和一个塔。这些外墙和大门并不经常有人驻守或巡逻，因为居住者并不担心被偷袭。不过，如果敌人真的来了，这些屏障可以很好地拖延任何入侵，直到地精们能够集结他们的防线。",
	"Inside the surrounding bulwark, the goblinoids all have their separate quarters, organized according to their wonts. Typical of any camp are the wide paths that crisscross it, running from each gate through the center of the camp and out the other side. This configuration enables all the goblinoids to swiftly rally and exit the camp en masse to meet an approaching threat.": "在周围的堡垒内，地精们都有自己独立的住所，按照他们的身份组织起来。任何营地的典型特征是纵横交错的宽阔道路，从每个门穿过营地的中心，再从另一边出去。这种配置使所有的地精都能迅速集结并集体离开营地，以应对即将到来的威胁。",
	"The camp's warlord resides in the command center, which is a large wooden building in the middle of camp. Here the warlord meets with advisors and makes plans for future conquest. Most of the time, a command center also holds elite bugbear bodyguards that protect the warlord and a goblin jester that serves as insurance against the appearance of a nilbog (see the \"Nilbogs: Pranksters with Power\" sidebar).": "营地的军阀居住在指挥中心，这是一个位于营地中央的大型木制建筑。在这里，军阀与顾问会面，并制定未来的征服计划。在大多数情况下，指挥中心还关押着保护军阀的精锐虫族保镖，以及作为防止尼尔博格出现的保险的地精小丑（见 \"尼尔博格：有力量的恶作剧者 \"侧边栏）。",
	"In a camp that doesn't have separate facilities for a library and a rookery, the command center subsumes those functions. Library records are stored in a chamber adjacent to where the war council meets, and posts for ravens are set all around the exterior of the building.": "在一个没有单独的图书馆和鸦巢设施的营地，指挥中心承担了这些功能。图书馆的记录存放在与战争委员会开会地点相邻的一个房间里，建筑物外部到处都有乌鸦的哨位。",
	"Each type of goblinoid has its own accommodations within the war camp.": "每种类型的地精都有自己在战营内的住所。",
	"After the hobgoblins stake out their territory, bugbear gangs dig their dens wherever else they wish, sometimes building them in the shadow of the outer wall but most often scattering them about, seemingly at random. A den typically consists of a hole and a crawlspace big enough for a few bugbears.": "在霍布林人划定自己的领地后，虫族团伙会在其他任何他们想去的地方挖洞，有时会把它们建在外墙的阴影下，但最常见的是把它们散布在各地，似乎是随意的。一个巢穴通常由一个洞和一个足以容纳几只虫熊的爬行空间组成。",
	"The camp's goblins settle wherever their hobgoblin commanders tell them to. Their quarters usually surround the areas where slaves and beasts. The typical goblin hovel is a round tent where related goblins sleep. In a permanent camp, these hovels often take the form of wattle-and-daub huts.": "营地的妖精们在他们的妖精指挥官告诉他们的地方定居。他们的宿舍通常围绕着奴隶和野兽的区域。典型的地精小屋是一个圆形的帐篷，相关的地精在里面睡觉。在一个永久的营地里，这些小屋通常采取荆条和稻草屋的形式。",
	"Not surprisingly, hobgoblins have the most spacious and well-appointed quarters in a war camp. Each of the banners in a legion has its own group of lodges in one of the quadrants of the interior, each one facing the pathway that runs past its front door.": "毫不奇怪，霍布林在战营中拥有最宽敞和完善的宿舍。军团中的每个旗帜都有自己的住宿群，位于内部的一个象限，每个旗帜都面向经过其前门的小道。",
	"Hobgoblins know the value of improving one's base of knowledge, and so they value any documentation about the world around them-maps, accounting records, battle reports, and other important facts. This knowledge is sorted by a legion's librarian and stored in the camp's library. The library serves as a hub for communication and strategy, and it is never located far from the group's leaders. In the field, the army's library is carried in a fortified and fire-protected wagon, surrounded by battle-hardened caretakers (often devastators or Iron Shadows) willing to give their lives to protect it.": "游民知道提高一个人的知识基础的价值，因此他们重视任何有关周围世界的文件--地图、会计记录、战斗报告和其他重要事实。这些知识由军团的图书管理员进行分类，并储存在营地的图书馆中。图书馆是沟通和战略的枢纽，它的位置永远不会远离团体的领导人。在战场上，军队的图书馆被装在一个有防御和防火保护的马车里，周围有身经百战的看守人（通常是破坏者或铁影子）愿意用他们的生命来保护它。",
	"Goblins are responsible for tending to the camp's slaves, battle beasts, and beasts of burden. These are hobbled, chained to posts, or placed in pens, cages, or pits as needed. Most of these containment sites are surrounded by goblin hovels, and those that aren't are nearby, so that the goblins can keep track of their charges.": "妖精负责照顾营地的奴隶、战斗用的野兽和负重兽。根据需要，这些人被拴住，用链子拴在柱子上，或放在围栏、笼子或坑里。这些关押地点大多被地精的小屋所包围，而那些没有被包围的则在附近，这样地精们就可以跟踪他们的货物了。",
	"Hobgoblins keep flocks of ravens that serve them as messengers and spies. A huge, tree-like conglomeration of metal and wood serves the ravens as a roosting and nesting place. If a camp doesn't use one of these freestanding structures, its ravens are accommodated by perches and outcrops built on the outside of the command center. In the field, a wagon serves as a make shift rookery.": "霍布金人饲养着成群的乌鸦，作为信使和间谍为他们服务。一个巨大的、像树一样的金属和木材的集合体为乌鸦提供了一个栖息和筑巢的地方。如果一个营地没有使用这些独立的结构，那么它的乌鸦就会被建在指挥中心外面的栖息地和突出物所容纳。在野外，一辆马车可以作为一个临时的栖息地。",
	"Members of the army are expected to maintain their own battle gear, but ammunition and replacement gear are kept on hand, as well as other nonperishable supplies. Rather than being contained in a building, these items are on wagons distributed throughout the camp in such a way that all the vehicles are accessible and ready to be moved if the rallying horn is blown.": "军队成员要维护自己的战斗装备，但弹药和替换装备以及其他不易腐烂的用品都在手边。这些物品不是装在建筑物里，而是装在分布在整个营地的马车上，以便所有的车辆都能接触到，并在集结号吹响时随时准备移动。",
	"Every wagon is under watch by at least two guards, which are responsible for recording \"withdrawals\" and reporting on inventory to the camp's leaders.": "每辆马车都由至少两名警卫看管，他们负责记录 \"提款 \"并向营地领导报告库存情况。",
	"Maglubiyet's holy symbol is a headsman's axe, and the block is where it is blessed by feeding it the lifeblood of conquered foes and goblinoids that neglect their duties. In a temporary camp, the block might be a simple slab of wood or stone laid on a hastily heaped-up pile of dirt. In a permanent garrison, the block is often attached to the command center and placed on a consecrated platform.": "马格鲁比耶特的神圣象征是头领的斧头，而这块地方是通过给它喂食被征服的敌人和疏于管理的地精的生命之血来保佑它的。在一个临时营地里，这块石头可能是一块简单的木板或石头，铺在匆忙堆积的泥土上。在永久的驻军中，这块石头通常与指挥中心相连，放在一个神圣的平台上。",
	"Near the block stands a post or a rack with various weapons that represent the symbols of the goblinoid gods, each placed in accordance with the god's rank. Maglubiyet's headsman's axe is always highest. Then comes Nomog-Geaya's sword and handaxe, Bargrivyek's white-tipped flail, and at the bottom, often touching the ground, the red-and-yellow whip of Khurgorbaeyag. Notably absent from this grouping are the symbols of the bugbear gods. Instead, severed heads hang in bunches around the block or are impaled upon spikes, their eyelids removed and mouths open. These honor the bugbears' deities, Hruggek and Grankhul, and their separate but subordinate positions in Maglubiyet's rule.": "在街区附近矗立着一根柱子或一个架子，上面摆放着各种代表地精诸神象征的武器，每件武器都是按照神的等级来摆放。马格卢比耶特的头人斧头总是最高的。然后是诺莫格-格亚的剑和手斧，巴格利耶克的白头连枷，最后是胡戈尔巴耶格的红黄相间的鞭子，经常接触到地面。值得注意的是，这一组中没有虫神的标志。取而代之的是成串的断头挂在街区周围，或被钉在尖刺上，眼皮被摘掉，嘴巴张开。这些都是为了纪念虫族的神灵--赫鲁格克和格兰库尔，以及他们在马格鲁比耶特的统治中独立但从属的地位。",
	"Hags are crones who represent corruption of ideals and goals, and they delight in seeing the innocent and good brought low. They are inhuman monsters, their forms twisted by evil. Shapechangers and blasphemers, they ally with other hags to form magical covens with extra powers. They collect and remember secret knowledge that is better lost and forgotten. Desperate mortals come to them looking for advice, only to have their requests fulfilled in ways that bring great suffering to themselves and their loved ones.": "女巫是代表理想和目标的堕落的女巫，她们乐于看到无辜和善良的人被贬低。他们是非人的怪物，他们的形态被邪恶所扭曲。她们是变形者和亵渎者，她们与其他女巫结盟，组成具有额外力量的魔法团体。她们收集并记住那些最好丢失和遗忘的秘密知识。绝望的凡人来找她们寻求建议，但她们的要求却以给自己和亲人带来巨大痛苦的方式得到满足。",
	"Hags are mysterious, unfathomable, and dangerous, especially from the viewpoint of mortals. One day a hag might be stealing and eating children that wander into the woods, on another day she might be making lewd jokes to adventurers asking her for advice, and the next she might be uprooting saplings to make a fence around her home for impaling intruders.": "女巫是神秘的、深不可测的、危险的，特别是从凡人的角度来看。有一天，女巫可能会偷吃误入森林的儿童，另一天，她可能会对向她征求意见的冒险者开淫秽的玩笑，而下一天，她可能会拔掉树苗，在她家周围做一个栅栏，用来刺杀入侵者。",
	"It is nearly impossible to predict how a hag will act from day to day, sometimes moment to moment, which is why folk with any wisdom at all give hags a wide berth.": "几乎不可能预测一个巫婆从一天到一天，有时从一刻到一刻会如何行动，这就是为什么有任何智慧的民间人士都对巫婆敬而远之。",
	"Hags perceive ugliness as beauty, and vice versa. They revel in having a hideous appearance and sometimes go out of their way \"improve\" upon it by picking at sores, wearing skins and bones as decoration, and rubbing refuse and dirt into their hair and clothing.": "巫婆把丑陋视为美丽，反之亦然。他们陶醉于自己丑陋的外表，有时会不顾一切地 \"改善 \"它，如抠疮，穿皮和骨头作为装饰，把垃圾和污垢揉进头发和衣服。",
	"Because both the Seelie Court and the Unseelie Court appreciate and revere true beauty among the fey, hags are almost never found in either place. The Summer Queen and the Queen of Air and Darkness recognize that hags have valuable knowledge and impressive magic, but they can't abide the stain on the beauty of their surroundings, so most hags are excluded from both courts. The rare few accepted as courtiers are either so influential that their entry can't be refused, or young and humble enough to be willing to use magic to put on a prettier appearance. Other hags aren't upset by their exclusion; they like to be left alone to their own schemes, not constrained by a fey queen's whims, and to be able to talk out of both sides of their mouths.": "由于塞里宫廷和非塞里宫廷都欣赏并推崇精灵中的真正之美，所以在这两个地方几乎都没有发现女巫。夏日女王和空气与黑暗女王承认女巫拥有宝贵的知识和令人印象深刻的魔法，但他们不能容忍女巫玷污他们周围的美景，所以大多数女巫被排除在这两个法庭之外。少数被接受为朝臣的人要么是非常有影响力，以至于他们的进入不能被拒绝，要么是足够年轻和谦卑，愿意使用魔法来装出更漂亮的外表。其他女巫并不为自己被排除在外而感到不安；她们喜欢独自享受自己的计划，不受女巫的奇思妙想的约束，并且能够从自己的嘴里说出话来。",
	"Hags are virtually immortal, with a life span greater than that of even dragons and elves. The oldest, wisest, and most powerful hags are called \"grandmothers\" by other hags. Some grandmothers are nearly as powerful as some of the archfey.": "女巫几乎是不朽的，其寿命甚至比龙和精灵还要长。最年长、最睿智、最强大的女巫被其他女巫称为 \"祖母\"。有些祖母几乎和一些大帝一样强大。",
	"Hags of lower but still respectable status are called \"aunties.\" An auntie gains her status from being very old, a member of a powerful coven, directly serving a grandmother, or having many offspring (whether adopted or birthed).": "地位较低但仍受人尊敬的女巫被称为 \"姑妈\"。阿姨的地位来自于她的年龄很大，是强大的女巫团成员，直接为祖母服务，或者有很多后代（无论是收养还是生育）。",
	"Hags delight in corrupting others. They do so not by imposing their will or being outwardly violent, but by making sinister bargains with those who seek their aid. This desire to orchestrate the downfall of others is why so many hags make their homes near humanoid settlements, which gives them a ready supply of creatures to tantalize and torment.": "女巫乐于腐蚀他人。他们不是通过强加自己的意志或外表上的暴力，而是通过与那些寻求他们帮助的人进行阴险的交易来做到这一点。这种策划他人堕落的欲望是许多女巫在人形定居点附近安家的原因，这使他们有现成的生物可供挑逗和折磨。",
	"Folk with nowhere else to turn are some of a hag's best customers. A farmer with a philandering spouse might seek out the local hag for a potion to make the spouse faithful again. The mayor with a demented father might ask the hag for something that makes him lucid again. A merchant whose child is deathly ill might go to the hag for a cure. The common element in these situations is that the mortals approach the hag for help; despite knowing that she is evil and dangerous, they are desperate enough to risk making a bargain with her, or foolish enough to think they can persuade her to be helpful without getting something in return.": "无处可去的人是巫婆最好的顾客。配偶不忠的农民可能会找当地巫婆要一种药水，使其配偶再次忠诚。有一个精神错乱的父亲的市长可能会向巫婆寻求能让他重新清醒的东西。孩子病重的商人可能会去找巫婆寻求治疗。这些情况的共同点是，凡人向女巫寻求帮助；尽管知道她是邪恶和危险的，但他们还是不顾一切地冒险与她讨价还价，或者愚蠢地认为他们可以说服她提供帮助而没有得到什么回报。",
	"Hags make bargains differently from how devils operate. A devil might approach a mortal to make a deal because it wants the individual to become tainted with evil, so that when the victim dies its soul goes to the Nine Hells. Hags are usually content to wait and conduct their own business, allowing mortals to come to them when the perceived need is great enough. Instead of being interested in a mortal's soul, a hag wants to bring the mortal low during its life as compensation for fulfilling her end of the bargain. Devils barter with the soul as the commodity; hags barter because they enjoy making people miserable. Night hags, as fey turned fiends, use aspects of both methods-corrupting a mortal's dreams until the creature commits enough evil acts that she can claim its soul.": "巫师进行交易的方式与魔鬼的操作方式不同。魔鬼可能会找凡人做交易，因为它想让这个人染上邪恶的色彩，这样当受害者死后，其灵魂就会进入九层地狱。女巫通常满足于等待和处理自己的业务，当感知到的需求足够大时，允许凡人来找他们。巫婆不是对凡人的灵魂感兴趣，而是想在凡人的一生中把他带入低谷，作为履行她那部分交易的补偿。魔鬼以灵魂为商品进行交易；女巫的交易是因为她们喜欢让人痛苦。夜妖，作为变成恶魔的精灵，使用这两种方法的各个方面--破坏凡人的梦境，直到该生物犯下足够多的邪恶行为，她就可以索取其灵魂。",
	"As much as she enjoys offering and enforcing her bargains, a hag rarely goes out looking for people to make deals with because she knows that someone coming to her puts her in a position of power. The visitor likely had to approach the hag in secret for fear of causing an uproar in town, and is probably eager to return home before being missed, which adds time pressure to the process and tips the balance more in the hag's favor. All these factors contribute to the hag's being able to set her terms for the bargain, presenting an offer that appears reasonable, and perhaps seems to have a tempting loophole or two that the mortal could exploit.": "尽管她喜欢提供和执行她的交易，但巫婆很少出去找人做交易，因为她知道有人来找她，就会使她处于权力地位。来访者很可能不得不秘密地接近女巫，因为害怕在镇上引起骚动，而且很可能急于在被错过之前回家，这给这个过程增加了时间压力，使天平更有利于女巫。所有这些因素都有助于女巫能够设定她的交易条件，提出一个看似合理的报价，也许看起来有一两个诱人的漏洞，凡人可以利用。",
	"Hags understand mortal desires and vices, and know how to manipulate people by preying on those qualities. A hag's bargain might bring success and prosperity for a time, but eventually have a drawback or side effect that makes the mortal resent the agreement and seek to get out of it. The philandering spouse now happy to stay home might grow slothful, the mayor's father might turn violent after regaining his senses, and the merchant's child might relapse if not treated again every few months.": "巫婆了解凡人的欲望和恶习，并知道如何通过利用这些品质来操纵人们。女巫的交易可能会在一段时间内带来成功和繁荣，但最终会有一个缺点或副作用，使凡人反感协议并试图摆脱它。现在乐于呆在家里的花心配偶可能会变得懒惰，市长的父亲在恢复理智后可能会变得暴力，而商人的孩子如果每隔几个月不重新治疗，可能会复发。",
	"Even when a bargain turns sour for a mortal and other people in town hear about or see the person's misfortune, the hag will eventually attract new customers. Other people will come to believe that they can outsmart the hag, or that their need is simple and can't be perverted, or that the earlier victims got too greedy when they were proposing a deal. Even if only one or two people make deals with a hag every year, over time many unfortunates can come under her sway-and she remembers the exact terms of every one of those bargains.": "即使当一个凡人的交易变质，镇上的其他人听到或看到这个人的不幸，巫婆最终会吸引新的顾客。其他人会相信他们可以胜过巫婆，或者他们的需求很简单，不会被扭曲，或者先前的受害者在提出交易时太贪婪了。即使每年只有一两个人与巫婆做交易，随着时间的推移，许多不幸的人都会受到她的影响，而且她还记得每一个交易的确切条款。",
	"Although it could be argued that there's no good time to make a bargain with a hag, mortals are more likely to get away in good shape if they offer up something a hag needs or wants. In such a case, the hag might even start the bidding.": "虽然可以说与巫婆讨价还价没有好时机，但如果凡人提供巫婆需要或想要的东西，他们更有可能以良好的状态离开。在这种情况下，巫婆甚至可能开始竞价。",
	"A hag that faces a serious threat from enemies will not hesitate to use promises or bribes to defuse the situation. For instance, most treasures in a hag's lair are useless without her knowledge of how to identify and handle them, so she might offer to provide such information  in return for her life. If an item later backfires on the one who uses it, or turns out to be cursed in some way, that's just another lesson in why never to never threaten or trust a hag.": "面对敌人的严重威胁，巫婆会毫不犹豫地使用承诺或贿赂来化解局势。例如，如果没有她关于如何识别和处理这些物品的知识，巫婆巢穴中的大多数宝物都是无用的，所以她可能会提出提供这些信息以换取她的生命。如果一件物品后来在使用它的人身上起了反作用，或者被证明在某种程度上被诅咒了，这只是另一个教训，说明为什么永远不要威胁或信任巫婆。",
	"Hags are curious about other creatures of power. They enjoy receiving news and gossip about other hags and influential creatures such as dragons, demons, genies, and certain mortals. Offering a hag accurate information  of this sort as part of a bargain earns a small measure of her respect, and might make her more receptive to the idea of a \"fair\" deal.": "女巫对其他有权力的生物感到好奇。她们喜欢接收关于其他女巫和有影响力的生物的消息和八卦，如龙、恶魔、精灵和某些凡人。向女巫提供这种准确的信息作为交易的一部分，可以赢得她的一点尊重，并可能使她更容易接受 \"公平 \"交易的想法。",
	"When a hag bargains with other creatures of the Feywild, rather than mortals, she approaches the situation with a more respectful attitude. She realizes that the creatures of her native realm are more powerful than common humanoids and therefore more dangerous when disappointed or angered by a deal gone bad. Fey are also long-lived and thus have more time to retaliate against the hag, whereas most humanoids die within a few short decades. These considerations don't mean that hags are automatically pleasant in dealings with other fey, just that they aren't as blatant or demanding in the bargains they offer; hags know exactly how much they can get away with, and they like pushing the limits of what others will tolerate.": "当巫婆与其他精灵世界的生物而不是凡人讨价还价时，她会以一种更尊重的态度对待这种情况。她意识到，她故乡的生物比普通人类更强大，因此在因交易失败而感到失望或愤怒时更危险。费伊人也很长寿，因此有更多的时间来报复巫婆，而大多数人形生物在短短几十年内就会死亡。这些考虑并不意味着女巫在与其他费伊人打交道时自动变得愉快，只是他们在提供交易时不那么明目张胆或苛刻；女巫清楚地知道自己能得到多少好处，而且他们喜欢挑战别人能容忍的极限。",
	"When a hag is generous with her help or requires only a simple task as payment, that's no guarantee that the deal will turn out as expected for both parties. By offering a proposal that seems, or actually is, fair, chances are that the hag is pursuing a hidden agenda. She still wants to set events into motion that benefit her or bring about the downfall of another, but she does so in an indirect way that has no obvious connection to her. A bargain as simple as a villager agreeing to deliver a mysterious letter at a crossroads at noon on a certain day could be the key to ruining the mortal's life. The hag's reasons might not become apparent for years or even decades, or won't be meaningful except under specific circumstances, such as an auspicious birth or a climactic encounter with a dangerous villain. Even when she's offering a deal that seems to have no downside, a hag is always secretive about her motivations, the reasons for the payments she requires, or how these things benefit her.": "当一个巫婆慷慨地提供帮助或只要求一个简单的任务作为报酬时，这并不能保证交易的结果会符合双方的预期。通过提供一个看起来，或者实际上是公平的建议，有可能是巫婆在追求一个隐藏的议程。她仍然想让事件发生，使她受益，或者使另一个人垮台，但她是以一种间接的方式，与她没有明显的联系。一个简单的交易，如一个村民同意在某一天的中午在十字路口送一封神秘的信，可能是毁掉凡人生活的关键。巫婆的理由可能在几年甚至几十年后才会显现出来，或者在特定情况下才会有意义，比如一个吉利的出生或与一个危险的恶棍的高潮相遇。即使她提供的交易似乎没有什么坏处，巫婆也总是对她的动机、她所要求的报酬的原因、或者这些东西对她有什么好处保密。",
	"A hag that spends a long time in close proximity to a human settlement often depletes the community of good-hearted folk as they succumb to her evil and selfish plans. The mood of the town becomes unwelcoming, grim, moody, or outright hostile toward newcomers and travelers. Even after a hag has done her worst in such a place, she maintains leverage over her victims by holding out the prospect that someday she will undo the curses that she has lain on them. For that reason, the local leaders won't allow any outsiders to act against her (which includes sabotaging adventurers who might decide to confront her).": "一个在人类居住区附近待了很长时间的巫婆，往往会耗尽社区中心地善良的人们，因为他们屈服于她邪恶和自私的计划。城镇的气氛变得不受欢迎、阴沉、喜怒无常，或者对新来的人和旅行者有直接的敌意。即使巫婆在这样的地方做了最坏的打算，她仍然保持着对受害者的影响力，认为有一天她会解除她对他们的诅咒。出于这个原因，当地的领导人不允许任何外来者对她采取行动（包括破坏那些可能决定与她对抗的冒险者）。",
	"Even when a hag acts indifferently or friendly toward adventurers, inside she is still a twisted fey creature, and she doesn't give two coppers about what anyone else thinks or wants. She might casually comment about how easily a visitor would fit in her cauldron or make a blunt sexual comment about a guest. When a mortal visits a hag, the experience should be nerve-wracking, uncomfortable, and risky; at any point the hag might lose her temper and decide to pull out someone's fingernails with her iron teeth.": "即使女巫对冒险者表现得冷漠或友好，她的内心仍然是一个扭曲的精灵生物，她不会对其他人的想法或要求给予两个铜板。她可能会随意地评论一个来访者在她的大锅里有多容易装下，或者对一个客人发表直率的性评论。当一个凡人拜访女巫时，这种经历应该是紧张的、不舒服的、有风险的；在任何时候，女巫都可能发脾气，决定用她的铁牙拔掉某人的指甲。",
	"Hags look upon younger creatures from the perspective of a cantankerous grandparent who no longer cares what anyone thinks-set in her ways, free to speak her mind, and not afraid to bring down punishment if pushed too far. Hags enjoy meddling with other people's lives, like busybodies with cruel intentions. Any time a hag agrees to help someone, the bargain includes a price to be paid, plus a hidden plan by which she sets the mortal up to fail, or a way that she gains leverage (whether over the deal-maker or someone else).": "女巫从一个不再关心别人想法的顽固的祖父母的角度来看待年轻的生物，她有自己的方式，可以自由地说出自己的想法，如果被逼得太紧，也不怕带来惩罚。女巫喜欢插手别人的生活，就像有残酷意图的忙碌者。任何时候，女巫同意帮助某人，交易包括要付出的代价，再加上一个隐藏的计划，她通过这个计划使凡人失败，或者她获得杠杆作用的方式（无论是对交易人还是其他人）。",
	"When a hag is presented with an unusual spell, a rare magic item, or a person who has a strange magical gift, she will sniff it, shake it, listen to it, taste it, murmur odd statements to herself, and mentally place a value on the merchandise. Hags aren't subtle about showing their intent at such times, and one might snatch away the offering so she can examine it more closely, even if this makes it obvious she is interested. If she doesn't have anything else like it, or can think of a use for it, or if having it means a rival can't get her hands on it, she'll value the offering highly. A visitor who offers a desirable item as a bribe or a gift is more likely to get a fair deal from the hag, or at least likely to suffer less when the true price of the deal is revealed.": "当一个巫婆收到不寻常的咒语、稀有的魔法物品或拥有奇怪魔法天赋的人时，她会闻一闻、摇一摇、听一听、尝一尝，对自己喃喃自语一些奇怪的说法，并在心理上对商品进行估值。在这种时候，女巫并不隐晦地表现出她们的意图，一个人可能会抢走供品，以便她能更仔细地检查它，即使这使她明显地感兴趣。如果她没有其他类似的东西，或者能想到它的用途，或者如果拥有它意味着对手无法得到它，她会高度重视这个礼物。访客如果提供一件理想的物品作为贿赂或礼物，就更有可能从巫婆那里得到公平的交易，或者至少在交易的真实价格被揭露时，可能会少受一些损失。",
	"If a hag's life is threatened, she will pretend to be weak and helpless if she thinks it will spare her life or buy her time to retaliate or escape. She'll use dangerous treasures as bribes, not telling about their curses or side effects. She will lie and deceive and try to turn her enemies against each other, playing up their guilt and fear and jealousy to tear them apart from the inside. She is older, smarter, and more shrewd than any mortal who dares to threaten her.": "如果女巫的生命受到威胁，她会假装虚弱和无助，如果她认为这能让她免于一死，或为她争取时间进行报复或逃跑。她会用危险的宝物作为贿赂，不告诉他们的诅咒或副作用。她会撒谎和欺骗，并试图让她的敌人互相对立，发挥他们的内疚、恐惧和嫉妒，从内部将他们撕碎。她比任何敢于威胁她的凡人更年长、更聪明、更精明。",
	"Hags prefer to cajole and bargain rather than confront someone with actual violence; they reserve their aggressive outbursts for situations where they are overwhelmingly more powerful than their opponents (such as when attacking children) or have an unfair advantage (such as when their enemy is asleep). Although a hag can always resort to attacking with her claws, if it comes to that then something has gone very wrong with her plans.": "女巫更喜欢劝说和讨价还价，而不是用实际的暴力与人对抗；她们把攻击性的爆发保留在她们比对手强大得多的情况下（如攻击儿童时）或拥有不公平的优势时（如敌人在睡觉）。虽然女巫总是可以用她的爪子进行攻击，但如果到了那一步，那么她的计划就出了大问题。",
	"I have made subtle insults into an art form.": "我已经把微妙的侮辱变成了一种艺术形式。",
	"I always act unpleasant so others never learn of my secret affections.": "我总是表现得很不愉快，所以别人永远不会知道我的秘密感情。",
	"I enjoy wagers as parts of my bargains, which increase the risk and the stakes.": "我喜欢把赌注作为我讨价还价的一部分，这增加了风险和赌注。",
	"I laugh at my own jokes-the darker, the better.": "我为自己的笑话发笑--越黑暗越好。",

	"Over the course of a seemingly endless lifetime, a hag typically discovers or creates several unusual ways to use magic. The weird magic that hags can call upon comes in a number of forms and with various means of activation. Even those who have read scholarly books about hag lore can't predict what a particular hag might have up her sleeve.": "在看似无尽的一生中，女巫通常会发现或创造一些不寻常的方法来使用魔法。女巫可以调用的怪异魔法有多种形式，有各种激活方式。即使是那些读过有关女巫传说的学术书籍的人，也无法预测一个特定的女巫可能有什么袖子。",
	"A grandmother or some other hag of great age and renown might know unique rituals that can temporarily or permanently alter or transform a creature, bring back the dead for a limited time, rewrite memories, or siphon emotions. At the other end of the spectrum, even a hag without lofty status is likely to have strange, single-use items that don't emulate common spells or even follow the normal rules of magic. For inspiration in devising the effects of such weird items, see \"Charms\" in chapter 7 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide.}": "一个祖母或其他一些年龄大、名气大的巫婆可能知道一些独特的仪式，可以暂时或永久地改变或改造一个生物，在有限的时间内让死者复活，改写记忆，或吸走情感。在光谱的另一端，即使是一个没有崇高地位的巫婆也可能拥有奇怪的、一次性的物品，它们不模仿普通的法术，甚至不遵循正常的魔法规则。关于设计这类奇怪物品的效果的灵感，请参见《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide.}》第七章的 \"符咒\"。",
	"If you want a hag to use a weird object of this sort in a combat situation, provide her with an item that produces a CR-appropriate spell effect when the hag manipulates or activates it. The effect might be a benefit to herself or an attack against her enemies. For example, a green hag (CR 3) might smash an ornate hand mirror, producing a cloud of glass shards that damages creatures like {@spell cloud of daggers} (a 2nd-level spell). She might instead uncork a bottle of wasps that surround her and stitch up her wounds with their stingers, healing her as {@spell cure wounds} (cast as a 2nd-level spell). Or she could take a mummified toad from her pocket and throw it into her cauldron, which immediately spews out inky blackness equivalent to {@spell darkness} (a 2nd-level spell).": "如果你想让巫婆在战斗中使用这种奇怪的物品，请为她提供一个物品，当巫婆操纵或激活它时，会产生一个与CR相适应的法术效果。这个效果可能是对她自己的好处，也可能是对她的敌人的一种攻击。例如，一个绿袍人（CR3）可能会砸碎一面华丽的手镜，产生一团玻璃碎片，对生物造成伤害，如（%0%）（一个2级法术）。她可能会打开一瓶黄蜂的瓶子，这些黄蜂围绕着她，用它们的刺缝合她的伤口，对她的治疗是（%1%）（作为二级法术施放）。或者她可以从口袋里拿出一只木乃伊蟾蜍，把它扔进她的大锅里，大锅立刻喷出相当于{@spell darkness}（二级法术）的墨色黑气。",
	"A hag carefully shepherds her use of weird magic because the items in her repertoire are often impossible to duplicate or replace. To reflect this fact, a hag should be able to use weird magic only once or twice per encounter in her lair, or only once per encounter if she is elsewhere. A hag who is expecting a fight might be better prepared and able (or willing) to use weird magic one additional time per encounter.": "一个巫婆会小心翼翼地使用怪异的魔法，因为她剧目中的物品通常是无法复制或替换的。为了反映这一事实，一个巫婆在她的巢穴中每次遭遇时应该只能使用一到两次怪异的魔法，如果她在其他地方，每次遭遇时也只能使用一次。一个期待战斗的女巫可能准备得更好，能够（或愿意）在每次遭遇时多使用一次古怪的魔法。",
	"If a hag is faced with mortal peril, all thoughts of conserving her resources vanish-she will use any weird magic at her disposal if it helps her stay alive. After all, a hag that's not dead has a virtually limitless lifetime to replace what was spent. No matter how hard it was to acquire that jar of death slugs, or that book on how to invoke the razor wind, or the runestone containing the three syllables for crystallizing blood, it is better to use such things than to risk death by not doing so.": "如果一个巫婆面临致命的危险，所有节约资源的想法都会消失--如果能帮助她活下去，她会使用她所掌握的任何奇怪的魔法。毕竟，一个没死的巫婆几乎有无限的生命来补充所花费的东西。无论获得那罐死亡蛞蝓有多难，或那本关于如何召唤剃刀风的书，或含有结晶血液的三个音节的符石，使用这些东西总比不这样做而冒着死亡的风险要好。",
	"Many stories tell of hags using strange, enchanted creatures and objects for travel, and most of those stories are accurate.": "许多故事讲述了女巫利用奇怪的、被施了魔法的生物和物品进行旅行，而这些故事大多是准确的。",
	"Instead of the usual horse or pony, a hag might ride astride a giant pig, a goat, or a cow. It's not unknown for a hag to use a sentient creature as a mount, perhaps as the result of a bargain that creature struck with her. A hag that wants to humiliate a mortal hero might require that hero to serve as her mount for a year as part of fulfilling her bargain. The giant raven that carries a hag aloft could be in actuality one of the hag's victims transformed because that individual tried to go back on its deal with her.": "巫婆可能会骑着一头大猪、一只山羊或一头牛，而不是通常的马或小马。巫婆使用有生命的生物作为坐骑也不是不可能的，这也许是该生物与她达成交易的结果。一个想要羞辱一个凡人英雄的巫婆可能会要求那个英雄当她的坐骑一年，作为履行交易的一部分。将女巫高高举起的巨大乌鸦实际上可能是女巫的受害者之一，因为这个人试图违背与她的交易而被转化。",
	"Some hags prefer nonliving conveyances from time to time, and their imagination in this regard knows no bounds. A hag might happily animate and \"spruce up\" any sort of object she can tailor for the purpose, such as a clay statue, a huge woven basket, a cauldron, a butter churn, a giant bird's nest, a mortar and pestle, or a tombstone.": "有些女巫时常喜欢非生命的运输工具，她们在这方面的想象力是无止境的。一个女巫可能会很高兴地将任何一种她能为之量身定做的物体活化和 \"装饰 \"起来，如泥塑、巨大的编织篮、大锅、黄油搅拌器、巨大的鸟巢、铁杵或墓碑。",
	"Usually only the hag that obtained or created them can use her mounts and vehicles. They obey only her commands, and their magic responds only to her will.": "通常只有获得或创造它们的巫婆才能使用她的坐骑和车辆。它们只服从她的命令，它们的魔法也只对她的意志做出反应。",
	"If a hag allows any other creature to use one of them as part of a bargain, she must be expecting an immense return on her investment.": "如果一个巫婆允许任何其他生物使用其中一个作为交易的一部分，她一定是在期待她的投资获得巨大的回报。",
	"Each of the five common types of hags prefers a particular  environment. It is possible to find a hag in unusual terrain, perhaps if she is traveling or is part of a coven along with two local hags. Grandmothers and aunties are more likely than other hags to take up permanent residence in unfriendly terrain, since their long-range plans sometimes require spending decades or years in a certain area before returning home.": "五种常见的女巫类型中的每一种都喜欢一个特定的环境。有可能在不寻常的地形找到一个女巫，也许她正在旅行或与两个当地女巫一起成为女巫会的一部分。祖母和阿姨比其他女巫更有可能在不友好的地形上长期居住，因为她们的长期计划有时需要在某个地区呆上几十年或几年才回家。",
	"live in mountains or hills. The terrain is easy for them to navigate because they are the most physically capable hags. Even with her hunched posture, an annis hag is as tall as an ogre. Her skin is bruise-blue or black and her claws are like rusty blades. Annis hags love tormenting the weak and fearful, and seeing others feel fear. Statistics for the annis hag appear in chapter 3 of this book.": "居住在山区或丘陵。这种地形对她们来说很容易驾驭，因为她们是最有体力的女巫。即使是弯腰驼背的姿势，阿尼斯女巫也和食人魔一样高。她的皮肤是青蓝色或黑色的，她的爪子像生锈的刀片。Annis hag喜欢折磨软弱和恐惧的人，并看到其他人感到恐惧。Annis hag的统计数字出现在本书的第三章。",
	"live in wintry lands, favoring snow-covered mountain peaks. They are gaunt, have blue-white skin, white hair, and are known for their gray wooden staffs that give them access to extraordinary ice magic. Bheur hags love seeing mortals freeze to death and have little if any room in their hearts for kin and community. Statistics for the bheur hag appear in chapter 3 of this book.": "生活在寒冷的土地上，喜欢被雪覆盖的山峰。他们面容憔悴，拥有蓝白色的皮肤和白色的头发，并以他们的灰色木杖而闻名，这些木杖使他们能够使用非凡的冰魔法。布尔哈格喜欢看到凡人被冻死，在他们心中几乎没有亲属和社区的空间。布尔哈格的统计数字出现在本书的第三章。",
	"inhabit dismal forests, swamps, and moors. A green hag's body, whether broad, narrow, fat, or thin, is topped with a tangled mane of hair. A green hag thrives on creating despair and tragedy in the lives of her victims, using her skill with illusion magic to help in this goal. Destroying the hopes of others brings her unbridled joy.": "居住在阴暗的森林、沼泽和荒野中。绿女巫的身体，无论是宽的、窄的、胖的还是瘦的，都顶着一头纠结的毛发。绿袍人以在她的受害者的生活中制造绝望和悲剧为乐，利用她的幻术技能来帮助实现这一目标。摧毁他人的希望会给她带来无尽的快乐。",
	"have left behind the world of the fey to roam the Lower Planes. They have dark blue or purple-black skin with white or light-colored eyes and thin, curving horns. A night hag is as least as tall as a human, and most are stout or have a medium build rather than being thin or emaciated. Night hags enjoy corrupting the dreams of good people, compromising the ideals of their victims to get them to eventually perform evil acts. Then, when a victim dies, the hag can harvest its soul and bring it to Hades.": "他们离开了精灵的世界，在下层世界游荡。他们有深蓝色或紫黑色的皮肤，有白色或浅色的眼睛，有细而弯曲的角。夜行者至少和人类一样高，而且大多数人都很结实，或有中等身材，而不是消瘦或憔悴。夜妖喜欢腐蚀好人的梦想，损害受害者的理想，让他们最终实施邪恶行为。然后，当受害者死亡时，夜妖可以收获其灵魂并将其带到冥府。",
	"live underwater or on the shore, favoring bleak and despoiled places. They have pale skin like that of a fish, covered in scales, with glassy dead eyes and hair like lank seaweed. Sea hags are emaciated, but one might be tall or short, frail or large-boned. A sea hag hates beauty in any form and seeks to attack, deface, or corrupt it so it has the opposite effect on its viewers. One is more likely to defile the inspiring statue in a town square, making it into a symbol of fear and sorrow, than to destroy it outright.": "它们生活在水下或岸上，喜欢荒凉和被掠夺的地方。他们有像鱼一样苍白的皮肤，覆盖着鳞片，有一双玻璃般的死眼，头发像松软的海草。海巫师很憔悴，但可能是高的或矮的，虚弱的或大骨架的。海姬讨厌任何形式的美，并试图攻击、玷污或腐蚀它，以便对其观众产生相反的效果。一个人更有可能玷污城镇广场上鼓舞人心的雕像，使其成为恐惧和悲伤的象征，而不是直接摧毁它。",
	"It's commonly believed that five kinds of hags exist in the world (and beyond it). What's not so widely known is that some hags can change from one kind to another during their lives.": "人们普遍认为，世界上（以及世界之外）存在五种巫婆。不太广为人知的是，一些女巫在其一生中可以从一种变为另一种。",
	"A hag that lives long enough or has the necessary resources can alter her basic nature, leaving behind her old physiology and adopting that of a hag appropriate to the environment of her current home. She might accomplish this transformation through force of will over time, or faster with the help of a ritual or assistance from her coven. The reasons for making such a change are as varied as the personalities and goals of hags.": "一个活得够久或拥有必要资源的女巫可以改变她的基本本性，抛弃她原来的生理结构，采用适合她当前家园环境的女巫的生理结构。她可能通过长期的意志力来完成这一转变，或者在仪式的帮助下或在女巫会的协助下更快地完成这一转变。做出这种改变的原因与女巫的个性和目标一样多种多样。",
	"Hags are selfish by nature, and each one cherishes her independence-from the rest of the world as well as from other hags. At the same time, every hag recognizes that she and her sisters are kindred souls, like the members of a dark sorority or sisterhood.": "女巫的天性是自私的，每个人都珍惜自己的独立性--从世界的其他地方以及从其他女巫那里。同时，每个女巫都认识到她和她的姐妹们是同类的灵魂，就像一个黑暗的联谊会或姐妹会的成员。",
	"Even though hags don't like each other, they share knowledge and trade secrets, helping them to keep abreast of worldly events and possible dangers. Even a hag living in a remote, isolated location is aware of goings-on that involve her neighboring hags, whether through magical communication, personal visits, or mundane messengers such as birds. In most cases, these relationships with her sisters, though devoid of emotion, are the closest a hag comes to having friends.": "尽管女巫们彼此不喜欢对方，但她们分享知识和商业秘密，帮助她们了解世界上的事件和可能的危险。即使是住在偏远、与世隔绝的地方的女巫，也会知道涉及她的邻居女巫的事情，无论是通过魔法交流、个人访问，还是通过鸟类等世俗的使者。在大多数情况下，与她的姐妹们的这些关系，虽然没有感情，但却是女巫最接近于朋友的关系。",
	"When a hag is attacked or killed, other hags are likely to hear about it. If the victim was friendly with other hags, those responsible for her death might find themselves the target of retaliation. If the victim died while owing favors to another hag, that hag sees her killers as now responsible for the dead hag's debts. If the victim was unpopular or if other hags were indebted to her (and thus are happy to see her go), her killers might receive relatively cordial treatment from those other hags instead.": "当一个女巫被攻击或杀害时，其他女巫很可能会听说此事。如果受害者与其他巫师友好，那些对她的死亡负有责任的人可能会发现自己成为报复的目标。如果受害者是在欠另一个女巫的人情时死亡的，那个女巫就会认为杀她的人现在要对死去的女巫的债务负责。如果受害者不受欢迎，或者如果其他巫师欠她的债（因此很高兴看到她离开），那么杀她的人可能会从其他巫师那里得到相对友好的待遇。",
	"Every hag has a particular status relative to others of her kind and to hags of all sorts, based on age, abilities, influence, alliances, and experience, and is aware of her place (though not necessarily satisfied with it). The few grandmothers sit at the top of the hierarchy, a larger number of aunties are beneath that, and all other hags vie for prominence in a chaotic pecking order that no mortal can truly figure out. A hag that is known to associate  with an auntie has a higher status than a similarly powerful hag without such a connection, and a young hag born of a grandmother begins her existence already benefiting from a greater measure of respect and status.": "根据年龄、能力、影响力、联盟和经验，每个女巫都有相对于其他同类和各种女巫的特定地位，并意识到自己的位置（尽管不一定满意）。少数祖母坐在等级制度的顶端，下面有更多的阿姨，而所有其他巫婆在一个混乱的啄食顺序中争夺突出地位，没有凡人能够真正弄清楚。众所周知，与姨妈有联系的女巫比没有这种联系的同样强大的女巫有更高的地位，而祖母所生的年轻女巫在开始存在时已经受益于更大程度的尊重和地位。",
	"To a hag, the thought of sharing her home with other creatures-even other hags-is disgusting. She has nothing but dislike or disdain for anyone other than herself, and she loves being alone (except for the company of minions and other creatures under her sway). That's the ordinary state of affairs. But when a group of hags have a common goal or they seek greater power to combat a formidable threat, they suppress their basic nature and come together to do their work. The result is a coven.": "对女巫来说，与其他生物--甚至是其他女巫--分享她的家的想法是令人厌恶的。她对自己以外的人只有厌恶和不屑，她喜欢独处（除了奴才和其他受她支配的生物的陪伴）。这就是普通的状态。但是当一群女巫有一个共同的目标，或者她们寻求更大的力量来对抗一个可怕的威胁时，她们就会压制住自己的基本本性，走到一起完成她们的工作。其结果是一个巫师团。",
	"Being part of a coven gives each individual hag more magic and spellcasting ability, and to her these benefits offset the inconvenience and bickering that goes with living and working with other hags.": "作为巫师团的一部分，每个巫师都有更多的魔法和施法能力，对她来说，这些好处抵消了与其他巫师一起生活和工作所带来的不便和争吵。",
	"If a member of a coven is killed and the surviving members intend to keep the group from dissolving, they immediately attempt to recruit a replacement.": "如果一个巫师团的成员被杀，而幸存的成员打算保持团体不解散，他们会立即尝试招募一个替代者。",
	"This process involves each prospective member committing cruel acts with the aim of impressing the remaining coven members.": "这个过程中，每个潜在成员都要做出残酷的行为，目的是为了给其余的女巫团成员留下深刻印象。",
	"Adventurers who slay only one member of a coven might deal a blow to it in the short term, but later on the surrounding region is wracked with plagues, curses, and other disasters as the applicants attempt to outdo one another.": "冒险家们如果只杀死一个巫师团的成员，可能会在短期内对其造成打击，但随后周围地区就会被瘟疫、诅咒和其他灾难所困扰，因为申请者们试图超越对方。",
	"An unusually gifted mortal sorcerer, warlock, or wizard of a deeply evil nature might be invited to join a coven or allowed to compete for a vacancy. This arrangement is potentially a dangerous proposition for the mortal, but a pair of hags might agree to it if their needs are served. For instance, a human member of a coven makes an ideal spy and infiltrator in and around a humanoid  settlement.": "一个天赋异禀的凡人巫师、术士或天性邪恶的巫师可能会被邀请加入一个巫师团，或被允许竞争一个空缺的职位。这种安排对凡人来说可能是个危险的提议，但如果能满足他们的需要，一对巫师可能会同意。例如，一个巫师团的人类成员是一个理想的间谍和渗透者，可以在人族聚居地及其周围进行活动。",
	"Hags make more hags by snatching and devouring human infants, birthing daughters who turn into hags on entering the thirteenth year of their lives. Fortunately for humanity and the rest of the world, such an occurrence is rare.": "女巫通过抢夺和吞噬人类婴儿来制造更多的女巫，生下的女儿在进入生命的第13年时变成了女巫。对人类和世界其他地区来说，幸运的是，这种情况很少发生。",
	"Rarer still, but not unheard of, is for a hag to repeat this process twice or more in short succession, giving her multiple offspring of about the same age. She might do this to form a coven with two of her daughters, or to create a coven made up entirely of her offspring. Some hags cite ancient lore that suggests that if a hag consumes twins or triplets, her offspring might have additional, unusual abilities; similarly, devouring the seventh-born child of a seventh-born is said to be a way to pass on rare magic to the hag's daughter.": "更为罕见的是，但并非闻所未闻的是，一个巫婆在短时间内重复这个过程两次或更多次，让她有多个年龄相仿的后代。她可能会这样做，与她的两个女儿组成一个女巫团，或者创造一个完全由她的后代组成的女巫团。一些女巫引用古老的传说，认为如果一个女巫吞噬了双胞胎或三胞胎，她的后代可能会有额外的、不寻常的能力；同样，吞噬一个七胞胎的孩子据说是将罕见的魔法传给女巫的女儿的一种方法。",
	"Some covens gather for a specific purpose, such as to defeat a champion of good, to serve as oracles for the delivery of baleful prophecies, or to corrupt a pristine wilderness. In such a case, because the coven strives to bend its magic to a more directed purpose, the members have different spells available for use with their Shared Spellcasting trait, usually focusing on a theme related to that purpose. Three examples of themed hag coven spell lists are given below.": "有些巫师团为了一个特定的目的而聚集在一起，比如打败一个善良的冠军，作为传递邪恶预言的神谕，或者腐蚀一个原始的荒野。在这种情况下，由于巫师团努力将其魔法屈服于一个更有指向性的目的，成员们有不同的法术可供他们的共享法术特质使用，通常集中在与该目的有关的主题上。下面给出了三个有主题的巫师团法术清单的例子。",

Hags and purveyors of witchcraft embrace the Rule of Three, as it is called: a coven has three members, they believe that good or evil magic returns upon its source threefold, and the casting of many spells requires the same words chanted three times.": "他们说，事情都是三分天下。好事情。坏事。奇怪的事情。巫婆和巫术的传播者接受所谓的 \"三法则\"：一个巫师团有三个成员，他们相信好的或邪恶的魔法会三倍于其来源，而许多法术的施展需要同样的话语念上三遍。",
	"Long ago, planar travelers came to recognize that many of the realms and layers of the multiverse are configured in multiples of three. It is possible that plane-traveling hags learned of this planar-based superstition and adapted it to their own uses, although some among the oldest hags claim to have invented the concept or at least named it.": "很久以前，星球旅行者认识到，多元宇宙的许多领域和层次是以三的倍数配置的。有可能是星球旅行的女巫们了解到了这种基于星球的迷信，并将其改编为自己的用途，尽管最古老的女巫中有人声称发明了这个概念，或者至少是命名了它。",
	"No matter what form it takes, a hag's home is a manifestation of her basic nature. It is ugly, eerie, or unnerving in some way, often incorporating some aspect of decay, such as a dead tree, a ruined tower, or a menacing cave entrance that resembles a skull.": "无论采取什么形式，女巫的家都是她基本本性的体现。它在某种程度上是丑陋的、阴森的或令人不安的，通常包含了腐烂的某些方面，如一棵枯树、一座废墟般的塔，或一个像头骨一样的可怕的洞口。",
	"Whether naturally or by manufactured means, the lair is well defended from intrusion. It might be reachable only by a steep mountain path, or it might be surrounded by a fence the hag builds out of posts capped with magically warded skulls. Often, a lair reflects the outlook of its primary inhabitant-a murderous hag's home might be crafted to look like a coffin or a mausoleum, and that of a gluttonous one might look like a tavern or a gingerbread house. Because such places are convenient for them, sea hags often establish their lairs inside the hulls of wrecked or abandoned ships.": "无论是天然的还是人造的手段，巢穴都有很好的防御措施，以防止入侵。它可能只能通过一条陡峭的山路到达，也可能被女巫用带有魔法防护头骨的柱子建成的栅栏所包围。通常情况下，一个巢穴反映了其主要居住者的面貌--一个凶残的女巫的家可能被制作成棺材或陵墓的样子，而一个贪吃的女巫的家可能看起来像一个小酒馆或姜饼屋。因为这些地方对他们来说很方便，海妖经常在失事或废弃的船只的船体中建立自己的巢穴。",
	"Many hags settle in places where the barriers between the mortal world and the Feywild are thin, making it easy for them to interact and bargain with creatures of both realms. Other popular choices are a place where the ambient energy augments certain kinds of magic, a site related to death such as a burial ground, and within a ring of fallen standing stones that still resonate with ancient power. In order to facilitate bargaining with mortals, the home must be near enough to a populated area that it attracts occasional visitors, but not so close that a community would see the hag's presence as a threat and try to defeat her or drive her off.": "许多女巫定居在凡人世界和精灵世界之间的壁垒很薄的地方，这使她们很容易与两个领域的生物互动和讨价还价。其他受欢迎的选择是环境能量能增强某些种类的魔法的地方，与死亡有关的地方，如埋葬地，以及仍能与古代力量产生共鸣的堕落石环内。为了方便与凡人讨价还价，住所必须足够靠近人口密集区，以吸引偶尔的访客，但又不能太近，以至于社区会将巫婆的存在视为一种威胁，并试图击败她或将她赶走。",
	"A hag's home is cluttered with mundane items, caged creatures, oddities, objects that hint of a magical purpose, preserved specimens, scraps of lore, and curiosities that have a supernatural origin but aren't inherently magical. For a selection of strange hag treasures, see the \"One-of-a-Kind Objects\" section later in this chapter.": "老巫婆的家里堆满了平凡的物品、笼子里的生物、古怪的东西、暗示有魔法用途的物品、保存的标本、传说的碎片，以及有超自然起源但本质上没有魔法的奇物。关于奇怪的巫婆宝物的选择，请参见本章后面的 \"独一无二的物品 \"部分。",
	"A hag always has an escape plan, in case ambitious do-gooders try to turn her home into her final resting place. If she is outmatched, or wants to vacate her lair quickly for some other reason, she uses a mix of her innate spellcasting, rare magic, guile, and the assistance of minions to get away. Most hags have three plans prepared: one for general threats and two others for specific likely scenarios, such as \"They've set the house on fire\" or \"A necromancer with undead are attacking.\"": "巫婆总是有一个逃跑计划，以防野心勃勃的好人试图把她的家变成她最后的安息之地。如果她不敌，或者因为其他原因想要迅速离开她的巢穴，她会混合使用她天生的法术、罕见的魔法、诡计，以及爪牙的协助来逃跑。大多数女巫都准备了三个计划：一个是针对一般的威胁，另外两个是针对具体的可能情况，比如 \"他们把房子烧了 \"或 \"一个死灵法师带着亡灵在进攻\"。",
	"If a hag is forced to resort to such measures, she immediately begins to plot her retaliation against those that caused her to flee. Like a vampire or a demon, a hag has a long life over which to exact her vengeance, and no dish of revenge is sweeter than one served cold and to the next three generations of her enemy's family.": "如果一个巫婆被迫采取这种措施，她会立即开始策划对那些导致她逃离的人进行报复。像吸血鬼或恶魔一样，女巫有很长的生命来实施她的复仇，没有什么复仇的菜肴比冷盘和对她的敌人的下三代的复仇更甜。",
	"If a hag is a grandmother, she gains a set of lair actions appropriate to her nature, knowledge, and history. A coven that includes a grandmother can use her lair actions as well, but the grandmother's will prevails-if one of the coven attempts this sort of action and the grandmother disapproves, nothing happens. A powerful auntie (or her coven) might also have access to lair actions like these, but only at certain times of the year or when the influence of the Feywild is strong.": "如果一个巫婆是祖母，她会获得一套适合她的性质、知识和历史的巢穴行动。包括祖母在内的女巫团也可以使用她的巢穴行动，但祖母的意志占上风--如果女巫团中有人试图采取这种行动，而祖母不同意，则什么也不会发生。一个强大的阿姨（或她的女巫团）也可以使用类似的巢穴行动，但只在一年中的某些时候，或在女巫团的影响很强的时候。",
	"The following lair actions are options for grandmothers and powerful aunties. Grandmothers usually have three to five lair actions, aunties usually only one (if they have any at all). Unless otherwise noted, any lair action that requires a creature to make a saving throw uses the save DC of the hag's most powerful ability.": "下面的巢穴行动是祖母和强大的阿姨们的选择。祖母通常有三到五个巢穴行动，阿姨通常只有一个（如果她们有任何行动的话）。除非另有说明，任何需要生物进行蓄力的巢穴行动都使用巫婆最强大的能力的蓄力DC。",
	"On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hag can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:": "在主动权计数20时（失去主动权的平局），巫婆可以采取巢穴行动，造成下列效果之一，但不能连续两轮使用同一效果。",
	"Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the hag can pass through solid walls, doors, ceilings, and floors as if the surfaces weren't there.": "在下一轮主动性计数20之前，女巫可以穿过坚固的墙壁、门、天花板和地板，就像这些表面不存在一样。",
	"The hag targets any number of doors and windows that she can see, causing each one to either open or close as she wishes. Closed doors can be magically locked (requiring a successful DC 20 Strength check to force open) until she chooses to make them unlocked, or until she uses this lair action again to open them.": "女巫以她能看到的任何数量的门和窗为目标，使每个门和窗按她的意愿打开或关闭。关闭的门可以被神奇地锁住（需要成功的DC20力量检查才能强行打开），直到她选择使它们解锁，或者直到她再次使用这个巢穴行动来打开它们。",
	"A powerful {@b annis hag} might have the following additional lair action:": "一个强大的（%0%）可能有以下额外的巢穴行动。",
	"The hag creates a thick cloud of caustic black smoke that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point she can see within 120 feet her. The cloud lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures and objects in or behind the smoke are heavily obscured. A creature that enters the cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 ({@dice 3d6}) acid damage.": "巫婆创造了一团厚厚的腐蚀性黑烟，以她能看到的120英尺范围内的一个点为中心，充满了一个半径为20英尺的球体。烟雾持续到下一回合的主动性计数20。烟雾中或背后的生物和物体都被严重遮蔽。在一个回合中第一次进入云层的生物或在那里开始其回合的生物会受到10({@dice 3d6})酸的伤害。",

	"The hag creates a blizzard in a 40-foot-high, 20-foot radius cylinder centered on a point she can see within 120 feet of her. The effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. The blizzard lightly obscures every creature and object in the area for the duration. A creature that enters the blizzard for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there is blinded until initiative count 20 on the next round.": "女巫在一个40英尺高、20英尺半径的圆柱体中，以她能看到的120英尺范围内的一个点为中心，制造一场暴风雪。这个效果一直持续到下一轮的主动性计数20。在持续时间内，暴风雪会轻度遮蔽该区域内的所有生物和物体。在一个回合中第一次进入暴风雪的生物或在那里开始它的回合的生物会被蒙蔽，直到下一回合的主动性计数20。",
	"A powerful {@b green hag} might have the following additional lair action:": "一个强大的（%0%）可能有以下额外的巢穴行动。",
	"The hag creates an illusory duplicate of herself, which appears in its own space. As long as she can see her duplicate, the hag can move it a distance equal to her walking speed as well as make the illusion speak on her turn (no action required). The illusion has the same statistics as the hag but can't take actions or reactions. It can interact with its environment and even pick up and hold real objects. The illusion seems real in every way but disappears if it takes any amount of damage. Otherwise, it lasts until the hag dismisses it (no action required) or can no longer see it. If the hag uses this lair action to create a new duplicate, the previous one vanishes, dropping any real objects in its possession.": "女巫创造了一个虚幻的自己的复制品，它出现在自己的空间里。只要她能看到她的复制品，巫婆就能将其移动到与她的步行速度相等的距离，并在她的回合中让幻象说话（不需要行动）。幻象拥有与巫婆相同的统计资料，但不能采取行动或反应。它可以与环境互动，甚至可以拿起和握住真实的物体。幻象在各方面看起来都很真实，但如果它受到任何程度的伤害就会消失。否则，它将持续到女巫解除它（不需要行动）或不再能看到它。如果巫婆使用这个巢穴动作来创造一个新的副本，那么之前的那个就会消失，并丢掉它所拥有的任何真实物品。",
	"A powerful {@b night hag} might have the following additional lair actions:": "一个强大的（%0%）可能有以下额外的巢穴行动。",
	"One creature the hag can see within 120 feet of her must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a prison demiplane. To escape, the creature must use its action to make a Charisma check contested by the hag's. If the creature wins, it escapes the demiplane. Otherwise, the effect ends on initiative count 20 on the next round. When the effect ends, the creature reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that one is occupied.": "巫婆能看到的120英尺范围内的一个生物必须在DC 15的 \"魅力测验 \"中获得成功，否则就会被放逐到监狱的半空中。要想逃脱，该生物必须用它的行动来做一个由巫婆的魅力检查。如果该生物赢了，它就能逃出半位面。否则，该效果将在下一回合的主动权计数20时结束。当效果结束时，该生物会重新出现在它所离开的空间中，或者在最近的未被占据的空间中（如果那个空间被占据）。",
	"The hag targets up to three creatures that she can see within 60 feet of her. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be flung up to 30 feet through the air. A creature that strikes a solid object or is released in midair takes {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved or fallen.": "巫婆的目标是她能看到的60英尺内的三个生物。每个目标必须在DC15宪法规定的投掷中成功，否则就会被甩到30英尺的空中。碰到固体物体或在半空中被释放的生物，每移动或坠落10英尺就会受到{@dice 1d6}重击伤害。",
	"A powerful {@b sea hag} might have the following additional lair actions:": "一个强大的（%0%）可能有以下额外的巢穴行动。",
	"The hag fills up to four 10-foot cubes of water with ink. The inky areas are heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a steady, strong underwater current disperses the ink on initiative count 10. The hag ignores the obscuring effect of the ink.": "巫婆用墨水填满了四个10英尺的水立方。墨水区域在1分钟内被严重遮蔽，尽管稳定而强大的水下水流会在主动计数10时驱散墨水。巫婆无视墨水的遮蔽效果。",
	"The hag chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the simulacrum spell). This hideous simulacrum is formed out of seaweed, slime, half-eaten fish, and other garbage, but still generally resembles the creature it is imitating. This simulacrum obeys the hag's commands and is destroyed on initiative count 20 on the next round.": "巫婆在巢穴中选择一个人形生物，并立即创造一个该生物的模拟物（就像用模拟物法术创造的一样）。这个狰狞的模拟物是由海藻、粘液、吃了一半的鱼和其他垃圾形成的，但总体上仍然与它所模仿的生物相似。这个模拟物听从女巫的命令，并在下一回合主动计数20时被摧毁。",
	"A hag's foul nature slowly suffuses the environment around her lair, twisting it to evil.": "巫婆的邪恶本性慢慢地充斥着她巢穴周围的环境，使其扭曲成邪恶。",
	"Each hag's lair is the source of three to five regional effects; the home of a grandmother, an auntie, or a coven has more effects than the lair of a single hag, including some that can directly harm intruders.

These effects either end immediately if the hag dies or abandons the lair, or take up to {@dice 2d10} days to fade away.": "每个巫婆的巢穴是三到五个区域性效果的来源；一个祖母、一个阿姨或一个巫师团的家比一个巫婆的巢穴有更多的效果，包括一些可以直接伤害入侵者的效果。任何需要生物进行救赎的区域效果都使用巫婆最强大的能力的救赎DC。如果巫婆死亡或放弃巢穴，这些效果就会立即结束，或者需要长达（%0%）天的时间来消退。",

	"Small avalanches of rock intermittently fall, blocking a path or burying intruders. A buried creature is restrained and has to hold its breath until it is dug out.": "岩石的小雪崩断断续续地落下，挡住了道路或埋葬了入侵者。被埋葬的生物会被限制住，不得不屏住呼吸，直到被挖出来。",

	"Although they are solitary by nature, hags sometimes feel the need for companionship. Usually one scratches this itch by acquiring servants she can insult and slap around as she wishes. Such a creature might be charmed into compliance, or under a spell that stops its heart if it disobeys, or too afraid of nonmagical punishment for failure to do what she says. Most hags have some kind of slave or minion creature living with or near them as a defense against attackers, even if it's just a common animal.": "虽然她们天性孤僻，但女巫有时也会觉得需要同伴的陪伴。通常一个人通过获得她可以随心所欲地侮辱和拍打的仆人来搔扰这种痒。这样的生物可能被迷住了，或者被施了咒语，如果它不听话就会停止心跳，或者太害怕非魔法的惩罚，不听她的话。大多数女巫都有某种奴隶或奴仆生物与她们生活在一起或在她们附近，作为对攻击者的防御，即使它只是一种普通的动物。",
	"Hags particularly delight in using mortals bound to their service as minions. A paladin might have no qualms about putting a hag coven to the sword, but her conviction falters if she must first fight through a crowd of innocent farmers that the hag has compelled to defend her. Ordinary folk are also useful as minions because they can serve the hag as her eyes and ears in a nearby settlement, either operating secretly or actively trying to persuade other townsfolk to pay her a visit.": "巫婆特别喜欢利用被捆绑在她们身边的凡人作为奴仆。一个圣骑士可能会毫不犹豫地将巫师团置于剑下，但如果她必须首先穿过巫师蛊惑来保护她的一群无辜农民，她的信念就会动摇。普通人作为奴仆也很有用，因为他们可以作为女巫在附近定居点的耳目为她服务，要么秘密行动，要么积极劝说其他镇民去拜访她。",
	"The weird magic at a hag's disposal means that she might have almost any type of creature helping or serving her-fey, giant, undead, and so on. Even a creature much more powerful than she might be under her command, working off the debt of a bargain for itself or someone else. Favors beget favors, and under duress a hag might speak a magic word to call upon a blood debt from a dragon, a noble, or another hag, making her able to wield magical, political, or physical power in a way she can't do by herself.": "巫婆所掌握的怪异魔法意味着她几乎可以让任何类型的生物帮助或服务于她--精灵、巨人、不死生物，等等。即使是比她强大得多的生物，也可能在她的指挥下，为自己或他人的交易债务而工作。恩惠会带来恩惠，在胁迫下，巫婆可能会说出一个魔法词来召唤龙、贵族或其他巫婆的血债，使她能够以一种她自己无法做到的方式挥舞魔法、政治或物理力量。",
	"Like the land near a hag's lair, over time her minions are altered by her presence, becoming twisted versions of their former selves (in a dark fey sort of way), but still recognizable as what they once were. She might alter them with magic, making them tireless, resistant to fire, able to transform into a flock of crows, or able to teleport through shadows-whatever the hag thinks best defends or serves her.": "就像女巫巢穴附近的土地一样，随着时间的推移，她的奴仆们会因为她的存在而改变，成为以前的扭曲版本（以一种黑暗精灵的方式），但仍然可以认出他们曾经是什么。她可能会用魔法改变它们，使它们不知疲倦，对火有抵抗力，能够变成一群乌鸦，或者能够通过阴影传送--无论女巫认为什么最能保护或服务她。",

In either case, a hag is confident that her servants will obey her orders without question.": "仆人表包括巫婆用来保护她自己和她家的忠实的、值得信赖的助手。这些生物要么是天生的邪恶，要么是被巫婆扭曲以更好地服务她。无论哪种情况，女巫都相信她的仆人会毫无疑义地服从她的命令。",
	"The Brutes table gives examples of the muscle a hag might employ, mercenaries that serve the hag only so long as it benefits them. These creatures run errands and take care of roughing up enemies or patrolling areas that the hag considers beneath her personal attention. Hags prefer to employ clever, cruel creatures rather than dumb oafs.": "野蛮人表给出了女巫可能雇佣的肌肉的例子，这些雇佣兵只为女巫服务，只要对他们有利。这些人负责跑腿和粗暴对待敌人，或者在女巫认为不值得她亲自关注的地方进行巡逻。巫婆更喜欢雇佣聪明、残忍的生物，而不是愚蠢的傻瓜。",
	"Much of a hag's treasure is strewn among all the clutter in her lair, making it difficult for intruders to quickly identify all the items that have use or value. But the hag knows what, and where, everything is.": "巫婆的许多财宝散落在她的巢穴中的所有杂物中，使入侵者难以迅速识别所有有用途或有价值的物品。但老巫婆知道所有东西是什么，在哪里。",
	"Every hag is infallible when it comes to keeping track of her treasures and other possessions. Her organization and labeling, if such a system exists, is designed to foil thieves and serve as a final, vexing puzzle for anyone who tries to make use of an item without her consent.": "每个巫婆在追踪她的宝物和其他财产方面都是无懈可击的。她的组织和标签，如果有这样一个系统的话，是为了挫败小偷，并对任何试图在未经她同意的情况下使用某件物品的人来说是一个最后的、令人烦恼的难题。",
	"A hag's treasure-like a gift from a fey being-should be doubted and even feared rather than simply being scooped up and carted away.": "一个巫婆的宝物--就像一个精灵的礼物--应该被怀疑，甚至被恐惧，而不是简单地被舀起和运走。",
	"Treasure-seekers are likely to fare better if they consider a hag's booty to be trapped, exercising caution rather than giving in to greed or curiosity. Manipulating a container or other item without knowing what's inside or what it does (or without knowing the proper password or technique) is likely to be very dangerous. At best, whatever was held in a container merely escapes or dissipates. At worst, just about anything can happen, none of it good.": "如果寻宝者认为女巫的战利品是陷阱，谨慎行事而不是向贪婪或好奇心屈服，他们可能会有更好的结果。在不知道里面有什么或它有什么作用（或不知道适当的密码或技术）的情况下操纵一个容器或其他物品可能会非常危险。在最好的情况下，容器里的东西只是逃脱或消散了。在最坏的情况下，几乎任何事情都可能发生，而且都不是好事。",
	"Above and beyond the items of obvious value a hag has accumulated, she also has a few bizarre and unique items in her collection. The Hag Objects table provides a way to quickly add such weird items to a hag's home.": "除了一个巫婆所积累的明显有价值的物品之外，她也有一些怪异和独特的物品在她的收藏中。巫婆物品表提供了一种方法，可以快速将这些奇怪的物品添加到巫婆的家中。",
	"The eye of a cleric, preserved in a liquid-filled jar. When an undead creature comes within 100 feet of the jar, the eye darts about as if it is looking around in a panic. It otherwise remains motionless.": "一个教士的眼睛，保存在一个充满液体的罐子里。当不死生物进入罐子的100英尺范围内时，眼睛就会飞快地转动，好像它在惊慌地四处寻找。否则它就会保持不动。",

	"A perfectly smooth, round stone the size of a human's fist. If placed on the ground, it rolls 20 feet per round toward the nearest source of fresh water.": "一块完美光滑的圆石，只有人的拳头大小。如果放在地上，它每回合会向最近的淡水源头滚动20英尺。",
	"A sickly crow with clipped wings. The only sound it can make is to roar like a lion.": "一只病态的乌鸦，翅膀被剪掉。它唯一能发出的声音就是像狮子一样吼叫。",
	"A seemingly empty, sealed jar. If opened, the person standing closest to the jar suddenly recalls {@dice 1d6} happy memories from the life of a long dead elf lord.": "一个看似空的、密封的罐子。如果打开，站在离罐子最近的人就会突然回忆起一个早已死去的精灵领主生活中的快乐回忆（%0%）。",
	"A seemingly mundane gold piece. Anyone who touches it gains the unshakable belief that this is the very first gold coin minted by humanity.": "一块看似平凡的金币。任何接触过它的人都会毫不动摇地相信，这是人类铸造的第一枚金币。",
	"A black box, 3 feet on each side. Anyone who opens it finds a set of three wooden, articulated figures that are modeled after three members of the adventuring party. If the figures are stood on the ground, they act out insulting parodies of their duplicates' recent actions.": "一个黑色的盒子，每边3英尺。任何打开它的人都会发现一套三个木制的、有关节的人形，这些人形是以冒险党的三个成员为模型的。如果这些人物站在地上，他们就会对他们的复制品最近的行为进行侮辱性的模仿。",
	"An oval-shaped disc made of an unknown metal. If it is tossed in the air, it flies in circles around the tosser for a minute, tiny lights winking on its surface, before settling to the ground nearby.": "一个椭圆形的圆盘，由一种未知的金属制成。如果把它扔到空中，它就会在扔的人身边绕圈飞行一分钟，表面上有小灯闪烁，然后落到附近的地上。",
	"A thick, dusty tome, every page filled with tiny, barely legible writing. Careful study of the book reveals it to be a written transcript of every conversation that took place over the course of a year, three years ago, in a nearby village.": "一本厚厚的、布满灰尘的小册子，每一页都写满了细小的、几乎无法辨认的文字。对这本书的仔细研究表明，它是三年前在附近村庄发生的每一次谈话的书面记录，为期一年。",
	"A small painting that depicts a placid field. Just after midnight each day, the painting changes to depict the following day's weather.": "一幅小画，描绘了一片平静的田野。每天午夜过后，这幅画就会改变，描绘出第二天的天气。",
	"Kobolds are often dismissed as cowardly, foolish, and weak, but these little reptilian creatures actually have a strong social structure that stresses devotion to the tribe, are clever with their hands, and viciously work together in order to overcome their physical limitations.": "哥布林常常被认为是胆小、愚蠢和软弱的，但这些小小的爬行动物实际上有一个强大的社会结构，强调对部落的奉献，他们的手很聪明，为了克服他们的身体限制而恶性地合作。",
	"Kobolds are naturally skilled at tunneling. Similar to dwarves, they seem to have a near-instinctive sense of what sections of stone or earth are strong or weak, are bearing a load or are safe to excavate, or are likely to contain minerals or offer access to water. This ability enables them to fashion secure homes in places where other creatures wouldn't feel safe.": "哥布林天生擅长挖掘隧道。与矮人相似，他们似乎有一种近乎本能的感觉，知道哪些部分的石头或泥土是坚固或脆弱的，哪些部分可以承受负荷或安全挖掘，或者可能含有矿物或提供水。这种能力使他们能够在其他生物感到不安全的地方建造安全的家园。",
	"Kobolds take advantage of their size by creating small-diameter tunnels that they can easily pass through, but that require larger creatures to hunch over or even crawl to make progress. In places where a tunnel opens into a chasm and continues on the other side, the kobolds might connect the two passages with a rope bridge or some other rickety structure, designed to collapse under the weight of any creature heavier than a kobold. On occasion, the route through a kobold lair runs along a ledge that borders a cavern or a crevasse, and the kobolds might erect a railing or a wall that prevents them from falling off the edge-high enough to protect a kobold but low enough to serve as a tripping hazard for a larger creature.": "哥布林利用自己的体型优势，建造了一些小直径的隧道，它们可以很容易地通过，但需要大型生物弯腰驼背，甚至爬行才能前进。在一些地方，隧道通向鸿沟，并在另一侧继续前进，哥布林可能会用绳索桥或其他一些摇摇欲坠的结构来连接这两条通道，其设计目的是为了在任何比哥布林更重的生物的重量下坍塌。有时，穿过哥布林巢穴的路线是沿着与洞穴或裂缝接壤的壁架走的，哥布林们可能会竖起一个栏杆或一堵墙，以防止他们从边缘掉下来--高度足以保护一个哥布林，但高度低到足以作为一个较大生物的绊脚石。",
	"Those of other humanoid races have little good to say about kobolds, but they do admit that the little reptilians do respectable tunnel work using simple tools. If a band of kobolds is enslaved by more powerful creatures, the kobolds are usually put to work enlarging their masters' living area and protecting vital areas of the lair with traps and other defenses.": "其他人形种族的人对哥布林没有什么好的评价，但他们也承认，这些小爬虫用简单的工具做着可敬的隧道工作。如果一群哥布林被更强大的生物所奴役，哥布林通常会被用来扩大主人的生活区域，并用陷阱和其他防御手段保护巢穴的重要区域。",
	"Some human communities hire kobolds to dig their sewer tunnels, paying them with food and tools the kobolds wouldn't have access to on their own. If they are treated well and left alone to do the job, the kobolds work industriously and build a network of passages beneath the streets, connecting them to a nearby waterway and greatly improving the town's sanitation. If the kobolds like the area and aren't mistreated by the humans, they might build a warren and make a permanent home there, while continuing to expand the town's sewers as the community grows. These so-called \"city kobolds\" live underground but might make occasional nighttime forays up to the surface. Roughly one quarter of the towns and cities in the world have kobold communities living under them, but the kobolds are so good at staying hidden that the surface-dwelling citizens in the area often don't know what lies beneath them.": "一些人类社区雇用哥布林来挖掘下水道，用哥布林自己无法获得的食物和工具来支付他们。如果他们受到良好的待遇，并被单独留下做这项工作，哥布林就会勤奋工作，在街道下面建造一个通道网络，将它们与附近的水道连接起来，大大改善城镇的卫生状况。如果哥布林喜欢这个地区，并且没有受到人类的虐待，他们可能会在那里建造一个巢穴并建立一个永久的家，同时随着社区的发展继续扩大城镇的下水道。这些所谓的 \"城市哥布林 \"生活在地下，但可能偶尔会在夜间上到地面。世界上大约有四分之一的城镇和城市都有哥布林社区生活在地下，但哥布林们非常善于隐藏，以至于该地区居住在地面上的市民往往不知道他们下面有什么。",
	"Because the kobolds make sure they stay out of the way of anyone more dangerous than themselves, grow their own subterranean food, and prefer to sneak about at night, the people of a town might go for weeks or months without noticing evidence that kobolds are in the area, and years between actual sightings.": "由于哥布林确保自己不受任何比自己更危险的人的影响，自己种植地下食物，并且喜欢在晚上偷偷摸摸地走动，一个镇上的人可能会在数周或数月内没有注意到哥布林在该地区的证据，而实际看到哥布林的时间也会相隔多年。",
	"Kobolds are adept at identifying broken, misplaced, discarded, or leftover crafted items from other creatures that can still be put to use. They prefer to scavenge objects that have clearly been lost or thrown away, which is easy to do without attracting attention. At the same time, they don't automatically shy away from trying to grab items that are the property of other creatures, because such objects are more likely to be in good condition and thus more useful or valuable.": "哥布林善于识别破碎的、放错地方的、被丢弃的、或其他生物遗留下来的仍可使用的手工制品。他们更喜欢搜刮那些明显已经丢失或扔掉的物品，这很容易做到，不会引起注意。同时，他们也不会自动回避试图攫取属于其他生物的物品，因为这种物品更有可能处于良好状态，因而更有用或更有价值。",
	"When they go after items that aren't free for the taking, kobolds try to remain undetected and don't give their targets reason to harm them. For example, a group of city kobolds might sneak into a cobbler's house at night to loot it of knives, leather bits, nails, and other useful items, but if they are at risk of discovery, they run away rather than attack anyone in the house. By fleeing before they can be seen or identified, they avoid getting into a situation where the townsfolk would try to hunt down all kobolds and put the tribe's survival at risk.": "当他们追逐那些不是免费的物品时，哥布林会尽量不被发现，不给目标以伤害他们的理由。例如，一群城市哥布林可能会在晚上潜入一个鞋匠的房子，掠夺刀子、皮革碎片、钉子和其他有用的物品，但如果他们有被发现的危险，他们会逃跑，而不是攻击房子里的任何人。通过在被看到或被识别之前逃跑，他们可以避免陷入城镇居民试图追捕所有哥布林并使部落的生存受到威胁的局面。",
	"Some aggressive individual kobolds and tribes do exist, but in general kobolds don't purposely provoke retaliatory attacks from the creatures they steal from. It's better to be cautious and overlooked than to be considered dangerous and a threat.": "确实存在一些具有攻击性的个别哥布林和部落，但一般来说，哥布林不会故意挑起他们所偷窃的生物的报复性攻击。与其被认为是危险和威胁，不如小心翼翼地被忽视。",
	"In a couple of situations, kobolds might abandon this careful approach. First, because of their hatred of gnomes, city kobolds often go out of their way to target gnomes' houses and shops. Even in such cases, the kobolds' fear of retaliation usually prevents them from trying to directly harm the gnomes, but they might spit in the milk, balance dishes on tables so they're easily knocked over and broken, or scatter sewing needles all over the floor-petty, vengeful acts that humiliate, injure, or anger the gnomes, but not so much that the gnomes want to hunt down and kill the kobolds. Because of the kobolds' animosity, gnomes tend to avoid or abandon settlements that have a severe infestation of kobolds, and conversely kobolds are usually driven out of communities that have a large gnome population.": "在一些情况下，哥布林可能会放弃这种谨慎的做法。首先，由于他们对地精的仇恨，城市哥布林经常不顾一切地针对地精的房子和商店。即使在这种情况下，哥布林对报复的恐惧通常也会阻止他们试图直接伤害地精，但他们可能会在牛奶中吐口水，把盘子放在桌子上，这样它们很容易被打翻和打碎，或者把缝纫针散落一地--这些卑鄙的报复行为会羞辱、伤害或激怒地精，但不会让地精想追杀哥布林。由于哥布林的敌意，地精倾向于避免或放弃那些哥布林严重泛滥的定居点，相反，哥布林通常被赶出拥有大量地精人口的社区。",
	"Second, kobolds are always on the lookout for magic that might help them free their imprisoned god, Kurtulmak. Typical kobolds don't know how to use a wand, a spellbook, or anything with more magical power than a potion, but they all believe that the tribal sorcerer can figure out how to use any such item they come across. When kobolds sense an opportunity to separate a magic item from its owner, they are often willing to take the chance of revealing themselves because the potential reward is worth the risk.": "其次，哥布林总是在寻找可能帮助他们释放被囚禁的神--库图尔马克的魔法。典型的哥布林不知道如何使用魔杖、魔法书或任何比药水更有魔力的东西，但他们都相信，部落的巫师能想出如何使用他们遇到的任何此类物品。当哥布林感觉到有机会将一件魔法物品与它的主人分开时，他们往往愿意冒着暴露自己的风险，因为潜在的回报值得冒险。",
	"Kobolds believe that they were created by Tiamat from the blood of dragons-a view supported by their reptilian (they would say draconic) appearance. In every kobold tribe, the legend of the creatures' origin is passed down from elder to hatchling, giving each individual and every generation a reason to feel pride and self-respect. The kobolds prefer to run away than fight, to live off the scraps of others, and they are often dominated by larger humanoids, but they know that there is greatness within them and they are proud that they were chosen to be the blood-kin of dragons.": "哥布林相信他们是由提亚马特用龙的血液创造出来的--他们的爬行动物（他们会说是龙族）的外表支持了这种观点。在每一个哥布林部落中，关于生物起源的传说都是由长辈传给幼崽的，这让每个人和每一代人都有理由感到自豪和自尊。比起战斗，哥布林人更喜欢逃跑，靠别人的残羹剩饭过活，他们经常被较大的人形生物支配，但他们知道自己内心的伟大，他们为自己被选为龙的血亲而感到自豪。",
	"Kobolds willingly serve chromatic dragons and worship them as if they were demigods-mighty beings of divine descent. This isn't a casual sort of worship or lip service; kobolds are awed in the presence of a dragon, as if an actual avatar of a deity were in their presence. Kobolds fall all over themselves to obey orders from a dragon, even if they are dangerous orders. Although kobolds usually don't worship Tiamat directly, they recognize her as the dragon-goddess of all chromatic dragons, and as the master of their racial god, Kurtulmak.": "哥布林愿意为色龙服务，并把它们当作半神--神圣血统的强大生命来崇拜。这不是一种随意的崇拜或口惠而实不至的服务；哥布林在龙的面前会感到敬畏，就好像一个真正的神灵化身在他们面前一样。哥布林会不顾一切地服从龙的命令，即使它们是危险的命令。虽然哥布林通常不直接崇拜提亚马特，但他们承认她是所有色龙的龙神，也是他们的种族神库图尔马克的主人。",
	"The god of kobolds was a vassal of Tiamat. When the gnome god Garl Glittergold stole a treasure from Tiamat's hoard, she sent Kurtulmak to retrieve it. Garl lured his pursuer into a maze-like cavern, then collapsed the exits behind him, trapping Kurtulmak for all eternity.": "哥布林之神是提亚马特的附庸。当地精之神加尔-闪金（Garl Glittergold）从提亚马特的囤积物中偷了一件宝物时，她派库尔图马克去取回它。加尔把他的追兵引到了一个类似于迷宫的洞穴里，然后把他身后的出口弄塌了，把库图尔马克永远地困在里面。",
	"Kurtulmak is a hateful deity, one who despises all life except for kobolds. He especially hates Garl Glittergold, gnomes, and fey creatures that enjoy playing pranks. He taught the first kobolds how to mine, tunnel, hide, and ambush. He is dominated by his emotions-intelligent, but not wise. Arrogant and prone to gloating, he carries grudges, has a huge chip on his shoulder, and spends a lot of time fashioning elaborate revenge scenarios against those who have disrespected him.": "库图尔马克是一个充满仇恨的神，他鄙视所有的生命，除了哥布林。他尤其憎恨加尔-格莱特戈德、地精和喜欢恶作剧的精灵生物。他教会了第一批哥布林如何采矿、挖地道、躲藏和伏击。他被自己的情感所支配--聪明，但不睿智。他傲慢无礼，容易幸灾乐祸，他心怀怨恨，有一个巨大的筹码，并花了很多时间来精心设计对那些不尊重他的人的报复方案。",
	"Unlike some other humanoids, kobolds don't fear or shun arcane magic. They see magic as part of their connection to dragons, and are proud to be blessed with the ability to wield such power. Young kobold sorcerers are trained by elders, and the training has an almost religious significance. Most kobold sorcerers are of the draconic bloodline origin and specialize in either damaging magic (which can also be used in mining), augmentation (of materials or allies), or divination (to find raw materials and foresee threats to the tribe).": "与其他一些人形生物不同，哥布林并不害怕或回避奥秘的魔法。他们认为魔法是他们与龙的联系的一部分，并为被赋予挥舞这种力量的能力而感到自豪。年轻的哥布林巫师由长者训练，这种训练几乎具有宗教意义。大多数哥布林巫师都是龙族血统，擅长破坏性魔法（也可用于采矿），增强（材料或盟友），或占卜（寻找原材料和预见对部落的威胁）。",
	"The main reason why kobolds depend on arcane magic rather than divine is Kurtulmak's imprisonment, which makes it difficult for him to grant spells to mortals and for those mortals to receive his favor. Furthermore, kobolds are so frail that a single hit from a human's weapon can kill one of them, so a tribe has little use for healing magic, and a sorcerer can meet most of the tribe's other magic-related needs.": "哥布林依赖奥术魔法而不是神术的主要原因是库图尔马克的监禁，这使得他很难向凡人授予法术，也使那些凡人难以得到他的青睐。此外，哥布林非常虚弱，人类的武器一击就能杀死他们中的一个，所以一个部落对治疗魔法没有什么用处，而一个巫师可以满足部落其他与魔法有关的大部分需求。",
	"Kobold shamans are very rare; priests of Kurtulmak, when they reveal themselves, are easily recognized by orange garb (usually just a roughly torn sash or cloak) decorated with an image of a gnome's skull.": "哥布林巫师非常罕见；库尔图马克的祭司，当他们显露出来时，很容易就能从装饰有地精头骨图像的橙色服装（通常只是一件粗略撕裂的腰带或斗篷）中认出。",
	"Kobolds have a tribal society in which they all take on specialized roles that protect and sustain the tribe. The strongest kobolds are trained to be hunters and warriors, the most clever are crafters and strategists, the toughest are miners and beast-wranglers, and so on. Even a stupid or physically weak kobold is given a role in the tribe, whether something as simple as picking mushrooms for food or watching over hatchlings, and they all understand that their actions contribute to the survival of the group. The tribe practices for the eventuality of defending the lair against intruders, and their plans always include knowing the best escape routes and who is responsible for blocking tunnels to deter pursuit.": "哥布林有一个部落社会，他们都承担着保护和维持部落的专门角色。最强壮的哥布林被训练成猎人和战士，最聪明的是手艺人和战略家，最强悍的是矿工和驯兽师，等等。即使是愚蠢或身体虚弱的哥布林也会在部落中被赋予一个角色，无论是采摘蘑菇获取食物还是看护幼崽这样简单的事情，他们都明白自己的行为有助于群体的生存。部落为抵御入侵者的巢穴而练习，他们的计划总是包括知道最佳的逃跑路线，以及谁负责封锁隧道以阻止追捕。",
	"Kobolds feel a cool affinity or something like kinship for other members of their tribe, but they are rarely affectionate with each other. Two kobolds who've known each other for over a decade might consider each other friends or enemies, but the strength of this sentiment is much fainter than any comparable human emotion. Since most of their waking time is spent working, adversarial kobolds rarely have opportunities to exchange insults, let alone come to blows over their differences.": "哥布林对他们部落的其他成员有一种很酷的亲和力或类似亲属关系的感觉，但他们彼此之间很少有好感。两个认识了十多年的哥布林可能会认为对方是朋友或敌人，但这种感情的强度比任何可比较的人类情感都要淡得多。由于他们大部分清醒的时间都花在工作上，敌对的哥布林很少有机会交换侮辱，更不用说为他们的分歧而发生冲突了。",
	"Kobolds choose mates primarily for convenience. Their lack of emotional bonding means they have no concept of marriage or permanent family relationships. Their eggs are placed in a common tribal hatchery with no effort to keep track of who each one's mother is. This practice and the communal raising of the hatchlings mean that the tribe operates like a group of cousins.": "哥布林选择配偶主要是为了方便。他们缺乏情感纽带，这意味着他们没有婚姻或永久家庭关系的概念。他们的蛋被放置在一个共同的部落孵化器中，没有努力去追踪每一个蛋的母亲是谁。这种做法和对孵化出的孩子的共同抚养意味着部落的运作就像一群表兄弟。",
	"Because they lay eggs, and the eggs don't require much tending, kobold females aren't exempted from war or work. Furthermore, kobolds can slowly change sex. If most males or females of a tribe are killed, some survivors change over several months until the tribe is balanced again. In this way, the tribe can quickly repopulate with just a few survivors. Because of these factors, kobolds don't have assigned gender roles for young or adults. A leader, sorcerer, miner, or crafter is as likely to be female as male.": "因为它们会产卵，而且卵不需要太多的照顾，所以哥布林的雌性并不能免于战争或工作。此外，哥布林可以慢慢地改变性别。如果一个部落的大部分男性或女性被杀，一些幸存者会在几个月内发生变化，直到部落重新达到平衡。这样一来，部落就可以迅速地用少数幸存者重新繁殖。由于这些因素，哥布林并没有为年轻人或成年人指定性别角色。领导者、巫师、矿工或工匠既可能是女性，也可能是男性。",
	"Kobolds grow and mature much more swiftly than members of other humanoid races. At 6 years old a kobold is considered an adult. Most succumb to violence, accidents, or disease by age 20, but a kobold can live for up to 120 years-a longevity they attribute to being distantly related to dragons. A female can lay up to six eggs per year, and an egg matures for two to three months before it hatches.": "哥布林的成长和成熟比其他人形种族的成员要快得多。6岁时，哥布林被认为是一个成年人。大多数人在20岁时都会屈服于暴力、事故或疾病，但哥布林可以活到120岁--他们把这种长寿归因于与龙的远亲关系。一个女性每年最多可以产6个蛋，一个蛋成熟两到三个月后才能孵化。",
	"Kobolds don't engage in funeral ceremonies; a dead kobold's body is burned or disposed of in some other convenient way (or, in a cannibalistic tribe, eaten). Kobolds believe that if they die in service to their tribe, Kurtulmak immediately sends each of them back to life as the next egg laid in the hatchery. If a particularly important or respected member of a tribe dies, the hatchery is closely monitored. The next egg laid is immediately separated from the rest and carefully protected. Once it hatches, the resultant young kobold is groomed to fill a position of importance.": "哥布林人不搞葬礼仪式；死去的哥布林人的尸体会被烧掉或以其他方便的方式处理掉（或者，在一个食人部落里，被吃掉）。哥布林相信，如果他们为部落服务而死亡，库尔图瓦克会立即将他们每个人送回生命，成为孵化室里的下一个蛋。如果部落中特别重要或受人尊敬的成员死亡，孵化场就会受到密切监视。下一个产下的蛋会立即与其他的蛋分开，并仔细保护。一旦它孵化出来，产生的年轻哥布林就会被培养成一个重要的职位。",
	"Although their sharp teeth would suggest they are carnivores, kobolds are actually omnivores, and can eat just about anything, including meat, fruit, tree bark, bone, leather, and eggshells (a newly hatched kobold's first meal is usually its own shell). A hungry tribe leaves nothing behind from a kill, eating everything that's edible and using the rest to make tools or adornments.": "虽然它们锋利的牙齿表明它们是肉食动物，但哥布林实际上是杂食动物，几乎什么都能吃，包括肉、水果、树皮、骨头、皮革和蛋壳（新孵化的哥布林的第一顿饭通常是它自己的壳）。饥饿的部落在杀戮后不会留下任何东西，他们会吃掉所有可食用的东西，用剩下的东西来制作工具或装饰品。",
	"Kobolds shed teeth as they wear out and grow new ones their entire lives. Many wear their own shed teeth as jewelry, with more teeth indicating an older-and wiser-kobold. Some unscrupulous individuals wear teeth stolen or harvested from others in an attempt to make them seem older and more respectable.": "哥布林在磨损后会脱落牙齿，并在一生中长出新的牙齿。许多人把自己脱落的牙齿当作珠宝佩戴，牙齿越多说明哥布林人越老越聪明。一些不择手段的人戴着从别人那里偷来的或收获的牙齿，试图让自己看起来更老、更体面。",
	"Most kobold tribes avoid eating what they call \"talking meat\"-intelligent creatures-because such behavior prompts retaliation. The fear of starvation can make them flexible about this principle, however, and if their options are either attacking such creatures or going hungry, kobolds are practical. A few tribes, particularly those in lightly populated areas, practice cannibalism, believing it is foolish to waste good meat.": "大多数哥布林部落避免吃他们所谓的 \"会说话的肉\"--有智慧的生物，因为这种行为会引起报复。然而，对饥饿的恐惧会使他们对这一原则持灵活态度，如果他们的选择要么是攻击这种生物，要么是挨饿，哥布林就会很实际。少数部落，特别是人口稀少地区的部落，实行食人制，认为浪费好肉是愚蠢的。",
	"In any case, kobolds that eat humanoids don't simply start consuming corpses or prisoners right after a battle; they're more inclined to tie their victims to saplings and slowly roast them over a fire, or put them in a giant cook pot to make stew. Fortunately for the prisoners, the kobolds' almost comedic preparations sometimes give rescuers time to locate and free the captives before the kobolds settle down for the main course.": "在任何情况下，吃人的哥布林都不会在战斗结束后立即开始食用尸体或俘虏；他们更倾向于把受害者绑在树苗上，在火上慢慢烤，或者把他们放在一个巨大的锅里炖。对俘虏来说，幸运的是，哥布林近乎滑稽的准备工作有时会让救援人员有时间在哥布林安顿下来做主菜之前找到并释放俘虏。",
	"Because the gnome god Garl Glittergold trapped the kobold god Kurtulmak in an inescapable maze, kobolds are bitterly hateful toward gnomes. Although they usually don't seek out gnomes to do them violence, if hostile kobolds encounter a mixed group of gnomes and other humanoids, the kobolds instinctively attack the gnomes. Kobolds in battle with gnomes are much less likely to run away because their hatred overrules their sense of self-preservation.": "由于地精之神Garl Glittergold将哥布林之神Kurtulmak困在一个无法逃脱的迷宫中，哥布林对地精充满了仇恨。虽然他们通常不会找地精施暴，但如果敌对的哥布林遇到地精和其他人类的混合群体，哥布林会本能地攻击地精。在与地精的战斗中，哥布林更不可能逃跑，因为他们的仇恨压倒了他们的自我保护意识。",
	"A kobold's cautious nature doesn't mean it can't get angry. The blood of dragons flows in its veins, and like a raging drake, a kobold that is pushed too far or has its back against the wall can become a miniature storm of fangs and claws as it desperately tries to defend its life. Likewise, kinship to their own tribe can prompt kobolds to battle another kobold tribe for resources or territory. Such conflicts aren't common, because two tribes will always prefer to expand in different directions if they come into contact, but they do happen.": "哥布林谨慎的天性并不意味着它不会发怒。龙的血液流淌在它的血管里，就像一只愤怒的德雷克，被逼得太紧或背靠墙壁的哥布林会变成一场小型的獠牙和爪子的风暴，因为它拼命地想保卫自己的生命。同样，对自己部落的亲属关系也会促使哥布林为资源或领土与另一个哥布林部落作战。这样的冲突并不常见，因为两个部落如果接触到了，总会倾向于向不同的方向扩张，但它们确实会发生。",
	"For example, two neighboring tribes that want exclusive claim to a flock of mountain goats might skirmish with each other every few days. Eventually the leader of one warring tribe realizes it is losing due to attrition and moves its tribe to another area, ceding the contested territory to its more successful neighbors.": "例如，两个想独占一群山羊的相邻部落可能每隔几天就会发生小规模冲突。最终，一个交战部落的首领意识到自己因损耗而失败，于是将其部落迁往另一地区，将有争议的领土让给更成功的邻居。",
	"As demonstrated by their hatred of gnomes, kobolds have a persecution complex and easily take offense at the actions or deeds of other races. They aren't forgiving of other races, and they enjoy nursing their hatred until they get a chance to wreak revenge on a creature or a race that has wronged them.": "正如他们对地精的仇恨所表明的那样，哥布林有一种迫害情结，很容易对其他种族的行动或行为感到不快。他们对其他种族并不宽容，而且他们喜欢将他们的仇恨保留下来，直到他们有机会向一个对他们不利的生物或种族进行报复。",
	"Kobolds are cold-blooded and thus prefer temperate and tropical climates. Kobold tribes in colder regions tend to be smaller in population and more aggressive in their hunting, since food is relatively scarce in such areas.": "哥布林是冷血动物，因此喜欢温带和热带气候。寒冷地区的哥布林部落往往人口较少，狩猎时也更有侵略性，因为这些地区的食物相对匮乏。",
	"Partly out of fear and partly because their eyes are sensitive to sunlight, kobolds prefer the security of a cave to living in the open air, and can be found in any sort of terrain that can support tunneling. In a swamp or along a coastline where digging into the soft ground is problematic, kobolds entrench themselves in dense woods, hills, or large rock outcroppings, creating warrens above the water line.": "部分是出于恐惧，部分是因为他们的眼睛对阳光很敏感，哥布林更喜欢安全的洞穴，而不是生活在露天环境中，而且可以在任何可以支持开凿隧道的地形中找到。在沼泽地或海岸线上，挖掘松软的地面是有问题的，哥布林会把自己藏在茂密的树林、山丘或大块的岩石上，在水线以上形成战壕。",
	"Kobolds reside most commonly in hilly or mountainous terrain. Such locations usually have natural caves suitable for living space, plenty of room to dig, and ready sources of food. Although lairing in these locations puts kobolds in competition with surface-dwelling humanoids, their ability to avoid detection often means their warrens go unnoticed by their larger rivals. If it's lucky, a tribe of kobolds that is discovered by a group of larger humanoids might form a mutually beneficial arrangement, relying on the humanoids for protection from invaders and in return providing services such as excavating new living spaces and disposing of trash. If it's unlucky, the tribe is enslaved by the other humanoids, and the kobolds serve similar roles but under threat of death.": "哥布林最常居住在丘陵或山地地带。这些地方通常有适合居住的天然洞穴，有足够的空间可以挖掘，还有现成的食物来源。虽然在这些地方筑巢使哥布林与地面居住的人类竞争，但他们避免被发现的能力往往意味着他们的巢穴不会被他们的大对手注意到。如果幸运的话，被一群较大的类人动物发现的哥布林部落可能会形成一种互利的安排，依靠类人动物的保护来抵御入侵者，并作为回报提供服务，如挖掘新的生活空间和处理垃圾。如果运气不好，这个部落就会被其他人形生物奴役，而哥布林也会担任类似的角色，但会受到死亡的威胁。",
	"Winged kobolds, known as urds, hatch seemingly at random from kobold eggs, even in a tribe that has no adult urds. Although being able to fly is an incredible gift, and it would be expected for kobolds to interpret the wings as a blessing from Tiamat, ordinary kobolds resent urds and don't get along with them. Fragments of kobold legends speak of Kuraulyek, a winged godling servant of Kurtulmak, who betrayed his master in some way. Kobolds see urds as Kuraulyek's favorites, and they project their resentment of this traitor onto their winged kin.": "有翅膀的哥布林，被称为Urds，似乎是随机从哥布林蛋中孵化出来的，甚至在一个没有成年Urds的部落里也是如此。虽然能够飞行是一种不可思议的天赋，而且哥布林会把翅膀解释为来自提亚马特的祝福，但普通的哥布林却憎恨urds，不与他们相处。哥布林传说的片段提到了库鲁尔耶克（Kuraulyek），一个有翅膀的神灵，是库图尔马克的仆人，他以某种方式背叛了他的主人。哥布林认为乌尔兹是库鲁耶克的宠儿，他们把对这个叛徒的怨恨投射到他们有翼的亲属身上。",
	"Kobold names are derived from the Draconic tongue and usually relate to a characteristic of the owner, such as scale color, distinctive body parts, or typical behavior. For example, \"Red Foot,\" \"White Claw,\" and \"Scurry\" are Common translations of often-used names. A kobold might change its name when it becomes an adult, or add additional word-syllables after important events such as completing its first hunt, laying its first egg, or surviving its first battle. The Kobold Names table presents kobold names suitable for any campaign.": "哥布林的名字来自于德拉克语，通常与主人的特征有关，如鳞片颜色、独特的身体部位或典型行为。例如，\"红脚\"、\"白爪 \"和 \"乱窜 \"是经常使用的名字的普通翻译。当一个哥布林成为一个成年人时，它可能会改变自己的名字，或者在完成第一次狩猎、产下第一个蛋、或在第一次战斗中幸存下来等重要事件后增加额外的单词音节。哥布林名字表列出了适合任何战役的哥布林名字。",

	"Most kobolds of the same tribe tend to have similar  coloration. For example, the Copper Tooth tribe might  be mostly gray with red stripes. Two tribes that merge  eventually crossbreed enough to create a new look,  although occasional outliers and throwbacks are born  that bear the appearance of one of the original tribes.": "同一部落的大多数哥布林往往有类似的颜色。例如，铜牙部落可能大部分是灰色的，有红色的条纹。两个合并的部落最终会进行杂交，足以创造出一种新的外观，尽管偶尔会有一些离群索居者和倒退者诞生，他们拥有原始部落之一的外观。",

	"Because they are physically weak individually, kobolds know they have to use superior numbers and cunning to take down powerful foes. In addition to their Pack Tactics trait described in the Monster Manual, they use traps, ambushes, terrain, allied monsters, and any other advantage they can squeeze out of their environment. Essentially, the only way kobolds can win is not to play fair.": "因为他们个人的身体素质很弱，哥布林知道他们必须利用优越的数量和狡猾的手段来对付强大的敌人。除了《怪物手册》中描述的群体战术特性外，他们还利用陷阱、伏击、地形、联盟怪物以及任何其他他们能从环境中挤出的优势。从本质上讲，哥布林获胜的唯一方法就是不公平竞争。",
	"Kobolds work together to accomplish difficult tasks they couldn't manage alone. They carve intricate tunnel systems that enable them to hold off and discourage enemies several times their size. Without engaging in much verbal communication, each kobold knows what has to be done to succeed. Kobolds' ability to work together is remarkable, especially compared to the behavior of other small humanoids like goblins, which tend to squabble among themselves and cooperate only when threatened by a strong leader.": "哥布林合作完成他们无法单独完成的困难任务。他们雕刻出错综复杂的隧道系统，使他们能够抵挡和劝阻数倍于他们的敌人。无需进行太多的语言交流，每个哥布林都知道必须做什么才能成功。哥布林的合作能力是了不起的，特别是与其他小型人形生物如地精的行为相比，它们往往会在彼此之间争吵，只有在受到强大的领导者威胁时才会合作。",
	"Kobolds avoid combat on a large scale, instead sticking to hit-and-run raids using smaller groups of warriors. If they have time, they prepare the battlefield with small bolt-holes for them to hide in and simple pit traps to hamper their opponents.": "哥布林避免大规模的战斗，而是坚持使用较小的战士团体进行打了就跑的突袭。如果他们有时间，他们会在战场上准备一些小的螺栓孔供他们藏身，以及一些简单的坑道陷阱来阻碍他们的对手。",
	"Standard kobold tactics include the following:": "标准的哥布林战术包括以下内容。",
	"Attacking light sources to extinguish them, so the kobolds can use their darkvision to best advantage.": "攻击光源使其熄灭，这样哥布林就能以最佳的方式使用他们的黑暗视觉。",
	"Leaving one defender in a room to lure invaders into a trap or an ambush. Often this bait is a sick or weak kobold who is otherwise unable to contribute to the tribe's needs.": "在一个房间里留下一个防御者，引诱入侵者进入陷阱或埋伏。这个诱饵通常是一个生病或虚弱的哥布林，否则无法对部落的需求做出贡献。",
	"Using hit-and-run maneuvers, fleeing between attacks to better or more secure vantage points. Often their goal is to attract enemies and draw the foes into greater danger, which can be especially effective if the invaders have made camp, are injured, or are otherwise compromised (such as having to move by climbing or swimming).": "采用打了就跑的机动方式，在攻击间隙逃到更好或更安全的有利位置。通常他们的目标是吸引敌人，把敌人引向更大的危险，如果入侵者已经扎营，受伤，或受到其他影响（如必须通过攀爬或游泳来移动），这可能特别有效。",
	"Using poison, usually harvested from vermin such as centipedes and spiders. They might extract the poison and use it on their weapons, or leave a chest or a clay pot full of the vermin in obvious places as false \"treasure,\" prompting intruders to open the container and release a swarm.": "使用毒药，通常是从蜈蚣和蜘蛛等害虫身上收获的。他们可能提取毒药并用于他们的武器，或者在明显的地方留下一个装满害虫的箱子或陶罐作为假 \"宝藏\"，促使入侵者打开容器并释放虫群。",
	"In a combat involving large numbers of kobolds (such as ten or more), consider spreading out their attacks over the round instead of having them all act on the same initiative count. Doing this gives the kobolds more opportunities to react to what their enemies do, and makes it harder for players to coordinate their characters' attacks because not all the kobolds take their actions at the same time.": "在涉及大量哥布林（比如10个或更多）的战斗中，可以考虑将他们的攻击分散到整个回合中，而不是让他们都在同一主动权计数中行动。这样做使哥布林有更多的机会对敌人的行动做出反应，也使玩家更难协调他们角色的攻击，因为不是所有的哥布林都在同一时间采取行动。",
	"Because they live underground, kobolds have access to a remarkable amount of earth-based treasures such as metal ores and unpolished gems. They have the basic skill to extract metals found in their natural state and to polish raw gemstones. Although they don't create their own coinage, nuggets of raw metals used for trade, bribes, or crafting are commonly found in kobold lairs.": "由于生活在地下，哥布林可以接触到大量基于地球的宝物，如金属矿石和未加工的宝石。他们拥有提取自然状态下发现的金属和打磨原始宝石的基本技能。虽然他们不创造自己的钱币，但在哥布林的巢穴中经常会发现用于贸易、贿赂或制作的原始金属块。",
	"Kobolds are talented at crafting, so most tribes have a remarkable amount of treasure in the form of simple jewelry, such as armbands, rings, necklaces, and other items that are small or can be constructed out of small pieces. These adornments are always fashioned so that they don't make noise when the wearer moves, as that would make it difficult for a kobold to sneak anywhere.": "哥布林在手工制作方面很有天赋，所以大多数部落都有大量以简单珠宝形式存在的宝物，如臂章、戒指、项链，以及其他小件或可以用小件构造的物品。这些装饰品的造型总是在佩戴者移动时不会发出声音，因为这将使哥布林人难以潜入任何地方。",
	"Even though the jewelry they make has no functional purpose, kobolds savor these items, perhaps as some echo of a dragon's inclination to collect treasure. Because the tribe's wealth is portable, the kobolds can relocate quickly without needing to transport containers of nuggets and gems, and they can offer these items as bribes or tribute to more powerful creatures, or as religious offerings to a dragon.": "尽管他们制作的珠宝没有任何功能用途，但哥布林却很喜欢这些东西，这也许是对龙收集宝物的倾向的某种呼应。因为部落的财富是可移动的，所以哥布林可以迅速迁移，而不需要运输装金块和宝石的容器，他们可以把这些物品作为贿赂或进贡给更强大的生物，或者作为对龙的宗教祭品。",
	"Thanks to their lack of physical prowess and their small size, kobolds are rarely in a position to dominate other creatures, so they usually don't have minions. Even when the opportunity presents itself, kobolds would rather not try to enslave or hire any intelligent creatures because they can't trust such creatures to not turn on them.": "由于缺乏体能，体型又小，哥布林很少能支配其他生物，所以他们通常不会有奴仆。即使有机会，哥布林也不愿意尝试奴役或雇佣任何智慧生物，因为他们无法相信这种生物不会背叛他们。",
	"Kobolds are good, however, at capturing and taming smaller animals and beasts, particularly rats, dire rats, and reptilian creatures like lizards that thrive in a cave or underground environment. The kobolds corral these pets or allow them to roam free, either feeding them scraps or allowing them to forage for insects and other morsels too small for the kobolds to care about. Much in the way that human villagers keep chickens, these animals help the kobolds with pest control and are occasionally used as food. Giant rats and similarly sized lizards are also used as pack animals and guardians.": "然而，哥布林擅长捕捉和驯服较小的动物和野兽，尤其是老鼠、地鼠，以及在洞穴或地下环境中生长的蜥蜴等爬行动物。哥布林把这些宠物关在笼子里，或者让它们自由自在地游荡，要么给它们喂食残羹剩饭，要么让它们去觅食昆虫和其他太小的食物，哥布林根本不在乎。就像人类村民养鸡一样，这些动物帮助哥布林人控制害虫，偶尔也作为食物使用。巨型老鼠和同样大小的蜥蜴也被用作驮运动物和守护者。",
	"Some tribes train giant weasels to serve as mounts or guardians, relying on their speed, keen senses, and ability to fit in kobold-sized tunnels. Other tribes use giant bats as mounts and guard animals, but the bats require a lot of space in which to move and are found only in lairs that feature large caves or close access to the surface world.": "一些部落训练巨型黄鼠狼作为坐骑或守护者，依靠它们的速度、敏锐的感觉和适应哥布林大小隧道的能力。其他部落使用巨型蝙蝠作为坐骑和护卫动物，但蝙蝠需要很大的活动空间，只能在具有大型洞穴或接近地面世界的巢穴中找到。",
	"Kobolds are cautious and fearful of bears, since bears often seek to live in caves and the animals might wander into the outermost parts of the lair, particularly when they're about to begin hibernating. Kobolds are likely to panic when they see a bear animal companion in the company of another creature. This aversion extends to owlbears and other bear-like creatures.": "哥布林对熊很谨慎，也很害怕，因为熊经常寻求在洞穴中生活，动物可能会徘徊在巢穴的最外面，特别是在它们即将开始冬眠的时候。当哥布林看到熊的动物伙伴与其他生物为伴时，很可能会感到恐慌。这种厌恶会延伸到猫头鹰熊和其他类似熊的生物。",
	"The lair of a kobold tribe is usually a maze of twisty little passages, sometimes stretching for hundreds of yards, and frequently guarded by traps. The area has a host of intersections, abrupt dead-ends, tunnels that cross over or under one another, concealed passages, and other features that make the lair difficult for outsiders  to navigate.": "哥布林部落的巢穴通常是一个由曲折的小通道组成的迷宫，有时绵延数百码，而且经常有陷阱把守。这里有大量的交叉口、突兀的死胡同、相互交叉或压在一起的隧道、隐蔽的通道，以及其他使外人难以驾驭老巢的特征。",
	"Creatures larger than a kobold have to squat or crawl in order to fit through the tunnels of a kobold warren, which by itself is enough to deter most hostile humanoids (such as orcs or hobgoblins) from trying to invade the kobolds' territory. Adventurers trying to eradicate a kobold infestation often find themselves stuck in low passages too narrow to turn around in, forcing them to move in single file and putting the burden of combat on the first and last people in line.": "比哥布林大的生物必须蹲着或爬着才能通过哥布林巢穴的隧道，这本身就足以阻止大多数敌对的人类（如兽人或哥布林）试图入侵哥布林的领土。试图铲除哥布林侵扰的冒险者经常发现自己被困在狭窄的通道里，无法转身，这迫使他们以单行线前进，并把战斗的负担放在排在第一位和最后一位的人身上。",
	"The layout of a kobold tribe's lair changes over time. The inhabitants regularly collapse or seal off tunnels and caves as they carve new ones. As such, any information that might be gleaned about the layout or location of areas within the lair becomes increasingly inaccurate as the kobolds \"migrate\" through the rock to meet the needs and ensure the safety of the community.": "哥布林部落的巢穴布局随时间而变化。居民们在开凿新的隧道和洞穴时，会定期坍塌或封闭隧道和洞穴。因此，随着哥布林在岩石中的 \"迁移\"，以满足社区的需要并确保其安全，任何可能收集到的关于巢穴内的布局或位置的信息都变得越来越不准确。",
	"Kobolds riddle their lairs with traps, using their gift for tunneling in conjunction with their skill at repurposing found items. Even though these traps are often far more deadly than the kobolds themselves, the kobolds don't feel threatened by having these devices in their home, any more than a human is afraid of its vicious but loyal guard dog.": "哥布林在他们的巢穴里布满了陷阱，利用他们挖地道的天赋和重新利用发现的物品的技能。尽管这些陷阱往往比哥布林本身更致命，但哥布林并不因为家中有这些装置而感到威胁，就像人类害怕其凶恶但忠诚的警卫犬一样。",
	"The most common traps in a lair are deadfalls, which the kobolds set up either to kill intruders or to block off key areas of the warren as invaders approach those places. Since the tribe is continually migrating and expanding its tunnel system, older tunnels are often employed in these traps. A tunnel can be rigged to collapse by pulling a rope connected to a support beam; a fleeing kobold can yank the rope, or the beam might be in a space so tight that a larger creature can't keep from dislodging it as the creature moves through area. Even if a deadfall traps some kobolds in an enclosed space, they and their fellows can usually chisel open an air vent within an hour, and create an opening large enough for the trapped kobolds to squeeze through in a few more.": "巢穴中最常见的陷阱是死亡陷阱，哥布林设置这些陷阱是为了杀死入侵者，或者在入侵者接近这些地方时封锁巢穴的关键区域。由于该部落不断迁移并扩大其隧道系统，因此这些陷阱中经常使用旧隧道。一条隧道可以通过拉动连接在支撑梁上的绳子而坍塌；逃跑的哥布林可以拉动绳子，或者梁可能在一个狭小的空间里，以至于较大的生物在通过该区域时不能不把它移开。即使死神把一些哥布林困在一个封闭的空间里，他们和他们的同伴通常可以在一小时内凿开一个通风口，并创造一个足够大的开口，让被困的哥布林再挤过去。",
	"Any place where a tunnel takes a sharp turn or becomes exceedingly narrow is a natural choke point that forces invaders to fight from a disadvantaged position. Such a location usually includes a small chamber in the ceiling that features murder holes, allowing the kobolds to drop rocks, poisonous vermin, and other annoyances on those below.": "任何一个隧道急转弯或变得极其狭窄的地方都是一个天然的阻塞点，迫使入侵者从一个不利的位置作战。这样的地方通常包括天花板上的一个小室，其特点是有杀人孔，允许哥布林向下面的人投掷石块、有毒的害虫和其他讨厌的东西。",
	"A kobold warren always has at least one escape tunnel that leads to a concealed surface exit, and the residents always know the shortest path to that tunnel. Usually an escape tunnel is rigged with traps to slow pursuers and ends in a narrow opening that requires even kobolds to squeeze through, to keep larger creatures from following them out.": "一个哥布林巢穴总是至少有一条通往隐蔽的地面出口的逃生通道，而居民们总是知道通往该通道的最短路径。通常情况下，逃亡通道上都装有陷阱，以减缓追捕者的速度，并在一个狭窄的开口处结束，即使是哥布林也需要挤过去，以防止大型生物跟随他们出去。",
	"A chamber that contains a kiln is usually one of the uppermost areas of the warren, because the fire needs to be vented to the surface in order to keep it from depleting the breathable air in the lair. Kobold crafters spend their time in this area, using the kiln to bake mud bricks and harden pottery. The room is also used for other noisy activities.": "包含窑炉的房间通常是巢穴中最上层的区域之一，因为火需要被排放到表面，以防止它耗尽巢穴中的可呼吸空气。哥布林手工业者在这个区域度过他们的时间，用窑炉来烘烤泥砖和硬化陶器。这个房间也被用来进行其他嘈杂的活动。",
	"Any chamber in the kobolds' underground complex that isn't immediately needed for another purpose is mined and excavated, both to extract usable ore and minerals and to provide room for later expansion of the den.": "在哥布林的地下建筑群中，任何不需要立即用于其他目的的房间都会被开采和挖掘，既是为了提取可用的矿石和矿物，也是为了给以后的洞穴扩建提供空间。",
	"Kobolds aren't good at agriculture, but they can get sustenance from subterranean mushrooms and hardy plant life that can live underground. A farm area might be completely underground, or a cavern near the surface with holes in the ceiling to let in some sunlight.": "哥布林不擅长农业，但他们可以从地下的蘑菇和能在地下生活的坚韧植物中获取养料。农场区域可能完全在地下，或者是靠近地表的洞穴，天花板上有洞，可以透进一些阳光。",
	"Much as humans do in their dwellings, kobolds set aside rooms with deep pits in which they preserve food for lean times.": "就像人类的住所一样，哥布林在房间里设置了深坑，在里面保存食物以备不时之需。",
	"Every lair has one or more spaces for living and sleeping, each large enough to comfortably hold ten to thirty adult kobolds. Individual kobolds might rest in a shallow pit or a personal-sized alcove, depending on the customs of the tribe. These spaces are used primarily for resting, although some kobolds might quietly work on crafts while others sleep. The creatures' sanitary needs, such as they are, are served by a deep pit near each sleeping area where refuse is deposited.": "每个巢穴都有一个或多个用于生活和睡眠的空间，每个空间都足以舒适地容纳10到30个成年哥布林。根据部落的习俗，个别哥布林可能会在一个浅坑或一个个人大小的凹室中休息。这些空间主要用于休息，尽管有些哥布林可能会在其他人睡觉时静静地做手工。这些生物的卫生需求，比如它们，是由每个睡眠区附近的一个深坑来满足的，垃圾就堆在那里。",
	"Most of the sleeping areas in the lair also double as hatcheries. Kobolds tend to their eggs by nesting them in a shallow pit lined with earth and dried grass. Because the eggs are susceptible to cold, they are kept near a slow-burning fire, or are protected by an insulating layer of dung and decomposing matter around the eggs.": "巢穴中的大多数睡眠区也都是孵化室。哥布林照顾它们的蛋，把它们筑在铺有泥土和干草的浅坑里。由于蛋很容易受寒，所以它们被放在缓慢燃烧的火堆附近，或者在蛋的周围用粪便和腐烂物的保温层保护起来。",
	"A warren's throne room is always protected by traps and features a shrine to Kurtulmak in the form of a carved idol behind the throne. Rather than entering the chamber to pay homage, kobolds offer prayers at its entrance with the belief that their god hears them. The location might include a basin where offerings such as metal nuggets, raw gems, and teeth can be left.": "巢穴的王室总是受到陷阱的保护，王座后面有一个以雕刻神像形式存在的库图尔马克的神龛。哥布林并不进入这个房间进行祭拜，而是在其入口处进行祈祷，相信他们的神会听到他们的祈祷。这个地方可能包括一个盆地，可以放置金属块、原始宝石和牙齿等祭品。",
	"Kobolds are amazingly creative at building traps, especially when adapting natural hazards and salvaged materials. They pound nails or spikes through a sapling and bend it to create a spring-arm, line pits or pools with sharp stones, rig platforms to collapse under anything more than a kobold's weight, and so on. Kobold traps might look flimsy or poorly designed, but a creature that gets hit with a bent sapling adorned with sharpened butter knives is liable to come away with a newfound respect for the little creatures.": "哥布林在建造陷阱方面有着惊人的创造力，尤其是在改造自然危害和残余材料方面。他们把钉子或钉子钉在树苗上，然后把它弯成一个弹簧臂，用锋利的石头把坑或池子排成一排，把平台弄得比哥布林的重量还要大，等等。哥布林陷阱可能看起来很脆弱或设计得很差，但如果一个生物被用磨得很锋利的黄油刀装饰的弯曲树苗击中，很可能会对这种小生物产生新的尊敬。",
	"The following are examples of common kobold traps:": "以下是常见的哥布林陷阱的例子。",
	"Barrels or small pots of oil (to be boiled, spilled, lit, or both)": "桶装或小锅装的油（要煮沸、溢出、点燃，或两者兼有）。",

	"Crates of centipedes": "成箱的蜈蚣",
	"Falling blocks": "坠落的木块",
	"Moats full of pitch or oil, which the kobolds can retreat behind and ignite": "装满沥青或石油的护城河，哥布林可以退到后面并点燃。",
	"Nets attached to ropes that pull creatures up vertical shafts far away from anyone who can help": "绑在绳索上的网，将生物拉上垂直的竖井，远离可以帮助的人。",

	"Volleys of needles": "挥舞的针头",
	"Nearly every activity in a kobold lair contributes to the tribe's survival. Guarding the lair keeps all of them safe from harm. Setting snares, farming mushrooms, and hunting provide food. Building traps deters intruders. Training guard animals helps protect the lair. Mining provides gems and ore for bribing enemies to leave them alone. Carving tunnels and rooms creates spaces for the next generation to live and improves the opportunity for the tribe to escape an overwhelming force.": "哥布林巢穴中的几乎每一项活动都有助于部落的生存。守卫巢穴可以使所有的人免受伤害。设置陷阱、种植蘑菇和打猎提供食物。建造陷阱可以阻止入侵者。训练守卫动物有助于保护巢穴。采矿提供宝石和矿石，用于贿赂敌人，使其不再骚扰他们。雕刻隧道和房间，为下一代创造生活空间，提高部落逃离压倒性力量的机会。",
	"The kobolds in a lair sleep in shifts, and all activities in the warren go on around the clock. Kobolds tend to be more active at night than during daylight hours, but unlike in a human settlement, there is no time when most of the inhabitants are resting. Warrens are built so that sleeping areas are somewhat isolated from the noise of work areas, enabling miners and crafters to do their work without awakening the sleepers. Kobolds learn at a young age to fall asleep to the noise of hammering nearby, but they still wake quickly at the sound of unusual activity.": "巢穴中的哥布林轮流睡觉，而巢穴中的所有活动则昼夜不停地进行。哥布林在夜间往往比白天更活跃，但与人类定居点不同的是，大多数居民没有休息的时间。巢穴的建造使睡眠区与工作区的噪音有一定程度的隔离，使矿工和手工艺人能够在不惊醒睡眠者的情况下进行工作。哥布林在很小的时候就学会了在附近的锤击声中入睡，但他们仍然会在不寻常的活动声中迅速醒来。",
	"Survival of the tribe is more important than the life of any particular individual. Even a cowardly kobold might sacrifice itself to give its fellows time to collapse a nearby tunnel and prevent invaders from getting to the rest of the tribe. All kobolds know that fleeing from danger, especially against bad odds, is the smart thing to do, but they are smart enough to realize that the strategic death of an individual can buy valuable time for the rest of the tribe, and each individual reluctantly accepts this need for sacrifice when it presents itself. This practice contributes to the reason why most common folk (and adventurers) think kobolds are stupid as well as weak; they've seen or heard of a lone kobold trying to hold off a group of armed attackers and attribute the act either to idiocy or the creature's ridiculously inflated idea of its prospects for success. The truth is that the lone kobold-persuaded into this role by its peers-is just hoping to slow down the invaders long enough to give the rest of the tribe time to prepare a lethal trap, an ambush, or a quick getaway.": "部落的生存比任何特定个人的生命更重要。即使是胆小的哥布林也可能牺牲自己，让同伴们有时间弄塌附近的隧道，防止入侵者接近部落的其他成员。所有的哥布林都知道，逃离危险，尤其是面对恶劣的环境，是明智之举，但他们也足够聪明，意识到个人的战略性死亡可以为部落的其他成员争取宝贵的时间，而当这种牺牲出现时，每个人都会勉强接受这种需要。这种做法是大多数普通人（和冒险者）认为哥布林愚蠢和软弱的原因；他们看到或听到一个孤独的哥布林试图挡住一群武装攻击者，并把这种行为归结为白痴或这种生物对其成功前景的可笑的夸大想法。事实是，孤独的哥布林--被它的同伴说服扮演这个角色--只是希望能拖住入侵者足够长的时间，让部落的其他成员有时间准备一个致命的陷阱、一个伏击，或者快速逃走。",
	"The tribe's leader is usually the oldest and smartest kobold; the other kobolds respect the old one's ability to survive so long, and they assume the leader will use that knowledge to help the tribe survive. In some cases, the best lesson a kobold leader can teach is \"I don't have to be faster than the bear. I just have to be faster than you.\"": "部落的首领通常是最年长和最聪明的哥布林；其他哥布林尊重年长者的生存能力，他们认为首领会利用这些知识来帮助部落生存。在某些情况下，哥布林领袖能教的最好的一课是 \"我不需要比熊快。我只需要比你更快。\"",
	"Mind flayers, also known as illithids, are horrific, alien humanoids that lurk deep within the Underdark. Masters of psionic energy, they use their mental powers to dominate other creatures. The fortunate among their victims are slain, their brains devoured.

	"The mind flayers relied on a slave race, the gith, to provide physical labor and sustenance when other sources of food grew thin. Eventually, the gith revolted. Whether the mind flayers became decadent or the gith discovered a weakness, none can say. What is known is that after centuries of domination, the mind flayer empire collapsed in less than a year. The gith rose up, slaughtered their masters, and destroyed almost all traces of the illithids' astral domains.": "当其他食物来源变得稀少时，心灵传播者依靠奴隶种族--吉斯，提供体力劳动和营养。最终，吉斯人造反了。不管是掠夺者变得颓废，还是吉斯人发现了一个弱点，没有人能够说得清楚。众所周知的是，经过几个世纪的统治，掠心者帝国在不到一年的时间里就崩溃了。吉斯人站了起来，屠杀了他们的主人，并摧毁了illithids星域的几乎所有痕迹。",
	"Only the mind flayers that had infiltrated the worlds of the Material Plane survived, and their safety was shortlived. Both the githzerai and the githyanki, two factions that arose from the victorious gith, sent hunting parties to root out and slaughter the remaining mind flayers.": "只有那些渗透到物质世界的心灵传播者幸存下来，而他们的安全是短暂的。吉斯泽拉（githzerai）和吉蒂扬基（githyanki）这两个从胜利的吉斯人中产生的派别，都派出了狩猎队，以铲除和屠杀剩余的心灵传播者。",
	"To this day, isolated clutches of mind flayers remain in hiding, seeking ways to recapture their former glory but hampered by their paranoia of being discovered and destroyed by their enemies.": "时至今日，与世隔绝的心灵传播者仍在躲藏，寻求重现他们昔日辉煌的方法，但却被他们被敌人发现和摧毁的偏执所阻碍。",

They use the brains of such creatures as food, of course, but they also need sentient humanoids to propagate.": "由于它们的饮食需求和它们的异世界生物学，心灵传播者必须保持在智慧类人的狩猎距离之内，即使这样做使它们容易受到敌人的攻击。当然，他们把这些生物的大脑当作食物，但他们也需要有智慧的人类来繁殖。",
	"When a mind flayer devours a brain, it acquires stray memories from its victim and shares them with the other members of its colony. Mind flayers also receive a degree of sustenance from the physical substance of a brain, but subsist primarily on the psionic energy that they extract from it in its final moments of activity.": "当一个噬心者吞噬了一个大脑，它就会从受害者身上获得游离的记忆，并与它的群体中的其他成员分享这些记忆。噬心者也从大脑的物理物质中获得一定程度的养分，但主要靠它们在大脑活动的最后时刻从大脑中提取的幻觉能量来维持生计。",
	"Through some quirk of the illithids' parasitic nature, the cultural sophistication of a mind flayer depends upon what sorts of brains are in its diet. For example, members of a colony that feed on grimlocks are no less intelligent than a colony that feeds on elves, but the former will pay almost no attention to crafting clothes to wear, and the latter will dress in elaborate robes.": "通过illithids的寄生性质的一些怪癖，噬心者的文化复杂程度取决于其食物中的各种大脑。例如，以鬼魂为食的族群成员的智力并不比以精灵为食的族群低，但前者几乎不注意制作衣服来穿，而后者则会穿上精致的长袍。",
	"This phenomenon extends to all displays of culture, from modes of architecture to the decorations that adorn illithid funerary brain jars.": "这种现象延伸到所有的文化展示中，从建筑模式到装饰illithid殡仪馆脑缸的装饰品。",
	"Mind flayers don't reproduce in the traditional sense. Instead, they lay eggs from which hatch tadpole-like creatures that are used to make more of their kind through a process called ceremorphosis. First, a captured humanoid is rendered docile by a blast of psionic power. A newly hatched tadpole is inserted into the victim's cranium, usually through a nostril or ear canal. The tadpole grows as it devours the humanoid's brain, attaching to the victim's brain stem and becoming its new brain. Over the course of a week, the humanoid body changes form, and a new mind flayer comes into being. The emergent mind flayer often retains a few dim memories from its previous form, but these vague recollections seldom have any bearing on its new life as a brain-eating monster.": "读心术者不进行传统意义上的繁殖。相反，它们产卵，从中孵化出蝌蚪状的生物，通过一个叫做 \"蜕变 \"的过程，用来制造更多的同类。首先，一个被俘虏的人形生物会被一阵幻觉的力量弄得很温顺。一个新孵化的蝌蚪被插入受害者的颅内，通常是通过鼻孔或耳道。蝌蚪在吞噬人形生物的大脑时不断成长，附着在受害者的脑干上，成为其新的大脑。在一周的时间里，人形的身体会改变形态，而一个新的噬心者会出现。新出现的噬心者通常会保留其先前形态的一些模糊记忆，但这些模糊的记忆对其作为食脑怪物的新生活很少有任何影响。",
	"Mind flayers use telepathy to communicate with each other and with other creatures. Among their own kind, they form a network of minds. Each mind flayer is an individual node of the network, taking on specific tasks, sharing information, and so on. At the center of this network is the elder brain. The elder brain is the most powerful member of a mind flayer colony. Just as mind flayers treat thralls made from captured humanoids, an elder brain expects perfect obedience from the illithids that dwell in its colony.": "心灵感应者使用心灵感应来相互沟通，并与其他生物沟通。在他们的同类中，他们形成了一个心灵网络。每个掠心者都是这个网络的一个独立节点，承担特定的任务，分享信息，等等。在这个网络的中心是长老脑。长老脑是掠心者群体中最强大的成员。就像思想絮乱者对待由捕获的人形生物制成的傀儡一样，长老之脑期望居住在它的殖民地中的伊里特人能够完全服从。",
	"If a single mind flayer in a colony sees or hears some thing, the elder brain and the rest of the illithids in the colony learn of it immediately. The colony relies on a collective memory, composed from the knowledge, experiences, and skills of all of its members and stored within the elder brain.": "如果一个族群中的一个思想絮乱者看到或听到了什么东西，长老脑和族群中的其他illithids会立即知道。群体依靠的是集体记忆，由所有成员的知识、经验和技能组成，并储存在长老脑中。",
	"In some ways, a mind flayer colony is like a great library of lore stored within its members' minds, with the elder brain as its librarian. Each individual illithid represents a category or subsection within the library. One mind flayer might specialize in biology, while another is an expert in defending the colony. Given that an individual mind flayer has a near-genius intellect, the extent of its knowledge is equivalent to the highest levels of scholarship attainable by humans.": "从某种程度上说，一个掠夺者群体就像一个储存在其成员头脑中的伟大传说图书馆，长老的大脑是它的图书管理员。每个人都代表图书馆中的一个类别或分支。一个弑心者可能专攻生物学，而另一个则是保卫蚁群的专家。考虑到单个弑心者拥有近乎天才的智力，其知识范围相当于人类可以达到的最高学术水平。",
	"There are limits to a colony's reach. An illithid can be part of its colony's network of minds only while it is within five miles of the elder brain. Beyond that distance, it is on its own. Mind flayers that venture away from the colony do so only under strict orders from the elder brain. Although such missions risk attracting unwanted attention, they can yield a treasure trove of knowledge and insights to be shared throughout the entire colony when a roaming mind flayer returns.": "群体的影响力是有限制的。一个Illithid只有在距离长老的大脑五英里之内，才能成为其群体思想网络的一部分。超过这个距离，它就只能靠自己了。掠夺者只有在长老大脑的严格命令下才会冒险离开殖民地。虽然这样的任务有可能引起不必要的注意，但它们可以产生一个知识和洞察力的宝库，当漫游的读心者返回时，可以在整个群体中分享。",
	"It is convenient for humanoids to understand a mind flayer colony by thinking of it as a single individual-the elder brain-directing a number of subservient, remote minds, which are the individual mind flayers. Perhaps at one time each mind flayer was independent, but now the elder brain is the only true power.": "对人类来说，理解一个掠心者群体很方便，可以把它想象成一个单独的个体--长老的大脑--指挥着一些服从的、遥远的头脑，这些头脑就是各个掠心者。也许在某一时期，每一个掠心者都是独立的，但现在长老的大脑是唯一真正的力量。",
	"The illithids know that their continued survival and their eventual return to power are possible only though perfect coordination and absolute obedience to the elder brain.": "伊利特人知道，只有通过完美的协调和对长者大脑的绝对服从，他们才有可能继续生存并最终恢复权力。",
	"An elder brain is arrogant, scheming, and power hungry, yet quick to flee or beg for mercy in the face of a powerful foe. It has no conception of joy, sympathy, or charity, but is well acquainted with fear, anger, and curiosity. It is an intellect utterly incapable of empathy or concern for creatures other than itself.": "长者的大脑傲慢、诡计多端、渴望权力，但在强大的敌人面前，又会迅速逃离或求饶。它对快乐、同情或慈善没有概念，但对恐惧、愤怒和好奇心却很熟悉。它是一个完全没有同情心的智力，也不关心自己以外的生物。",
	"An elder brain has a perfect recollection of its race's history. Consequently, it views itself as both a refugee and a victim, forced into hiding by barbaric monsters.": "一个长者的大脑对其种族的历史有着完美的回忆。因此，它认为自己既是难民又是受害者，被野蛮的怪物逼得躲了起来。",
	"An elder brain also sees itself as a savior of the mind flayer race and a living memorial that preserves the memories of the mind flayers' prey. By its twisted logic, humanoids whose brains are devoured by the colony are rendered immortal, their memories preserved forever in the elder brain's labyrinthine mind. When a mind flayer grows old, becomes infirm, or is grievously injured, the elder brain absorbs it-another form of immortality, as the mind flayer's mind dwells within the hive mind forever after.": "一个长老脑还把自己看作是噬心者种族的救星，是保存噬心者猎物记忆的活的纪念碑。根据它扭曲的逻辑，大脑被蚁群吞噬的人类会变得不朽，他们的记忆永远保存在长老大脑的迷宫中。当一个掠夺者变老、变得虚弱或受到严重伤害时，长老大脑会吸收它--这是另一种形式的不朽，因为掠夺者的思想永远居住在蜂巢思想中。",
	"See chapter 3 for more information on elder brains.": "关于老年人大脑的更多信息，见第三章。"
