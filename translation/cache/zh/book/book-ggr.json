	"From the back of her soaring roc, a sky knight surveys the spire-studded cityscape below. As the morning fog dissipates under the chill autumn sun, the city spreads out as far as she can see: lofty cathedrals, squat courthouses, towering apartments, sprawling tenements, cobblestone plazas, and broken ruins where once-majestic buildings have crumbled to rubble. She imagines the teeming masses below her: humans, elves, vedalken, minotaurs, goblins, loxodons, and other peoples, as some of them rise to greet the morning and others retire after a hard night of work or play. They are the reason she is here: sworn to protect them, she leads a flight of roc riders toward the fires raging in Precinct Three. Soldiers on the ground will put out the flames, while it's her job to deal with their source: the dragon she can just make out, clinging to the spire of a distant tower. Standing in her stirrups and raising her sword, she turns her mount toward the dragon, ready to battle once again for the sake of Ravnica.": "一位天空骑士从她翱翔的大鹏背上，俯瞰下面尖顶林立的城市景观。晨雾在秋日的寒风中消散，城市在她的视线范围内蔓延开来：高大的大教堂、狭小的法院、高耸的公寓、无垠的唐人街、鹅卵石广场，以及曾经雄伟的建筑坍塌成废墟的残垣断壁。她想象着她脚下熙熙攘攘的人群：人类、精灵、维达肯人、牛头人、地精、loxodons和其他民族，他们中的一些人起来迎接早晨，另一些人在经过一夜的辛勤工作或玩耍后退休。他们是她在这里的原因：她发誓要保护他们，她带领一队大鹏鸟骑手向第三区的大火冲去。地面上的士兵将扑灭火焰，而她的工作则是处理火焰的源头：她可以看到那条龙，紧贴着远处塔的尖顶。她站在马镫上，举起她的剑，把她的坐骑转向那条龙，准备为拉夫尼卡的利益再次战斗。",
	"Ravnica is a whole new world for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign to explore. A vast, sprawling city that covers the whole of the known world, Ravnica teems with intrigue and adventure, driven by the conflicts among the ten powerful guilds that rule the city.": "拉夫尼卡是一个全新的世界，供你的龙与地下城活动探索。作为一个覆盖整个已知世界的庞大城市，拉夫尼卡充满了阴谋和冒险，由统治这个城市的十个强大的行会之间的冲突所驱动。",
	"Ravnica originally appeared as a setting for the Magic: The Gathering trading card game. It has been the subject of eight card sets: 2005–6's {@i Ravnica: City of Guilds}, {@i Guildpact}, and {@i Dissension}; 2012–13's {@i Return to Ravnica}, {@i Gatecrash}, and {@i Dragon's Maze}; and 2018–19's {@i Guilds of Ravnica} and {@i Ravnica Allegiance}. Among fans of Magic, Ravnica is one of the most popular settings, in part because the world's ten guilds strongly support the way players build Magic decks.": "拉夫尼卡最初是作为《魔法：集结号》交易卡游戏的一个场景出现。它已经成为八个卡组的主题：2005-6年的{@i Ravnica: City of Guilds}、{@i Guildpact}和{@i Dissension}；2012-13年的{@i Return to Ravnica}、{@i Gatecrash}和{@i Dragon's Maze}；以及2018-19年的{@i Guilds of Ravnica}和{@i Ravnica Allegiance}。在魔术迷中，拉夫尼卡是最受欢迎的设定之一，部分原因是世界上的十个公会强烈支持玩家构建魔术卡组的方式。",
	"As it turns out, Ravnica's ten guilds also provide a great framework for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. They offer character archetypes, competing factions that player characters can join, and abundant opportunities to develop and drive a campaign driven by the guilds' schemes and interactions.": "事实证明，拉夫尼卡的十个公会也为龙与地下城的活动提供了一个很好的框架。它们提供了角色原型，玩家角色可以加入的竞争性派别，以及丰富的机会来发展和推动由公会的计划和互动驱动的活动。",
	"This book, then, is your point of entry into Ravnica as a setting for your D&D campaign. It guides you through the process of creating characters and adventures set here.": "那么，这本书是你进入拉夫尼卡作为D&D活动背景的起点。它指导你创建角色和冒险的过程。",
	"Chapter 1 is all about building characters. It offers new race and class options, reflecting the unique character of Ravnica as a Magic setting, and the creatures and characters seen on Magic cards. You can also use this material in any other D&D setting.": "第一章是关于建立角色的。它提供了新的种族和阶级选择，反映了拉夫尼卡作为一个魔法环境的独特特征，以及在魔法卡上看到的生物和角色。你也可以在任何其他D&D设定中使用这些材料。",
	"Race and class are only the skeleton of a character, though, and chapter 2 is aimed at helping you add flesh to those bones in order to make a character who is an integrated part of Ravnica's tapestry of guilds. The ten guilds are detailed in chapter 2, and each section includes a background that reflects a character's membership in the guild. This chapter also describes opportunities for characters to advance in rank and position within their guilds by acquiring renown.": "不过，种族和阶级只是角色的骨架，第二章的目的是帮助你在这些骨架上添加肉，以便使角色成为拉夫尼卡的行会织锦中的一个组成部分。第二章详细介绍了十个公会，每个部分都包括反映角色在公会中的成员身份的背景。这一章还描述了角色通过获得声望在其公会中提升等级和地位的机会。",
	"The focus of chapter 3 is on the city itself—and particularly on the Tenth District, which is the heart of Ravnica. The important precincts and neighborhoods of the district are described in broad overview, allowing you, as DM, plenty of leeway for developing the specifics of places and NPCs.": "第三章的重点是城市本身--特别是第十区，它是拉夫尼卡的中心。对该区的重要辖区和街区进行了广泛的描述，使你作为管理人有足够的余地来发展地方和NPC的具体情况。",
	"Chapter 4 is all about adventures in Ravnica, expanding on the material in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} with hundreds of seeds that can grow into full-fledged adventures in the fertile ground of a DM's imagination. This chapter also includes a short starting adventure you can use to launch a Ravnica campaign.": "第四章是关于拉夫尼卡的冒险，在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的基础上扩展了数百个种子，这些种子可以在DM的想象力的沃土上成长为成熟的冒险。本章还包括一个简短的起始冒险，你可以用来启动拉夫尼卡的活动。",
	"Chapter 5 includes magic items and other treasures for use as rewards in a Ravnica campaign. Many of these magic items are D&D interpretations of specific Magic artifact cards—not literal translations of their mechanics from one rules system to the other, but game elements inspired by the flavor and abilities of the cards.": "第5章包括在拉夫尼卡战役中作为奖励使用的魔法物品和其他宝物。这些魔法物品中有许多是对特定魔法神器卡片的D&D解释--不是将其机制从一个规则系统翻译成另一个规则系统，而是从卡片的味道和能力中获得灵感的游戏元素。",
	"Chapter 6 presents new monsters and NPCs, again reflecting the creatures seen on Magic cards as well as the nature of each guild. The guildmaster of each guild is detailed in this chapter, as are a variety of guild members.": "第6章介绍了新的怪物和NPC，再次反映了在魔法卡上看到的生物，以及每个公会的性质。本章详细介绍了每个行会的行会会长，以及各种行会成员。",
	"In all their fantastic diversity, the cosmopolitan citizens of Ravnica go about their daily business in bustling markets and shadowy back alleys. Shambling pack animals (mammals, reptiles, insects, and bizarre hybrids alike) carry their loads through the streets, while untamed wild things lurk in verdant greenbelts, rubble-strewn ruins, and sewers. And interwoven throughout it all, ten guilds vie for power, wealth, and influence:": "在所有奇妙的多样性中，拉夫尼卡的世界公民在繁华的市场和阴暗的小巷中进行他们的日常工作。摇摇晃晃的驮运动物（哺乳动物、爬行动物、昆虫和奇怪的混血儿）带着它们的货物穿过街道，而桀骜不驯的野生动物则潜伏在青翠的绿化带、碎石遍布的废墟和下水道中。在这一切的交织中，十个行会争夺权力、财富和影响力。",

The Azorius Senate functions as the government of Ravnica, built on the three columns of a legislative, a judicial, and an executive branch under the leadership of {@creature Isperia|GGR}, the sphinx Supreme Judge.": "{@b Azorius Senate}. 阿佐里乌斯元老院作为拉夫尼卡的政府，在斯芬克斯最高法官（%%1%）的领导下，建立在立法、司法和行政三根柱子上。",

Its enigmatic leader, {@creature Lazav|GGR}, wears many faces.": "{@b House Dimir}. 迪米尔家族以信息为业，在信使、调查员和档案员的外表下运作一个间谍组织。其神秘的领导人，(1%)，有很多面孔。",

	"{@b Cult of Rakdos}. The demonic Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} is the jester in Ravnica's culture, using satire and performance to skewer the powerful and embolden the weak. But it is a cruel and bloodthirsty jester, in the manner of its demonic leader, and it supplements parody and levity with blood and fire.": "{@b Cult of Rakdos}. 恶魔教派（%1%）是拉夫尼卡文化中的小丑，利用讽刺和表演来讽刺强者，给弱者壮胆。但它是一个残酷而嗜血的小丑，就像它的恶魔领袖一样，它用血和火来补充嘲讽和轻浮。",

	"These ten guilds stand as the foundation of power on Ravnica. Each maintains a distinctive identity and civic function, a diverse collection of creatures, and a subculture of its own. The guilds' history is a web of wars, intrigue, and political machinations stretching over the millennia during which they have vied for control of the world. Their roles were established thousands of years ago in a magical treaty called the Guildpact, which not only assigned each guild a function, but also enforced an uneasy peace among them.": "这十个行会是拉夫尼卡的权力基础。每个公会都保持着独特的身份和公民职能，拥有不同的生物，并拥有自己的亚文化。这些公会的历史是一张由战争、阴谋和政治阴谋组成的网络，绵延数千年，期间他们争夺对世界的控制权。他们的角色是在几千年前被称为 \"行会契约 \"的魔法条约中确立的，该条约不仅为每个行会分配了职能，而且还在他们之间实施了不稳定的和平。",
	"Sometimes you might want to choose a guild at random. Here's a table you can use in those situations.": "有时你可能想随机选择一个行会。这里有一个表格，你可以在这些情况下使用。",

	"More than ten thousand years ago, a war tore across the world of Ravnica. Ten armies battled for control of the world in a conflict that ended with the creation of a magical contract of immense power known as the Guildpact. The leaders of each of the ten armies—ancient beings known as paruns—were the signatories to the Guildpact, and they became the first guildmasters of Ravnica.": "一万多年前，一场战争撕裂了拉夫尼卡世界。在这场冲突中，十支军队为争夺世界的控制权而战，最终形成了一份具有巨大力量的魔法契约，即《公会契约》。这十支军队的领导人--被称为 \"parun \"的古代生物--是《公会契约》的签署者，他们成为拉夫尼卡的第一批公会会长。",
	"The text of the Guildpact spelled out specific roles for each guild within the infrastructure of Ravnica, allowing the city to grow while the guilds coexisted in relative peace. But the true power of the Guildpact was the strength of its magically binding force, which absolutely prevented large-scale violence among the guilds.": "行会契约的文本为每个行会在拉夫尼卡的基础设施中规定了具体的角色，使城市得以发展，而各行会则相对和平地共存。但《行会契约》的真正力量在于其神奇的约束力，它绝对能阻止各行会之间的大规模暴力。",
	"For ten millennia, the city grew and flourished under this structure as the guilds evolved into unique and powerful forces, often venturing far from their original purpose.": "一万年来，城市在这种结构下成长和繁荣，因为行会演变为独特而强大的力量，经常远离其最初的目的而冒险。",
	"The signing of the Guildpact marked the beginning of the modern Ravnican calendar. Years prior to that pivotal event are denoted as \"Al Concordant,\" or AC, and counted backward from 1 AC. Years after the signing are \"Zal Concordant,\" ZC. The current date is 10,076 ZC, usually referred to as '76.": "行会契约》的签署标志着现代拉夫尼卡历法的开始。在这一关键事件之前的年份被称为 \"Al Concordant\"，即AC，并从AC1开始向后计算。签署后的年份为 \"Zal Concordant\"，即ZC。目前的日期是10,076 ZC，通常被称为76年。",
	"During the Decamillennial Celebration of 10,000 ZC, commemorating a monumental anniversary of the Guildpact's signing, the pact was broken, the ancient balance was shattered, and Ravnica was thrown into chaos. It didn't take long for wealthy power-mongers to begin seizing control of elements in the city, turning the guilds to their service instead of the other way around. Eventually, the ten-thousand-year-old guild culture and division of duties reasserted itself. The ten guilds regained their dominant positions, but without the magically binding force of the Guildpact to maintain the balance among them.": "在10,000 ZC的十年庆典中，为了纪念公会契约签署的纪念日，契约被打破了，古老的平衡被打破了，拉夫尼卡被扔进了一片混乱之中。没过多久，富有的权贵们就开始控制城市中的各种元素，让公会为他们服务，而不是反过来。最终，有着一万年历史的行会文化和职责分工重新得到了体现。十个行会重新获得了他们的主导地位，但没有了行会契约的神奇约束力来维持他们之间的平衡。",
	"Years later, in 10,075 ZC, the Izzet guildmaster discovered that Azor, founder of the Azorius Senate, had created a contingency plan that would take effect if the magic of the Guildpact were ever broken. An intricate network of ley lines sprawling across the districts of Ravnica, called the Implicit Maze, offered a test to the guilds: if they could cooperate to solve the maze, they would secure the power of a new Guildpact. That power was eventually bestowed—incarnated, actually—in the person of Jace Beleren, who became the Living Guildpact. His word became the binding law of Ravnica. Any law he verbally confirmed became magically unbreakable, and the responsibility of keeping the guilds in balance fell to him.": "多年后，在10,075 ZC，伊泽特公会的会长发现，阿索里乌斯元老院的创始人阿索尔创造了一个应急计划，如果公会契约的魔法被打破，这个计划就会生效。一个错综复杂的雷系网络遍布拉夫尼卡的各个地区，被称为 \"隐秘迷宫\"，为各公会提供了一个考验：如果他们能合作解决这个迷宫，他们就能获得新的公会契约的力量。这种力量最终被赋予了--实际上是化身为杰斯-贝勒伦，他成为了活着的公会契约。他的话成为了拉夫尼卡的约束性法律。他口头确认的任何法律在魔法上都是牢不可破的，而保持公会平衡的责任也落在了他身上。",
	"Jace is a Planeswalker, with the ability to travel from world to world, and his attention never remains focused on Ravnica for long. Thanks to his involvement with other Planeswalkers, he spends extended periods of time away from Ravnica. During his absences, Ravnica has to fend for itself, and that means that the guilds return to their old habits of fighting with each other over the smallest scraps of influence that could tilt the balance of power in their favor.": "杰斯是一个星球行者，有能力从一个世界到另一个世界，而他的注意力从来没有长时间集中在拉夫尼卡。由于他与其他行星行者的关系，他有很长一段时间不在拉夫尼卡。在他不在的时候，拉夫尼卡不得不自求多福，这意味着各行会又回到了他们的老习惯，为争夺最小的影响力碎片而相互争斗，而这些碎片可能会使权力的天平向他们倾斜。",
	"These conflicts erupt in a variety of forms. Sometimes guilds clash violently in the streets: Boros forces try to quell Gruul riots, Azorius arresters raid a {@creature Rakdos|GGR} murder show, or Selesnya forces come together to repel a Golgari incursion. More often, sinister plots unfold in secret, through infiltration, sabotage, theft, and deception. Schemes are hidden beneath layers of other schemes, making the intention behind them nearly impossible to discover. The guildmasters are often the source of these plots, but sometimes subordinates attack other guilds to gain more influence within their own. In the absence of the Guildpact, some people believe that it's only a matter of time until these schemes and skirmishes escalate into all-out war on a scale that Ravnica hasn't known for ten millennia.": "这些冲突以各种形式爆发出来。有时，行会在街上发生激烈的冲突。Boros的部队试图平息格鲁尔的暴乱，Azorius的逮捕者突袭了一场{@creature Rakdos|GGR}谋杀秀，或者Selesnya的部队一起击退了Golgari的入侵。更多的时候，险恶的阴谋是通过渗透、破坏、偷窃和欺骗的方式秘密展开的。阴谋被隐藏在其他阴谋的层层叠叠之下，使其背后的意图几乎无法被发现。行会会长通常是这些阴谋的源头，但有时下属也会攻击其他行会，以获得自己行会内更大的影响力。在没有公会契约的情况下，有些人认为，这些阴谋和小规模冲突升级为全面战争只是时间问题，拉夫尼卡已经有一万年没有这样的规模了。",
	"With the precarious peace always hanging in the balance, opportunities abound for adventurers to serve their guilds or advance their own agendas. Whether delving into the dungeons of the undercity, pursuing assassins through the bustling streets, negotiating accords among the rich and powerful, or sniffing out corruption in the halls of law, the characters in a Ravnica campaign have a world of adventure to explore.": "由于不稳定的和平总是悬而未决，冒险者们有很多机会为他们的公会服务或推进自己的议程。无论是深入地下城的地牢，在繁华的街道上追捕刺客，在富人和权贵之间谈判协议，还是在法律的殿堂里嗅出腐败，拉夫尼卡战役中的人物都有一个冒险的世界可以探索。",

	"Ravnica is a vast city, covering the entirety of the world in many layers of construction, from deep sewers and catacombs to sky-raking spires. No single map can encompass the tremendous scope of its sprawl, and its borders (if it has any) are unknown, except possibly to those who live near the edges.": "拉夫尼卡是一座巨大的城市，从深邃的下水道和地下墓穴到高耸入云的尖塔，许多建筑覆盖了整个世界。没有一张地图能涵盖它的巨大范围，它的边界（如果它有的话）也是未知的，除了那些住在边缘的人可能知道。",
	"The story of Ravnica focuses on its core. Sometimes called the city proper, this core is divided into ten districts, each of which is a huge urban environment in its own right. The districts are named in simple numerical order from the First to the Tenth. No correlation exists between the ten guilds and the ten districts; all ten guilds are active in all ten districts. The Tenth District, in particular, is a hotbed of activity where all the guilds maintain their primary headquarters. It is the focus of chapter 3.": "拉夫尼卡的故事集中在它的核心。这个核心有时被称为城市本身，它被分为十个区，每个区都是一个巨大的城市环境。这些地区以简单的数字顺序命名，从第一区到第十区。十个行会和十个区之间不存在任何关联；所有十个行会都在所有十个区活动。特别是第十区，它是一个活动的温床，所有的行会都在这里设有主要的总部。它是第三章的重点。",
	"A huge avenue called the Transguild Promenade runs through all ten districts, making it the most notable landmark for navigation through the city's heart. Lined with markets, small parks, and colonnades, the Promenade is a commercial thoroughfare used to transport loads of cargo. On celebration days, it becomes the city's most popular parade route. Even when guild conflicts run hot, Ravnicans respect the sanctity of the Promenade as neutral ground.": "一条名为 \"跨行会长廊 \"的巨大大道贯穿所有十个区，使其成为穿越城市中心的最显著的导航地标。长廊两旁有市场、小公园和柱廊，是一条用于运输货物的商业大道。在庆典日，它成为城市最受欢迎的游行路线。即使在公会冲突激烈的时候，拉夫尼科人也会尊重长廊作为中立地的神圣性。",
	"Beyond the core are an uncounted number of other districts, which originated as outlying cities that gradually melded into the expanding metropolis. Well-known districts outside the core include the Smelting District, Irbitov (the mausoleum district), and Jezeru (the lake district).": "在核心区之外，还有不计其数的其他地区，这些地区起源于外围城市，逐渐融入不断扩张的大都市。核心区以外的著名地区包括冶炼区、伊尔比托夫（陵墓区）和杰泽鲁（湖区）。",
	"Districts, whether in the city proper or beyond it, are the fundamental configurations that define Ravnica. They are informally divided into various quarters, neighborhoods, and the like. Some of these areas extend across district boundaries. Deadbridge, for example, existed as a well-defined neighborhood before Ravnica City was formally divided into ten districts, and that division was made without consideration of Deadbridge's informally acknowledged boundaries. Part of Deadbridge, known as Deadbridge Chasm, occupies much of the Tenth District's Precinct Six, but it extends out into the neighboring area. Similar neighborhoods, both within and outside the city proper, include the Steambath Quarter, the Wrights' Quarter, and Mahovna, the Haven of Moss.": "地区，无论是在城市本身还是在城市之外，都是定义拉夫尼卡的基本配置。它们被非正式地划分为各种区、街区等。其中一些区域跨越了区界。例如，在拉夫尼卡城被正式划分为十个区之前，死桥（Deadbridge）就作为一个明确的街区存在，而这种划分没有考虑到死桥非正式承认的边界。死桥的一部分被称为 \"死桥鸿沟\"，占据了第十区第六区的大部分区域，但它也延伸到了邻近地区。类似的街区，无论是在城市内部还是外部，都包括Steambath Quarter、Wright'Quarter和Mahovna，Moss的避难所。",
	"Members of Ravnica's guilds typically carry guild insignia with them, though in some cases (notably House Dimir) the insignia might be carefully hidden. A replacement insignia costs 5 gp and is available only to members of the guild.

	"This book uses standard D&D coinage, as detailed in the {@i Player's Handbook}, but in Ravnica, citizens refer to their money as zibs and zinos, with 100 zibs to 1 zino.

	"A mixture of technological advancement and sophisticated magic offers amenities to the people of Ravnica that would be extraordinary to folk in most D&D worlds, except one like Eberron. The nicer neighborhoods of the city enjoy central heating and plumbing (thanks to the work of the Izzet League), elevators, and spacious apartments. Even poorer neighborhoods boast clean and smooth roads and sturdy construction. No one needs to go hungry in Ravnica, because the Golgari Swarm provides a bare minimum of sustenance to anyone who can't afford better food, though it is best not to think too much about where the thick gruel comes from. (In practical terms, even a character who can't afford more than a wretched lifestyle doesn't need to go hungry.)": "科技的进步和复杂的魔法为拉夫尼卡的人们提供了便利，这些便利对于大多数D&D世界的人们来说都是非同寻常的，除了像Eberron这样的世界。城市中较好的社区享有中央供暖和管道（感谢伊泽特联盟的工作）、电梯和宽敞的公寓。即使是较贫穷的社区也拥有干净平整的道路和坚固的建筑。在拉夫尼卡，没有人需要挨饿，因为戈尔加里蜂群为那些买不起更好食物的人提供了最低限度的食物，尽管最好不要过多地考虑这些浓稠的粥是怎么来的。(从实际情况来看，即使是一个负担不起更多可怜的生活方式的角色也不需要挨饿）。",
	"The citizens of Ravnica enjoy plenty of leisure time, and the city offers an abundance of ways to fill it. Ravnica features restaurants with extensive collections of fine wines, cafés serving coffee and tea, street vendors offering portable meals, and bakeries that sell a wide variety of breads and pastries.

The D&D game relies on cooperation among the players, so it's helpful for the player characters to find common ground that unites them despite their differences in guild affiliation, ideals, and agendas. Even though some guild leaders (especially the villainous ones) might talk about exterminating or dominating other guilds, many guild members have family, lovers, friends, and acquaintances among other guilds. Those positive associations can bind an adventuring party together.": "虽然行会之间的冲突推动了拉夫尼卡战役中的大部分行动，但重要的是不要让这种紧张关系在冒险者队伍中造成过多的摩擦。D&D游戏依赖于玩家之间的合作，因此，尽管玩家角色在公会归属、理想和议程方面存在差异，但找到将他们团结起来的共同点是很有帮助的。尽管一些公会的领导者（尤其是反派）可能会谈论消灭或支配其他公会，但许多公会成员在其他公会中都有家人、爱人、朋友和熟人。这些积极的关联可以将一个冒险队伍捆绑在一起。",

	"As stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, bonds represent your connections to people, places, and events in the world. Contacts are people you have a connection to, but they're not necessarily bonds. People can be bonds if they inspire you, motivate you, or make you act against your best interests. (They can represent flaws if their existence amounts to a weakness for you.) Contacts, in comparison, are simply people you know. They might be friends, rivals, or even family members, but their relationship with you is rarely as strong as with a bond.": "如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}所述，债券代表你与世界上的人、地方和事件的联系。联系人是与你有联系的人，但他们不一定是纽带。如果人们激励你、鼓舞你，或使你的行为违背你的最佳利益，他们就可以成为纽带。(如果他们的存在相当于你的弱点，他们就可以代表缺陷。）相比之下，联系人只是你认识的人。他们可能是朋友、对手，甚至是家庭成员，但他们与你的关系很少像纽带那样牢固。",
	"Although the tables of contacts in this chapter describe nonplayer characters who are members of guilds (your own and others), you are likely to acquire guildless contacts as well.

Then you'll roll once on the table of contacts from other guilds. That contact could be either an ally or a rival, or you might instead gain a third contact from your own guild.": "你将在联系人表中为你的公会掷两次骰子，除非你是在迪米尔家族（在该公会的章节中解释）。你的第一次滚动会给你一个盟友。你的第二次滚动会给你一个对手，他可能是友好的、嫉妒的或敌对的。(这些人有可能是同一个人；例如，一个人可能对你很友好，但同时又嫉妒你的成功）。然后，你将在其他公会的联系人表上滚动一次。这个联系人可能是盟友或对手，或者你可能从你自己的公会获得第三个联系人。",
	"The guilds might be considered the heart and soul of Ravnica, but they aren't all that makes up the city. Many citizens choose not to join a guild—some because they can't be bothered, and others because they have philosophical objections to the very idea of guilds. The so-called guildless are especially common in areas that might be considered rural: places farther from the heart of the city and the larger exurban districts. But even in the city's heart, some guildless citizens actively oppose the influence of the guilds, blaming the world's strife and suffering on an elite hierarchy that seeks to take control, consolidate wealth, and fragment a populace against itself. The numbers of the guildless include people engaged in a wide variety of trades and services that aren't managed and regulated by the guilds, from baking to cartography. University professors, guides, traders, and bartenders might be guildless. Criminal gangs set themselves up as rivals to the Orzhov, and even military forces operate independent of guild control, serving as neighborhood police forces or mercenaries for hire. About half of Ravnica's population is guildless. That proportion is higher for some races than others: nearly all elves, for example, belong to the Golgari, Selesnya, or Simic guilds, but a majority of goblins are guildless. Loxodons tend to have a strong sense of community, so they readily join guilds. And when they don't, they join groups of another sort, such as mercenary companies or cults. Simic hybrids are all created within the Simic Combine, so it's rare for them not to be part of it.": "公会可能被认为是拉夫尼卡的核心和灵魂，但它们并不是构成这个城市的全部。许多市民选择不加入公会--有些是因为他们不愿意，有些是因为他们在哲学上反对公会的想法。所谓的无公会者在可能被认为是农村的地区特别常见：远离城市中心的地方和较大的郊区。但即使在城市中心，一些无公会的市民也积极反对公会的影响，将世界上的纷争和苦难归咎于精英阶层，他们试图控制、巩固财富，并使民众自相残杀。无公会的人数包括从事各种不受公会管理和规范的贸易和服务的人，从烘烤到制图。大学教授、导游、商人和酒保都可能是无公会者。犯罪团伙将自己设定为Orzhov的对手，甚至军事力量也独立于公会控制之外，充当附近的警察部队或受雇的雇佣兵。拉夫尼卡大约一半的人口是无公会的。一些种族的这一比例高于其他种族：例如，几乎所有的精灵都属于戈尔加里、塞勒斯尼亚或西米克公会，但大多数地精都没有公会。Loxodons倾向于有强烈的社区意识，所以他们很容易加入公会。如果他们不这样做，他们就会加入另一种团体，如雇佣兵公司或邪教。西米克混血儿都是在西米克联合体内创造的，所以他们很少不成为联合体的一部分。",

They provide you with lodging and food in dire circumstances and pay for your funeral if needed. If you are accused of a crime, your guild offers legal support, as long as a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime was justifiable.": "{@b Renown 3 or Higher}. 当你在自己的公会中的声望分数至少达到3分时，你就是公会中成熟的、受尊敬的成员。公会的其他成员默认对你有友好的态度。(尽管你的声望很高，但公会的个别成员可能有理由不喜欢你）。他们在恶劣的情况下为你提供住宿和食物，如果需要的话，还会为你的葬礼买单。如果你被指控犯罪，你的公会会提供法律支持，只要能很好地证明你是无辜的或犯罪是合理的。",
	"{@b Renown 5 or Higher}. When your renown score with any guild reaches 5, you gain an additional contact within the guild. This contact might be a character you met during your adventures or someone who seeks you out because of your fame. Your DM will assign you a contact or have you roll on the Contacts table for the appropriate guild.": "{@b Renown 5 or Higher}. 当你在任何公会的声望值达到5时，你会在该公会中获得一个额外的联系人。这个联系人可能是你在冒险过程中遇到的一个角色，或者是因为你的名气而找你的人。你的管理员会给你指定一个联系人，或者让你在联系人表上为相应的行会打分。",
	"Some guilds—notably Azorius, Orzhov, and Boros—have well-defined hierarchies that characters can ascend through as they improve their renown scores.": "一些公会--特别是阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）、奥尔佐夫（Orzhov）和鲍罗斯（Boros）--有明确的等级制度，角色可以在提高声望值的过程中升迁。",
	"Other guilds have positions of honor that characters can apply for if their renown score is high enough. Not every member of the Selesnya Conclave aspires to be a sagittar (an archer assigned to guard an important guild location), but any character who meets the prerequisites can apply for the position. Ultimately, the DM decides whether a character qualifies for such a role, with a certain renown score as a minimum requirement.": "其他行会有一些荣誉职位，如果他们的声望值足够高，就可以申请。并非每个塞勒斯尼亚公会的成员都渴望成为sagittar（被派去守卫公会重要地点的弓箭手），但任何符合前提条件的角色都可以申请这个职位。最终，DM决定一个角色是否有资格担任这样的角色，一定的声望值是最低要求。",
	"Several guilds provide a salary among the benefits of renown within the guild. The salary is described as sufficient to maintain a lifestyle of a certain level. If you earn a salary, you can live at the specified lifestyle without paying the normal daily expenditure. See {@book chapter 5|PHB|5|Expenses} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} for more information on lifestyle expenses.": "一些行会在行会内的声誉福利中提供工资。工资被描述为足以维持一定水平的生活方式。如果你赚取了工资，你就可以在指定的生活方式下生活，而无需支付正常的日常开支。关于生活方式支出的更多信息，请参见{@book chapter 5|PHB|5|Expenses}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}。",
	"A prominent position in a guild often allows you to call on the services of lower-ranking members to assist you in your work. When you do, they are assumed to be loyal followers who help you to the best of their ability. Some of them are assigned to help you for the duration of a single task or mission, while others are under your permanent command, staffing a laboratory, workshop, or garrison where you are in charge. Depending on their role, they might help you in dangerous situations (like combat) or flee from them. You might assign them to perform tasks in your absence, which could include undertaking research, looking for witnesses to a crime, or carrying out a small-scale raid, for example, depending on their role and capabilities. You carry the responsibility for their lives and welfare, ultimately, and if the guild decides that you are abusing your authority and mistreating the members beneath you, you might lose renown, lose your rank or status in the guild, or even be cast out of the guild.": "在行会中的重要地位往往允许你调用低级成员的服务来协助你的工作。当你这样做时，他们被认为是忠诚的追随者，会尽其所能地帮助你。他们中的一些人被指派在单一任务或使命期间帮助你，而另一些人则在你的长期指挥下，为你负责的实验室、车间或驻军配备人员。根据他们的角色，他们可能在危险的情况下帮助你（如战斗），也可能从危险中逃离。你可能会指派他们在你不在的时候执行任务，这可能包括进行研究，寻找犯罪的证人，或者进行一次小规模的突袭，例如，根据他们的角色和能力。你最终要对他们的生活和福利负责，如果公会决定你滥用权力，虐待你下面的成员，你可能会失去声望，失去你在公会的等级或地位，甚至被赶出公会。",
	"If you commit a serious offense against your guild or its members, you might lose renown within the guild. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to the DM's discretion. A character's renown score with a guild can never drop below 0. If your renown score drops below the threshold for a rank or privilege you have attained, you lose that benefit. Even if you regain the lost renown, you might find it more difficult to again secure a position or rank you have previously lost.": "如果你对你的公会或其成员犯下严重的违法行为，你可能会在公会中失去声望。损失的程度取决于违规行为，由管理员决定。如果你的声望值低于你已经获得的等级或特权的阈值，你就会失去该利益。即使你重新获得了失去的声望，你可能会发现再次获得你以前失去的职位或等级更加困难。",
	"As you're playing a character associated with one of the guilds, think about your character's relationship with the guild. Guild members can be grouped into four categories, depending on their motivations and priorities: loyalists, opportunists, rebels, and anomalies. Which one of these descriptions best fits your character?": "当你在扮演一个与某个行会有关的角色时，要考虑你的角色与行会的关系。行会成员可以根据他们的动机和优先次序分为四类：忠诚者、机会主义者、反叛者和异常者。这些描述中的哪一个最适合你的角色？",
	"{@b Loyalists} join a guild because they firmly believe in the guild's ideals and want to advance its goals. Their membership in the guild is a badge of identity for them. They're typically of the races and classes most strongly associated with the guild, and their personality traits and ideals fall in line with the suggestions in this chapter. An idealistic human or a minotaur paladin in the Boros Legion is an example of a loyalist.": "{@b Loyalists}加入行会是因为他们坚信行会的理想，并希望推动行会的目标。他们在行会中的成员身份是他们的一个徽章。他们通常属于与公会联系最紧密的种族和阶级，他们的个性特征和理想与本章的建议相一致。一个理想主义的人类或博罗军团中的牛头人圣骑士就是一个忠诚者的例子。",
	"{@b Opportunists} join a guild based on what they can gain from becoming members. Every guild offers its members something—whether concrete benefits such as opportunities for wealth or more subtle, intangible rewards such as social status—and getting that something is the primary motivation for this type of character. Opportunists often pay lip service to the ideals and goals of the guild, looking out for themselves first and the guild second (at best). A selfish human fighter who uses membership in the Boros Legion as an excuse to bully and steal from others would be an opportunist.": "{@b Opportunists}加入一个公会是基于他们能从成为会员中获得什么。每个公会都会为其成员提供一些东西--无论是具体的利益，如获得财富的机会，还是更微妙的、无形的奖励，如社会地位，而获得这些东西是这类人物的主要动机。机会主义者往往对公会的理想和目标口惠而实不至，首先为自己着想，其次才是为公会着想（最好是）。一个自私的人类战士，把加入波罗斯军团作为欺负和偷窃他人的借口，这就是机会主义者。",
	"{@b Rebels} love the guilds they're in but don't conform to guild expectations. They might be good-hearted idealists trying to bend a shady guild toward nobler pursuits, or they might be selfish egotists hoping to direct the guild's actions toward promoting their own interests. Most rebels are typical members of the guild in terms of race and class, but they vary from type when it comes to personalities and ideals. A Boros legionnaire with tyrannical tendencies who thinks the Boros should enforce justice with an iron fist would be a rebel.": "{@b Rebels}热爱他们所在的行会，但不符合行会的期望。他们可能是心地善良的理想主义者，试图让一个阴暗的公会屈服于更高尚的追求，也可能是自私的利己主义者，希望将公会的行动导向促进自己的利益。大多数反叛者在种族和阶级方面都是典型的公会成员，但当涉及到个性和理想时，他们的类型就不同了。一个有暴虐倾向的博罗军团成员，认为博罗军团应该用铁拳来执行正义，这就是叛军。",
	"{@b Anomalies} are individuals who join guilds contrary to all expectations. Their race or class (or both) is outside the norm for their guild, but their personalities and ideals fall perfectly in line; that's why they joined. A vedalken paladin in the Boros Legion, or an Ordruun minotaur in the Orzhov Syndicate, would fall into this category.": "{@b Anomalies}是加入公会的个人，与所有的期望相反。他们的种族或阶级（或两者）超出了他们公会的标准，但他们的个性和理想却完全符合；这就是他们加入的原因。Boros军团中的维达肯圣骑士，或者Orzhov辛迪加中的奥德鲁恩牛头人，都属于这种类型。",
	"Some adventurers do exactly what they're told, spending their careers doing the bidding of their guild superiors. Most adventuring characters, though, prefer more independence. You can roll a {@dice d6} or choose from the options in the table below to establish a reason for the freedom enjoyed by your character.": "有些冒险者完全听从他们的吩咐，在他们的职业生涯中为他们的公会上级服务。不过，大多数冒险者喜欢更多的独立性。你可以掷出{@dice d6}或从下表中的选项中选择，以确定你的角色享有自由的原因。",

	"I've been singled out for special assignments because somebody up the ranks hates me.": "我被挑出来执行特殊任务，因为上级有人讨厌我。",
	"I'm moonlighting, and I'd get in trouble if my superiors knew what I was up to.": "我在做兼职，如果我的上级知道我在做什么，我就会有麻烦。",
	"I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors want to help them.": "我被置于另一个公会的支配之下，因为我的上级想帮助他们。",
	"I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors hope I'll fail.": "我被置于另一个公会的支配之下，因为我的上级希望我失败。",
	"If events in your character's adventuring career warrant it, you can abandon membership in one guild and join a different one. Once you leave a guild, you can rarely go back.": "如果你的角色的冒险生涯中的事件需要，你可以放弃一个行会的成员资格而加入另一个行会。一旦你离开一个公会，你就很少能再回去。",
	"Your DM decides what requirements you must meet to join a new guild. Some guilds welcome new recruits and make the process as simple as possible, while others require a demonstration of loyalty.": "你的DM决定你必须满足哪些要求才能加入一个新的公会。有些公会欢迎新成员加入，并尽可能地简化程序，而有些公会则要求展示忠诚度。",
	"When you change guilds, you lose all the privileges of membership in your original guild, including the background feature granted to you by your original guild and any rank or position you have achieved in that guild. You also lose access to your old guild spells, unless they are already on your class's spell list, among your spells known, or in your spellbook. Except in exceptional circumstances, your renown score with your original guild becomes 0.": "当你改变行会时，你会失去在原行会中的所有特权，包括原行会授予你的背景特征和你在该行会中取得的任何等级或职位。你也失去了使用旧公会法术的权利，除非这些法术已经在你等级的法术列表中，在你的已知法术中，或者在你的法术书中。除非在特殊情况下，你在原公会的声望值变为0。",
	"Your old guild expects you to return your guild insignia, and your new guild gives you one to replace it.": "你的旧行会希望你归还你的行会徽章，而你的新行会给你一个徽章来代替它。",
	"You gain the privileges of membership in your new guild. These include the background feature granted by your new guild, although your DM might decide that it takes you a while to gain the full benefit. For example, a character who leaves another guild to join the Gruul Clans doesn't immediately know the ways of the rubblebelts, but has to gain that familiarity over time. You also gain access to your new guild spells.": "你获得了新行会成员的特权。这些包括你的新公会授予的背景功能，尽管你的DM可能会决定你需要一段时间才能获得全部好处。例如，一个离开另一个公会加入格鲁尔家族的角色不会立即知道瓦砾地带的方式，而是要随着时间的推移获得这种熟悉感。你还可以获得新公会的法术。",
	"Your new guild doesn't give you any benefits that assume prior knowledge or experience, including proficiencies, starting equipment (except your guild insignia), and contacts.": "你的新公会不会给你任何假定有知识或经验的好处，包括熟练程度、起始装备（除了你的公会徽章）和联系人。",
	"Officer Lavinia stood before the enormous double doors that led into the highest spire of New Prahv, the lair of the guildmaster. To look at her, nothing would seem out of place: her cape spilled elegantly from her officer's armor, her sword shone like a decorative piece one would hang above a mantel, and her three-sided medals displayed her district-spanning rank.": "拉维尼娅警官站在巨大的双扇门前，这扇门通向新普拉赫夫的最高尖顶，即公会会长的巢穴。看着她，没有什么会显得不合适：她的披风优雅地从她的军官盔甲上溢出来，她的剑像挂在壁炉上的装饰品一样闪闪发光，她的三面奖章显示了她跨越地区的等级。",
	"Bringing order from chaos—that is the mission of the Azorius Senate. Without the extensive legal code crafted and enforced by the Azorius, society would crumble, transforming Ravnica into a field of rubble where the Gruul and the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} do whatever they please. The Azorius carry this weighty responsibility with stoic pride, and they perform their work of legislation, investigation, and enforcement with steely determination.": "从混乱中带来秩序--这就是阿佐里乌斯参议院的使命。如果没有阿佐里乌斯制定和执行的广泛的法律规范，社会就会崩溃，将拉夫尼卡变成一片瓦砾之地，格鲁尔和百分之零点几的人就会为所欲为。阿佐里乌斯人以坚忍不拔的自豪感承担着这一重任，他们以坚定的决心进行立法、调查和执法工作。",
	"The first guildmaster of the Azorius Senate was a sphinx named Azor. He was the author of the original Guildpact, as well as the creator of the elaborate contingency plan that resulted in the creation of the Living Guildpact. The Azorius Senate was meant to carry on his legacy by serving as the legislative body of Ravnica.": "阿索瑞斯元老院的第一任会长是一位名叫阿索尔的斯芬克斯。他是最初《公会契约》的作者，也是精心设计的应急计划的创造者，该计划导致了《生活公会契约》的诞生。阿索里乌斯参议院是为了继承他的遗产，作为拉夫尼卡的立法机构。",
	"The Azorius Senate is supported by three branches, called columns, each led by an arbiter (also called a capital). The capitals of the three columns form the Triumvirate, which advises the guildmaster, Supreme Judge {@creature Isperia|GGR}, an ancient and wise sphinx.": "阿索里乌斯元老院由三个分支支持，称为柱子，每个柱子由一个仲裁者（也叫首都）领导。三个纵队的首领组成三巨头，向公会会长，最高法官（%0%），一个古老而睿智的斯芬克斯提供建议。",
	"The {@b Sova Column} consists of judges and the extensive legal apparatus surrounding them. It is tasked with adjudicating and arbitrating the effects of the law. The column employs legal aides, pages, librarians, experts on precedent, advocates for the accused, public prosecutors, and judges.": "{@b Sova Column}由法官和围绕他们的大量法律机构组成。它的任务是对法律的效力进行裁决和仲裁。该栏目雇用了法律助理、版面人员、图书管理员、先例专家、被告的辩护人、公诉人和法官。",
	"The {@b Jelenn Column} writes and enacts the laws of Ravnica, involving the efforts not just of the designated legislators but also a network of bureaucrats: aides, writers, researchers, lobbyists, clerks, and so on.": "{@b Jelenn Column}撰写和颁布拉夫尼卡的法律，不仅涉及指定的立法者的努力，还涉及一个官僚网络：助手、作家、研究员、说客、文员等等。",
	"The {@b Lyev Column} enforces the law as Ravnica's police force. The many-leveled hierarchy of the Lyev Column includes arresters, investigators, officers, and lawmages. The Lyev Column is also venturing into the work of managing surveillance and precognition. Most adventuring characters, by their nature and because of their capabilities, are associated with the active work of the Lyev Column rather than the behind-the-scenes activity of the other columns.": "{@b Lyev Column}作为拉夫尼卡的警察部队执行法律。利耶夫纵队的多级等级制度包括逮捕者、调查员、官员和法师。利耶夫纵队也在涉足管理监视和预知的工作。大多数冒险人物，由于他们的性质和能力，都与利耶夫纵队的积极工作有关，而不是其他纵队的幕后活动。",
	"The Azorius Senate's ultimate goal is the perfection of society. They want to protect the people of Ravnica and foster a community of peace and harmony. A society's values, they contend, are reflected in the laws it creates. Something is good if it is lawful. To the Azorius, the highest virtue is a society built on stability and order, and the guild's elaborate system of laws is structured to prevent wrongdoing first and foremost, even at the expense of certain liberties. The Azorius can act as a benevolent proactive force that keeps evildoers in check, but it can also act as an oppressive bureaucratic force that stifles freedom and expression.": "阿佐里乌斯参议院的最终目标是社会的完善。他们希望保护拉夫尼卡的人民，培养一个和平与和谐的社区。他们认为，一个社会的价值观反映在其制定的法律中。只要是合法的东西就是好东西。对Azorius来说，最高的美德是一个建立在稳定和秩序之上的社会，公会精心设计的法律体系首先是为了防止错误行为，甚至以牺牲某些自由为代价。阿佐里乌斯可以作为一种仁慈的主动力量，使坏人受到制约，但它也可以作为一种压迫性的官僚力量，扼杀自由和表达。",
	"In the absence of the Living Guildpact, the Azorius are uncertain who is supposed to maintain balance among the guilds. As a group, they are convinced that the system can't be disrupted, but they are challenged by the reality that the one person who is meant to hold their world together never seems to be around. The Azorius Senate is invoking emergency powers with increasing frequency, and the Lyev Column's enforcers are wielding an ever-growing amount of influence.": "在没有活着的行会契约的情况下，Azorius人不确定谁应该维持各行会之间的平衡。作为一个团体，他们相信这个系统是不会被破坏的，但是他们受到了现实的挑战，那就是那个要维持他们世界的人似乎从来没有出现过。Azorius参议院越来越频繁地引用紧急权力，而Lyev Column的执行者们正在发挥着越来越大的影响力。",
	"The Azorius guild embraces the belief that Ravnican society has come too far to succumb to chaos. Civilization can be saved only through the guidance of a strong, safety-focused government. In the mind of the Azorius, the threat of chaos is imminent. They believe it is time to face facts and do whatever is necessary to protect the people and preserve the force of law.": "阿佐里乌斯公会相信，拉夫尼卡社会已经走到了尽头，不能再向混乱屈服。只有通过一个强大的、以安全为中心的政府的指导，才能拯救文明。在Azorius的心目中，混乱的威胁迫在眉睫。他们认为现在是时候面对现实，采取一切必要的措施来保护人民，维护法律的力量。",
	"The Azorius, as always, see agents of disorder as their greatest enemies. They have cracked down on the Gruul Clans and imposed a variety of creatively written laws outlawing that guild's presence in as many public places as possible. The Azorius also abhor the satirical shows of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} (in part because the Azorius are frequently ridiculed by {@creature Rakdos|GGR} performers) and attempt to curb them with new decrees about public performances. In response to attempts by other guilds to edge their way around the system, the Azorius routinely create new laws to support or countermand old ones.": "像往常一样，阿佐里乌斯将混乱的代理人视为他们最大的敌人。他们对格鲁尔家族进行了打击，并实施了各种创造性的法律，在尽可能多的公共场所宣布该公会为非法。阿佐里乌斯也憎恨{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的讽刺表演（部分原因是阿佐里乌斯经常被{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的表演者嘲笑），并试图用有关公共表演的新法令来遏制它们。为了应对其他行会试图绕过该系统的做法，Azorius经常制定新的法律来支持或抵制旧的法律。",

	"You like playing enchanter wizards, clerics of law, or unbending paladins.": "你喜欢玩魔法师、法律牧师或不屈的圣骑士。",
	"As a recruit to the Azorius Senate, you were quickly immersed in the law. You might have clerked for a judge or a legislator, been an apprentice to a practitioner of law magic, studied rhetoric with diplomats, or trained to patrol the streets and enforce the law. As your training comes to an end and your adventuring career begins, you must decide whether to focus on law enforcement or to operate primarily within the bureaucracy of the senate.": "作为Azorius元老院的新人，你很快就沉浸在法律之中。你可能是法官或立法者的书记员，是法律魔法从业者的学徒，与外交官一起学习修辞，或者接受训练在街上巡逻和执法。当你的训练结束，你的冒险生涯开始时，你必须决定是专注于执法还是主要在参议院的官僚体系中运作。",
	"Most Azorius adventurers belong to the guild's police force. They are soldiers or spellcasters who patrol the city in teams or singly, preventing crimes or stopping them in progress. If you want to pursue a career in law enforcement, choose the path of the lawmage, the precognitive mage, or the arrester.": "大多数Azorius冒险者属于公会的警察部队。他们是士兵或施法者，以团队或单人形式在城市中巡逻，防止犯罪或阻止犯罪的发生。如果你想从事执法工作，请选择法师、预知法师或逮捕者的道路。",
	"As a spellcaster in the Azorius Senate, you use your magic to compel or restrain malefactors and scofflaws (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Enchantment). You might also use your magic to protect Azorius soldiers and innocent bystanders from harm (perhaps as a wizard specialized in the School of Abjuration or as a cleric of the Order Domain, which is described in {@book chapter 1|GGR|1}). In any case, you're called a lawmage, and you can aspire to the title of justiciar and then deputy as your standing within the guild increases.": "作为阿索里乌斯元老院的施法者，你用你的魔法来蛊惑或约束坏人和恶棍（也许是作为魔法学院的专业巫师）。你也可以用你的魔法来保护Azorius的士兵和无辜的旁观者免受伤害（也许是作为一个专攻咒语学校的巫师，或者是作为一个秩序领域的牧师，这在{@book chapter 1|GGR|1}中有所描述）。在任何情况下，你都被称为法师，随着你在行会中地位的提高，你可以渴望获得justiciar的头衔，然后是副手。",
	"If you are a spellcaster with some ability to glimpse the future (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Divination or a cleric of the Knowledge Domain), you can use this ability to try to prevent crime before it occurs, serving as a precognitive mage. These mages occupy a small niche on the periphery of the guild, and the guild hasn't developed a bureaucratic structure to accommodate them, so they advance through the same ranks as lawmages.": "如果你是一个具有某种窥视未来能力的施法者（也许是一个专攻占卜学派的巫师或知识领域的牧师），你可以利用这种能力来试图在犯罪发生之前进行预防，作为一个预知法师。这些法师占据了公会外围的一个小角落，而且公会还没有发展出一个官僚结构来容纳他们，所以他们和法师一样通过等级晋升。",
	"As a martial character, you can serve as an arrester in the Azorius Senate. You might be a fighter (of any martial archetype) or a paladin who has sworn the Oath of Vengeance, for example. Arresters maintain the peace by removing threats—both actual and potential—identified through regular patrols, citizen reports, and occasionally alerts from the precognitive mages. As you gain the respect of your superiors, you can be promoted to the rank of officer or imperator.": "作为一个武将角色，你可以在阿索里乌斯元老院担任逮捕者。例如，你可以是一个战士（任何武术原型）或一个发誓要复仇的圣骑士。逮捕者通过定期巡逻、市民报告以及偶尔来自预知法师的警报来消除实际和潜在的威胁，从而维护和平。当你获得上级的尊重时，你可以被提升为军官或御林军的级别。",
	"Bureaucracy might seem like the opposite of adventure, but it is possible to immerse yourself in the life of a civil servant in the Azorius Senate and still live an adventurous life. You might be a mild-mannered judge's clerk or scribe who got caught up in a whirlwind chain of events beyond your control, or you might moonlight as a vigilante in defiance of the law you are supposed to uphold. Or you could serve a diplomatic function as an elocutor.": "官僚主义似乎是冒险的反面，但有可能让你沉浸在阿索里乌斯参议院的公务员生活中，仍然过着冒险的生活。你可能是一个温和的法官文员或抄写员，被卷入了一连串超出你控制的事件中，或者你可能兼职做一个义务兵，无视你应该维护的法律。或者，你可以作为一名口才师履行外交职能。",
	"As a skilled orator and diplomat (perhaps a bard of the College of Lore), you can put your talents to use in the guild as an elocutor. The Azorius are known for their measured, patient speech, and the elocutors are the primary voice through which the senate communicates with the other guilds and the people of Ravnica. Thus, you might serve as an emissary from the Azorius to another guild, working to settle trade or territorial agreements, temporary alliances, and the like. You might have the task of securing the support of key senators for a particular piece of legislation or treaty. Well-established elocutors can be rewarded with the rank of scribe or emissary.": "作为一个熟练的演说家和外交家（也许是洛尔学院的吟游诗人），你可以在公会中发挥你的才能，成为一名口才师。阿索里乌斯人以其有分寸、有耐心的演讲而闻名，而口才师是元老院与其他公会和拉夫尼卡人民交流的主要渠道。因此，你可能会作为阿佐里乌斯的使者前往其他公会，致力于解决贸易或领土协议、临时联盟等问题。你的任务可能是确保关键参议员对某项立法或条约的支持。成熟的口才者可以得到文士或使者的奖励。",

	"The heads of the three columns of the Azorius Senate are called arbiters or capitals. The arbiter of the Sova Column (the judiciary) is Leonos II, a wise and kind human judge and lawmage who takes pains to consider all perspectives before issuing a judgment—even the perspectives of the spirits of the dead, with whom he can communicate. He is patient and utterly loyal to the guild. The Jelenn Column (the legislature) is led by a vedalken lawmage named Uzana, renowned for a nearly perfect memory. She has memorized every statute of Azorius law, and much of her speech is quotations from those statutes. The hussar commander Agmand Sarv is the arbiter of the Lyev Column, the senate's law enforcement branch. Despite the fact that he has never been in combat, he has earned a reputation as a brilliant military strategist. His tactical genius is unquestioned, but his lack of battle experience did cause some controversy among the soldiers and lawmages of the Lyev Column when he was appointed to be its head.": "阿索里乌斯元老院的三个柱子的负责人被称为仲裁者或首领。索瓦柱（司法机构）的仲裁者是莱昂诺斯二世，他是一位睿智而善良的人类法官和法师，在作出判决前会不厌其烦地考虑所有的观点--甚至包括死灵的观点，他可以与死灵沟通。他很有耐心，对公会完全忠诚。杰伦纵队（立法机构）由一位名叫乌扎娜的维达肯法师领导，她以几乎完美的记忆力而闻名。她已经记住了阿索里乌斯的每一条法规，她的大部分讲话都是引用这些法规的内容。轻骑兵指挥官阿格曼德-萨夫（Agmand Sarv）是元老院执法部门利耶夫纵队的仲裁者。尽管他从未参加过战斗，但他已经赢得了杰出的军事战略家的声誉。他的战术天才是毋庸置疑的，但当他被任命为里耶夫纵队的负责人时，他缺乏战斗经验确实在士兵和法师中引起了一些争议。",
	"By gaining renown as a member of the Azorius Senate, you can advance within the guild. Promotion through the ranks requires the approval of a superior officer. Advancement is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.": "作为阿索里乌斯元老院的成员，通过获得声誉，你可以在行会内晋升。级别的提升需要上级官员的批准。晋升是对为公会提供服务的奖励，而不是名望增加后的自动结果。",

	"The archangel Razia was the original guildmaster of the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmaster for almost ten thousand years.

	"Minotaurs have a reputation for being both fierce warriors and clever strategists. Thick of muscle, stout of heart, and possessing a burning love of justice and the battlefield, they have become the steel spine of the Boros Legion. Generations of minotaurs of the Ordruun family line have served with honor and distinction, claiming more than fifteen generals to their lineage.": "牛头人以其凶猛的战士和聪明的战略家而闻名。他们肌肉粗壮，心智坚韧，对正义和战场有着强烈的热爱，已经成为波罗斯军团的钢铁脊梁。奥德鲁恩家族的几代牛头人都以荣誉和出色的表现服役，他们的血统里有超过15位将军。",
	"Angels occupy the highest tier of the Boros hierarchy, from the guildmaster {@creature Aurelia|GGR} down to the hosts of holy warriors and advisors in leadership roles. Their opinions and advice are deeply respected in the guild, though the angels aren't above engaging in the machinations of mortal politics. The angels include the wise, strategic warleaders; the holy champions and paragons of war known as firemanes; and battleforce angels, who form the bulk of the legion's angelic warriors.": "天使们占据了博罗等级制度的最高层，从公会会长（%0%）一直到担任领导角色的圣武士和顾问。他们的意见和建议在公会中深受尊重，尽管天使们并不排斥参与凡人的政治阴谋。天使们包括明智的、有策略的战争领袖；被称为火人的神圣冠军和战争典范；以及构成军团天使战士主体的战斗部队天使。",
	"From the perspective of the average Boros soldier, the angels embody the ideals the Boros hold dear. Few mortal soldiers gain admission into the presence of the warleaders and other powerful angels, but battleforce angels fight at the forefront of the legion's ranks, and they form strong friendships with mortals under such life-and-death circumstances. Boros paladins are the members most likely to converse with the angels and be charged with implementing their plans.": "从普通的波罗斯士兵的角度来看，天使体现了波罗斯人所珍视的理想。很少有凡人士兵能够进入战争领袖和其他强大的天使的视线，但战斗部队的天使在军团的最前线作战，他们在这种生死攸关的情况下与凡人结下了深厚的友谊。波洛圣骑士是最有可能与天使交谈并负责执行他们的计划的成员。",
	"The garrison commanders who convey the angels' commands are accessible to the ordinary soldier. In addition to Sunhome, the Boros maintain smaller garrisons throughout the Tenth District, at least one in each of the six precincts.": "传达天使命令的驻军指挥官是普通士兵可以接触到的。除了Sunhome，Boros在整个第十区都有较小的驻军，在六个辖区中至少有一个。",

	"The Boros Legion is defined by the tension between its goal of establishing order and harmony and the fiery zeal that drives many of its members. The guild stands for peace and justice, which can be established only through the rule of law. Its moral stance is fundamentally good, as it strives to protect the innocent and powerless from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, members of the legion are passionate about their pursuit of justice, spurred by their righteous wrath into action against evil and injustice. Ironically, this means that individual members sometimes break the rules they are charged with enforcing, cleaving to the spirit of the law when the letter no longer serves justice.": "波洛军团是由其建立秩序与和谐的目标与驱动其许多成员的火热热情之间的紧张关系所定义的。该公会代表着和平与正义，只有通过法治才能建立。它的道德立场从根本上说是好的，因为它努力保护无辜和无权的人不受压迫和剥削。同时，军团成员对追求正义充满热情，在他们的正义之怒的刺激下，对邪恶和不公正采取行动。具有讽刺意味的是，这意味着个别成员有时会违反他们负责执行的规则，当法律条文不再有利于正义时，他们会坚持法律的精神。",
	"Because the Guildpact—the one force on Ravnica that can keep the guilds from destroying each other—is now embodied in a single, unreliable person who vanishes for weeks or months at a time, the legion is in a heightened state of vigilance. In this time of uncertainty, the Boros are on constant alert for military threats. They work to maintain their fortifications to ensure that they aren't overrun by Gruul marauders. Construction proceeds on new strongholds near Gruul territories, but in general the Boros prepare for a military threat the same way they always have—by fielding the stronger army.": "因为公会契约--拉夫尼卡上唯一能让公会不互相毁灭的力量--现在体现在一个不可靠的人身上，他每次都会消失几个星期或几个月，所以军团处于高度警惕的状态。在这个不确定的时期，博罗人对军事威胁时刻保持警惕。他们努力维护他们的防御工事，以确保他们不会被格鲁尔掠夺者攻陷。在格鲁尔领地附近的新据点的建设工作也在进行，但总的来说，波罗人准备应对军事威胁的方式与以往一样--派出更强大的军队。",
	"The angels are also bracing for a subtler threat: the danger of infiltration by House Dimir. The Boros are becoming increasingly aware of the possibility that their guild could be undermined from within. Security at garrison buildings is vigilant, with angels watching the entrances at all times for spies.": "天使们也在为一个更微妙的威胁做准备：迪米尔家族的渗透危险。波罗人越来越意识到他们的公会有可能受到内部的破坏。驻军建筑的安保工作非常警觉，天使们随时注意入口处的间谍。",

	"As a new recruit to the Boros Legion, you were sent to the prestigious Horizon Military Academy for training. Your life there was tempered in the forge of Boros discipline, devotion, and zeal. Your training regimen was deliberately harsh, to weed out the uncommitted. You lasted to the end, and now you begin your adventuring career ready to put everything you have learned to use in the legion's service. Depending on whether you focused on martial training, studied magic, or pursued both courses, your path will look somewhat different.": "作为波罗斯军团的新兵，你被送到著名的地平线军事学院接受训练。你在那里的生活是在博罗军团的纪律、奉献和热情的锻造中得到锤炼的。你的训练计划是刻意严苛的，以淘汰那些不坚定的人。你坚持到了最后，现在你开始了你的冒险生涯，准备将你所学到的一切用于军团的服务中。根据你是专注于武术训练，还是学习魔法，或者同时追求两种课程，你的道路会有些不同。",

	"Another option is to join the swiftblades, the vanguard of the Boros Legion. They specialize in assault and occupation, and their squads often function as commandos or guerrillas. They pick off enemy archers and mages, softening the enemy's front lines before the rest of the legion marches in.": "另一个选择是加入波洛军团的先锋队--迅捷之刃。他们擅长突击和占领，他们的小队经常扮演突击队或游击队的角色。他们击退敌人的弓箭手和法师，在军团其他成员开进前软化敌人的前线。",
	"If you are spellcaster (perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Evocation or a cleric of the Light Domain), you can find a place as a combat mage in the Boros Legion, called an embermage. These mages use spells of fire and light to clear the way for the legion's combat troops.": "如果你是施法者（也许是专攻唤灵学派的巫师或光明领域的牧师），你可以在博洛斯军团中找到一个战斗法师的位置，称为栓塞法师。这些法师使用火和光的法术来为军团的战斗部队开路。",
	"If you prefer healing magic over the explosive magic of the embermages (perhaps as a cleric of the Life or the Light Domain), you can become a medic. These combat healers are an essential part of Boros operations, using a combination of magic and mundane medicine to close wounds and restore strength.": "如果你喜欢治疗魔法而不是栓塞法师的爆炸性魔法（也许是作为生命或光明领域的牧师），你可以成为一名医生。这些战斗治疗师是波罗斯行动的重要组成部分，他们使用魔法和世俗药物的组合来关闭伤口和恢复力量。",
	"If you are a paladin who swears the Oath of Devotion, a fighter of the Eldritch Knight archetype, or a cleric of the War Domain, you can combine the martial training of a soldier with magic and call yourself a firefist. Fueled by a healthy dose of righteous zeal, firefists command a great deal of respect in the Boros Legion.": "如果你是一个宣誓献身誓言的圣骑士，一个长生骑士原型的战士，或者一个战争领域的牧师，你可以把士兵的武术训练和魔法结合起来，称自己为火拳。在健康的正义热情的推动下，火拳手在波洛军团中得到了很大的尊重。",

	"An adventuring party drawn entirely from the ranks of the Boros Legion would be a small military strike force, probably focused on combat but also strong on social interaction. One or two soldiers (fighters), a medic (cleric), and an embermage (wizard) would form the core of that strike force. A firefist (paladin) would be a strong addition, or might replace a fighter or a cleric. A lightly armored swiftblade (ranger) could help the group in situations involving stealth or exploration.": "一个完全由波罗斯军团成员组成的冒险队伍将是一支小型的军事打击力量，可能侧重于战斗，但也很注重社会互动。一个或两个士兵（战士）、一个医生（牧师）和一个法师（巫师）将构成该突击队的核心。一个火拳手（圣骑士）将是一个强有力的补充，或者可能取代一个战士或一个牧师。一个轻装的快刀手（游侠）可以在涉及隐身或探索的情况下帮助这个团体。",
	"By gaining renown as a member of the Boros Legion, you can ascend through an ordered series of ranks within the guild. Promotion always requires the approval of a superior officer. It is a reward for services rendered to the guild, rather than an automatic consequence of increased renown.": "作为博罗军团的成员，通过获得声誉，你可以在公会内通过一系列有序的等级提升。晋升总是需要得到上级官员的批准。这是对为公会提供的服务的奖励，而不是声望提高后的自动结果。",

	"If you meet the prerequisites, you can apply to join the elite soldiers of the Wojek League. This special order serves as a combination of military police and military intelligence, giving it a fair degree of independence within the guild. Its members scout the activities of other guilds to assess their military strength and predict potential threats, and they sometimes activate squads to defuse threats before they grow more serious. The Wojeks also help the angels root out spies and leaks within the legion. Secondarily, the Wojek League is responsible for policing the ranks of the legion. When members get carried away by their zeal and break the law or abuse their authority, the Wojeks take on the tasks of investigating, apprehending, and punishing the malefactors. Similarly, if members of the legion disappear (involuntarily or otherwise), Wojek agents are typically the ones called to investigate.": "如果你符合先决条件，你可以申请加入沃杰克联盟的精英士兵。这个特殊的命令作为军事警察和军事情报的组合，使其在公会内部具有相当程度的独立性。它的成员侦察其他公会的活动，以评估他们的军事力量并预测潜在的威胁，他们有时会启动小队，在威胁变得更严重之前化解它们。Wojeks还帮助天使们铲除军团内部的间谍和泄密者。其次，Wojek联盟负责监督军团的队伍。当成员被他们的热情冲昏头脑，违反法律或滥用他们的权力时，Wojeks就会承担起调查、逮捕和惩罚犯罪者的任务。同样地，如果军团成员失踪（非自愿或其他原因），Wojek探员通常会被要求进行调查。",

	"As a commander, you assume the leadership of one of the major garrisons of the Boros Legion: Kamen Fortress, Horizon Military Academy, or the great flying garrison called {@i Parhelion II}, which moves from place to place to deploy reinforcements to Boros troops around Ravnica.

	"In this role, you are advised—and ordered around—by angels. You are in regular communication with Guildmaster {@creature Aurelia|GGR}, who places you in charge of a major guild initiative. You might be tasked with improving recruitment, developing a plan for dealing with Dimir infiltration, or collaborating with the Izzet to develop new weaponry for Boros soldiers.": "在这个角色中，你被天使建议和命令。你会定期与公会会长（%0%）沟通，他让你负责公会的重大举措。你的任务可能是改进招募工作，制定一个应对迪米尔人渗透的计划，或者与伊兹特人合作，为波罗斯士兵开发新的武器装备。",

	"In general, the Boros find some common ground with other guilds that value order and structure: Azorius, Selensya, and (to a lesser extent) Orzhov.

	"The legion is dedicated to combating the influence of Dimir spies and infiltrators, containing the brutal chaos of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, and halting the schemes of the Golgari. But any guild can become an enemy of Boros if its aims and activities lead to crime, chaos, injustice, or harm to the innocent citizens of Ravnica. Even the Azorius can become so obsessive in creating and enforcing laws that they overreach the bounds of justice.": "该军团致力于打击迪米尔间谍和渗透者的影响，遏制{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的残酷混乱，并阻止戈尔加里的计划。但是，如果任何公会的目标和活动导致犯罪、混乱、不公正或对拉夫尼卡的无辜公民造成伤害，那么它就会成为博洛斯的敌人。即使是阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）也会在制定和执行法律时变得如此执着，以至于超越了正义的界限。",
	"Conversely, any guild can offer you allies in your quest for justice. Distasteful as they might be, even the Gruul and the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} can play a part in curtailing threats to the city that also impede their own interests.": "反过来说，任何公会都可以在你寻求正义的过程中为你提供盟友。尽管他们可能令人厌恶，但即使是格鲁尔和{@creature Rakdos|GGR}也能在减少对城市的威胁方面发挥一定的作用，这些威胁也阻碍了他们自己的利益。",
	"The Boros are committed to justice and order, and they are convinced that virtually every other guild is just as committed to undermining both. Therefore, the Boros rely only on their comrades for support and view everyone else with suspicion or disdain.": "波罗人致力于正义和秩序，他们相信几乎所有其他公会都同样致力于破坏这两者。因此，博罗人只依靠他们的战友来支持，对其他所有人都持怀疑或不屑的态度。",

He floated effortlessly down from the upper reaches of the chamber, and alighted on the chamber floor near the two of them.": "一个吸血鬼从黑暗中出现，像一阵微风一样安静。尽管地下寒气逼人，他还是脱到了腰部，他的眼睛像猫一样反射着光芒。他毫不费力地从密室的上游飘下来，落在密室的地板上，靠近他们两个人。",
	"House Dimir is Ravnica's dark secret: behind a facade of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an association of spies and assassins whose existence is barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.": "迪米尔家族是拉夫尼卡的黑暗秘密：在受人尊敬的信使和记者的外表下，潜藏着一个由间谍和刺客组成的协会，其存在几乎不被广大民众所怀疑。秘密既是迪米尔家族最好的武器，也是最好的防御，公会的许多工作甚至对其他成员都是隐藏的。迪米尔的特工们不留下任何秘密活动的痕迹，他们扭曲目击者的记忆，甚至抹去自己的思想，以消除任何有关他们完成任务的证据。",
	"The first guildmaster of House Dimir was a vampire named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten thousand years until he was arrested and killed in the turmoil of the Decamillennial Celebration.": "迪米尔家族的第一位会长是一位名叫萨德克的吸血鬼，他的组织同意担任拉夫尼卡的信使、信息经纪人和图书馆管理员。但萨德克也利用他的公会在收集信息方面的专长建立了一个庞大的间谍网络，不久之后，公会的秘密行动就大大超过了其公开行动。最终，该行会消失在阴影中，大多数拉夫尼克人开始怀疑它的存在。作为一个不朽的实体，萨德克统治了公会一万年，直到他在十周年庆典的动乱中被逮捕和杀害。",
	"House Dimir has a clandestine aspect hidden from all but its most important members. The guildmaster, {@creature Lazav|GGR}, and his direct contacts guide and manipulate the covert operations of the guild.

One agent knows another only by a code name, or receives communications only at a particular meeting spot at a specific place and time. Every self-proclaimed expert with an opinion on the matter has a theory about the guild's intentions, and all those guesses about Dimir's motivations and pursuits contradict each other, frustrating any attempt to get to the truth of things. The public face of Dimir remains inscrutable, which some interpret as the best evidence that the guild's true plans mean something dire for the Ravnican populace.": "迪米尔家族是关于秘密和错误信息的，甚至在涉及到自己的成员时也是如此。任何一个迪米尔特工知道的巷子里的联系人和档案投放点都不超过几个。一名特工只知道另一名特工的代号，或只在特定地点和时间的特定会议上收到通信。每个自称对此事有看法的专家都对公会的意图有一套理论，而所有这些关于迪米尔的动机和追求的猜测都相互矛盾，使任何试图了解事情真相的努力受挫。迪米尔的公众形象仍然难以捉摸，这被一些人解释为最好的证据，表明该公会的真正计划对拉夫尼卡的民众来说意味着可怕的事情。",
	"To House Dimir, knowledge is power. The guild hungers to learn everything it doesn't already know, especially the weaknesses of its adversaries, and to exploit those weaknesses for its own gain.

The Dimir lurk in the shadows, methodically gathering the knowledge they need to remake Ravnica to their advantage.": "对迪米尔家族来说，知识就是力量。该公会渴望了解一切它还不知道的东西，尤其是对手的弱点，并利用这些弱点为自己谋利。相反，该家族紧紧抓住自己的秘密，因为它不希望敌人翻脸。迪米尔人潜伏在暗处，有条不紊地收集他们所需的知识，以重塑拉夫尼卡的优势。",
	"House Dimir's progress toward its goals depends on a web woven from meticulously gathered intelligence. Unpredictable behavior by other guilds can destabilize that web.

The Selesnya behave predictably on the whole, but the members of the conclave are so numerous that it can be hard for the Dimir to keep track of their activities. Of all the other guilds, the Izzet and the Gruul concern the Dimir the most; their erratic methods of decision-making, combined with their unflinching approach to danger, can quickly undermine any Dimir strategy designed to contain them.": "迪米尔家族实现其目标的进展取决于一个由精心收集的情报编织而成的网络。其他行会不可预测的行为会破坏这个网络的稳定。当博罗人在突如其来的热情激励下采取突然、有力的行动时，迪米尔人可能会措手不及。塞勒斯尼亚人的行为总体上可以预测，但其成员人数众多，迪米尔人很难跟踪他们的活动。在所有其他行会中，伊泽特人和格鲁尔人最让迪米尔人担心；他们反复无常的决策方法，再加上他们对危险毫不留情的态度，可以迅速破坏任何旨在遏制他们的迪米尔战略。",

	"The leadership of the Golgari has undergone several major changes, but the nature of the swarm makes it easily adaptable to the churn of continuous cycles. Being alive isn't a prerequisite for leadership, as demonstrated by the rule of the current guildmaster, the elf lich {@creature Jarad Vod Savo|GGR}. Assassination is seen as a perfectly valid means of effecting political change, which is how Jarad's sister, Savra, took control of the guild before him.

The machinations among elves, medusas, kraul, and other creatures rarely bring any significant improvement to the lives of the swarm's countless members, but often cause disruption and occasionally disaster. Most guild members believe it's best to keep their heads down and stay out of the political conflict and to avoid attracting the disfavor of the Ochran, the guild's order of assassins. More adventurous members might enjoy intrigue and politics, or might unwittingly become tangled up in the schemes of the guild's leaders.": "Golgari蜂群的成员生活在Jarad和各个派别的领导者的阴影下。精灵、梅杜莎、克劳尔和其他生物之间的阴谋诡计很少给蜂群无数成员的生活带来任何显著的改善，但经常会造成混乱，偶尔会造成灾难。大多数行会成员认为最好是低调行事，不参与政治冲突，避免引起行会的刺客组织Ochran的不满。更有冒险精神的成员可能喜欢阴谋和政治，或者可能在不知不觉中被公会领导人的阴谋所纠缠。",
	"Jarad maintains a council of shamans and rogues to serve as a combination of advisory parliament and spy agency. These high chancellors rarely convene publicly, preferring to disperse themselves throughout the swarm to keep information flowing from the nucleus to every part of the organism.": "贾拉德维持着一个由巫师和流氓组成的理事会，作为咨询议会和间谍机构的组合。这些大法官们很少公开召开会议，他们更愿意将自己分散在整个蜂群中，以保持信息从核心到有机体的每个部分的流动。",
	"The Golgari Swarm celebrates the growth and vibrancy of the natural world, but gives equal attention to nature's facets of destruction, decay, and death. It finds allies and agents in the form of fungi, oozes, insects, diseases, and other unsavory aspects of nature, and it uses the power of nature actively toward the goal of advancing its own place in the world. But the Golgari have also learned patience from nature; they are content to work from the shadows, harnessing the energy that comes from decay while the civilization of Ravnica slowly erodes and destroys itself.": "Golgari Swarm赞美自然界的成长和活力，但对自然界的破坏、衰败和死亡方面也给予同样的关注。它以真菌、渗出物、昆虫、疾病以及自然界其他不愉快的方面的形式找到盟友和代理人，并积极利用自然界的力量，以推进自己在世界中的地位。但戈尔加里人也从自然中学到了耐心；他们满足于从阴影中工作，在拉夫尼卡的文明慢慢侵蚀和毁灭自己时，利用来自腐烂的能量。",
	"The teeming hordes of the Golgari Swarm believe it is finally their time to shine. They have dwelled under the streets and under the sway of the other guilds for too long. They are convinced that Ravnica's institutions are now on the verge of collapse and that the absence of the Living Guildpact proves it. However, the Golgari are neither surprised nor panicked by this, for they believe that all things eventually rot and die, and from this decay, new life blooms. As such, the Golgari see the looming interguild conflict as a necessary final push to bring about a new era—their era.": "Golgari Swarm的成群结队的人相信，现在终于是他们大显身手的时候了。他们已经在街头巷尾和其他公会的摇摆下生活了太久。他们确信拉夫尼卡的机构现在正处于崩溃的边缘，而活人公会的缺席证明了这一点。然而，戈尔加里人对此既不惊讶也不惊慌，因为他们相信所有的东西最终都会腐烂和死亡，而从这种腐烂中，新的生命会绽放。因此，戈尔加里人将迫在眉睫的公会间冲突视为带来新时代的必要的最后推动力--他们的时代。",
	"The Golgari are preparing for upheaval. They have sealed many of the passages leading into the undercity, making their territory seem like an impregnable subterranean fortress. Within it, the Golgari domain retains its grandeur, a mysterious and wondrous kingdom. The rare visitors who stumble into it are awed by its beauty and its aura of ancient power. Palatial architecture fills cavernous sewer chambers, and luminescent spores float through the air to shed an otherworldly light on the moss-covered masonry. Entering Golgari territory feels like stepping into a secret world of dangerous beauty.": "戈尔加里人正在为动乱做准备。他们已经封住了许多通往地下城市的通道，使他们的领地看起来像一个坚不可摧的地下堡垒。在这里面，戈尔加里人的领地保持着它的宏伟，是一个神秘而奇妙的王国。偶然进入这里的稀少访客被它的美丽和古老力量的光环所震撼。宫殿式的建筑充斥着空旷的下水道室，发光的孢子漂浮在空气中，在覆盖着青苔的砖石上洒下异样的光芒。进入戈尔加里的领地感觉就像踏入了一个危险的美丽的秘密世界。",
	"Also called the elves of shadow, the Devkarin are one of the three branches of Ravnica's elf race. Like other elves, the Devkarin are adept spellcasters, counting most of the Golgari's shamans among their number.": "Devkarin也被称为阴影精灵，是拉夫尼卡精灵种族的三个分支之一。和其他精灵一样，德夫卡林也是善于施法的人，他们中的大多数是戈尔加里的巫师。",
	"After being cast out of the nascent Selesnya Conclave millennia ago, the Devkarin found a home amid the corrupted and overgrown places of Ravnica, and the Devkarin necromancer Svogthir became the founder of the Golgari Swarm. Since then, the Devkarin have been a major influence in the guild, even during the times when they didn't hold absolute power. Regardless of who rules the guild, the Devkarin follow the guidance of a high priest, called the matka. The matka's spiritual leadership usually aligns with the guildmaster's temporal commands, but during times when the guild is ruled by a non-elf faction, the matka can be a significant dissenting voice.": "在千年前被赶出新生的塞勒斯尼亚协约国后，德夫卡林在拉夫尼卡的腐败和杂草丛生的地方找到了一个家，德夫卡林的死灵法师斯沃格蒂尔成为了戈尔加里群的创始人。从那时起，德夫卡林一直是公会的主要影响者，即使在他们没有掌握绝对权力的时候。无论谁统治公会，Devkarin都会遵循一个被称为matka的大祭司的指导。Matka的精神领导通常与公会会长的时间命令相一致，但在公会被非精灵派系统治的时候，Matka可以成为一个重要的反对声音。",

	"You like elves and druids but want to explore an unusual direction.": "你喜欢精灵和德鲁伊，但想探索一个不寻常的方向。",
	"Similar to a {@creature swarm of insects}, the Golgari collectively behave more like a single organism than a scattering of individuals. New members aren't recruited or initiated into the Golgari Swarm; you have been absorbed and incorporated, and the biological system of the swarm funneled you to where your talents are most needed to contribute to the health of the guild. Your position within the guild is defined by your capabilities.": "类似于（%0%），戈尔加里人的集体行为更像是一个单一的有机体，而不是分散的个体。新成员并不是被招募或开始进入戈尔加里虫群的；你已经被吸收和融合了，虫群的生物系统将你输送到最需要你的才能的地方，为公会的健康作出贡献。你在公会中的地位是由你的能力决定的。",
	"You might act as a shaman of the Golgari if you are a spellcaster—perhaps a wizard specialized in the School of Necromancy, a druid of the Circle of the Land, or a druid of the Circle of Spores (described in {@book chapter 1|GGR|1}). In this revered position, you teach and advise other members of the swarm, keeping them attuned to the natural cycle of death and regrowth. You might manipulate that natural cycle by wielding the magic of death, snuffing out life and reanimating the dead. Or you might wield your magic to spread fungal rot and noxious gases, preparing parts of the city for annexation.": "如果你是一个施法者，你可能会充当戈尔加里的萨满--也许是一个专攻亡灵学派的巫师，一个土地之环的德鲁伊，或者一个孢子之环的德鲁伊（在（%0%）中描述）。在这个受人尊敬的位置上，你教导和建议虫群的其他成员，使他们适应死亡和再生的自然循环。你可以通过挥舞死亡的魔法来操纵这个自然循环，扼杀生命并使死者复活。或者你可以挥舞你的魔法来传播真菌的腐烂和有害气体，为城市的部分地区被吞并做准备。",
	"If you aren't adept at magic, the swarm still needs you. Golgari warriors both defend the guild's territory and, when necessary, take offensive action. If you are a fighter (typically of the Champion archetype), you can serve as a shock trooper, perhaps fighting alongside kraul and trolls on behalf of the swarm. If you are a ranger (likely of the Beast Master archetype) or a rogue (of the Thief or Assassin archetype), you are more of a skirmisher. Golgari rangers favor insects and reptiles as companions.": "如果你不擅长魔法，虫群仍然需要你。戈尔加里战士既要保卫公会的领地，必要时又要采取进攻行动。如果你是一个战士（通常是冠军原型），你可以作为一个突击队员，也许会代表虫群与克劳尔和巨魔并肩作战。如果你是游侠（可能是野兽大师原型）或流氓（盗贼或刺客原型），你更像是一个小兵。戈尔加里游侠喜欢昆虫和爬行动物作为同伴。",

	"Every member of the Golgari Swarm has its place, and every role is important to the proper functioning of the guild. Aside from a few leadership positions, the swarm doesn't consider different functions to be more or less important than others.

That said, your renown within the Golgari is a direct measure of the guildmaster's knowledge of you, his confidence in your abilities, and his interest in your activities.": "Golgari Swarm的每个成员都有自己的位置，每个角色对公会的正常运作都很重要。除了一些领导职位外，蜂群并不认为不同的职能比其他职能更重要或更不重要。向上爬的想法对戈尔加里人的思维方式是陌生的。也就是说，你在戈尔加里内部的声望是衡量会长对你的了解、对你能力的信心以及对你活动的兴趣的直接标准。",
	"At the start of your career with the Golgari, the guildmaster and his chancellors have no way to distinguish you from the masses of others who perform a similar function.

	"The Golgari prefer to erode their enemies' strength through a process of attrition rather than by launching frontal attacks.

Occasionally, you might be assigned to assault the enemies of the Golgari more directly, especially if you are a member of the Ochran. If the death of a particular person or the theft of a key treasure will contribute to the decline and downfall of an enemy guild, even the typically patient Golgari will try to seize that opportunity.": "戈尔加里人更喜欢通过消耗的过程来削弱敌人的实力，而不是通过发动正面攻击。如果你被要求对另一个公会采取直接行动，那可能是为了自我保护，对抗一个威胁到戈尔加里人的生命和生计的公会。你可能会反对阿佐里乌斯（Azorius）试图将他们的管辖范围扩大到城下，或者反击波洛（Boros），以劝阻他们向戈尔加里的领土发动更多的攻击。偶尔，你可能会被指派去更直接地攻击戈尔加里人的敌人，特别是如果你是奥克兰的成员。如果某个人的死亡或某个关键宝物的失窃将有助于敌方公会的衰落和垮台，即使是典型的有耐心的戈尔加里人也会努力抓住这个机会。",
	"You might ally with members of another guild if they are working—even unwittingly—toward goals you share. The Gruul, for example, are adept at hastening the decay of both humanoid populations and physical structures, even if they remain unaware of their full role in the natural cycle.

They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored—an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.": "格鲁尔氏族是文明土地上的野蛮人，他们是蹲在拉夫尼卡社会边缘的一个松散联盟。他们避开文明中心，认为那是压迫和软弱的源头，而在拉夫尼卡的小巷、废弃区和废墟中出没。他们希望看到文明的大厦被拆毁，这样世界就能恢复到城市发展到覆盖一切之前的纯洁的荒野，从而繁荣起来。然后自然界的真正秩序可以被恢复--一个不受约束的、残酷的状态，其中只有强者生存，最强者统治。",
	"In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place, the most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh.

They frequently send sorties into civilized areas to secure goods—and to wreak havoc.": "在一个布满城市街道和高楼大厦的世界里，格鲁尔人是最不合群的，最不自在的，也是最渴望推翻这一切，重新开始的。不断的仪式性战争在部族中回荡，每一次小规模的战争都会加强他们适者生存的理论。他们经常派遣突击队进入文明地区，以确保货物和破坏。",
	"The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops who was purportedly the ancestor of {@creature Borborygmos|GGR}, the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.": "格鲁尔的第一任领导人是Cisarzim，一个独眼巨人，据说是现任公会会长{@creature Borborygmos|GGR}的祖先。Cisarzim被称为混沌之主，他的公会最初的职能是维护拉夫尼卡的自然场所，这意味着让他的派别尽可能远离世界的文明部分。然而，城市的逐渐扩张将格鲁尔人赶到越来越小的避难所。",
	"Gruul goblins live in colonies scattered at the edges of Gruul territory and civilized neighborhoods. They fight fiercely when threatened, punctuating their attacks with hisses and growls.

	"As a collection of disparate clans, the Gruul have no single leader and no headquarters. But the Gruul respect strength and are willing to follow a strong individual who points them in a direction they want to go anyway. For several decades, that position has been held by the mighty cyclops {@creature Borborygmos|GGR}, chief of the Burning Tree clan. His nihilistic anger inspires the rest of the Gruul, so when he calls on the other clans to join a raid, they usually agree. Even the fractious Gruul can see the benefit of banding together.

	"{@b Ghor Clan}. The Ghor clan is led by an ettin named Ruric Thar (or, perhaps more properly, Ruric and Thar, since the heads claim separate names). Of all the clans, the Ghor carry out the most frequent and savage assaults on Ravnica's citizenry. The clan is known for its audacity in forging encampments close to heavily populated districts.": "{@b Ghor Clan}. 戈尔部族由一个名叫鲁里克-塔尔（Ruric Thar）的人领导（或者，也许更正确的说法是鲁里克和塔尔，因为他们的首领都声称有独立的名字）。在所有的部族中，戈尔部族对拉夫尼卡的公民进行了最频繁和野蛮的攻击。该部族因其在人口稠密地区附近建立营地的大胆行为而闻名。",
	"{@b Scab Clan}. Members of the Scab clan display scars and body modifications, which they view as expressions of the powerful rage they harbor within themselves.

The Slizt clan is a clutch of sly, skittish warriors, consisting largely of reptilian humanoids called viashino (use the {@creature lizardfolk} stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} to represent them), along with a few wily humans. This clan survives in the rubblebelts by taking up hiding places in high ground and ambushing its enemies with ranged attacks from above. Other Gruul regard the Slizt as skulkers and cowards, but nonetheless all are cautious when entering areas with elevated ruins. The home ground of the Slizt clan is the Husk, an area at the center of a vast rubblebelt featuring many large, ancient structures that have remained standing for generations.": "{@b Slizt Clan}. 斯里兹特氏族是一群狡猾、胆小的战士，主要由被称为viashino的爬行动物组成（使用{@creature lizardfolk}状态块中的{@book Monster Manual|MM}来代表他们），同时还有一些狡猾的人类。这个部族在瓦砾地带的生存方式是躲藏在高处，从高处伏击敌人，进行远程攻击。其他格鲁尔人认为斯里兹特人是躲藏者和懦夫，但尽管如此，当进入有高处废墟的地区时，所有人都会小心翼翼。斯里兹特氏族的主场是哈斯克（Husk），这是一个位于巨大的废墟地带中心的区域，有许多大型的、古老的建筑，已经保持了好几代。",
	"{@b Gravel Hide Clan}. The Gravel Hide clan believes that resilience is the truest measure of strength. Though a relatively new group, its members have already earned a reputation (almost certainly exaggerated) for shrugging off devastating attacks. The clan's leader, a hot-tempered goblin named Skorik Boulder Tooth, adorns himself with the shattered remnants of weapons that he has rent to bits with his own jaws.": "{@b Gravel Hide Clan}. 砾石隐蔽部族相信，复原力是衡量实力的最真实标准。虽然是一个相对较新的团体，但其成员已经赢得了甩掉毁灭性攻击的声誉（几乎肯定是夸张的）。该部族的首领是一个脾气暴躁的地精，名叫斯科里克-大石牙，他用自己的下颚将武器撕成碎片的残骸来装饰自己。",
	"{@b Zhur-Taa Clan}. The Zhur-Taa clan advocates an extreme interpretation of the Old Ways. Central to this view is its belief in the imminent awakening of an ancient boar god—Ilharg, the Raze-Boar—who will lay waste to the overcivilized world. Led by a centaur druid called Nikya of the Old Ways, the Zhur-Taa pile up skulls as offerings to this god, and their druids perform guttural chants before and during battle that are said to be in the language of the old gods.": "{@b Zhur-Taa Clan}. Zhur-Taa氏族主张对古老的方法进行极端的解释。这种观点的核心是相信一个古老的野猪神--伊尔哈格（Ilharg）--雷泽-野猪--即将苏醒，他将毁灭这个过度文明的世界。在一个被称为 \"古老方式 \"的半人马德鲁伊的领导下，Zhur-Taa将头骨堆积起来作为对该神的祭品，他们的德鲁伊在战斗前和战斗中都会吟唱一些据说是古老神灵的语言。",
	"Zhur-Taa druids are adept at summoning and training beasts as war-companions and mounts, and the clan's warriors wade into battle alongside giant boars, other beasts, and even wurms or hydras.": "Zhur-Taa德鲁伊善于召唤和训练野兽作为战友和坐骑，该部族的战士们与巨野猪、其他野兽、甚至狼人或水蛇一起涉足战斗。",
	"{@b Bolrac Clan}. The most selective of all the Gruul Clans, the Bolrac clan denies membership to the smaller races. Its members are all enormous, lumbering brutes, primarily cyclopes, ogres, and giants. The clan's leadership changes frequently—sometimes daily, since battles for supremacy are as common as meals. The Bolrac clan specializes in bringing down massive structures using mauls and battering rams. The only thing the Bolrac love more than destroying something smaller than them is toppling, overrunning, and destroying something larger than them.": "{@b Bolrac Clan}. 在所有格鲁尔部族中，博拉克部族是最有选择性的，它拒绝小种族加入。它的成员都是巨大的、笨重的野蛮人，主要是独眼巨人、食人魔和巨人。该部族的领导层经常更换，有时是每天更换，因为争夺最高地位的战斗就像吃饭一样常见。博拉克氏族擅长使用大锤和撞锤推倒大型建筑。比起摧毁比他们小的东西，博拉克人唯一喜欢的是推翻、碾压和摧毁比他们大的东西。",
	"{@b Trogs}. Some wandering hermits, known as trogs, find even the company of a clan to be too suffocating, so they spend their days alone in the wild places of Ravnica. These individuals are fierce, independent warriors who traverse the rubblebelts as apex predators. Trogs are notoriously short-tempered and impatient around others. Occasionally, they heed the call of the guildmaster to join in riots or festivals, but more often they conduct their own ceremonies and celebrations in private.": "{@b Trogs}. 一些流浪的隐士，被称为 \"trogs\"，他们发现即使有氏族的陪伴也太令人窒息了，所以他们在拉夫尼卡的野外独自度过了他们的日子。这些人是凶猛的、独立的战士，他们作为顶级掠夺者在瓦砾带中穿行。特罗格人是出了名的脾气暴躁，在别人面前不耐烦。偶尔，他们会听从公会会长的号召，参加暴乱或节日活动，但更多的时候，他们会在私下进行自己的仪式和庆祝活动。",
	"So far as any philosophy can be said to underlie the Gruul way of life, it is about living in the now, with little concern for forethought, planning, or speculation. Impulse drives the actions of the Gruul Clans. They want to live their lives unimpeded, and they lash out when something tries to stand in their way. Emotion and impulsiveness drive them as they seek to do what they want, take what they want, and smash what they want.": "就格鲁尔人的生活方式所依据的任何哲学而言，它是关于活在当下，很少考虑到预想、计划或猜测。冲动是格鲁尔部族行动的动力。他们希望自己的生活不受阻碍，当有东西试图阻挡他们时，他们就会大发雷霆。情感和冲动驱使他们去做他们想做的事，拿他们想拿的东西，砸他们想砸的东西。",

	"The rites of becoming Gruul, whether you have come from outside the guild or are marking your entrance into adulthood, center around being buried alive. When you enter the shallow grave, the person you were before is dead. Your past wrongs and errors are forgotten, but so are your past accomplishments. No matter how well you proved yourself in battle before, when you rise from the earth you are untested. The clan leaders recognize you only when you earn glory in battle as a Gruul.": "成为格鲁尔的仪式，无论你是来自行会外，还是标志着你进入成年，都是以被活埋为中心。当你进入浅浅的坟墓时，你之前的那个人已经死了。你过去的错误和失误被遗忘，但你过去的成就也被遗忘。无论你以前在战斗中证明自己有多好，当你从土里爬出来时，你是未经考验的。只有当你作为格鲁尔人在战斗中赢得荣耀时，氏族领袖才会认可你。",
	"Most of the Gruul find their place among the fierce warriors of their clans. If you are a fighter, ranger, or barbarian, this is your natural role. Gruul fighters tend to adopt the Champion archetype, Gruul rangers usually adopt the Hunter or the Beast Master archetype, and Gruul barbarians follow either the Path of the Totem Warrior or the Path of the Berserker. Whatever your class, as a Gruul warrior you are devoted to tearing down the edifices of civilization, both physical and institutional. You lash out at a system that you believe is the root of corruption and weakness.": "大多数格鲁尔人在他们的部族中找到了自己的位置，那就是凶猛的战士。如果你是一个战士、游侠或野蛮人，这就是你的自然角色。格鲁尔战士倾向于采用冠军原型，格鲁尔游侠通常采用猎人或野兽大师原型，而格鲁尔野蛮人则遵循图腾战士之路或者狂战士之路。无论你是哪种类型，作为格鲁尔战士，你都致力于拆毁文明的建筑，包括物质和制度。你对你认为是腐败和软弱的根源的制度进行抨击。",
	"If you are spellcaster, such as a druid (usually of the Circle of the Moon) or a cleric of the Tempest Domain, you might adopt a more spiritual role in your clan. You practice what the Gruul call the Old Ways, a discipline that predates the foundation of civilization on Ravnica, to channel the primal energy that still pulses through the wild places of the world.": "如果你是施法者，比如德鲁伊（通常是月之环）或暴风域的牧师，你可能会在你的部族中扮演更多的精神角色。你修炼格鲁尔人所谓的 \"古老的方法\"，这是一门早于拉夫尼卡文明基础的学科，以引导仍然在世界的荒野中跳动的原始能量。",

	"A group of Gruul adventurers can serve as a raiding party to pursue the goals of one clan or the guild as a whole. The combination of anarchs and berserkers (fighters, rangers, and barbarians) with druids of the Old Ways (druids or clerics) creates a powerful mix of muscle and magic. Such a party lacks the capacity for subtlety or stealth, but Gruul missions rarely require such abilities. (A ranger can provide them, in the rare case where they are necessary.)": "一群格鲁尔冒险者可以作为一个突击队，追求一个部族或整个公会的目标。无政府主义者和狂暴者（战士、游侠和野蛮人）与古老的德鲁伊（德鲁伊或牧师）的组合创造了一个强大的肌肉和魔法组合。这样的队伍缺乏微妙或隐蔽的能力，但格鲁尔任务很少需要这种能力。(游侠可以提供这些能力，在罕见的情况下，他们是必要的。)",
	"Renown among the Gruul could also be called glory—when you prove yourself in battle, you earn the respect of your fellows. With glory comes acceptance of your leadership and warriors willing to follow you into battle. The Gruul have no formal holders of titles aside from the chieftains of clans and the guildmaster, but relative status within one's clan is still important.": "在格鲁尔人中的声望也可以称为荣耀--当你在战斗中证明自己时，你就会赢得伙伴们的尊重。随着荣耀的到来，人们接受你的领导，战士们也愿意跟随你去战斗。除了部族首领和公会会长之外，格鲁尔人没有正式的头衔持有者，但在部族中的相对地位仍然很重要。",
	"With several battles under your belt, you have demonstrated service to your clan and earned the recognition of your peers. You have the right to tattoo your body to commemorate your triumphs in battle and demonstrate your loyalty to the Gruul. You don't yet have authority over others, but when you go into battle with your clan, your fellow warriors fight near you, acknowledging your prowess. Your clan chieftain knows your name and might decide to single you out, offering you an opportunity to prove yourself by performing a special task. Depending on the nature of the task, the chieftain might send {@dice 1d4} {@creature Anarch|GGR|anarchs} along to help you.": "随着几场战斗的进行，你已经展示了对你的部族的服务，并赢得了同行的认可。你有权在身上纹身，以纪念你在战斗中的胜利，展示你对格鲁尔的忠诚。你还没有权力支配别人，但当你和你的部族一起战斗时，你的同伴会在你身边战斗，承认你的能力。你的族长知道你的名字，并可能决定把你挑出来，为你提供一个机会，通过执行一项特殊任务来证明自己。根据任务的性质，首领可能会派{@dice 1d4}{@creature Anarch|GGR|anarchs}的人去帮助你。",
	"When you reach this level of renown, you develop a rapport with the beasts that haunt the rubblebelts. When you are in a rubblebelt area, you can summon one beast to be your mount: a batterboar (a {@creature giant boar} as described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), a ceratok (using the stat block of a {@creature rhinoceros}), or a raktusk (equivalent to a {@creature giant elk}). It doesn't fight for you unless you have magic or another ability that can control a beast.": "当你达到这个声望水平时，你就会与在废墟地带出没的野兽建立起一种默契。当你在瓦砾带地区时，你可以召唤一只野兽作为你的坐骑：一只巴特波尔（{@book Monster Manual|MM}中描述的{@creature giant boar}），一只瑟拉托克（使用{@creature rhinoceros}的状态块），或一只拉克塔斯克（相当于{@creature giant elk}）。除非你有魔法或其他可以控制野兽的能力，否则它不会为你战斗。",
	"In addition, when you carry out a raid on the guild's behalf, a druid of your clan gives you a {@reward Gruul charm|ggr} (described in {@book chapter 5|GGR|5|Guild Charms}) at the start of the raid.": "此外，当你代表公会进行突袭时，在突袭开始时，你的氏族的德鲁伊会给你一个（%0%）（在（%1%）中描述）。",

	"Similar to the Golgari, Selesnya, and Simic, the Gruul respect nature and maintain a close relationship with animals—in the Gruul's case, the monstrous beasts that stalk the rubble and ruins. But the Gruul would just as soon smash the sewers, gardens, and laboratories of those other guilds than cooperate with them in an effort to establish nature as a larger presence within the city.": "与Golgari、Selesnya和Simic类似，格鲁尔人尊重自然，并与动物保持密切的关系--在格鲁尔人看来，就是那些在瓦砾和废墟中游荡的怪兽。但格鲁尔人很快就会捣毁那些其他行会的下水道、花园和实验室，而不是与他们合作，努力在城市中建立自然界的更大存在。",
	"Because they see all of the remaining guilds as cogs in the vast machine of civilization, the Gruul tailor their tactics toward breaking the machine, rather than directing their attacks at any particular guild. Any guild can be the target of Gruul aggression, as the opportunity arises. The fiercest assaults often come against the guilds that take it upon themselves to combat the Gruul, primarily the Boros and Azorius.": "因为他们把所有剩余的公会看作是文明的巨大机器中的齿轮，格鲁尔人把他们的战术定位于打破这个机器，而不是把他们的攻击指向任何特定的公会。只要有机会，任何公会都可能成为格鲁尔的攻击目标。最猛烈的攻击往往是针对那些自己动手打击格鲁尔的行会，主要是波洛和阿佐里斯。",
	"In certain circumstances, such as when some nightmarish horror rears its head in the heart of a rubblebelt, you and your clan could accept the help of members of another guild in putting an end to the danger. Or, when the schemes of other guilds pit one clan against another, there might be some benefit to you and your clan in cooperating with those efforts. But your truest allies are other members of your clan.": "在某些情况下，比如当一些噩梦般的恐怖在瓦砾地带的中心出现时，你和你的部族可以接受另一个公会成员的帮助来结束危险。或者，当其他公会的计划使一个部族与另一个部族对抗时，你和你的部族与这些努力合作，可能会有一些好处。但你最真实的盟友是你的家族的其他成员。",
	"Since every other guild participates to some extent in the establishment and sustenance of the civilization that the Gruul despise, the Gruul look down on all other guilds as soft, corrupt, or downright abhorrent.": "由于其他每个公会都在某种程度上参与了格鲁尔人所鄙视的文明的建立和维持，所以格鲁尔人看不起其他所有的公会，认为它们软弱、腐败，或者完全令人憎恶。",

	"The Izzet mages weren't hard to find. After a couple of days of observation, Jace heard an explosion and saw a startled flight of birds from across the district. The plume of blue smoke was a telltale sign of one of the Izzet's pyrotechnic experiments. Jace tracked the source of the blast and spied two mages, a human and a goblin, outfitted with alchemical gadgetry and mizzium gauntlets. They emerged from a disused tunnel, leaving behind charred bricks and a haze of smoke, and their instruments crackled with energy. From what Jace had gathered, this was the Izzet style of research: keep adding energy until something blows up, then observe the results.": "伊泽特法师并不难找。经过几天的观察，杰斯听到了爆炸声，看到了来自整个地区的惊飞的鸟。那股蓝烟是伊扎特人的一个烟火实验的标志。杰斯跟踪了爆炸的源头，发现了两个法师，一个是人类，一个是地精，装备着炼金术的小工具和米兹恩护手。他们从一条废弃的隧道中走出来，留下了烧焦的砖块和一片烟霾，他们的仪器发出了能量的噼啪声。从杰斯收集到的信息来看，这是伊泽特人的研究风格：不断增加能量，直到某物爆炸，然后观察结果。",

	"The league's most grandiose experiments typically concern public works projects and elemental experimentation. These efforts use a methodology that relies on unexpected outcomes: all results are informative, even if they completely defy expectations. For example, an experiment that begins as the creation of a \"hypermana focusing lens\" might be renamed a \"scram-range teleportal\" once the researchers discover more properties of what they have fashioned. Then, after a few goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains the designation of \"universal refuse disintegrator\"—until the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjustment is par for the course in Izzet experiments; the \"fiddle and find out\" method is favored over any process of systematic scientific research.": "联盟最宏大的实验通常涉及公共工程项目和元素实验。这些努力使用一种依赖于意外结果的方法：所有的结果都是有信息的，即使它们完全违背了预期。例如，一个以创造 \"超马纳聚焦透镜 \"开始的实验，一旦研究人员发现他们所制造的东西的更多特性，可能会被重新命名为 \"scram-range teleportal\"。然后，在几个地精志愿者在里面消失后，这个设备就会被命名为 \"通用垃圾分解器\"--直到这些地精志愿者被发现还活着，被传送到远离车间的地方。这种调整在伊泽特的实验中是很正常的；\"摆弄和发现 \"的方法比任何系统的科学研究过程都更受欢迎。",

It is manic in its expressions of creative energy, shifting from careful analysis to intuitive leap seemingly for no reason, always thinking outside the proverbial box. As the Izzet see it, unpredictable action, far from being antithetical to methodical research, has experimental value. In the words of one researcher, \"The only action worth taking is one with an unknown outcome.\"": "伊泽特联盟渴求知识，珍视智力，并猜测多元宇宙的秘密。它为其科学追求带来了燃烧的激情，将其对知识的探索变成了一种永不满足的饥渴，使其冰冷的智力取得了辉煌的成果，并将其推测扩大到寻找天壤之别的物体或概念之间的联系。它在表达创造性的能量时是狂躁的，从仔细的分析转变为直觉的跳跃，似乎没有任何理由，总是在众所周知的盒子之外思考。在伊扎特人看来，不可预测的行动远不是与有条不紊的研究对立，而是具有实验价值。用一位研究人员的话说，\"唯一值得采取的行动是具有未知结果的行动\"。",
	"As Ravnica descends into increasing turmoil, the Izzet have further intensified their frenetic research, though now their efforts are mainly directed toward one outcome: the development of super-weapons.

	"For the rest of the guild members, the search for bigger and better weapons is mainly an opportunity to engage in all sorts of wild research while abandoning all outward pretense of safety or reason. Much of the guild's laboratory space has been converted into testing grounds that are capable of withstanding great discharges of magical energy.": "对于公会的其他成员来说，寻找更大更好的武器主要是一个机会，可以从事各种疯狂的研究，同时放弃所有安全或理性的外在伪装。公会的大部分实验室空间已被改造成能够承受巨大的魔法能量释放的试验场。",

In times past, the Orzhov danced along the edges of the law and presented an appearance of legality, but the combination of an ever-expanding legal code and the guild's move into racketeering and other explicitly illegal activities has made it vulnerable to Azorius enforcement. So far, the Azorius have demonstrated more interest in cracking down on the chaotic activity of the Gruul and the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, but Azorius arresters also routinely shut down Orzhov protection rackets and take enforcers into custody. To make matters worse, the Azorius Senate's increasing use of precognitive magic is proving difficult for the Orzhov to work around.": "Azorius是Orzhov运营的最大威胁。在过去，Orzhov在法律的边缘跳舞，呈现出合法的外观，但不断扩大的法律规范和公会进入敲诈勒索和其他明显的非法活动的结合，使其容易受到Azorius的执法。到目前为止，Azorius对打击Gruul和{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的混乱活动表现出更大的兴趣，但Azorius的逮捕者也经常关闭Orzhov的保护网，并将执法者拘留。更糟糕的是，阿索里乌斯元老院越来越多地使用预知魔法，这证明Orzhov人很难应付。",

Contact between the oligarchs and lower-ranking members of the guild is increasingly rare in this situation, and even the pontiffs find it ever more difficult to arrange a hearing with their superiors.": "到目前为止，该集团最有效的策略是增加公会的日常犯罪活动与领导层之间的隔离层，确保无论抓到多少街头混混和集团成员来充实阿佐里乌斯的监狱，公会的领导层都不会受到影响。在这种情况下，寡头和公会的低级成员之间的接触越来越少，甚至连教皇都发现越来越难安排与他们的上级会面了。",

	"At last, you have the opportunity to display your genius to the masses. When you perform, you're the star of the show, the climax of a night of revelry.

	"Making the powerful look ridiculous lies at the heart of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} performance philosophy.

That's particularly true when powerful guilds—especially the Azorius—try to use their power to suppress the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}.": "让强大的人看起来很可笑是{@creature Rakdos|GGR}绩效理念的核心。该行会的大部分侵略行为是针对那些拥有权力并滥用权力的行会，或者是那些公然竞价的行会。当强大的公会--尤其是阿索里乌斯--试图利用他们的权力来压制{@creature Rakdos|GGR}时，情况尤其如此。",
	"Making the ridiculous powerful is the flip side of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} philosophy. Usually, this means elevating the status of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR}—and yourself—at the expense of others, but circumstances might lead you to cooperate with members of other guilds in pursuit of a common goal. For example, a power struggle in another guild can be an opportunity for you to install a sympathetic (or ineffectual) leader in that guild.

	"Selesnya troops poured into the streets, emptying the nature temples, wildlife preserves, and other green spaces controlled by the conclave. The centaurs' hooves clattered on the cobblestones and the wolf-riders bounded over stone bridges. Human and elf infantry flooded through the arteries of the district, streaming past intersections and flowing around buildings. Griffons and their riders swooped down out of a blanket of low clouds, strafing past the spires. Emmara rode on the shoulder of a massive creature made of a snarl of marble, wood, and vines, her hand resting on its great head. Two more of the nature behemoths strode ahead of her, swinging their limbs in slow motion, indenting the streets with their footfalls as the other Selesnya troops ran between their legs. Below her, Captain Calomir led the Selesnya army. He rode his white war rhino, driving the Selesnya ranks forward, guiding them through the streets toward the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} horde.": "塞勒斯尼亚军队涌入街道，清空了自然庙宇、野生动物保护区和其他由协约国控制的绿色空间。半人马的马蹄在鹅卵石上哒哒作响，狼骑兵在石桥上飞奔。人类和精灵的步兵涌入该区的动脉，流过十字路口，在建筑物周围流动。狮鹫和它们的骑手从一片低矮的云层中俯冲下来，从尖顶上扫过。艾玛拉骑在一个由大理石、木头和藤蔓组成的巨大生物的肩膀上，她的手放在它巨大的头上。还有两只自然界的巨兽在她前面漫步，慢悠悠地摆动着四肢，当其他塞勒斯尼亚部队在它们的腿间奔跑时，它们的脚步声在街道上留下了痕迹。在她下面，卡洛米尔上尉领导着塞勒斯尼亚军队。他骑着他的白色战犀牛，驱使塞勒斯尼亚的队伍前进，引导他们穿过街道，走向{@creature Rakdos|GGR}部落。",
	"Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization.

	"At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called Mat'Selesnya, which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guildmaster. The current guildmaster, {@creature Trostani|GGR}—three dryads fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being—is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul in a similar way. The original mission of the conclave involved conservation and charity, but its focus has long been on expanding its community, in which all members are cared for and nature is preserved in harmony with civilization.": "塞勒斯尼亚信仰和哲学的核心是世界之魂，称为马特塞勒斯尼亚，其信徒认为它是自然本身的一种表现。在签署最初的公会契约时，马特-塞勒斯尼亚以一种元素的形式体现出来，并担任公会的第一任公会会长。目前的公会会长，{@creature Trostani|GGR}--三个干尸与马特-塞勒斯尼亚融合成一个整体--据说以类似的方式体现了世界之魂的意志。协约国最初的使命是保护和慈善，但它的重点长期以来一直是扩大其社区，在其中所有成员都得到照顾，自然与文明和谐共存。",
	"The Selesnya Conclave is organized into enclaves called vernadi, which are communes built around central trees. The vernadi are smaller versions of the guildhall, the great city-tree Vitu-Ghazi. A dryad, called a voda, is called forth from that central tree to be the leader of the community, connecting the vernadi and its devotees to the Worldsoul and uniting them with the will of the entire conclave.": "塞勒斯尼亚协约国被组织成称为 \"维尔纳迪 \"的飞地，这些飞地是围绕中心树而建的公社。vernadi是市政厅的缩小版，即伟大的城市之树Vitu-Ghazi。一个被称为 \"沃达 \"的干尸被从中心树上召唤出来，成为社区的领袖，将弗纳迪及其信徒与世界之魂联系起来，并将他们与整个协约国的意志结合起来。",
	"A voda is accessible to all the guild members in her care. You have regular contact with your voda, who knows your name and has a good idea of your interests, goals, and strengths.

	"In addition to the voda, military and religious leaders in each vernadi regularly communicate with its members. Ordinary members of the conclave spend a few hours every day training with a military instructor and studying with a religious teacher.": "除了沃达，每个维尔纳迪的军事和宗教领袖也定期与成员进行交流。协进会的普通成员每天花几个小时与军事教官一起训练，与宗教教师一起学习。",
	"Despite the growing tensions that now grip the world, in the long view of the Selesnya Conclave, not much has changed. Ravnica is troubled, but Ravnica has always been troubled. The Living Guildpact is absent, but the Guildpact comes and goes. The Worldsoul has not changed, nor has the will of Mat'Selesnya: the conclave's main goal is to grow, as it has always been. Its strength lies in its numbers.": "尽管现在世界上的紧张局势日益严重，但从塞勒斯尼亚会议的长远来看，并没有什么变化。拉夫尼卡有麻烦，但拉夫尼卡一直都有麻烦。活着的行会契约不存在，但行会契约来了又走。世界之魂没有改变，马特-塞勒斯尼亚的意志也没有改变：协约国的主要目标是增长，就像它一直以来一样。它的力量在于它的数量。",
	"The conclave clings to the ideal of a peaceful collective in which individual desires are subordinate to the good of the whole group. The guild wants to see this beloved community grow, flourish, and thrive in peace. But as much as it values peace within the community, it displays incredible ferocity when that harmony is threatened.": "协进会坚持和平集体的理想，其中个人的欲望服从于整个团体的利益。公会希望看到这个心爱的社区在和平中成长、繁荣和兴旺。但是，尽管它非常重视社区内的和平，但当这种和谐受到威胁时，它却表现出惊人的凶残。",
	"Selesnya's vision is centered on the idea of harmony between civilization and nature. To advance the cause of civilized society, the conclave believes in the need for an ordered structure that orients the group toward the pursuit of the common good. At the same time, the guild's connection with the natural world gives the conclave a fervent appreciation for the interconnectedness of all things. Selesnya doesn't tolerate selfishness or ambition, instead urging its members to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires and to use the power of nature—including nature's wrath—to drive away those whose selfishness threatens the coherence of the group.": "Selesnya的愿景以文明与自然的和谐理念为中心。为了推进文明社会的事业，协约国相信需要一个有序的结构，使群体朝着追求共同利益的方向发展。同时，公会与自然界的联系让协进会对万物的相互联系有了热切的体会。Selesnya不容忍自私或野心，而是敦促其成员将他人的需求置于自己的欲望之上，并利用自然的力量--包括自然的愤怒--赶走那些自私自利威胁到团体一致性的人。",
	"The greatest danger that Selesnya faces lies in the ambitions of other guilds, which are flourishing in the absence of the Guildpact. Selesnya's way of curbing this grasping selfishness has always been to outnumber the other guilds. Its members aren't naive; they fully realize that the ambitions of other guilds will lead to violence. And they aim to be prepared for that violence when it erupts.": "塞勒斯尼亚面临的最大危险在于其他公会的野心，这些公会在没有公会契约的情况下蓬勃发展。塞勒斯尼亚遏制这种攫取性的自私行为的方法一直是在数量上超过其他公会。它的成员并不天真；他们完全意识到其他公会的野心会导致暴力。而且他们的目标是在暴力爆发时做好准备。",
	"\"For my seedlings to survive,\" Mat'Selesnya says, \"we must grow an army capable of overwhelming such ambitions.\" Some of that army is literally grown, in the case of plant creatures and elementals. A great many members grow up in the guild from childhood and learn their martial skills at the guild's training grounds. And still more join the guild through recruitment—especially in these troubling times, when rumors of war and a sense of imminent doom make Selesnya's message of harmonious community sound ever more appealing.": "\"为了让我的幼苗生存下去，\"马特-塞勒斯尼亚说，\"我们必须培养一支能够压倒这种野心的军队。\" 在植物生物和元素的情况下，这支军队中的一些人是真正成长起来的。许多成员从小就在行会里长大，在行会的训练场上学习他们的武术技能。还有更多的人通过招募加入公会--特别是在这个动荡的时代，当战争的谣言和迫在眉睫的厄运感使塞勒斯尼亚的和谐社区的信息听起来更加吸引人。",

	"As a guardian, deepsage, or other non-scientist within the Simic, you don't progress through ranks, but as a luminary you might be entrusted with the leadership of guerrilla or espionage missions, with other Simic hybrid agents under your command. Or you might be respected as a wise and enlightened teacher.": "作为一个守护者、深层贤者或其他西米克内部的非科学家，你不会通过等级晋升，但作为一个发光体，你可能被委托领导游击队或间谍任务，在你的指挥下，其他西米克混合型特工。或者你可能会被尊重为一个明智的、开明的老师。",
	"If your work for the guild requires it, a project leader, clade leader, or other superior can equip you with a {@reward Simic charm|ggr} (described in {@book chapter 5|GGR|5|Simic Charm}) before you undertake a mission or an experiment on the guild's behalf.": "如果你为公会的工作需要，在你代表公会进行任务或实验之前，项目负责人、部落负责人或其他上级可以为你配备一个（%0%）（在（%1%）中描述）。",

	"A proven researcher, you are eligible to oversee your own project, directing the efforts of other researchers toward the solution of some problem facing the guild.

	"Hosting the work of a successful and important project reflects well on the Speaker of a zonot, so your Speaker keeps a close eye on your work. On the positive side, you can count on access to the considerable resources of the zonot as long as your research is going well. On the other hand, you can expect your Speaker to try to meddle in your work to ensure that your efforts remain relevant to the overall goals of the Simic Combine.": "主持一个成功的、重要的项目的工作可以很好地反映出一个分区的议长，所以你的议长会密切关注你的工作。从积极的方面看，只要你的研究进展顺利，你就可以指望获得区政府的大量资源。另一方面，你可以预期你的议长会试图干涉你的工作，以确保你的努力与西米克联合体的总体目标保持一致。",
	"As a famous researcher or a successful project leader, you stand ready to take on a supervisory role for an entire clade. New clades rarely form, so you must wait for your clade leader to retire (one way or another) before a position exists for you to fill, except in truly exceptional circumstances. Similar to a project leader, you are responsible for directing the efforts of researchers exploring a wide variety of projects related to the focus of your clade. Unless an experiment turns out to be especially interesting, these efforts can carry on without your supervision. If you need to, you can enlist the aid of {@dice 5d12} researchers (which use the stat blocks of {@creature Commoner||commoners} or {@creature merfolk} from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), and you can also request the support of hybrids, krasis, or any other creature associated with the Simic Combine (see the list in {@book chapter 6|GGR|6|Simic Creatures}) from the Speaker of any zonot where the members of your clade live and work.": "作为一个著名的研究人员或成功的项目负责人，你已经准备好承担起整个支系的监督角色。新的支系很少形成，所以你必须等待你的支系领导人退休（一种方式），然后才有职位供你填补，除非在真正的特殊情况下。与项目负责人类似，你负责指导研究人员探索与你的支系重点相关的各种项目的工作。除非某个实验被证明是特别有趣的，否则这些工作可以在没有你的监督下进行。如果你需要，你可以争取{@dice 5d12}研究人员的帮助（他们使用{@creature Commoner||commoners}或{@creature merfolk}来自{@book Monster Manual|MM}的状态块），你也可以向你的氏族成员生活和工作的任何分区的议长请求混血儿、克拉西斯或任何其他与西米克联合体有关的生物（见{@book chapter 6|GGR|6|Simic Creatures}的名单）的支持。",
	"Because most clades span multiple zonots, you have status equal to the Speakers of the zonots. You have no voice on the Speakers' Chamber, unless you can persuade one or more of its members to speak on your behalf.": "因为大多数宗族跨越了多个分区，你的地位等同于各分区的议长。你在议长会议上没有发言权，除非你能说服一个或多个议长会议成员代表你发言。",
	"You are eligible to become the Speaker of a zonot. The selection of a new Speaker (in the event of an existing Speaker's retiring, dying, or otherwise leaving the position) takes place through a combination of popular election and the input of the other eight Speakers, with the current Prime Speaker having the final word.

	"You are a political leader rather than a scientific one, so you have authority over other members of the combine only if they live and work in your zonot. If a clade has a laboratory in your zonot, you have the right (and responsibility) to supervise its activities to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, but not to interfere in its research beyond that point. And if the clade leader lives in a different zonot, you have no authority whatsoever over that person.": "你是一个政治领袖，而不是一个科学领袖，所以只有当联合体的其他成员在你的区域内生活和工作时，你才对他们有权力。如果一个部落在你的区域内有一个实验室，你有权利（和责任）监督它的活动，以确保遵守法律和法规，但不能干涉它的研究，超过这一点。如果该部落的领导人住在另一个区，你对该人没有任何权力。",
	"The Simic Combine has an affinity for guilds that care for the forces of nature, and as such it has worked alongside the Selesnya, Gruul, and Golgari in the past. To a lesser extent, the combine also has a rapport with the other scientific guild, the Izzet. But overall, the Simic attitude toward other guilds is one of healthy caution bolstered by a general tendency toward isolation.": "西米克联合体对那些关心自然力量的行会有一种亲和力，因此它在过去曾与塞勒斯尼亚、格鲁尔和戈尔加里一起工作。在较小的程度上，联合体也与另一个科学行会--伊泽特（Izzet）--有着融洽的关系。但总的来说，西米克对其他公会的态度是一种健康的谨慎，并以一种普遍的孤立倾向为支撑。",
	"Any guild could break the peace and send the entire world spiraling into war, so all the guilds are potential enemies—particularly if they direct their aggression at the Simic Combine. The Golgari Swarm has launched a direct attack against Zonot Four (located in the Sixth District), and they could expand that attack to other zonots at any time. Azorius arresters are prying into all the zonots, looking for evidence of wrongdoing. Thus, the Simic efforts at preparing for war are in danger, and the need for those efforts to be brought to fruition could arise at any time.": "任何一个公会都可以打破和平，让整个世界陷入战争，所以所有的公会都是潜在的敌人--特别是如果他们把侵略的矛头指向西米克联合体。Golgari Swarm已经对Zonot Four（位于第六区）发起了直接攻击，他们随时可能将这种攻击扩大到其他分区。阿佐里乌斯的逮捕者正在窥探所有的分区，寻找不法行为的证据。因此，西米克人准备战争的努力正处于危险之中，而这些努力需要付诸实施的情况随时可能出现。",
	"Your most obvious allies are those who seek to restrain the ambition of other guilds and maintain the balance of power. At various times, that category could include members of any other guild, particularly the Selesnya Conclave. Everyone (with the possible exception of the chaotic {@creature Rakdos|GGR} and Gruul) has an occasional interest in maintaining the status quo, no matter how revolutionary that notion might seem at other times.": "你最明显的盟友是那些试图抑制其他行会的野心并维持权力平衡的人。在不同时期，这一类人可能包括任何其他公会的成员，尤其是塞勒斯尼亚协约国。每个人（混沌者（%0%）和格鲁尔可能是例外）都对维持现状偶有兴趣，不管这种观念在其他时候看起来多么具有革命性。",

	"Each precinct, as well as its distinct personality, is explored in its own section later in this chapter. Here are brief descriptions of each of them to help orient you before your tour:": "在本章后面的章节中，将对每个辖区以及其独特的个性进行探讨。以下是对每个区的简要描述，以帮助你在参观前确定方向。",
	"{@b Precinct One}. This is the hub of the wealthy and powerful, where courtly games and espionage play out among visitors gawking at the impressive architecture. The precinct is also known as the Guildpact Precinct.": "{@b Precinct One}. 这里是富人和权贵的聚集地，宫廷游戏和间谍活动在对令人印象深刻的建筑目不转睛的游客中展开。该区也被称为Guildpact区。",
	"{@b Precinct Two}. Many professionals live here in clean and orderly neighborhoods, in the shadow of New Prahv, while mob bosses coerce residents in order to enrich themselves and influence local politics.": "{@b Precinct Two}. 许多专业人士在这里生活在干净有序的社区，在新普拉赫夫的阴影下，而黑帮老大则胁迫居民，以便发财和影响当地政治。",
	"{@b Precinct Three}. In the Greenbelt, nature has encroached into the urban environment to varying degrees, and folk here provide bountiful sustenance and domesticated beasts for most of the district.": "{@b Precinct Three}. 在绿化带中，大自然在不同程度上侵占了城市环境，这里的民风为大部分地区提供了丰盛的养料和驯养的野兽。",
	"{@b Precinct Four}. Constantly in a state of turmoil, the scarred streets of Precinct Four are a proving ground for soldiers and marauders alike. Visitors here had best be spoiling for a fight.": "{@b Precinct Four}. 第四区的街道一直处于动荡状态，伤痕累累的街道是士兵和掠夺者的试验场。来这里的人最好准备好迎接一场战斗。",
	"{@b Precinct Five}. Precinct Five is where the learned folk of the Tenth District gather to discuss theory or to put their knowledge to practical use in the precinct's many schools, libraries, and laboratories.": "{@b Precinct Five}. 第五区是第十区有学问的人聚集在一起讨论理论或在该区的许多学校、图书馆和实验室将他们的知识用于实践的地方。",
	"{@b Precinct Six}. In the hardscrabble neighborhoods of Precinct Six, the working folk eke out a living by toiling at warehouses, docks, and factories controlled by callous employers. When night comes, the residents hide indoors to avoid becoming prey to creatures that stalk the darkness.": "{@b Precinct Six}. 在第六区艰苦的街区，工人们在冷酷无情的雇主控制的仓库、码头和工厂里劳作，勉强维持生计。当夜幕降临时，居民们躲在室内，以避免成为跟踪黑暗的生物的猎物。",
	"Each precinct's section includes two tables that can help you, as DM, improvise as characters explore that part of the city.": "每个辖区的部分包括两个表格，可以帮助你，作为DM，在角色探索城市的那一部分时即兴发挥。",
	"When a character wants to talk to a person on the street, you can roll on the People on the Street table for the precinct. Unless otherwise noted, these NPCs can be of any race. They might use the {@book Monster Manual|MM} stat blocks for {@creature Commoner||commoners}, {@creature Guard||guards}, or other creatures, at your discretion.": "当一个角色想和街上的人交谈时，你可以在街上的人的表格上为该辖区的人进行滚动。除非另有说明，这些NPC可以是任何种族。他们可以使用{@book Monster Manual|MM}的状态块，用于{@creature Commoner||commoners}、{@creature Guard||guards}或其他生物，由你决定。",
	"Whenever characters are gathering information or talking with contacts in a precinct, you can use the Rumors table for the precinct to add some flavor to their interactions or to generate adventure hooks.": "每当角色在辖区内收集信息或与联系人交谈时，你可以使用该辖区的流言表，为他们的互动增加一些味道，或产生冒险钩。",
	"Two major avenues run across the whole Tenth District, crossing precinct lines.": "两条主要的大道贯穿整个第十区，跨越选区线。",
	"{@b Tin Street} is the longest thoroughfare in the city, a vital center of trade, and a hub of activity day and night. In addition to its shopping attractions, Tin Street is also a popular spot for nightlife, with its many restaurants and theaters. Much of the street runs through the western part of Precinct Four, and other parts are claimed by goblin gangs. The prominent presence of Boros soldiers along the length of Tin Street helps the populace feel safer, but the threat of rubblebelt raiders and goblin thieves remains.": "{@b Tin Street}是该市最长的大道，是重要的贸易中心，也是日夜活动的中心。除了购物景点外，锡街也是一个受欢迎的夜生活场所，有许多餐馆和剧院。这条街的大部分穿过第四区的西部，而其他部分则被地精帮派所占据。沿着铁皮街，Boros士兵的突出存在帮助民众感到更安全，但瓦砾带袭击者和地精小偷的威胁仍然存在。",
	"The {@b Transguild Promenade} makes its way across the district from the edge of the rubblebelt in Precinct Four to the southern gates of Precinct One. The Promenade's northern reach is heavily patrolled by Boros soldiers, and caravans coming from the north employ heavily armed escorts to ensure their safe passage through the ruined areas. Markets and parks line the avenue as it winds through Precinct One, and parades clog the street on festive holidays.": "从第四区的废墟边缘到第一区的南门，{@b Transguild Promenade}一路横穿该区。长廊的北面有大量的鲍罗斯士兵巡逻，来自北方的商队雇佣全副武装的护卫，以确保他们安全通过废墟区。市场和公园沿着大道蜿蜒穿过第一区，每逢节庆假日，游行队伍就会拥堵在街上。",
	"Even though most Ravnicans think the city begins at ground level and stretches upward, the part of the city that lies beneath the streets impacts the lives of everyone. Immediately underground are the city works, such as the sewers and the transit system. Below the complex network of tunnels and passages that make up the city works lies the undercity—a realm populated by creatures that shun the surface world.": "尽管大多数拉夫尼克人认为城市从地面开始，然后向上延伸，但城市中位于街道下面的部分影响着每个人的生活。紧邻地下的是城市工程，如下水道和交通系统。在构成城市工程的复杂的隧道和通道网络下面是地下世界--一个由避开表面世界的生物所居住的领域。",
	"The Izzet League is responsible for constructing and maintaining public works, including sewers and other pipe systems. Many members of the Golgari Swarm live or work here, farming fungus and scavenging for valuable trinkets in the muck. Orzhov crypts and vaults, Dimir hideouts, and Simic laboratories can also be found in the city works.": "伊泽特联盟负责建造和维护公共工程，包括下水道和其他管道系统。许多戈尔加里蜂群的成员在这里生活或工作，养殖菌类，在淤泥中搜刮有价值的饰品。在城市工程中还可以找到奥佐夫（Orzhov）的地下室和地窖、迪米尔（Dimir）的藏身处以及西米克（Simic）的实验室。",
	"Anchored by enormous chains at the juncture of Precincts One, Three, and Four, the Millennial Platform is a floating observation deck that affords the best overhead view of the Tenth District. The most exclusive restaurant in the district is located here. Every citizen is given a token that can be redeemed for one airship ride to the platform anytime during the coming year, but those who want to dine at the Millennial Restaurant might have to make a reservation months in advance.": "千年平台由巨大的铁链锚定在第一、第三和第四区的交界处，是一个浮动的观景台，提供了第十区最好的俯视视角。该区最高档的餐厅就设在这里。每个公民都会得到一个代币，可以在未来一年内的任何时候兑换一次飞艇到平台上，但那些想在千年餐厅用餐的人可能要提前几个月预订。",
	"A vast, winding sewer network runs under the Tenth District, lit by {@spell continual flame} spells. Some of the tunnels are simply storm sewers, meant to carry rainwater (and the debris it washes from the streets) into great cisterns, where it is purified and sent into the pipes in the plumbing system that serves Ravnica's nicer neighborhoods. Others carry waste and refuse out of those neighborhoods, depositing it in different cisterns or dumping it into the subterranean oceans of the undercity.": "一个巨大的、蜿蜒的下水道网络在第十区地下运行，由{@spell continual flame}法术照明。有些隧道仅仅是暴雨下水道，目的是将雨水（以及雨水从街道上冲刷下来的碎片）输送到巨大的蓄水池中，在那里经过净化后被送入水管系统的管道中，为拉夫尼卡较好的社区服务。另一些则是将垃圾和废物运出这些社区，将其存放在不同的蓄水池中，或将其倾倒在城市地下的海洋中。",
	"Around the sewer system, smaller tunnel networks carry steam, distilled magical energy, and water to various places throughout the city. These passages are large enough for a humanoid to walk through but are often quite uncomfortable, filled with impure air and stifling heat.": "在下水道系统周围，较小的隧道网络将蒸汽、蒸馏的魔法能量和水运送到整个城市的各个地方。这些通道足够大，可以让人走过，但往往相当不舒服，充满了不纯净的空气和令人窒息的热量。",
	"Magically charged tracks line the floors of tube-like tunnels that send vehicular constructs to major locations in the Tenth District and beyond. The tunnels open into small stations that have staircases leading up to the surface.": "在管状隧道的地板上铺设了带有魔力的轨道，将车辆构造送到第十区和其他地区的主要地点。隧道开到小站，有楼梯通往地面。",
	"Ancient resting places lie in secret chambers below the surface of Ravnica. Many of them have been magically warded to prevent unauthorized entry. Some of these sites are homes for restless undead or gathering places for thieves, smugglers, and other criminals.": "古老的休息场所位于拉夫尼卡地表下的密室中。其中许多地方都被施以魔法，以防止未经授权的进入。其中一些地方是不安分的亡灵的家园，或是小偷、走私者和其他罪犯的聚集地。",
	"Deep below the Tenth District lies a vast, thriving community of folk who have no desire or choice to live under the sky. Here, the Dimir, Golgari, {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, and Simic hold sway in the caverns, causeways, and bodies of water that grace the darkest depths.": "在第十区的地下深处，有一个巨大的、繁荣的社区，那里的人们不愿意也没有选择在天空下生活。在这里，迪米尔（Dimir）、戈尔加里（Golgari）、（%0%）和西米克（Simic）在最黑暗的深处的洞穴、堤道和水体中掌握着权力。",
	"The sprawling residence of many of the House Dimir elite, parts of Nightveil overlap the Tenth District in the undercity. An extensive system of natural caverns houses high-walled mansions and sunken crypts that have a grand, sinister motif. Patrolling specters and other incorporeal undead make it difficult for the unwelcome to enter.": "作为迪米尔家族许多精英的居住地，夜幕的部分地区与城市地下的第十区重叠在一起。一个广泛的天然洞穴系统容纳了高墙的豪宅和下沉的墓穴，具有宏伟而阴险的主题。巡逻的幽灵和其他无体的亡灵使不受欢迎的人难以进入。",
	"The Dimir guildhall is protected by memory wards (glyphs of warding that store {@spell modify memory} spells) to ensure that few know of its existence. Those who are called there never remember what transpired, beyond what is necessary. Most assume that the place lies somewhere within Nightveil, but it could lie anywhere in the undercity.": "迪米尔市政厅受到记忆护盾的保护（护盾的字形可以储存（%0%）法术），以确保很少有人知道它的存在。那些被召唤到那里的人，除了必要的事情之外，从不记得发生了什么。大多数人认为这个地方位于Nightveil的某个地方，但它可能位于城市地下的任何地方。",
	"Also called the Maze of Decay, Korozda is an arched subterranean cathedral surrounded by fungal hedgerows and moss-encrusted ruins. In its center is a great amphitheater where the most important issues are brought to the Golgari's attention. Penvar, the Hanging Keep, is a castle fixed upside down on the ceiling above the entrance to Korozda. Its soldiers, predominantly the insectoid kraul, prevent any unauthorized visitors to the Golgari stronghold.": "科罗兹达也被称为 \"腐烂的迷宫\"，是一个拱形的地下大教堂，周围是真菌树篱和长满青苔的废墟。在它的中心是一个巨大的圆形剧场，最重要的问题在这里被提交给戈尔加里注意。Penvar，即悬空堡垒，是一座倒挂在科罗兹达入口处天花板上的城堡。它的士兵，主要是昆虫类的克劳尔，防止任何未经授权的访客进入戈尔加里的据点。",
	"Known as the Dungeon Palace, this is the guildhall of the Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR}, and the lava-filled lair of the demon himself. An immense, crumbling, red stone staircase called the Demon's Vestibule begins the journey from the Smelting District down into the depths, treating travelers to terrifying images depicted on banners as they descend. Farther down, the temperature rises and the passage eventually opens up into the Festival Grounds, where the bloodiest performances of the {@creature Rakdos|GGR} and their torturous equipment are on display.": "这里被称为地宫，是{@creature Rakdos|GGR}邪教的行宫，也是恶魔本人充满熔岩的巢穴。一条巨大的、摇摇欲坠的红色石阶被称为 \"恶魔前庭\"，它开始了从冶炼区到深处的旅程，旅行者在下降的过程中会看到横幅上描绘的恐怖图像。再往下走，温度升高，通道最终打开，进入节日广场，这里展示着（1%）最血腥的表演和他们折磨人的设备。",
	"Rivers, lakes, and oceans run deep below the surface of Ravnica. Several of them connect to the Simic habitats known as zonots. They are also used as thoroughfares by aquatic races and monsters.": "河流、湖泊和海洋在拉夫尼卡的地表下深处流淌。其中有几个连接到被称为 \"分区 \"的西米克栖息地。它们也被水生种族和怪兽用作通道。",
	"The grandeur of Precinct One is the heart of Ravnica's civilization, and visitors gawk at the impressive architecture and rub shoulders with the rich and powerful. Immaculately maintained avenues and manicured gardens create an impression of order, civility, and high culture. During the day, the streets are filled with tourists, government officials, diplomats, and wealthy merchants and financiers. At night, most of Precinct One is quiet, with a few lit carriages drawn by constructs and well-groomed beasts making their way to exclusive nightclubs and restaurants.": "第一区的宏伟是拉夫尼卡文明的核心，游客们对令人印象深刻的建筑瞠目结舌，与富人和权贵擦肩而过。维护得一尘不染的林荫道和修剪整齐的花园给人留下了秩序、文明和高级文化的印象。白天，街道上挤满了游客、政府官员、外交官以及富有的商人和金融家。到了晚上，第一区的大部分地区都很安静，只有几辆由建筑工人和精心打扮的野兽拉着的点燃的马车在前往高级夜总会和餐馆的路上。",
	"The people who live in this precinct are accustomed to having high-quality goods and spending a lot of leisure time in social engagements. Neighbors are polite and affable toward others of their station, but gossip is quite common and accepted.": "住在这个地区的人习惯于拥有高质量的商品，并在社交活动中花费大量的休闲时间。邻居们对与他们地位相同的人都很有礼貌，和蔼可亲，但流言蜚语是相当普遍和被接受的。",
	"All the guilds have interests here. Lawyers, bureaucrats, and soldiers of the Azorius Senate are found throughout the precinct. The Orzhov Syndicate runs many of the clubs and restaurants here, and this is the location of both its guildhall, Orzhova, and its monumental Vizkopa Bank. The Selesnya Conclave helps to maintain the grounds around the plaza and is often involved as diplomatic envoys for meetings and negotiations that take place here.": "所有的行会都在这里有利益。律师、官僚和Azorius元老院的士兵在整个辖区内都可以找到。奥尔佐夫集团在这里经营着许多俱乐部和餐馆，这里也是它的市政厅--奥尔佐瓦和它的纪念性的维兹科帕银行的所在地。塞勒斯尼亚公会帮助维护广场周围的场地，并经常作为外交使节参与在这里举行的会议和谈判。",

	"A popular place for meetings, recreation, shopping, and simply being seen, Tenth District Plaza is a beautiful oasis of calm and cleanliness. Kept perpetually clean through magic and constantly patrolled by Azorius arresters, the plaza is considered neutral ground for every guild, gang, and faction in the city. Drawing a weapon within the confines of the plaza is met with a swift response from the arresters and marks the offender as a person who can't be trusted.": "第十区广场是一个深受欢迎的聚会、娱乐、购物的地方，也是一个美丽的平静和清洁的绿洲。广场通过魔法保持永久的清洁，并由阿佐里乌斯的逮捕人员不断巡逻，被认为是城市中每个公会、帮派和派别的中立地。在广场的范围内拔出武器会得到逮捕者的迅速反应，并将犯罪者标记为不可信任的人。",
	"The long promenade of Plaza Avenue connects the south end of Tenth District Plaza to the great meeting hall of the guilds. The Chamber of the Guildpact is accessible by a grand staircase leading up into a cavernous hall where visitors and dignitaries from all over Ravnica meet. The Living Guildpact has an office here, but he is seldom present. In his absence, various functionaries who occupy the upper levels of the chamber try to carry out his work of adjudicating disputes between guilds and maintaining a semblance of peace.": "广场大道的长廊连接着第十区广场的南端和公会的大会议厅。行会会议厅可以通过一个大的楼梯进入一个空旷的大厅，来自拉夫尼卡各地的访客和政要在这里会面。活着的公会联盟在这里有一个办公室，但他很少出现。在他不在的时候，占据会议厅上层的各种职能部门试图执行他的工作，裁决公会之间的争端，维持和平的假象。",

	"The privileged and wealthy people who live in Precinct One believe that the purpose of law enforcement is to serve them and keep them protected from the more unsavory elements of the city. Government officials here are more practical in their view of the law, recognizing that Precinct One is the entry point into the Tenth for many visitors and thus it must keep up the best of appearances. Azorius law enforcement officers are ever-present here, with at least one arrester assigned to patrol each street in Precinct One. It is illegal to brandish a weapon here, and people who walk around with unconcealed weapons (even sheathed ones) draw attention.

	"Few days or nights pass quietly in Precinct Four. The frequent din of battle as Boros soldiers guard against Gruul marauders, the strange sounds of volatile magic emanating from Izzet experiments, and the occasional explosive flare-ups of goblin gang wars keep the precinct a dynamic and dangerous place. Its buildings include ramshackle tenements damaged by conflict, impregnable fortresses and laboratories, and bustling markets filled with merchants ready to defend themselves and their wares.": "在第四区，很少有几天或几夜是安静的。Boros的士兵们经常在战斗的喧嚣中防范Gruul的掠夺者，Izzet实验中发出的不稳定魔法的奇怪声音，以及偶尔爆发的地精帮派战争，使这个地区成为一个充满活力和危险的地方。这里的建筑包括被冲突破坏的破旧公寓，坚不可摧的堡垒和实验室，以及充满了准备保护自己和自己商品的商人的热闹市场。",

	"The Boros Legion's guildhall fortress, Sunhome, is located here, and that guild is the heart of the precinct's defense against the savage forces that come from the northern rubblebelt. The Izzet League often likes to test its latest experiments in this precinct. Its guildhall, Nivix, towers over the south end. The Gruul Clans frequently raid into the rest of the precinct from the rubblebelt in the north. The Cult of {@creature Rakdos|GGR} delights in sowing mayhem here, stoking the fires of conflict and gathering inspiration for future performances.": "Boros军团的公会堡垒Sunhome就位于这里，该公会是本辖区防御来自北部废墟地带的野蛮力量的核心。伊泽特联盟经常喜欢在这个辖区测试其最新的实验。它的市政厅，Nivix，耸立在南端。格鲁尔（Gruul）家族经常从北部的废墟地带突袭到辖区内的其他地方。邪教{@creature Rakdos|GGR}乐于在这里制造混乱，煽动冲突的火焰，为未来的表演收集灵感。",

	"The seat of the Boros Legion's power, the guildhall known as Sunhome is an imposing structure that serves as a fortress, barracks, and spiritual center. It is widely believed to be impregnable and serves as a reminder to attackers from the north of the strength of Boros resolve.": "被称为 \"太阳之家 \"的市政厅是波罗斯军团权力的所在地，它是一个宏伟的建筑，作为堡垒、军营和精神中心。人们普遍认为它是坚不可摧的，并提醒来自北方的攻击者波罗斯决心的力量。",

	"The rubblebelt to the north is a wasteland filled with ruins, gutted buildings, and debris-ridden streets. Aside from the Gruul Clans, the only citizens who live in the neighborhood are the ones too stubborn to move away. The Gruul share the space with ferocious beasts, elementals, and other monsters.": "北面的瓦砾带是一片荒地，到处是废墟、被掏空的建筑和满是碎片的街道。除了格鲁尔部族，住在附近的唯一公民是那些太顽固的人，他们不愿搬走。格鲁尔人与凶猛的野兽、元素和其他怪物共享这个空间。",
	"The neighborhood between Sunhome and Nivix is filled with reinforced structures that serve as low-rent apartments and shops. Those who live in the Bulwark are mainly workers or professionals who see opportunity in supporting the Boros garrison.": "Sunhome和Nivix之间的街区充满了加固的结构，作为低租金公寓和商店。住在Bulwark的人主要是工人或专业人士，他们在支持Boros的驻军中看到了机会。",
	"The Gruul Clans periodically converge on the gutted, cratered remains of a huge palace in the Red Wastes where a great bonfire perpetually burns. Skarrg is the closest thing the Gruul have to a guildhall—a place where their clans can come together, roast giant boars, boast of their exploits, and form something akin to camaraderie before they go their separate, violent ways. It's not neutral ground, though—old grudges frequently boil over into combat. Outsiders are never welcome.": "格鲁尔部族定期聚集在红色荒原上一座巨大宫殿的残垣断壁上，那里永远燃烧着巨大的篝火。斯卡格是格鲁尔人最接近公会的地方--他们的部族可以聚集在一起，烤大野猪，夸耀他们的功绩，并在他们各奔东西、充满暴力之前形成类似于友情的东西。不过，这里并不是中立的地方，长期以来的怨恨经常会激化成战斗。外来者从不受欢迎。",
	"Precinct Four has a wide variation in available goods, depending on the neighborhood. There is little or no commerce in the Red Wastes, except for what can be bartered with Gruul clansfolk or scavenged. The Bulwark carries many basic goods and services, with weapons and armor plentiful due to the constant threat of conflict and the nearby foundries in District Six. On Tin Street, almost anything is available for a bit of searching and the right price.": "第四辖区的商品差异很大，这取决于附近的情况。在红色荒原上几乎没有商业，除了可以与格鲁尔族人进行交易或搜刮的东西。堡垒有许多基本的商品和服务，由于冲突的持续威胁和附近第六区的铸造厂，武器和盔甲都很充足。在铁皮街上，只要稍加寻找，以合适的价格，几乎什么都能买到。",

	"Much of Precinct Four is a war zone, and mundane methods of law enforcement aren't always effective in such an environment. No one takes the constant patrolling of the Boros Legion as a guarantee of their safety, and almost all folk know how to fight to some degree. Typical threats include giant monsters, unstable elementals, and Gruul raiding parties, and a curfew system is often instituted when a neighborhood is beset by one of these dangers. The only area that is usually safe from external threats is Tin Street. Petty crimes aren't given much attention, since the soldiers are primarily concerned with curbing violence and mayhem. The typical response to a reported crime or a dangerous threat is {@dice 1d8} minutes, and the squad consists of a Boros Legion {@creature knight} (from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}){@b} leading {@dice 4d4} {@creature soldier|GGR|soldiers}.": "第四区的大部分地区是一个战区，在这样的环境下，世俗的执法方法并不总是有效的。没有人把波洛军团的持续巡逻当作他们安全的保证，几乎所有的人都知道如何在某种程度上战斗。典型的威胁包括巨型怪物、不稳定的元素和格鲁尔突击队，当一个街区被这些危险困扰时，通常会制定宵禁制度。唯一通常不受外部威胁的地区是锡街。由于士兵们主要关注的是遏制暴力和混乱，所以小规模犯罪并没有得到太多的关注。对报告的犯罪或危险威胁的典型反应是{@dice 1d8}分钟，小队由博罗军团{@creature knight}（来自{@book Monster Manual|MM}）{@b}领导{@dice 4d4}{@creature soldier|GGR|soldiers}组成。",
	"The Red Wastes is a lawless region mostly beyond the reach of Boros patrols and Azorius laws.

	"As the home of prestigious universities, ancient libraries, and hidden laboratories, Precinct Five is the hub of information and learning in the Tenth District. People of all ages flock to this precinct to spend time learning, whether by poring over texts and scrolls or finding a mentor who will guide a student. It's also the place to find information brokers, who sell specialized or secret knowledge available nowhere else. Multilevel buildings set next to each other with little regard for planning give way to an occasional square or open campus where socially minded residents congregate during daytime hours. At night, many continue their studies while others tinker with their latest creations or intellectual endeavors. Taverns and pubs tend to be more urbane than in other parts of the district and often feature poetry readings, storytelling, and musical performances.": "作为著名大学、古老图书馆和隐藏实验室的所在地，第五区是第十区的信息和学习中心。各个年龄段的人都涌向这个辖区，花时间学习，无论是翻阅文本和卷轴，还是寻找指导学生的导师。这里也是寻找信息经纪人的地方，他们出售其他地方没有的专业或秘密知识。多层建筑彼此相邻，很少考虑规划，偶尔会有一个广场或开放的校园，白天有社会意识的居民在这里聚集。到了晚上，许多人继续学习，而其他人则捣鼓他们最新的创作或智力成果。酒馆和酒吧往往比该区的其他地方更城市化，经常有诗歌朗诵、讲故事和音乐表演。",
	"People who live in Precinct Five have a zeal for learning and tend to be inquisitive. Getting into a heated debate or touting a recent success to your neighbors is part of showing your worth. Good neighbors keep their projects and research hidden until a result can be displayed; it is considered uncouth to allow others to view a work in progress.": "住在第五区的人有学习的热情，并倾向于好奇心。陷入激烈的辩论或向邻居吹嘘最近的成功，是展示自己价值的一部分。好的邻居会把他们的项目和研究隐藏起来，直到可以展示出结果；让别人看到正在进行的工作被认为是不礼貌的。",
	"Zonot Seven, the home of the Simic Combine's guildhall, is located on the western edge of the precinct. The Izzet League maintains a network of laboratories and workshops close to Nivix (in Precinct Four).

Some members of the Azorius Senate who prefer to study disciplines aside from the law make their homes here as well.": "Zonot Seven是西米克联合体的行宫所在地，位于辖区的西部边缘。伊泽特联盟在靠近尼维克斯（第四区）的地方维持着一个实验室和车间网络。迪米尔家族的特工在该区到处可见或不可见，他们秘密地管理着伊斯梅里图书馆。一些喜欢研究法律以外的学科的阿索瑞斯参议院成员也在这里安家。",
	"Life for residents in Precinct Five is spent mostly indoors, or in the case of the Simic, underwater. The precinct's occupants—including significant populations of students, instructors, researchers, scribes, and university staff—are crowded into dormitories and apartments squeezed in among laboratories, libraries, and magical machinery.": "第五区居民的生活大部分是在室内度过的，或者在西米克的情况下，是在水下。辖区内的居民--包括大量的学生、教师、研究人员、抄写员和大学工作人员--都挤在宿舍和公寓里，挤在实验室、图书馆和魔法机器之间。",

Zonot Seven is the only zonot within Ravnica City proper, and it contains Zameck, the Simic guildhall. In contrast to the rest of the precinct, the zonot is a bustling place, with activity at all hours. A huge chamber just below the street surface serves as a gathering place for all the Simic speakers, as well as a place where visitors can meet with Prime Speaker {@creature Zegana|GGR} or other Simic emissaries.

	"A series of gigantic waterwheels, built and operated by the Izzet League, turns just outside Zonot Seven in the north end of the precinct. The system generates magical energy to power public works, Simic laboratories, and, of course, Izzet workshops. Few outside the Izzet realize that the amount of energy generated in the Blistercoils far exceeds what is actually used, with the excess stored in underground batteries that could explode if they became overloaded.": "一系列巨大的水车，由Izzet联盟建造和运营，就在辖区北端的Zonot Seven外转动。该系统产生的魔法能量为公共工程、西米克实验室，当然还有伊泽特工场提供动力。很少有Izzet以外的人意识到，水泡线圈产生的能量远远超过了实际使用的能量，多余的能量储存在地下电池中，如果过载就会发生爆炸。",

	"The western end of the precinct is packed with educational institutions of all sorts, from grand universities that cover a broad span of disciplines to specialized schools that instruct students in subjects ranging from theoretical metaphysics to fine arts.

Students and staff live both on and off the various campuses, and several cozy pubs and small lecture halls are busy from afternoons through late in the night.": "辖区的西端挤满了各种教育机构，从涵盖广泛学科的大型大学到指导学生学习从理论形而上学到美术的专业学校。这个街区的名字来自于这些学校的建筑中至少有一个高大的尖顶。学生和教职员工都住在不同的校园内和校园外，几个舒适的酒吧和小型演讲厅从下午到深夜都很热闹。",
	"A crystal-paned center of learning that concentrates on magical theory and application, Prism University draws potential wizards and other would-be mages who want to learn about all forms of magic, in contrast to the specialized and practical applications of magic espoused by the guilds. Even though the school maintains a formal state of neutrality, it's an open secret that many guilds have infiltrated the university and planted agents to woo prospective members. Partly as a result of this influence, many graduates of the university do go on to join a guild, finding a way to apply their broad experience to support the narrower focus of the guild. (A player character spellcaster might well be a graduate of the university, which could explain the character's ability to use magic that wouldn't normally be taught within their guild.)": "棱镜大学是一个专注于魔法理论和应用的学习中心，它吸引了潜在的巫师和其他想要学习各种形式的魔法的法师，这与行会所推崇的专门和实用的魔法应用形成鲜明对比。尽管学校保持着正式的中立状态，但许多公会已经渗透到大学里，并安插了代理人来招揽潜在的成员，这是一个公开的秘密。部分由于这种影响，许多大学的毕业生确实加入了一个公会，找到了一种方法来应用他们广泛的经验来支持公会的狭隘焦点。(一个玩家角色的施法者很可能是大学的毕业生，这可以解释这个角色有能力使用通常不会在他们公会中传授的魔法）。",
	"One of the greatest libraries on all Ravnica, the Ismeri Library is open to all citizens at all hours. Hundreds of thousands of books covering every conceivable subject are found here. The place is also one of the centers of Dimir communication. Secret messages are hidden within its books by a variety of methods both magical and mundane. Dimir agents might have to gather message fragments hidden within several different documents, for example, to find their next assignments or targets. Intricate codes and magical wards protect other secrets.": "作为整个拉夫尼卡最伟大的图书馆之一，伊斯梅里图书馆在任何时候都对所有公民开放。这里有几十万本涵盖所有可以想象的主题的书籍。这个地方也是迪米尔人的交流中心之一。秘密信息通过各种魔法和世俗的方法被隐藏在书中。例如，迪米尔特工可能不得不收集隐藏在几个不同文件中的信息碎片，以找到他们的下一个任务或目标。复杂的代码和魔法防护装置保护着其他秘密。",
	"Specialty items that are commonly used by scribes, researchers, and inventors can be found in many small shops in the precinct, usually run by a tinker or academic. Precinct Five also has the best apothecaries, alchemists, and magic-mongers in the Tenth District. On the other hand, mundane adventuring gear, weapons, and armor are harder to find.": "文士、研究人员和发明家常用的特殊物品可以在辖区内的许多小商店找到，这些商店通常由工匠或学者经营。第五区还拥有第十区最好的药剂师、炼金术师和魔法师。另一方面，普通的冒险装备、武器和盔甲比较难找。",

	"Meals and lodging of modest to wealthy quality are available here. Older and more experienced people—high-ranking Simic researchers or established scholars—tend to maintain lifestyles toward the more expensive end of that scale.": "这里的餐饮和住宿质量从一般到富裕都有。年纪较大、经验丰富的人--高级西米奇研究人员或知名学者--往往会将生活方式维持在这一规模的较昂贵的一端。",

	"Much of the crime in Precinct Five is of a sort that is hard to detect: blackmail, espionage, identity theft (of the literal kind, perpetrated by shapechangers), and the like. Most of the precinct's residents spend their time absorbed in study, unaware that such activities might be happening under their noses. Only rarely does violence break out, and Azorius arresters try hard to keep the incident quiet and maintain public calm.": "第五区的大部分犯罪都是难以察觉的：勒索、间谍活动、身份盗窃（字面意思是由变形金刚实施的）等等。辖区内的大多数居民把时间花在学习上，没有意识到这种活动可能发生在他们的眼皮底下。只有在极少数情况下才会发生暴力事件，阿佐里乌斯的逮捕人员会努力保持事件的安静，并保持公众的冷静。",

The demands of commerce keep the area constantly active, and the inconspicuous nature of the warehouses makes them popular as rendezvous points for all sorts of transactions, legal and illicit.

Many kraul make their homes in the walls that line the cavernous descent, and Devkarin elves come up to the surface through this passage to trade on Tin Street.": "地面上的一个缺口主宰着这个区域，两边是长满苔藓的楼梯和真菌的花朵。死桥鸿沟是通往戈尔加里人的城下之境和他们的行宫科罗兹达的入口。这个区域有腐烂的气味，这种气味在炎热的日子里会变得特别强烈。许多克劳尔人在洞穴下行的墙壁上安家，德夫卡林的精灵们通过这条通道来到地面，在铁皮街进行交易。",
	"The neighborhood of Wayport rises like a pillar from the midst of Deadbridge Chasm, and a number of bridges, large and small, connect it to the surrounding city of multiple vertical levels. Many goods traded with other districts are funneled along Tin Street, often pausing in Wayport's warehouses along the way. But only the wealthiest merchants can afford storage space here.": "Wayport社区像一根柱子一样从死桥鸿沟的中间升起，一些大大小小的桥梁将它与周围的多个垂直层面的城市连接起来。许多与其他地区交易的货物都是沿着铁皮街输送的，沿途经常在Wayport的仓库中停顿。但只有最富有的商人才能负担得起这里的存储空间。",
	"This wide bridge is a main thoroughfare for cargo traveling to and from districts beyond the Tenth.

Secret pain clubs, hidden below the market in dark rooms inside the bridge itself, come alive after sunset.": "这座宽阔的桥是进出第十区的货物的主要通道。这里有一个小市场，里面有商店和餐馆，所有这些都在天黑后关闭。秘密的疼痛俱乐部，隐藏在市场下面桥内的黑暗房间里，日落之后就会活跃起来。",
	"Trade goods can easily be acquired in Precinct Six, along with manufactured items such as artisan's tools. Weapons, armor, and mounts are rarely on sale here.

	"The folk of Precinct Six are pragmatic, not overly concerned with the welfare of others, and thus often willing to disregard minor crimes. Arresters from the Azorius Senate can often be found on patrol in and around the warehouses. Soldiers from the Boros Legion are common near the warehouses and in the Smelting Quarter. The typical response time to a reported crime in these areas is {@dice 2d10} minutes, and the squad consists of two Boros {@creature soldier|GGR|soldiers}.

	"Beneath the urban environment of Ravnica is an entirely different city—the dark, dank undercity, where vermin and horrors lurk and the Golgari Swarm maintains its elegant courts. Indeed, thousands of years of development have buried countless layers of construction beneath the current surface streets, making the undercity much larger than the surface city, though much of it is inaccessible. But if a sinkhole or other catastrophe opens long-sealed vaults and exposes them to the surface again, who knows what horrors might be revealed?": "在拉夫尼卡的城市环境之下是一个完全不同的城市--黑暗、阴暗的地下城，那里潜伏着害虫和恐怖，戈尔加里虫群保持着它优雅的法庭。事实上，数千年的发展已经在目前的地面街道下埋下了无数的建筑层，使得地下城市比地面城市大得多，尽管其中大部分是无法进入的。但是，如果一个天坑或其他灾难打开了长期密封的地窖，使它们再次暴露在地面上，谁知道会有什么恐怖的事情发生？",

	"Every guild has its internal politics, making it easy for characters to get caught up in intrigue—particularly within their own guilds. Certain guilds are more likely to involve themselves in the politics of {@i other} guilds, which makes them particularly good villains for intrigue-based adventures.": "每个行会都有其内部政治，使角色很容易陷入阴谋之中--特别是在他们自己的行会中。某些行会更有可能卷入（%0%）行会的政治，这使他们成为基于阴谋的冒险中特别好的反派。",
	"Ravnica is rife with crime, presenting law-abiding adventurers with ample opportunity to put their mystery-solving skills to the test. Identifying a guild assassin, tracking a stolen treasure, or unmasking a corrupt bureaucrat could all fall into this category. Of course, the adventurers need not be virtuous or law-abiding themselves: the Orzhov are more apt to send their own enforcers after thieves than they are to turn to the forces of law for assistance.": "拉夫尼卡充斥着犯罪，为守法的冒险者提供了大量的机会来考验他们的解谜技巧。识别一个公会的刺客，追踪一个被盗的宝藏，或者揭开一个腐败的官僚的面纱，都可以归入这一类别。当然，冒险家们不需要自己是个有德行或守法的人：奥卓夫人更倾向于派自己的执法者去追捕小偷，而不是向法律的力量寻求帮助。",
	"When a cyclonic rift sweeps through the streets, an uncontrolled wurm crashes through buildings, or a laboratory experiment goes haywire, heroes might be called upon to shelter the innocent, stop the disaster at its source, or hunt down the villain responsible.": "当旋风裂缝横扫街道，不受控制的巫妖撞破建筑物，或者实验室的实验出现混乱时，英雄们可能会被要求保护无辜者，从源头上阻止灾难，或者追捕负责的恶棍。",

	"Interguild conflict is such a fundamental aspect of life on Ravnica that the player characters' guild membership is an easy starting point for choosing an adventure villain. If you choose a villain from a guild that's already in conflict with one or more guilds that the characters belong to, it's easy to craft villainous goals that are at odds with the characters' goals.": "公会间的冲突是拉夫尼卡生活的一个基本方面，所以玩家角色的公会成员身份是选择冒险反派的一个简单起点。如果你从一个已经与角色所属的一个或多个公会发生冲突的公会中选择一个反派，就很容易制定出与角色目标相悖的反派目标。",
	"If all the player characters belong to a single guild, choosing almost any other guild will provide opportunities for conflict. The natural state of the relationship between any two guilds is tension at best, and open warfare at worst. All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.": "如果所有的玩家角色都属于一个单一的公会，选择几乎任何其他的公会都会提供冲突的机会。任何两个行会之间关系的自然状态最好是紧张，最坏是公开战争。只需要一个愿意打破权力平衡的反派，人物的公会或他们自己的动机就会很容易使他们与反派发生冲突。考虑到即使在行会内部也存在大量的阴谋诡计，一方自己的行会甚至可以提供一个反派。叛变的行会官员、同一行会的成员彼此不和，甚至是腐败的行会会长，都可以使角色与自己的行会发生冲突。",
	"If the characters come from different guilds, a common enemy provides a good reason for them to work together. Any guild that isn't represented by one of the characters is a fine choice for a villain.": "如果角色来自不同的公会，共同的敌人为他们提供了一个很好的理由来合作。任何不是由其中一个角色代表的行会都是一个很好的反派选择。",
	"Once you've chosen an adventure seed—a villain, a mission, or a general hook—you need to figure out what gets the player characters involved in the adventure. The answer could be as simple as a guildmaster or other authority sending them on a mission, but it's generally good to hook the characters in personally. What motivation do they have to thwart the villain?": "一旦你选择了一个冒险的种子--一个反派，一个任务，或者一个一般的钩子--你就需要想出是什么让玩家角色参与到这个冒险中来。答案可能很简单，就是一个公会会长或其他权威人士派他们去执行任务，但一般来说，让角色亲自参与进来是很好的。他们有什么动机来挫败坏蛋？",
	"The best answers to this question stem either from the adventurers' personalities, ideals, and histories, or from their guild affiliations. The characters might have a common reason to fight the villain (especially if they all belong to the same guild or have been adventuring together for a while), or they might all oppose the villain for different reasons.": "这个问题的最佳答案要么来自冒险者的个性、理想和历史，要么来自他们的公会关系。这些角色可能有一个共同的理由来对抗恶棍（特别是如果他们都属于同一个公会或者已经一起冒险了一段时间），或者他们都可能因为不同的原因而反对恶棍。",
	"For example, say your villain is a group of Gruul anarchs raiding in a densely populated area. A Boros character might be assigned to protect innocent bystanders, or might just happen to be in the area and leap to the defense of the innocents. An Izzet character might be trying to make sure that an Izzet laboratory in the area isn't damaged or its secrets looted. A Dimir spy might leap at the opportunity to steal some Izzet secrets when the laboratory comes under attack.": "例如，假设你的反派是一群格鲁尔无政府主义者，他们在人口稠密的地区进行袭击。一个Boros角色可能被指派去保护无辜的旁观者，或者刚好在该地区，并跃跃欲试地去保护无辜者。一个Izzet角色可能会试图确保该地区的Izzet实验室不被破坏或其秘密被掠夺。当实验室受到攻击时，一个迪米尔间谍可能会抓住机会偷取一些伊泽特人的秘密。",

	"Given their affinity for death, necromancy, and decay, the Golgari make excellent villains. Because they consider life and death as equal parts of the natural cycle, they have no qualms about subjecting entire neighborhoods to poisonous gas or strangling vines to achieve their various goals. When a Golgari assassin goes on a killing spree, when a patch of their vegetative growth begins \"reclaiming\" an area that isn't yet abandoned, or when their fungus-bearing zombies emerge from the undercity to haunt the city streets, heroes are duty bound to act against the threat.": "鉴于他们对死亡、巫术和腐烂的亲和力，戈尔加里人是优秀的反派。因为他们认为生命和死亡是自然循环的同等部分，所以他们毫无顾忌地将整个社区置于毒气中或扼杀藤蔓来实现他们的各种目标。当戈尔加里刺客大开杀戒时，当他们的植物生长地开始 \"开垦 \"一个尚未被遗弃的地区时，或者当他们携带真菌的僵尸从城市的地下涌出，在城市的街道上出没时，英雄们都有责任采取行动，应对这一威胁。",
	"The Golgari possess a combination of ambition and ruthlessness that makes them extremely dangerous adversaries. The tension among the various factions of the swarm (the elves, the medusas, the kraul, and the rising erstwhile) adds an element of instability to the mix. But perhaps the Golgari Swarm's most dangerous quality is the widespread confidence among its members that it will survive any catastrophe that might befall the surface world. This certainty means Golgari villains will stop at nothing in an attempt to provoke such an event—triggering a virulent plague, causing explosive plant growth, or inciting the other guilds into open war, for example. Over the course of a campaign, a group of adventurers might foil Golgari plans to accomplish all these things, or the characters might be constantly struggling against one ongoing disaster.": "戈尔加里人拥有一种野心和无情的结合，这使他们成为极其危险的对手。虫群中各派系（精灵族、梅杜莎族、克劳尔族和正在崛起的厄斯泰尔族）之间的紧张关系为这个组合增添了不稳定因素。但戈尔加里虫群最危险的品质也许是其成员中普遍存在的信心，即它将在任何可能降临到地表世界的灾难中幸存下来。这种确定性意味着戈尔加里的恶棍们会不惜一切代价来挑起这样的事件--例如，引发一场剧烈的瘟疫，导致植物爆炸性生长，或者煽动其他公会进行公开战争。在一场战役的过程中，一群冒险者可能会挫败戈尔加里的计划，完成所有这些事情，或者角色们可能会不断地与一场正在进行的灾难作斗争。",
	"For example, the characters might spend the early part of the campaign resolving disputes between guilds, unaware that the Golgari are actually the instigators of those conflicts. Perhaps incidental to these missions, they also face a spore druid who is in the early stages of testing a terrible plague. Then, as the campaign reaches higher levels, the plague breaks out again, this time spreading rapidly. The crisis heightens tensions among the other guilds, especially when food sources are threatened. At the climax of the campaign, the heroes must defuse conflict among the guilds while finding a way to get at the druid at the cause of it all, who is locked in an undercity mansion waiting out the catastrophe.": "例如，角色们可能会在战役的早期阶段解决行会之间的争端，却不知道戈尔加里人实际上是这些冲突的煽动者。也许在这些任务中，他们还面临着一个孢子德鲁伊，他正处于试验一种可怕瘟疫的早期阶段。然后，随着战役达到更高的水平，瘟疫再次爆发，这一次迅速蔓延。这场危机加剧了其他公会之间的紧张关系，特别是当食物来源受到威胁时。在战役的高潮部分，英雄们必须化解公会之间的冲突，同时找到一种方法来对付造成这一切的德鲁伊，他被锁在城市地下的豪宅中等待灾难的到来。",
	"Characters who are members of the Golgari Swarm might be sent on missions into the undercity, particularly jobs that involve retrieval or salvage. The secretive agents of the Ochran are more likely to pursue goals that call for theft or even assassination, while shamans could participate in the swarm's work of \"reclamation\" in surface neighborhoods. The Golgari Assignments table reflects this range of possibilities. An assignment can also serve as a side quest for Golgari adventurers to undertake while pursuing a larger goal with a mixed-guild party.": "作为戈尔加里蜂群的成员，他们可能会被派往城市地下执行任务，特别是涉及回收或打捞的工作。奥克兰的秘密特工更有可能追求偷窃甚至暗杀的目标，而巫师们则可以参与虫群在地面社区的 \"开垦 \"工作。戈尔加里任务表反映了这一系列的可能性。一个任务也可以作为戈尔加里冒险家的副业，在与混合公会一起追求一个更大的目标时进行。",

As a result, the workshops and laboratories of the Izzet are prone to magical mishaps, with results that range from personal injury to district-wide destruction.

Eventually, their strategy evolves toward extortion and conquest, as they unleash wurms and similar powerful beasts to threaten those who refuse to convert, and they use the might of their armies to eliminate other guilds and bring whole precincts under their control.

The wrath of the other guilds turns toward the combine, but this conflict is exactly what the guild has been preparing for.

Inside were hundreds of well-preserved corpses suffused with a latent necromantic power that Mazirek activated, bringing the corpses back to a shambling semblance of life. This new race of undead is called the Erstwhile (equivalent to the wight in the {@i Monster Manual}).": "Golgari力量平衡的重大转变始于Kraul死亡牧师Mazirek发现一个古老的陵墓群。在城市的深处，在几千年来建立起来的文明层之下，马兹雷克发现了一个被称为Umerilek的隐藏的地窖网络，一个巨大的结构，可以支配一个城市街区。里面有数百具保存完好的尸体，这些尸体充满了潜在的亡灵力量，马兹雷克激活了这些尸体，使其恢复了摇摇欲坠的生命力。这个新的亡灵种族被称为Erstwhile（相当于{@i Monster Manual}中的wight）。",
