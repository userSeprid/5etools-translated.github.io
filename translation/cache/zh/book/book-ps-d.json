	"By the time you read this, you'll have heard news of the forthcoming publication of Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, which I privately refer to as \"Plane Shift: Ravnica.\" That book is the primary reason that this installment of the Plane Shift series is relatively late, because the D&D part of my brain was occupied with working on it. But that book is also the culmination of all the work I've done on this series over the last couple of years. Plane Shift—and your overwhelmingly positive response to it—paved the way for the hardcover Ravnica book, by proving that a D&D/Magic crossover was something that people wanted to see. So your delight and enthusiasm for this pet project is directly responsible for the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica coming later this year. Thank you! When I started working on the D&D team at Wizards of the Coast in 2000, there was already some talk of doing a crossover product between D&D and Magic: The Gathering. At the time, Magic was more or less synonymous with the world of Dominaria. So in a way, this installment of the Plane Shift series is over eighteen years in the making. This work isn't comprehensive, of course. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Dominaria is the definitive resource, but even that book could only scratch the surface of Dominaria. The art book was built on the world guide, and the world guide specifically chose ten regions of the world—two per mana color—as a focus for the card set. Of those ten regions, seven are either located on or around the continent of Aerona or have a significant impact on it. For that reason, I made the decision in this article to focus on the Domains, omitting the regions of Urborg, Shiv, and Yavimaya. I figured that leaving those out would diminish the temptation for characters to circumnavigate a globe that includes so many regions already omitted from the art book. That said, the art book includes a complete map, and the Internet is home to abundant information about Dominaria (especially on {@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}). So if you want to expand your campaign beyond Aerona, you should have little trouble doing so. There's not a lot of rules content in this article, largely because Dominaria is as close as Magic comes to the classic fantasy that D&D draws from. Feel free to make extensive use of class options, monsters, and other parts of the fifth edition D&D rules (which you can {@link find here|https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules}). Once more, thanks for showing so much support for the Plane Shift series, and for making possible the even more exciting projects to come!": "当你读到这篇文章时，你应该已经听说了即将出版的《拉夫尼卡公会指南》的消息，我私下里把它称为 \"位面转移\"。拉夫尼卡\"。那本书是本期 \"位面转移 \"系列相对较晚的主要原因，因为我大脑中的D&D部分都在忙于编写它。但是那本书也是我在过去几年中为这个系列所做的所有工作的顶点。Plane Shift--以及你们对它压倒性的积极反应--为精装版的Ravnica书铺平了道路，证明了D&D/魔法的交叉是人们想要看到的东西。因此，你们对这个宠物项目的喜悦和热情直接导致了今年晚些时候《拉夫尼卡公会会长指南》的出版。谢谢你！\"。当我在2000年开始在Wizards of the Coast的D&D团队工作时，已经有一些关于在D&D和《魔法：聚集》之间做一个交叉产品的讨论。在当时，魔法或多或少是多米尼亚世界的代名词。因此，从某种程度上说，这一期的 \"位面转移 \"系列是经过了十八年的酝酿。当然，这项工作并不全面。一如既往，《魔法：集会-多米尼亚》的艺术是权威的资源，但即使是那本书也只能触及多米尼亚的表面。艺术书是建立在世界指南上的，而世界指南特别选择了世界上的十个地区--每个法力颜色两个--作为卡组的重点。在这十个地区中，有七个位于爱罗纳大陆上或周围，或者对其有重大影响。出于这个原因，我在本文中决定将重点放在领域上，省略了乌尔堡、希夫和亚维马亚等地区。我想，省略这些地区可以减少角色环游地球的诱惑，因为地球上有许多地区已经从美术书中省略了。也就是说，美术书中包含了一张完整的地图，互联网上也有很多关于多米尼亚的信息（特别是在{@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}）。因此，如果你想把你的战役扩展到爱罗娜之外，你应该没有什么困难。本文的规则内容不多，主要是因为多米尼亚是最接近于D&D所借鉴的经典幻想的魔法。请自由地广泛使用类别选项、怪物和第五版D&D规则的其他部分（你可以（%1%））。再次感谢你对 \"位面转换 \"系列的支持，感谢你使更多令人激动的项目成为可能。",
	"Dominaria is an enormous plane, with numerous landmasses separated by vast oceans. This article, though, focuses on the continent of Aerona and its surrounding lands, which are collectively known as the Domains.": "多米尼亚是一个巨大的平面，有无数的陆地被广阔的海洋所分隔。本文主要介绍爱罗娜大陆及其周围的土地，它们被统称为领域。",
	"The continent of Aerona is sharply split between its northern and southern parts, with the division marked by a wide bay and a forbidding mountain range.": "艾罗纳大陆的北部和南部截然分开，分界线是一个宽阔的海湾和一座令人生畏的山脉。",
	"The southern part of Aerona is dominated by {@b Benalia}, the foremost mercantile and military power on Dominaria. It spreads along the western coast and out to the nearby islands, including the Isle of Avenant to the north and much of the Spice Isles to the west. Though most famous for their fertile fields, the lands of Benalia also include old-growth forests, rolling mountains, and a lengthy coastline.": "艾罗纳的南部由{@b Benalia}主导，是多米尼亚最重要的商业和军事力量。它沿西海岸延伸到附近的岛屿，包括北边的阿维南特岛和西边的香料群岛的大部分地区。虽然贝纳利亚的土地以其肥沃的田地而闻名，但也包括古老的森林、连绵的山脉和漫长的海岸线。",
	"The skies above Benalia are dotted with the curved, floating spires of the {@b Church of Serra}, with a heavy concentration of them above Benalia City. In stark contrast to the beneficence of the church, agents of {@b Belzenlok's Cabal} have been infiltrating Benalia from their stronghold to the east, in Urborg.": "贝纳利亚的天空中遍布着{@b Church of Serra}的弯曲、漂浮的尖顶，它们主要集中在贝纳利亚城上方。与教会的仁慈形成鲜明对比的是，(1%)的代理人从他们在东部乌尔堡的据点渗透到了贝纳利亚。",
	"South and east of Benalia lie the impassable tangles of the {@b Llanowar} forest. Llanowar is populated by diverse elven societies that are threatened by the goblins and orcs of the Ironclaw Mountains.": "贝纳利亚的南部和东部是难以通行的{@b Llanowar}森林的纠结。拉诺瓦（Llanowar）的居民是多样化的精灵社会，他们受到铁爪山的地精和兽人的威胁。",
	"Land passage through Benalia to the east coast of Aerona is virtually impossible thanks to the peaks of the Ironclaws, but the Benalish are the preeminent naval power in the region. By informal but frequently reiterated agreement, Benalish ships stay out of the Voda Sea, and the merfolk of {@b Vodalia} allow shipping to pass along Aerona's coastlines largely unhindered. This command of Aerona's southern coasts allows the Benalish to maintain a permanent presence in Sursi on the east coast of the continent.": "由于铁爪峰的存在，通过贝纳里亚到艾罗纳东海岸的陆地通道几乎是不可能的，但贝纳里亚人是该地区最杰出的海军力量。根据非正式但经常重申的协议，贝纳利什的船只不进入沃达海，而{@b Vodalia}的人鱼则允许航运在很大程度上不受阻碍地沿着艾罗纳的海岸线通过。这种对艾罗纳南部海岸的控制使贝纳利什人能够在该大陆东海岸的苏尔西保持长期存在。",
	"To the northeast of Benalia are the Red Iron Mountains, which divide the more sparsely populated northern half of Aerona from the lands to the south. The mountains' native Crookshank kobolds fared poorly during the chaos of the Rift Years, and the mountains are now dotted with Benalish mining settlements.": "贝纳里亚的东北部是红铁山脉，它将人口较稀少的艾罗纳北半部与南部的土地分割开来。在裂变年代的混乱中，山上的原生克罗克桑克哥布林过得很糟糕，现在山上到处都是贝纳利什人的采矿定居点。",
	"To the east, the Red Iron Mountains divide as the continent does, with the Ironcrowns veering off to the south. The northern branch becomes the formidable peaks of the Hurloon Mountains, home of a peaceful but reclusive nation of minotaurs. The occasional Benalish trading mission ventures into Hurloon, but permanent settlements and Serran missionaries are met with open hostility.": "在东部，红铁山脉与大陆一样分界，铁鸦山脉向南偏移。北部分支成为赫伦山脉的可怕山峰，是一个和平但隐居的牛头人国家的家园。偶尔有贝纳利什人的贸易代表团进入休伦山，但永久定居点和塞兰人的传教士会遭到公开的敌视。",
	"The forbidding subcontinent north of Aerona is Icehaven, home to the warrior nation of {@b Keld}. Keldon raiders and Benalish colonists now clash regularly along the west coast of northern Aerona, both seeking to control the relatively narrow stretch of land between the Sea of Avenant and the Whispering Woods to the east.": "艾罗纳北部令人生畏的次大陆是冰港，是{@b Keld}战士国家的家园。凯尔登突袭者和贝纳利什殖民者现在经常在爱罗纳北部的西海岸发生冲突，双方都在寻求控制阿维南特海和东部的低语森林之间相对狭窄的土地。",
	"West of Benalia spreads a vast ocean dotted with islands. The most prominent of the {@b Tolarian Academies}, Tolaria West, is situated in the northwestern Spice Isles. (A second Tolarian Academy is situated on Walassa to the east of Aerona, part of the mercantile empire of Orvada.)": "在贝纳利亚的西部，散布着一片广阔的海洋，上面点缀着许多岛屿。其中最突出的{@b Tolarian Academies}，托拉里亚西，位于香料岛的西北部。(第二所托拉里昂学院位于艾罗纳东部的瓦拉萨，是奥瓦达商业帝国的一部分）。",
	"Benalia is a land of natural and architectural beauty: vast fields of sun-kissed grain crisscrossed by meandering rivers and dotted with cities of white limestone towers and vivid stained glass. One would hardly guess that less than a century before, this great empire was fractured, its people scattered, and its shining capital city a salt-choked ruin. Today, the seven noble houses of Benalia once again rule one of the most prosperous and powerful nations of Dominaria. The Benalish are keenly aware that their New Benalia is in its infancy, with a thousand years of heroic ancestors and tales of bravery to live up to. But they are a diligent people—and proud enough to consider themselves equal to the task.": "贝纳里亚是一片具有自然和建筑之美的土地：广袤的阳光亲吻的谷物田，蜿蜒的河流纵横交错，点缀着白色石灰岩塔楼和鲜艳的彩色玻璃的城市。人们很难想象，在不到一个世纪之前，这个伟大的帝国已经四分五裂，人民四散，其闪亮的首都成为盐碱地上的废墟。今天，贝纳利雅的七个贵族家族再次统治了多米尼亚最繁荣和强大的国家之一。贝纳利什人敏锐地意识到，他们的新贝纳利亚还处于起步阶段，有一千年的英雄祖先和勇敢的故事要去实现。但他们是一个勤奋的民族--而且足够自豪，认为自己能够胜任这项工作。",
	"Benalia is an empire poised for expansion, and many of its greatest heroes are part of its strong and growing array of military forces.": "贝纳利亚是一个准备扩张的帝国，许多最伟大的英雄都是其强大且不断增长的军事力量的一部分。",
	"Usually lawful, often good": "通常是合法的，往往是好的",
	"{@background Acolyte}, {@background Noble}, {@background Sage} (House Tarmula), {@background Sailor} (House Deniz), {@background Soldier}": "{@background Acolyte}, {@background Noble}, {@background Sage}（Tarmula家族）, {@background Sailor}（Deniz家族）, {@background Soldier}",
	"Consider any of the following class options for a Benalish character.": "考虑以下任何一个贝纳利什角色的等级选择。",
	"The priests who march with the armies of Benalia are consecrated by the Serran church—and are technically part of its ecclesiastical hierarchy. In practice, though, they serve more as military officers than as clergy. Benalish clerics inspire their charges to great feats of glory and heroism, bolstering them with the blessings of Serra.": "与贝纳里亚军队一起行军的牧师都是由塞兰教会祝圣的--从技术上讲，他们是教会等级制度的一部分。但实际上，他们更多的是作为军官而不是作为神职人员服务。贝纳利什的教士们激励他们的士兵完成伟大的荣耀和英雄主义壮举，用塞拉的祝福支持他们。",
	"Benalish fighters drawn from the noble houses are often elite knights. They are responsible for security for Benalish lords and their manors, and make up the core of military forces in the field. Noble fighters also serve as officers for the soldiery, but many people from the common classes also rise to officer ranks. Each of the noble houses maintains its own standing army, but several legions of professional soldiers tithed from the different houses make up the backbone of the Benalish fighting force.": "贝纳利什的战士来自贵族家庭，通常是精锐的骑士。他们负责保护贝纳利什领主及其庄园的安全，并构成了战场上军事力量的核心。贵族战士还担任士兵的军官，但许多来自普通阶层的人也能升到军官级别。每个贵族家族都有自己的常备军，但几个由不同家族征收的职业士兵军团构成了贝纳利什战斗力的骨干。",
	"Warriors who combine loyalty to Benalia with devotion to Serra might join the ranks of Benalia's knights if they come from noble blood. This is particularly true of the members of House Capashen, who have a long heritage of worshiping Serra.": "将对贝纳里亚的忠诚与对塞拉的奉献结合起来的勇士，如果他们出身于贵族血统，就可能加入贝纳里亚的骑士行列。卡帕森家族的成员更是如此，他们有着崇拜塞拉的悠久传统。",
	"The leather-clad Benalish warriors known colloquially as \"heroes\" make up a special, renowned class of defender. They are trained from a young age to survive in any environment while operating independently, and they owe their loyalty directly to Benalia City and the Council of Seven.": "穿着皮衣的贝纳利什战士被俗称为 \"英雄\"，构成了一个特殊的、著名的保卫者阶层。他们从小就接受训练，在任何环境下都能独立生存，他们直接对贝纳利雅城和七人议会表示忠诚。",

	"Even within the peaceful Church of Serra, some are called to fight. Soldiers (called acolytes and guardians) serve a largely ceremonial function, protecting the cathedrals of Serra.

Those who are devoted to the Four Virtues of art, discourse, freedom, and peace are more apt to swear the Oath of the Ancients.": "即使在和平的塞拉教会内，也有人被召唤去战斗。士兵（称为圣徒和守护者）在很大程度上发挥着仪式性的作用，保护塞拉的大教堂。但圣骑士们更加世俗化，在整个土地上冒险寻找要打败的邪恶。塞拉的圣骑士们通常会宣誓献身的誓言。那些致力于艺术、话语、自由和和平这四种美德的人，更倾向于宣誓古人的誓言。",

	"The most visible and recognized symbols of the Church of Serra are her angels—both those that were personally created by Serra and those that appeared spontaneously in the Cathedral at Sursi. Some angels live contemplative lives within the cathedrals, but most are active defenders of the faith, protecting Serra's people across the world. Powerful angels often take responsibility for large regions of the world. Lyra, for example, stands as the protector of Benalia, and Shalai plays a similar role in Llanowar. Serra's angels are believed to hear prayers addressed to Serra, and they have an uncanny tendency to arrive exactly when they are needed.": "塞拉教会最明显和公认的象征是她的天使--既有塞拉亲自创造的天使，也有自发出现在苏尔西大教堂的那些天使。一些天使在大教堂内过着沉思的生活，但大多数天使是信仰的积极捍卫者，保护世界各地的塞拉的子民。强大的天使往往负责世界上的大片区域。例如，天琴（Lyra）是贝纳利亚（Benalia）的保护者，沙莱（Shalai）在拉诺瓦（Llanowar）扮演着类似的角色。人们相信塞拉的天使会听到向塞拉发出的祈祷，而且他们有一种不可思议的倾向，即在需要他们的时候准确到达。",

	"As a major force for good in the world, the Church of Serra is more likely to act as a patron for heroic adventurers than as an adversary. That said, even the most well-meaning paladin can take on a villainous nature, either out of misguided zeal or when manipulated by a sinister force. You can use the following tables to help inspire adventure ideas dealing with the Church of Serra.": "作为世界上一股主要的正义力量，塞拉教会更有可能作为英雄冒险家的守护者而不是对手。也就是说，即使是最善意的圣骑士也会因为被误导的热情或被阴险的力量所操纵而具有反派的性质。你可以使用以下表格来帮助激发涉及塞拉教会的冒险想法。",
	"Characters with ties to the Church of Serra might be sent on holy quests by priests or even angels. Alternatively, they might draw on their own pious devotion to undertake a pilgrimage—or a crusade.": "与塞拉教会有联系的人物可能被牧师甚至天使派去进行神圣的任务。另外，他们也可以利用自己的虔诚奉献来进行朝圣--或十字军东征。",

From the Cabal's beginning, spellcasters known as dementists have manipulated the very stuff of nightmares, reshaping reality and creating items and creatures from the parallel realm of \"dementia space.\" Though it has been greatly changed by centuries of hardship, dementia magic remains a powerful asset of the Cabal, and cabalists value prowess with such magic above everything except the favor of Belzenlok.": "Cabalists是统一的狂热者，被痛苦、贪婪和他们痴呆魔法的独特力量折磨得狂热不已。从卡巴尔开始，被称为痴呆症患者的施法者就操纵着噩梦中的东西，重塑现实，并从 \"痴呆症空间 \"的平行领域创造物品和生物。虽然经过几个世纪的艰难困苦，痴呆魔法已经发生了很大的变化，但它仍然是卡巴尔的一项强大的资产，卡巴尔人对这种魔法的重视程度超过了一切，除了对贝尔岑洛克的青睐。",
	"Most members of the Cabal serve it in a religious capacity. Cells of Cabal cultists are found throughout the world, worshiping Belzenlok in secret. Once inducted into the Cabal more formally, cultists shave their heads and become initiates, assisting priests in their dark rites. As Cabal priests rise through the ranks, they dress more ornately, often wearing headgear or high collars that set them apart from initiates. Most Cabal clerics are dementists, and carry with them implements of sacrifice and veneration. But a few are more martial in nature, wielding heavy blades and viewing combat as the most active form of sacrifice to Belzenlok.": "徒党的大多数成员以宗教身份为其服务。世界各地都有卡巴尔崇拜者的小组，他们秘密地崇拜贝尔岑洛克。一旦更正式地加入卡巴尔，崇拜者就会剃光头，成为入门者，协助牧师进行黑暗仪式。随着卡巴尔祭司等级的提高，他们的衣着更加华丽，经常戴着头饰或高领，使他们与入会者不同。大多数卡巴尔神职人员是痴呆症患者，他们随身携带祭祀和敬畏的工具。但也有少数人在本质上更偏向于武术，他们挥舞着沉重的刀剑，将战斗视为对贝尔岑洛克最积极的献祭形式。",

But even the faithful of Freyalise are likely to pray directly to Gaea most days. That said, the druids of Llanowar are not just a religious order.
