	"If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.": "如果一个生物想跳到另一个生物身上，它可以通过抓取来实现。然而，除非魔法赋予抓捕者超自然的力量，否则一个小型或中型生物几乎没有机会成功抓捕一个巨大或巨型生物。",
	"As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the target's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.": "作为一种选择，一个适当大的对手可以被视为地形，以便跳到它的背上或依附于一个肢体。在进行任何必要的能力检查以进入位置并爬上较大的生物之后，较小的生物使用它的行动来进行力量（（%0%））或灵巧（（%1%））检查，并与目标的灵巧（（%2%））检查进行竞争。如果它赢得了比赛，较小的生物就成功地移动到目标生物的空间，较小的生物就会与目标一起移动，并且在对它的攻击卷上有优势。",
	"The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.": "较小的生物可以在较大的生物的空间内移动，将该空间视为困难地形。大型生物攻击小型生物的能力取决于小型生物的位置，并由你决定。较大的生物可以通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）进行检查，并通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）或灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）进行检查，将较小的生物赶走作为一个动作--将它推开，将它刮到墙上，或抓住并扔出去。较小的生物可以选择使用哪种能力。",
	"A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the {@item defender} drops the item.": "一个生物可以使用武器攻击，将武器或其他物品从目标手中击落。攻击者在目标的力量（（%0%））检查或灵巧（（%1%））检查中进行攻击卷的竞争。如果攻击者赢得比赛，攻击不会造成伤害或其他不良影响，但{@item defender}会掉落该物品。",
	"The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.": "如果目标用两只或更多的手拿着该物品，则攻击者在其攻击卷中处于劣势。如果目标比攻击者大，它的能力检查就有优势，如果它小，就有劣势。",
	"This option makes it easier for melee combatants to harry each other with opportunity attacks.": "这个选项使近战战斗人员更容易用机会攻击来骚扰对方。",
	"When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the {@condition incapacitated} condition or the {@spell shocking grasp} spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.": "当一个生物进行近战攻击时，它也可以标记其目标。直到攻击者的下一回合结束，它对被标记的目标所做的任何机会攻击都有优势。机会攻击不会消耗攻击者的反应，但是如果有什么东西，例如{@condition incapacitated}条件或{@spell shocking grasp}咒语，阻止它做出反应的话，攻击者就不能做出攻击。攻击者每回合只能进行一次机会攻击。",
	"When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.": "当一个生物试图穿过一个敌对生物的空间时，移动者可以尝试通过超越敌对生物而强行通过。作为一个行动或额外的行动，移动者做一个力量（（%0%））检查，与敌对生物的力量（（%1%））检查相抗衡。试图超越的生物如果比敌方生物大，则在这个检定上有优势，如果小，则有劣势。如果移动者赢了比赛，它可以在本回合通过敌对生物的空间移动一次。",
	"With this option, a creature uses the special {@action shove} attack from the Player's Handbook to force a target to the side, rather than away. The attacker has disadvantage on its Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check when it does so. If that check is successful, the attacker moves the target 5 feet to a different space within its reach.": "有了这个选项，一个生物会使用《玩家手册》中的特殊（%0%）攻击，将一个目标逼到一边，而不是离开。攻击者这样做时，在其力量（（%1%））检查中处于劣势。如果检定成功，攻击者会将目标移动5英尺到其范围内的不同空间。",
	"A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.": "一个生物可以尝试翻滚通过一个敌对生物的空间，躲避和穿梭过对手。作为一个行动或额外行动，翻滚者做一个灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查，与敌对生物的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查竞争。如果翻滚者赢得比赛，它可以在本回合内通过敌对生物的空间移动一次。",
	"The Eberron campaign setting introduced this concept to reflect characters who are larger-than-life heroes destined for great things.

	"You can spend an action point whenever you roll a {@dice d20} to make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw. You don't have to decide until after you make the roll and learn if it succeeded or failed. If you spend an action point, roll a {@dice d6} and add it to your {@dice d20} result, possibly changing a failure into a success. You can spend only 1 action point per roll.": "每当你掷出{@dice d20}来进行攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力时，你可以花费一个行动点。你不需要决定，直到你做完卷子，知道它是成功还是失败。如果你花了一个行动点，就可以掷出一个{@dice d6}并把它加到你的{@dice d20}结果中，可能会把失败变成成功。你每次滚动只能花费1个行动点。",
	"In addition, whenever you fail a death saving throw, you can spend an action point to make it a success.": "此外，每当你的死亡救赎失败时，你可以花费一个行动点来使其成功。",
	"Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft {@item adamantine armor}, the metal is also used for weapons.": "金刚石是一种在陨石和特殊矿脉中发现的超硬金属。除了用于制作工艺（%0%），这种金属还可用于制作武器。",
	"Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an {@item adamantine weapon|xge} or piece of {@item adamantine ammunition|xge|ammunition} hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.": "由金刚砂制成或涂有金刚砂的近战武器和弹药在用于击碎物体时异常有效。每当{@item adamantine weapon|xge}或{@item adamantine ammunition|xge|ammunition}的碎片击中一个物体时，该命中是一个关键命中。",
	"The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.": "一件近战武器或十件弹药的金刚砂版本比普通版本多花费500金币，无论武器或弹药是由金属制成还是涂有金属。",
	"When adventurers find a piece of technology that isn't from their world or time period, the players might understand what the object is, but the characters rarely will. To simulate a character's ignorance about the technology, have the character make a series of Intelligence checks to figure it out.": "当冒险者发现一件不是他们的世界或时间段的技术时，玩家可能会明白这个东西是什么，但角色很少会明白。为了模拟角色对技术的无知，可以让角色进行一系列的智力检查来弄清它。",
	"To determine how the technology works, a character must succeed on a number of Intelligence checks based on the complexity of the item: two successes for a simple item (such as a cigarette lighter, calculator, or revolver) and four successes for a complex item (such as a computer, chainsaw, or hovercraft). Then consult the Figuring Out Alien Technology table. Consider making the item break if a character fails four or more times before taking a long rest.": "为了确定技术是如何运作的，角色必须根据物品的复杂程度进行智力检查：简单的物品（如打火机、计算器或左轮手枪）需要2次成功，复杂的物品（如电脑、电锯或气垫船）需要4次成功。然后参考《弄清外星人技术》表。如果一个角色在长时间休息之前失败了四次或更多次，可以考虑使该物品失效。",
	"A character who has seen an item used or has operated a similar item has advantage on Intelligence checks made to figure out its use.": "见过某项物品的使用或操作过类似物品的人物在智力检查上有优势，可以弄清其用途。",
	"9 or lower": "9或更低",
	"One failure; one charge or use is wasted, if applicable; character has disadvantage on next check": "一次失败；一次充电或使用被浪费，如果适用的话；人物在下一次检查中处于不利地位",
	"One failure": "一次失败",
	"One success": "一次成功",

	"You might decide to grant one of the following rewards to a 20th-level character, instead of awarding an epic boon. These two options can be awarded to a character more than once.": "你可能会决定授予一个20级的角色以下奖励之一，而不是授予一个史诗般的恩赐。这两个选项可以被授予一个角色一次以上。",
	"The character can increase one ability score by 2 or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The ability score can now be increased above 20, up to a maximum of 30.": "角色可以将一个能力分值增加2，或将两个能力分值各增加1。现在，能力得分可以增加到20分以上，最高可增加到30分。",
	"The character gains a new feat chosen by the player, but subject to your approval.": "角色获得一个新的特技，由玩家选择，但须经你批准。",
	"Sometimes the randomness of a {@dice d20} roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges.": "有时，{@dice d20}卷的随机性导致了可笑的结果。比方说，一扇门需要用DC15的力量检查来击倒。一个力量为20的战士可能会因为糟糕的掷骰子而无助地拍打着门。同时，力量为10的无赖在她的第一次检定中掷出自然的20，将门从铰链上敲下来。",
	"If such results bother you, allow automatic success on checks for characters with high ability scores. Under this optional rule, a character automatically succeeds on any ability check with a DC less than or equal to the relevant ability score minus 5. So in the above example, the fighter would automatically kick in the door. This rule doesn't apply to contests, saving throws, or attack rolls.": "如果这样的结果让你感到困扰，那就允许能力分数高的角色在检查中自动成功。在这个可选的规则下，一个角色在任何能力检查中都会自动成功，其DC值小于或等于相关能力得分减去5。所以在上面的例子中，战士会自动踢门。这条规则并不适用于竞赛、蓄力或攻击卷。",
	"The downside of this approach is its predictability. Once a character's ability score reaches 20, checks of DC 15 and lower using that ability become automatic successes. Smart players will then always try to match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. If you want some risk of failure, you need to set higher DCs. Doing this, though, can merely aggravate the problem you're trying to solve: higher DCs require higher die rolls, and thus rely even more on luck.": "这种方法的缺点是其可预测性。一旦一个角色的能力得分达到20，使用该能力的DC15及以下的检查就会自动成功。聪明的玩家将总是试图让能力得分最高的角色来对付任何特定的检查。如果你想要一些失败的风险，你需要设置更高的DC。不过，这样做只会加剧你想解决的问题：更高的DC需要更高的掷骰子，因此更依赖运气。",
	"You can modify this rule to account for proficiencies using an additional option. If a character can apply a proficiency bonus to the check, he or she automatically succeeds if its DC is less than or equal to the relevant ability score. If you don't mind predictability, and you can resist the temptation to increase DCs, you might find that this variant speeds up play and focuses attention on truly difficult, tense situations.": "你可以用一个额外的选项来修改这个规则，以考虑到熟练程度。如果一个角色可以在检定中应用熟练度奖励，那么如果检定的DC小于或等于相关的能力分数，他或她就自动成功。如果你不介意可预测性，而且你能抵制增加DC的诱惑，你可能会发现这种变体能加快游戏速度，并将注意力集中在真正困难、紧张的情况上。",
	"If your player characters regularly fight hordes of lower-level monsters, consider using this optional rule to help speed up such fights.": "如果你的玩家角色经常与成群结队的低级怪物战斗，可以考虑使用这个可选规则来帮助加快这种战斗。",
	"When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.": "当一次近战攻击将一个未受伤害的生物减少到0点命中率时，该攻击的任何多余伤害可能会转移到附近的另一个生物。攻击者的目标是触手可及的另一个生物，如果原来的攻击卷能够击中它，则将任何剩余的伤害施加于它。如果该生物没有受到伤害，并且同样被降低到0点命中率，则重复这个过程，将剩余的伤害转嫁到它身上，直到没有有效的目标，或者直到转嫁的伤害不能将一个没有受到伤害的生物降低到0点命中率。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations. The Mror dwarves speak Dwarvish and the Aereni elves speak Elvish, but they know Common as the language of trade. In Eberron, there are a number of other languages that serve this role in different regions or cultures. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC to reflect this.": "通用语是五国的语言。摩尔矮人说矮人语，艾瑞尼精灵说精灵语，但他们知道通用语是贸易语言。在Eberron，还有一些其他的语言在不同的地区或文化中起着这种作用。DM可以改变分配给怪物或NPC的语言来反映这一点。",
	"Giant is the common tongue of Xen'drik. It is rarely encountered on Khorvaire. Monsters in Khorvaire usually speak Goblin.": "巨人是Xen'drik的通用语言。在Khorvaire很少遇到。Khorvaire的怪物通常说哥布林语。",
	"Goblin is the common tongue of Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches, along with most \"monstrous\" creatures in Khorvaire. It was the language of the goblin empire that dominated the continent before humanity arrived. Orcish is a dead language; it may be encountered in ancient inscriptions, but modern orcs speak Goblin.": "妖精是达尔古恩（Darguun）、德拉姆（Droaam）和影子牧场（Shadow Marches）的通用语言，以及霍尔韦尔的大多数 \"畸形 \"生物。在人类到来之前，它是统治该大陆的地精帝国的语言。兽人语是一种死亡的语言；它可能在古代的铭文中遇到，但现代兽人说的是哥布林语。",
	"Infernal is spoken by spirits that embody evil. This incorporates Abyssal; all fiends speak a common language. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "无间道是由体现邪恶的精神所讲的。这包含了深渊语；所有的恶魔都说一种共同的语言。无间道有时被称为 \"开伯尔的语言\"，而天道则是 \"西伯利亚人的语言\"。",
	"Riedran is the common tongue of the continent of Sarlona. Quori is spoken by the kalashtar, spirits native to Dal Quor, and the Inspired lords of Riedra.": "里德兰语是萨尔罗纳大陆的通用语言。Kalashtar人说Quori语，他们是Dal Quor的原住民，以及Riedra的Inspired lords。",
	"If a ship moves into the space occupied by a creature or object, it might crash. A ship avoids crashing if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it.": "如果一艘船移动到一个生物或物体所占据的空间，它可能会坠毁。如果生物或物体至少比它小两个尺寸，飞船就能避免坠毁。",
	"When a ship crashes, it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage to its hull based on the size of the creature or object it crashed into, as shown on the Crash Damage table. It also stops moving if the object or creature is bigger than it or one size smaller. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object moves to the nearest unoccupied space that is not in the ship's path. At the DM's discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed": "当一艘船坠毁时，它必须立即进行DC 10宪法救赎。如果救赎失败，它的船体就会受到基于它所撞上的生物或物体大小的伤害，如碰撞伤害表所示。如果物体或生物比它大或小一号，它也会停止移动。否则，飞船会继续移动，而生物或物体则会移动到最近的、不在飞船路径上的未被占据的空间。根据DM的决定，一个被迫移动但固定在原地的物体反而会被摧毁。",
	"A creature struck must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the ship's Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship's size (as shown on the Crash Damage table) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "被击中的生物必须做一个灵巧的蓄力动作，DC等于10+飞船的力量修饰，蓄力失败时受到基于飞船尺寸的伤害（如碰撞伤害表所示），蓄力成功时受到一半的伤害。",

	"House Cannith has an enclave devoted solely to wand production. This facility is equipped with tools that amplify the Mark of Making and channel planar energies; the artisans also have access to a vast array of exotic woods and materials. You can also create a wand, but you're starting from scratch and creating the tools you need. Essentially, when House Cannith creates magic items, it's using factories; while your artificer is the equivalent of the tinkerer working in the garage. You can create magic items, and you can potentially create items that House Cannith can't make... but it's going to take you more time and gold than it takes for them. Here's an overview of the process.": "坎尼斯家族有一块专门用于制作魔杖的飞地。这个设施配备了可以放大 \"制造标记 \"和引导平面能量的工具；工匠们还可以获得大量的奇异木材和材料。你也可以创造一根魔杖，但你要从头开始，创造你需要的工具。从本质上说，当坎尼斯家族创造魔法物品时，它是在使用工厂；而你的工匠则相当于在车库里工作的修理工。你可以创造魔法物品，你也有可能创造坎尼斯家族无法制造的物品......但你需要花费比他们更多的时间和金币。下面是这个过程的概述。",
	"The first step in creating a magic item is to acquire a schema for it. This is the equivalent of a recipe or a blueprint; it explains the process and components required to create the item. If you can obtain a schema—from House Cannith, the mystical library of Arcanix, the collection of an experienced artificer—you're ready to move on. Otherwise, you can create a schema, but this takes time and skill. An arcane spellcaster uses {@skill Arcana} to create schema. A divine caster uses {@skill Religion}, while a druid or ranger relies on {@skill Nature}. You must have a minimum skill bonus—your proficiency bonus plus your ability score bonus—in order to develop a schema. You must maintain the minimum skill bonus for the duration of your work, so an effect that increases an ability score for a few minutes won't help you.": "创造一个魔法物品的第一步是为它获得一个模式。这相当于一个配方或蓝图；它解释了创造物品的过程和所需的组件。如果你能从坎尼斯家族、阿卡尼克斯的神秘图书馆、有经验的工匠的收藏中获得一个图式，你就可以继续前进了。否则，你可以创造一个模式，但这需要时间和技巧。一个奥术施法者使用（%0%）来创建模式。神圣的施法者使用（1%），而德鲁伊或游侠则依靠（2%）。你必须有一个最低的技能奖励--你的熟练度奖励加上你的能力得分奖励--才能开发一个图式。你必须在你工作的持续时间内保持最低的技能加成，所以一个增加能力得分几分钟的效果不会对你有帮助。",

	"This ability to develop a schema represents remarkable talent. It could take House Cannith years or decades to develop a particular schema; the fact that you can accomplish this in weeks reflects the idea that player characters are innovators. However, it is always up to the DM to decide if you can create a particular schema. The DM can always choose to exclude a particular magic item from a campaign.": "这种开发模式的能力代表了非凡的才能。坎尼斯家族可能需要花费数年或数十年的时间来开发一个特定的模式；你可以在数周内完成这一任务，这反映了玩家角色是创新者的想法。然而，你是否能够创造一个特定的模式，总是由DM来决定的。DM总是可以选择将某个特定的魔法物品排除在活动之外。",
	"Any magic item requires specialized materials—Eberron dragonshards, rare woods or metals, exotic herbs or other substances. While exotic, these things can be purchased or obtained in any major city. But creating a magic item from scratch often requires rarer components that can't simply be purchased. You might need a flower from Thelanis, a feather from a couatl, or the scale of a dragon. More often than not, such this will require an adventure. You may not have to kill something to obtain what you need, but you'll surely have to overcome a challenge. The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests how difficult that challenge could be.": "任何魔法物品都需要专门的材料--艾伯伦龙石、稀有木材或金属、异国草药或其他物质。虽然很奇特，但这些东西可以在任何大城市购买或获得。但是从头开始创造一个魔法物品往往需要更稀有的部件，而这些部件是无法简单购买的。你可能需要一朵来自Thelanis的花，一根来自couatl的羽毛，或者一个龙的鳞片。更多时候，这样的事情需要冒险。你可能不需要杀死什么东西来获得你需要的东西，但你肯定要克服一个挑战。魔法物品成分表显示了这种挑战的难度。",
	"It's possible to find a rare component even when you're not looking for one. You could discover an exotic Khyber crystal in the ruins of an artificer's workshop. Time and study could yield suggestions as to what items could be made with the component; for example, that Khyber shard could be used to create an {@item iron flask} or {@item dimensional shackles}.": "即使在你没有寻找的时候，也有可能找到一个罕见的组件。你可以在一个工匠作坊的废墟中发现一块奇特的开伯尔水晶。时间和研究可以产生一些建议，告诉你用这种成分可以制作什么物品；例如，那个开伯尔的碎片可以用来制作一个（%0%）或（%1%）。",
	"Once you have your schema and any rare components, you're ready to begin. The DM can assign skills or tools that are required for this act of creation, so that it requires both proficiency and access to these tools.

And you must spend a significant amount of time working on it; creating a legendary item can take a year of effort!": "一旦你有了你的模式和任何罕见的组件，你就可以开始了。DM可以指定这种创造行为所需的技能或工具，使之既需要熟练掌握，又能获得这些工具。你必须支付制造该物品所需的材料和服务的基本费用。而且你必须花大量的时间来做这件事；创造一个传奇物品可能需要一年的努力！\"。",
	"The Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table provides a basic framework, but various factors could reduce time or cost. Eberron dragonshards are a significant amount of the cost of materials. A remarkable dragonshard could reduce the cost of creating an item by 10 percent. A planar convergence could reduce the time or cost required to make an item with an effect tied to that plane. Ultimately, this is a story, and there are exceptions to every rule.": "魔法物品制作的时间和成本表提供了一个基本框架，但各种因素都可以减少时间或成本。Eberron的龙石是材料成本的重要部分。一个杰出的龙石可以将制作物品的成本降低10%。一个平面聚合可以减少制作一个具有与该平面相关的效果的物品所需的时间或成本。归根结底，这是一个故事，每个规则都有例外。",
	"These rules for magic item creation are derived from the system presented in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. This also offers the idea that the creation of a magic item is a complex procedure and that complications can arise.

Xanathar's Guide presents a number of possible complications. Here are few tied to Eberron.": "这些关于魔法物品创造的规则来自于《Xanathar万物指南》中介绍的系统。这也提供了一个想法，即魔法物品的创造是一个复杂的程序，可能会出现并发症。如果你使用这个规则，在制作物品时每花五个工作周就有（%0%）的机会出现并发症。Xanathar的指南提出了许多可能的并发症。这里有几个与Eberron相关的。",

It works as a sorting mechanism, providing a big-picture assessment of which creatures, factions, and NPCs make natural allies or enemies.": "结盟是对角色和怪物的一般态度的一个方便的标签。它是一种分类机制，为哪些生物、派别和NPC是天然的盟友或敌人提供了一种大局观的评估。",
	"The standard alignment system embraces the fundamental points of tension in D&D: the struggle between good and evil on the one hand, and the conflict between law and chaos on the other. The nice thing about this arrangement is that it allows for tension even within a good-aligned party. The law—chaos divide means that characters can still disagree on how to promote good in the world.": "标准排列系统包含了D&D中的基本紧张点：一方面是善与恶的斗争，另一方面是法律与混乱的冲突。这种安排的好处是，它甚至允许在善的一方内部出现紧张。法律与混乱的分界线意味着角色们仍然可以在如何促进世界上的善上产生分歧。",
	"Alignment is meant to serve only as a quick summary of a character, not a rigid definition. It's a starting point, but elements such as flaws and bonds paint a much more detailed picture of a character's identity.": "结盟的目的只是作为一个角色的快速总结，而不是一个僵硬的定义。它是一个起点，但诸如缺陷和纽带等元素会对一个角色的身份进行更详细的描述。",
	"You might find that the alignment choices of good and evil, law and chaos are too abstract for your campaign. You might prefer attitudes that are more nuanced, without the implicit demarcation of heroes as good-aligned creatures and villains as evil-aligned ones. A simple solution is to discard alignment in favor of an alternative system that brings the key conflicts in your campaign to the forefront.": "你可能会发现，善与恶、法律与混乱的结盟选择对你的活动来说太抽象了。你可能更喜欢更细微的态度，没有隐含的英雄是善的，反派是恶的的划分。一个简单的解决方案是放弃结盟，而采用另一种系统，将你的战役中的关键冲突带到最前面。",

Forming one alignment path are the opposing forces of life and death. Like the choice of good or evil, this conflict defines the setting, and you would expect most player characters to be aligned to life or at least neutral with respect to their support for the necromancers' plans.": "例如，想象一下这样一个战役背景：一个死灵法师集团设计的生态危机威胁到将世界变成一片死亡的荒地。形成一个排列组合的路径是生命和死亡的对立力量。就像善或恶的选择一样，这种冲突定义了这个环境，你会期望大多数玩家角色与生命结盟，或者至少在支持死灵法师的计划方面保持中立。",
	"The second conflict path might be preservation versus destruction. People who have gathered to protect the land might disagree on whether to attack and destroy the necromancers, or to work instead at strengthening the natural order so that not even the necromancers' power can overwhelm it.": "第二条冲突路径可能是保护与破坏。聚集在一起保护土地的人们可能会在是否攻击和摧毁死灵法师上产生分歧，或者转而努力加强自然秩序，以便连死灵法师的力量都无法压倒它。",
	"For grittier games that avoid obvious classifications of good versus bad, you might create alignment paths with more than two choices. In a game that focuses on intrigue and power struggles, for example, alignment might be a quick reference for which factions a character supports. One element of a character's alignment might indicate his or her affiliation with a noble house or guild. A second element could call out which deity or pantheon the character is tied to.": "对于那些避免明显的好与坏分类的比较狡猾的游戏，你可以创建有两个以上选择的结盟路径。例如，在一个专注于阴谋和权力斗争的游戏中，结盟可能是一个角色支持哪个派系的快速参考。一个角色的排列组合的一个元素可能表明他或她与某个贵族家族或公会的关系。第二个元素可以指出该角色与哪个神灵或万神殿有联系。",
	"When creating your alignment system, think about the role of neutrality, and decide whether there's a midpoint for any alignment path. Neutral creatures might choose to sit out a struggle (as is often the case in good versus evil) or see strengths in both approaches (as in law versus chaos). The role of this choice in your campaign should make sense in terms of your central conflict.": "在创建你的对准系统时，考虑中立的作用，并决定是否有一个任何对准路径的中点。中立的生物可能会选择置身于一场斗争之外（正如善与恶的斗争中经常出现的情况），或者看到两种方法的优势（如法律与混乱）。这种选择在你的活动中的作用应该在你的中心冲突方面有意义。",
	"At your Dungeon Master's option, you can use this variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.": "在你的地下城主的选择下，你可以使用这个变体来决定你的能力分数。这里描述的方法允许你用一套你单独选择的能力分数来建立一个角色。",
	"You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs 7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with, before applying racial increases. You can't have a score lower than 8.": "你有27点可以花在你的能力分数上。每个分数的花费都显示在能力得分点花费表中。例如，一个14分的分数需要7分。使用这种方法，15分是你在应用种族增加之前可以得到的最高能力分数。你不能有一个低于8分的分数。",
	"This method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between those extremes.": "这种确定能力分数的方法使你能够创建一组三个高的数字和三个低的数字（15，15，15，8，8，8），一组高于平均水平且几乎相等的数字（13，13，13，12，12，12），或者在这些极端之间的任何一组数字。",
	"Alternatively, see the ": "另外，请看",
	"At 1st level, you choose various aspects of your character, including ability scores, race, class, and background. Together these elements help paint a picture of your character's origin and give you the ability to create many different types of characters. Despite that versatility, a D&D race that has the Ability Score Increase trait includes little or no choice—a lack that can make it difficult to realize certain character concepts. The following subsections address that lack by adding choice to your character's race if it includes the Ability Score Increase trait, allowing you to customize your ability scores, languages, and certain proficiencies to fit the origin you have in mind for your character. Character race in the game represents your character's fantasy species, combined with certain cultural assumptions. The following options step outside those assumptions to pave the way for truly unique characters.": "在1级时，你可以选择你的角色的各个方面，包括能力分数、种族、等级和背景。这些元素共同帮助描绘了你的角色的起源，并使你有能力创造许多不同类型的角色。尽管有这种多功能性，但具有能力分数增加特性的D&D种族几乎没有任何选择--这种缺乏会使你难以实现某些角色概念。下面的小节解决了这一问题，如果你的种族包括能力分值增加的特性，你就可以在你的种族中增加选择，允许你定制你的能力分值、语言和某些能力，以适应你对角色的想法。游戏中的角色种族代表你的角色的幻想物种，与某些文化假设相结合。以下选项跳出了这些假设，为真正独特的角色铺平了道路。",
	"The Ability Score Increase trait in a race reflects an archetypal bit of excellence in the adventurers of this kind in D&D's past. For example, if you're a dwarf, your Constitution increases by 2, because dwarf heroes in D&D are often exceptionally tough. This increase doesn't apply to every dwarf, just to dwarf adventurers, and it exists to reinforce an archetype. That reinforcement is appropriate if you want to lean into the archetype, but it's unhelpful if your character doesn't conform to the archetype.": "一个种族的能力值增加特质反映了D&D过去这类冒险家的一个典型的优秀点。例如，如果你是一个矮人，你的体质会增加2，因为D&D中的矮人英雄往往是非常强悍的。这种增加并不适用于每个矮人，只适用于矮人冒险者，它的存在是为了加强一种原型。如果你想向原型靠拢，这种强化是合适的，但如果你的角色不符合原型，它就没有帮助了。",
	"If you'd like your character to follow their own path, you may ignore your Ability Score Increase trait and assign ability score increases tailored to your character. Here's how to do it: take any ability score increase you gain in your race or subrace and apply it to an ability score of your choice. If you gain more than one increase, you can't apply those increases to the same ability score, and you can't increase a score above 20.": "如果你想让你的角色走自己的路，你可以忽略你的能力分值增加特性，为你的角色量身定做能力分值增加。具体做法是：将你在你的种族或次种族中获得的任何能力分值增加，应用于你选择的能力分值。如果你获得了一个以上的提高，你不能将这些提高应用于同一个能力分数上，而且你不能将一个分数提高到20以上。",
	"For example, if the Ability Score Increase trait of your race or subrace increases your Constitution by 2 and your Wisdom by 1, you could instead increase your Intelligence by 2 and your Charisma by 1.": "例如，如果你的种族或亚种的能力得分增加特性使你的体质增加2，智慧增加1，你可以改为使你的智力增加2，魅力增加1。",
	"If your character's race has the Languages trait, that trait includes languages that your character is assumed to know, usually Common and the language of your ancestors. For example, a halfling adventurer is assumed to know Common and Halfling. Here's the thing: D&D adventurers are extraordinary, and your character might have grown up speaking languages different from the ones in your Languages trait.": "如果你的角色的种族有语言特质，该特质包括你的角色被认为会的语言，通常是普通话和你祖先的语言。例如，一个半身人冒险家被认为会普通话和半身人。问题是：D&D的冒险家是非同寻常的，你的角色可能在成长过程中讲的语言与你的语言特征中的语言不同。",
	"To customize the languages you know, you may replace each language in your Languages trait with a language from the following list: Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.": "要自定义你所知道的语言，你可以从以下列表中用一种语言替换你语言特质中的每一种语言。Abyssal, Celestial, Common, Deep Speech, Draconic, Dwarvish, Elvish, Giant, Gnomish, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, Orc, Primordial, Sylvan, or Undercommon.",
	"Your DM may add or remove languages from that list, depending on what languages are appropriate for your campaign.": "你的DM可以从该列表中添加或删除语言，这取决于什么语言适合你的活动。",
	"Some races that include the Ability Score Increase trait also grant proficiencies. These proficiencies are usually cultural, and your character might not have any connection with the culture in question or might have pursued different training. You can replace each of those proficiencies with a different one of your choice, following the restrictions on the Proficiency Swaps table.": "一些包含能力分值增加特质的种族也会授予熟练度。这些能力通常是文化性的，而你的角色可能与该文化没有任何联系，或者可能接受了不同的训练。你可以用你选择的不同能力来替换这些能力，但要遵循能力互换表上的限制。",

	"Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, which can influence roleplaying and how the characters interact with them, but doesn't come with a guarantee of help.": "一旦一个联络人帮助或阻碍了一个角色，这个角色就需要再次进行狂欢以重新获得NPC的好感。一个联络人只提供一次帮助，而不是终生帮助。联系人保持友好，这可以影响角色扮演和角色与他们的互动，但并不保证会得到帮助。",
	"You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if that character doesn't come into play.": "你可以指定特定的NPC作为联系人。你可以决定让Wretched Gorgon的酒吧老板和驻扎在西门的一个警卫成为角色的盟友联系人。指定特定的NPC为玩家提供具体的选择。它为战役带来了活力，并在该地区播下了角色关心的NPC的种子。另一方面，它可能会被证明是难以追踪的，而且如果该角色不出现，可能会使联系人失去作用。",
	"Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC into a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.": "另外，你也可以让玩家在狂欢之后，当场让一个NPC成为联系人。当角色在他们狂欢的地区时，玩家可以消耗一个盟友联系人，并指定他们遇到的一个NPC为联系人，假设这个NPC根据角色的狂欢方式属于正确的社会等级。玩家应该为这种关系提供一个合理的解释，并将其纳入游戏中。",
	"Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.": "混合使用这两种方法是一个好主意，因为它给你增加了特定联系人的深度，同时给玩家自由，以确保他们积累的联系人是有用的。",
	"The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or dramatic moment.": "同样的过程可以适用于敌对的接触。你可以给角色一个他们应该避免的特定NPC，或者你可以在一个不恰当的或戏剧性的时刻引入一个NPC。",
	"At any time, a character can have a maximum number of unspecified allied contacts equal to 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit—only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.": "在任何时候，一个角色都可以拥有最多不指定的盟友联系人，其数量等于1+该角色的魅力修改器（最小为1）。具体的、有名字的联系人不计入这个限制，只有那些可以在任何时候用来宣布一个NPC为联系人的联系人。",

	"The creation of a magic item is a lengthy, expensive task. To start, a character must have a formula that describes the construction of the item. The character must also be a spellcaster with spell slots and must be able to cast any spells that the item can produce. Moreover, the character must meet a level minimum determined by the item's rarity, as shown in the Crafting Magic Items table. For example, a 3rd-level character could create a {@item wand of magic missiles} (an uncommon item), as long as the character has spell slots and can cast {@spell magic missile}. That same character could make a {@item +1 weapon} (another uncommon item), no particular spell required.": "创造一件魔法物品是一项漫长而昂贵的任务。首先，一个角色必须有一个描述该物品构造的公式。该角色还必须是一个拥有法术槽的施法者，并且必须能够施展该物品所能产生的任何法术。此外，该角色必须达到由物品的稀有性决定的最低等级，如制作魔法物品表所示。例如，一个3级的角色可以制造一个{@item wand of magic missiles}（一种不常见的物品），只要该角色有法术槽并能施放{@spell magic missile}。同样的人物可以制造一个{@item +1 weapon}（另一个不常见的物品），不需要特别的法术。",
	"You can decide that certain items also require special materials or locations to be created.

	"An item has a creation cost specified in the Crafting Magic Items table. A character engaged in the crafting of a magic item makes progress in 25 gp increments, spending that amount for each day of work until the total cost is paid. The character is assumed to work for 8 hours each of those days. Thus, creating an uncommon magic item takes 20 days and 500 gp. You are free to adjust the costs to better suit your campaign.": "一个物品的创造成本在制作魔法物品表中有规定。一个从事魔法物品制作的角色以25GP为单位取得进展，每工作一天就花掉25GP，直到付清总成本。假设该角色在这些天里每天工作8小时。因此，制造一个不常见的魔法物品需要20天和500金币。你可以自由调整费用，以更好地适应你的活动。",
	"If a spell will be produced by the item being created, the creator must expend one spell slot of the spell's level for each day of the creation process. The spell's material components must also be at hand throughout the process. If the spell normally consumes those components, they are consumed by the creation process. If the item will be able to produce the spell only once, as with a {@item spell scroll}, the components are consumed only once by the process. Otherwise, the components are consumed once each day of the item's creation.": "如果被创造的物品会产生一个法术，创造者必须在创造过程的每一天消耗一个法术等级的法术槽。在整个过程中，法术的材料成分也必须在手边。如果该法术通常会消耗这些成分，那么它们会在创造过程中被消耗掉。如果该物品只能产生一次法术，就像{@item spell scroll}一样，那么组件只被这个过程消耗一次。否则，这些成分在物品创造的每一天都会被消耗一次。",

	"You can award a formula in place of a magic item. Usually written in a book or on a scroll, a formula is one step rarer than the item it allows a character to create. For example, the formula for a common magic item is uncommon. No formulas exist for legendary items.": "你可以授予一个公式来代替一个魔法物品。通常写在书上或卷轴上，配方比它允许角色创造的物品更稀有。例如，一个普通魔法物品的配方是不常见的。不存在传奇物品的配方。",
	"If the creation of magic items is commonplace in your campaign, a formula can have a rarity that matches the rarity of the item it allows a character to create. Formulas for common and uncommon items might even be for sale, each with a cost double that of its magic item.": "如果魔法物品的创造在你的活动中很常见，那么配方的稀有程度可以与它允许角色创造的物品的稀有程度相匹配。普通和不普通物品的配方甚至可以出售，每个配方的成本是其魔法物品的两倍。",
	"A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.": "一个有时间、金钱和所需工具的角色可以利用停工时间来制作盔甲、武器、衣服或其他种类的非魔法装备。",
	"In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 50 gp or lower. Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.": "除了要制作的物品所需的适当工具外，角色还需要价值为物品销售成本一半的原材料。要确定制作一件物品需要多少个工作周，请将其金币成本除以50。一个角色可以在一个工作周内完成多个物品，如果这些物品的总成本是50金币或更低。成本超过50金币的物品可以在更长的时间内完成，只要把正在进行的工作存放在一个安全的地方。",
	"Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item.

	"Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.": "创造一件魔法物品需要的不仅仅是时间、努力和材料。这是一个长期的过程，需要一次或多次冒险来追踪稀有材料和创造物品所需的传说。",

	"It's possible for the characters to start a campaign at 1st level, dive into an epic story, and reach 10th level and beyond in a short amount of game time. Although that pace works fine for many campaigns, some DMs prefer a campaign story with pauses built into it—times when adventurers are not going on adventures. The downtime rules given in this section can be used as alternatives to the approach in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, or you can use the material here to inspire the creation of your own options.": "角色有可能从1级开始活动，潜入一个史诗般的故事，并在很短的游戏时间内达到10级或更高。虽然这种节奏对许多战役来说都很好，但有些DM更喜欢有停顿的战役故事--当冒险者不进行冒险的时候。本节给出的停顿时间规则可以作为《玩家手册》和《地下城管理员指南》中的方法的替代方案，或者你可以使用这里的材料来激发你创建自己的方案。",
	"By engaging the characters in downtime activities that take weeks or even months to complete, you can give your campaign a longer time line—one in which events in the world play out over years.

	"Rivals are NPCs who oppose the characters and make their presence felt whenever the characters are engaging in downtime. A rival might be a villain you have featured in past adventures or plan to use in the future. Rivals can also include good or neutral folk who are at odds with the characters, whether because they have opposing goals or they simply dislike one another. The cultist of Orcus whose plans the characters have foiled, the ambitious merchant prince who wants to rule the city with an iron fist, and the nosy high priest of Helm who is convinced the characters are up to no good are all examples of rivals.": "敌人是反对角色的NPC，每当角色在休息时，他们就会出现。一个对手可能是你在过去的冒险中出现过的或计划在未来使用的一个反派。竞争对手也可以包括与角色不和的好人或中立人士，无论是因为他们有相反的目标，还是仅仅因为他们彼此不喜欢对方。角色挫败了奥库斯邪教的计划，野心勃勃的商人王子想用铁拳统治城市，多管闲事的赫尔姆大祭司确信角色不怀好意，这些都是对手的例子。",
	"A rival's agenda changes over time. Though the characters engage in downtime only between adventures, their rivals rarely rest, continuing to spin plots and work against the characters even when the characters are off doing something else.": "竞争对手的议程随着时间的推移而变化。虽然人物只在冒险之间进行停顿，但他们的对手却很少休息，即使人物在做其他事情时，他们也会继续策划阴谋，与人物作对。",
	"In essence, a rival is a somewhat specialized NPC. You can use chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to build a new NPC for this purpose, or pick one from your current cast of supporting characters and embellish that NPC as described below.": "从本质上讲，对手是一个有点特殊的NPC。你可以使用《地下城管理指南》第4章来建立一个新的NPC，或者从你目前的辅助人物中挑选一个，然后按照下面的描述来美化这个NPC。",
	"It's possible for the characters to have two or three rivals at a time, each with a separate agenda. At least one should be a villain, but the others might be neutral or good; conflicts with those rivals might be social or political, rather than manifesting as direct attacks.": "人物有可能同时有两到三个对手，每个对手都有独立的议程。至少有一个是反派，但其他的可能是中立的或善良的；与这些对手的冲突可能是社会或政治的，而不是表现为直接攻击。",
	"The best rivals have a connection with their adversaries on a personal level. Find links in the characters' backstories or the events of recent adventures that explain what sparked the rival's actions. The best trouble to put the characters in is trouble they created for themselves.": "最好的对手与他们的对手在个人层面上有联系。从人物的背景故事或最近的冒险事件中找到联系，解释是什么引发了对手的行动。让人物陷入的最好的麻烦是他们为自己制造的麻烦。",

	"An effective rival has a clear reason for interfering with the characters' lives. Think about what the rival wants, how and why the characters stand in the way, and how the conflict could be resolved. Ideally, a rival's goal directly involves the characters or something they care about.": "一个有效的对手有一个明确的理由来干扰人物的生活。想一想对手想要什么，人物如何以及为什么要阻挠他，以及如何解决冲突。理想的情况是，对手的目标直接涉及人物或他们所关心的事物。",
	"Think about the resources the rival can marshal. Does the character have enough money to pay bribes or to hire a small gang of mercenaries? Does the rival hold sway over any guilds, temples, or other groups? Make a list of the rival's assets, and consider how they can be used.": "想一想对手可以调动的资源。这个角色是否有足够的钱来支付贿赂或雇佣一小群雇佣兵？竞争对手是否对任何行会、寺庙或其他团体有影响力？列出对手的资产清单，并考虑如何利用它们。",
	"The foundation of a rival's presence in the campaign is the actions the rival takes or the events that occur as a result of that character's goals. Each time you resolve one or more workweeks of downtime, pick one of the ways a rival's plans might be advanced and introduce it into play.": "一个对手在战役中存在的基础是对手采取的行动或因该角色的目标而发生的事件。每次你解决了一个或多个工作周的停工期，就从对手的计划中挑选一种可能被推进的方式，将其引入游戏。",
	"Think about how a rival might operate in order to bring specific plans to fruition, and jot down three or four kinds of actions the rival might undertake. Some of these might be versions of the downtime activities described later in this section, but these are more often efforts that are specific to the rival.": "想一想对手可能如何运作以实现具体的计划，并记下对手可能采取的三或四种行动。其中一些可能是本节后面描述的停工活动的版本，但这些往往是对手的具体努力。",
	"A rival's action might be a direct attack, such as an assassination attempt, that you play out during a session. Or it might be a background activity that you describe as altering the campaign in some way. For example, a rival who wants to increase the prestige of the temple of a war god might hold a festival with drink, food, and gladiatorial games. Even if the characters aren't directly involved, the event becomes the talk of the town.": "竞争对手的行动可能是一个直接的攻击，例如暗杀企图，你在会议期间进行。它也可能是一个背景活动，你把它描述为以某种方式改变战役。例如，一个想要提高战神庙宇威望的对手可能会举办一个有饮料、食物和角斗士游戏的节日。即使人物没有直接参与，这个活动也会成为全镇的话题。",
	"Some elements of a rival's plans might involve events in the world that aren't under the rival's control. Whether such an event can be easily anticipated or not, the rival's plans might include contingencies for taking advantage of such happenings.": "竞争对手计划中的一些内容可能涉及到世界上不在竞争对手控制之下的事件。无论这样的事件是否可以轻易预见，对手的计划可能包括利用这种事件的应急措施。",
	"Downtime activities are tasks that usually take a workweek (5 days) or longer to perform. These tasks can include buying or creating magic items, pulling off crimes, and working at a job. A character selects a downtime activity from among those available and pays the cost of that activity in time and money. You, as DM, then follow the rules for the activity to resolve it, informing the player of the results and any complications that ensue.": "闲暇活动是指通常需要一个工作周（5天）或更长时间才能完成的任务。这些任务可以包括购买或创造魔法物品，实施犯罪，以及工作。一个角色从现有的活动中选择一个停工活动，并支付该活动的时间和金钱成本。你，作为管理人，然后按照该活动的规则来解决它，将结果和随之而来的任何复杂情况通知玩家。",
	"Consider handling downtime away from the game table. For example, you could have the players pick their downtime activities at the end of a session, and then communicate about them by email or text, until you next see them in person.": "考虑在远离游戏桌的地方处理停工时间。例如，你可以让玩家在会议结束时选择他们的休息时间活动，然后通过电子邮件或文本进行沟通，直到你下次见到他们本人。",
	"The description of each activity tells you how to resolve it. Many activities require an ability check, so be sure to note the character's relevant ability modifiers. Follow the steps in the activity, and determine the results.": "每项活动的描述告诉你如何解决它。许多活动需要进行能力检查，所以一定要注意角色的相关能力修正值。按照活动的步骤进行，并确定结果。",
	"Most downtime activities require a workweek (5 days) to complete. Some activities require days, weeks (7 days), or months (30 days). A character must spend at least 8 hours of each day engaged in the downtime activity for that day to count toward the activity's completion.": "大多数停机活动需要一个工作周（5天）来完成。有些活动需要几天，几周（7天），或几个月（30天）。一个角色每天必须花至少8个小时从事停工活动，才能算作活动的完成。",
	"The days of an activity don't need to be consecutive; you can spread them over a longer period of time than is required for the activity. But that period of time should be no more than twice as long as the required time; otherwise you should introduce extra complications (see below) and possibly double the activity's costs to represent the inefficiency of the character's progress.": "一项活动的天数不需要连续，你可以把它们分散在比活动所需时间更长的时间段内。但这段时间不应超过所需时间的两倍；否则你应该引入额外的复杂因素（见下文），并可能使活动的费用翻倍，以代表角色进展的低效率。",
	"The description of each activity includes a discussion of complications you can throw at the characters. The consequences of a complication might spawn entire adventures, introduce NPCs to vex the party, or give the characters headaches or advantages in any number of other ways.": "每项活动的描述都包括对你可以向角色抛出的复杂情况的讨论。复杂情况的后果可能会引发整个冒险，引入NPC来困扰当事人，或者以任何其他方式让角色感到头痛或有利。",
	"Each of these sections has a table that offers possible complications. You can roll to determine a complication randomly, pick one from the table, or devise one of your own, and then share it with the player.": "每个部分都有一个表格，提供可能的复杂情况。你可以通过掷骰子来随机决定一个复杂情况，从表中挑选一个，或者自己设计一个，然后与玩家分享。",
	"The following activities are suitable for any character who can afford to pursue them. As DM, you have the final say on which activities are available to the characters. The activities you allow might depend on the nature of the area where the characters are located. For example, you might disallow the creation of magic items or decide that the characters are in a town that is too isolated from major markets for them to buy such items.": "以下活动适合于任何有能力从事这些活动的角色。作为DM，你对角色可以参加哪些活动有最终决定权。你所允许的活动可能取决于角色所在地区的性质。例如，你可能不允许创造魔法物品，或者决定人物所在的城镇与主要市场过于隔绝，使他们无法购买此类物品。",
	"See the following entries for details:": "详见以下条目。",
	"If you do want to add elements of Emrakul's madness to your campaign, use the {@variantrule New Ability Scores: Honor and Sanity||Sanity} score rules in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Allow characters to make Sanity checks to interpret the effects of Emrakul's corruption, and Sanity saving throws to resist the effects of the spreading madness.": "如果你确实想在你的战役中加入埃姆拉库尔的疯狂元素，请使用《地下城主指南》第九章中的（%0%）得分规则。允许角色进行理智检查来解释埃姆拉库尔的堕落效果，并进行理智判断来抵御疯狂蔓延的影响。",
	"A creature or character whose Sanity score is below 10 can begin to manifest signs of physical corruption, which progresses in stages.": "如果一个生物或角色的理智评分低于10分，就会开始表现出身体腐败的迹象，这将分阶段进行。",
	"Even before Emrakul's arrival, some cultists and those who pried too deep into dark secrets begin to change. In this early stage, physical proportions shift, with one or more of the creature's limbs or some part of the face growing larger, almost always asymmetrically. Noticeable skin blemishes can also appear, most often as boils or clumps of cauliflower-like growths (though these do not yet resemble the lattice of Emrakul's flesh). Creature statistics are unchanged.": "甚至在埃姆拉库尔到来之前，一些邪教徒和那些窥探黑暗秘密太深的人就开始发生变化。在这个早期阶段，身体比例发生了变化，一个或多个生物的四肢或脸部的某些部分变大，几乎总是不对称的。明显的皮肤瑕疵也会出现，最常见的是疖子或菜花状的生长物（尽管这些还不像埃姆拉库尔的肉格）。生物的统计数据没有变化。",
	"In the second stage, a creature can develop a dead or bulging eye, huge tumorous growths, curled hands or feet, violent palsy, oozing secretions from the skin or eyes, raw red patches on the skin, and similar deformities. Patches of lattice-like growths often appear on the skin. In some cases, particularly in Nephalia, cultists begin to manifest distinctly fishlike features—goggling eyes, scaled or slimy skin, webbing between the fingers or toes, or gill-like flaps on the face or neck. Creature statistics remain unchanged.": "在第二阶段，生物可以出现死眼或凸出的眼睛，巨大的肿瘤性生长，手或脚卷曲，剧烈麻痹，皮肤或眼睛有渗出的分泌物，皮肤上有生的红色斑块，以及类似的畸形。皮肤上经常出现成片的格子状生长。在某些情况下，特别是在尼法利亚，邪教徒开始表现出明显的鱼形特征--眼睛瞪得大大的，皮肤上有鳞片或黏糊糊的，手指或脚趾间有蹼，或脸上或脖子上有鳃状的皮瓣。生物的统计数据保持不变。",
	"In the third stage, the lips shrink away from the teeth, which can rot and fall out. Fingers and toes sometimes fuse together or start transforming into tentacles. Bleeding sores erupt on the skin, or bulbous growths can appear under the skin. Cultists in Nephalia often grow finlike protrusions or pincerlike hands. At this stage, creatures might manifest improved natural armor or weapons, or simple benefits such as the Amphibious trait of a {@creature bullywug}, the Blind Senses of a {@creature grimlock}, Chameleon Skin like a {@creature troglodyte}, the Slippery trait of a {@creature kuo-toa}, or the Spider Climb trait of an {@creature ettercap}.": "在第三阶段，嘴唇从牙齿上缩走，牙齿会腐烂和脱落。手指和脚趾有时会融合在一起，或开始转变为触角。皮肤上会出现出血的溃疡，或者在皮肤下出现球状的生长物。尼法利亚的崇拜者经常长出鳍状突起或钳状手。在这个阶段，生物可能会表现出改进的天然盔甲或武器，或简单的好处，如{@creature bullywug}的两栖特性，{@creature grimlock}的盲觉，{@creature troglodyte}的变色龙皮肤，{@creature kuo-toa}的滑溜特性，或{@creature ettercap}的蜘蛛攀爬特性。",
	"In the fourth stage, a creature's flesh often rots away or grows out of control, either leaving muscle and bone visible beneath or concealing features beneath masses of fleshy lattice or bulbous growths. Bone structure can alter radically, creating additional limbs or turning existing limbs into bizarrely jointed tentacles. Extra eyes can appear in unexpected places, or the head can transform into something resembling a fish or octopus. At this stage, a corrupted creature might begin to transform into an entirely different creature. A human could effectively become any of the creatures mentioned above, or some other vaguely humanoid monster such as a {@creature kenku}, a {@creature lizardfolk}, a {@creature sahuagin}, or a yuan-ti.": "在第四阶段，生物的肉体通常会腐烂或失控生长，要么留下可见的肌肉和骨骼，要么将特征隐藏在大量的肉格子或球状的生长物之下。骨骼结构可以彻底改变，形成额外的肢体或将现有的肢体变成怪异的关节触手。额外的眼睛可以出现在意想不到的地方，或者头部可以变成类似于鱼或章鱼的东西。在这个阶段，被腐蚀的生物可能开始转变为一种完全不同的生物。一个人可以有效地变成上面提到的任何一种生物，或其他一些模糊的人形怪物，如（%0%）、（%1%）、（%2%）或元宝。",
	"The most warped creatures are barely even recognizable. Some become little more than a mass of writhing tentacles, or lose their physical coherence entirely. Two or more creatures can fuse together, joined by fleshy lattice. The \"lucky\" ones retain a basically humanoid shape, but otherwise appear completely monstrous, with twisted faces, extra limbs, horny growths, jointed tentacle extrusions, and so on. Such a creature might effectively become an Eldrazilike monster such as an {@creature aboleth}, a {@creature chuul}, a {@creature cloaker}, a {@creature gibbering mouther}, or a {@creature mind flayer}.": "最扭曲的生物甚至几乎无法辨认。有的变成了一团蠕动的触手，或者完全失去了身体的连贯性。两个或更多的生物可以融合在一起，由肉质晶格连接。那些 \"幸运 \"的生物基本上保留了人形，但在其他方面则显得完全畸形，有扭曲的面孔、多余的肢体、角质的生长、有关节的触手挤压，等等。这样的生物可能有效地成为Eldrazilike怪物，如{@creature aboleth}、{@creature chuul}、{@creature cloaker}、{@creature gibbering mouther}、或{@creature mind flayer}。",

	"For each day of a voyage, in addition to checking for hazards, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 19 or 20, the ship has a random encounter.

	"If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.": "如果你携带的重量超过你力量得分的10倍，达到你的最大承载量，你就会被重重地束缚住，这意味着你的速度会下降20英尺，而且你在使用力量、灵巧或体质的能力检查、攻击卷和蓄力时有劣势。",
	"Combat can feel very mechanical. {@i I move 10 feet. I make an attack roll. I use a reaction.} One way for the DM to encourage more cinematic action is to present a list of Environmental Elements. In a tavern, this list could include Chandelier, Plate Glass Window, Roaring Fireplace, Tray of Drinks, Drunk Patron. If you're fighting in an ancient tomb the list could be Pile of Gold Coins, Scattered Bones, Rotting Tapestry, Moss-Covered Statue. Each turn, a player can work one of these elements into their description of their action. The primary purpose of this is to give players ideas; interesting details to use while describing their actions. But if a player comes up with a particularly clever way to use an element, the DM could grant advantage on a check or attack roll, or some other benefit. The rogue needs to cross a room full of enemies and wants to swing on the chandelier? As the DM, I'd let them make a simple Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to avoid opportunity attacks, essentially getting a free {@action Disengage} action.": "战斗会让人感觉非常机械。{@i I move 10 feet. I make an attack roll. I use a reaction.}DM鼓励更多电影化的行动的一个方法是提出一个环境元素的清单。在一个酒馆里，这个清单可以包括吊灯、平板玻璃窗、熊熊燃烧的壁炉、一盘饮料、喝醉的赞助人。如果你是在古墓中作战，这个清单可以是一堆金币、散落的骨头、腐烂的挂毯、覆盖着青苔的雕像。每一回合，玩家可以在他们的行动描述中加入这些元素之一。这样做的主要目的是给玩家提供思路；在描述他们的行动时，可以使用有趣的细节。但是，如果玩家想出了一个特别聪明的方法来使用一个元素，管理员可以在检查或攻击卷上给予优势，或其他一些好处。流氓需要穿过一个满是敌人的房间，想在吊灯上荡秋千？作为管理者，我会让他们做一个简单的灵巧（（%1%））检查来避免机会攻击，基本上可以得到一个免费的（%2%）行动。",
	"Environmental elements are always  optional and largely cosmetic. As a DM, you  don't have to grant a bonus for every use of an   element. But presenting a list can help players  think of the location as more than just squares  on a map and challenge them to add more  cinematic flair to their actions.": "环境元素总是可有可无的，而且主要是装饰性的。作为一个管理人，你不必为每一个元素的使用提供奖励。但提供一个清单可以帮助玩家把这个地点看作是地图上的方块，并挑战他们为自己的行动添加更多的电影色彩。",
	"In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won't fit in a halfling's leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant's elegant robe.": "在大多数战役中，你可以在常识的范围内使用或穿戴你在冒险中发现的任何装备。例如，一个魁梧的半兽人不适合穿半身人的皮甲，而一个地精会被云雾巨人的优雅长袍所吞没。",

	"Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith, tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The DM can either roll {@dice 1d4 × 10} or determine the increase in cost based on the extent of the alterations required.": "使用这个变体，当冒险者发现盔甲、衣服和类似的物品是用来穿的，他们可能需要去找一个盔甲匠、裁缝、皮革工人或类似的专家来使这个物品可以穿。这种工作的费用从物品市场价格的10%到40%不等。管理员可以掷骰子（%0%），或者根据所需改造的程度来决定成本的增加。",

	"If you want the precision of knowing which way a creature is facing, consider using this optional rule. Whenever a creature ends its move, it can change its facing. Each creature has a front arc (the direction it faces), left and right side arcs, and a rear arc. A creature can also change its facing as a reaction when any other creature moves.": "如果你想要精确地知道一个生物所面对的方向，可以考虑使用这个可选规则。每当一个生物结束其移动时，它都可以改变其朝向。每个生物都有一个前弧（它所面对的方向）、左和右的侧弧以及一个后弧。当任何其他生物移动时，一个生物也可以作为反应而改变其方向。",
	"A creature can normally target only creatures in its front or side arcs. It can't see into its rear arc. This means an attacker in the creature's rear arc makes attack rolls against it with advantage.": "一个生物通常只能针对其前弧或侧弧的生物。它不能看到它的后弧。这意味着在该生物的后弧中的攻击者对它的攻击卷轴具有优势。",
	"Shields apply their bonus to AC only against attacks from the front arc or the same side arc as the shield. For example, a fighter with a shield on the left arm can use it only against attacks from the front and left arcs.": "盾牌只对来自正面弧线或与盾牌同侧弧线的攻击适用其AC的奖励。例如，一个在左臂上有盾牌的战士只能用它来对付来自正面和左边弧线的攻击。",
	"Feel free to determine that not all creatures have every type of arc. For example, an amorphous ochre jelly could treat all of its arcs as front ones, while a hydra might have three front arcs and one rear one. On squares, you pick one side of a creature's space as the direction it is facing. Draw a diagonal line outward from each corner of this side to determine the squares in its front arc. The opposite side of the space determines its rear arc in the same way. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature form its side arcs.": "请自由决定，不是所有的生物都有每种类型的弧。例如，一个无定形的赭石果冻可以把它所有的弧线都当作正面的，而九头蛇可能有三个正面的弧线和一个背面的弧线。在方格上，你选择一个生物空间的一侧作为它的方向。从这一侧的每个角落向外画一条对角线以确定其前弧的方格。空间的另一侧以同样的方式决定其后弧。该生物两侧的其余空间构成其侧弧。",
	"On hexes, determining the front, rear, and side arcs requires more judgment. Pick one side of the creature's space and create a wedge shape expanding out from there for the front arc, and another on the opposite side of the creature for the rear arc. The remaining spaces to either side of the creature are its side arcs.": "在六角星上，确定前面、后面和侧面的弧线需要更多的判断。挑选生物空间的一侧，创造一个楔形，从那里向外扩展，作为前弧，并在生物的另一侧创造一个楔形作为后弧。生物两侧的剩余空间是它的侧弧。",
	"A square or hex might be in more than one arc, depending on how you draw the lines from a creature's space. If more than half of a square or hex lies in one arc, it is in that arc.

If half of it is in a side arc and the rear arc, it's in the side arc.": "一个正方形或六边形可能在一个以上的弧中，这取决于你如何从生物的空间中画线。如果一个正方形或六边形的一半以上位于一个弧线内，它就在那个弧线内。如果它被正好从中间分割开来，则使用这个规则：如果它的一半位于前面的弧线上，它就在那个弧线上。如果它的一半在侧弧和后弧中，它就在侧弧中。",
	"Falling from a great height is a significant risk for adventurers and their foes. The rule given in the Player's Handbook is simple: at the end of a fall, you take {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet you fell, to a maximum of {@dice 20d6}. You also land {@condition prone}, unless you somehow avoid taking damage from the fall. Here are two optional rules that expand on that simple rule.": "从高处坠落对于冒险者和他们的敌人来说都是一个重大的风险。玩家手册中给出的规则很简单：在坠落结束时，你每下降10英尺就会受到{@dice 1d6}的重击伤害，最大为{@dice 20d6}。你也会落地（％2％），除非你以某种方式避免受到坠落的伤害。这里有两条可选的规则，对这一简单规则进行了扩展。",
	"The rule for falling assumes that a creature immediately drops the entire distance when it falls. But what if a creature is at a high altitude when it falls, perhaps on the back of a {@creature griffon} or on board an {@item airship}? Realistically, a fall from such a height can take more than a few seconds, extending past the end of the turn when the fall occurred. If you'd like high-altitude falls to be properly time-consuming, use the following optional rule.": "坠落的规则假定一个生物在坠落时立即掉下整个距离。但是，如果一个生物在坠落时处于高空，也许是在{@creature griffon}的背上或在{@item airship}的飞机上呢？现实地讲，从这样的高度坠落可能需要几秒钟以上的时间，延长到坠落发生时的回合结束。如果你想让高空坠落适当地耗费时间，可以使用下面的可选规则。",
	"When you fall from a great height, you instantly descend up to 500 feet. If you're still falling on your next turn, you descend up to 500 feet at the end of that turn. This process continues until the fall ends, either because you hit the ground or the fall is otherwise halted.": "当你从高处坠落时，你会立即下降到500英尺。如果你在下一回合仍在下降，你在该回合结束时最多下降500英尺。这个过程一直持续到坠落结束，要么是因为你落地了，要么是因为坠落被停止了。",
	"A flying creature in flight falls if it is knocked {@condition prone}, if its speed is reduced to 0 feet, or if it otherwise loses the ability to move, unless it can hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as the {@spell fly} spell.": "飞行中的生物如果被击倒（%0%），如果它的速度降低到0英尺，或者如果它失去了移动的能力，就会坠落，除非它可以盘旋，或者它被魔法保持在高空，例如（%1%）的咒语。",
	"If you'd like a flying creature to have a better chance of surviving a fall than a non-flying creature does, use this rule: subtract the creature's current flying speed from the distance it fell before calculating falling damage. This rule is helpful to a flier that is knocked {@condition prone} but is still conscious and has a current flying speed that is greater than 0 feet. The rule is designed to simulate the creature flapping its wings furiously or taking similar measures to slow the velocity of its fall.": "如果你想让一个飞行生物比非飞行生物有更好的机会在坠落中存活下来，请使用这个规则：在计算坠落伤害之前，用生物的当前飞行速度减去它的坠落距离。这个规则对被击倒（%0%）但仍有意识且当前飞行速度大于0英尺的飞行者有帮助。这个规则是为了模拟生物狂拍翅膀或采取类似的措施来减缓其坠落的速度。",
	"If you use the rule for rate of falling in the previous section, a flying creature descends 500 feet on the turn when it falls, just as other creatures do. But if that creature starts any of its later turns still falling and is {@condition prone}, it can halt the fall on its turn by spending half its flying speed to counter the {@condition prone} condition (as if it were standing up in midair).": "如果你使用上一节中关于下落速度的规则，一个飞行生物在它下落的回合中会下降500英尺，就像其他生物那样。但是如果该生物在其后来的任何一个回合开始时仍然在下降，并且是（%0%），它可以在其回合中通过花费一半的飞行速度来对抗（%1%）的条件而停止下降（就像它在半空中站起来一样）。",

This section presents an alternative system, exploring reactions personalized to individual characters and offering incentive for players to embrace roleplaying moments of fear. Options exploring fear provide guidance to create frightening moments for a character outside of spells or monster abilities, while rules for stress model the lingering toll such events can take.

	"This variant encourages teamwork and makes your life as a DM easier, since you can more easily coordinate monsters. On the downside, the side that wins initiative can gang up on enemies and take them out before they have a chance to act.": "这种变体鼓励团队合作，使你作为管理人的生活更容易，因为你可以更容易地协调怪物。但缺点是，赢得主动权的一方可以群殴敌人，在他们有机会行动之前就把他们干掉。",

	"Using inspiration to reward roleplaying is a good place to start for most groups. Reward a player with inspiration when that player causes his or her character to do something that is consistent with the character's personality trait, flaw, or bond. The character's action should be notable in some way. It might drive the story forward, push the adventurers into danger, or make everyone at the table laugh. In essence. you reward the player for roleplaying in a way that makes the game more enjoyable for everyone else.": "对于大多数团体来说，使用灵感来奖励角色扮演是一个好的开始。当一个玩家使他或她的角色做了与该角色的个性特征、缺陷或纽带相一致的事情时，就用灵感来奖励该玩家。角色的行动应该在某些方面值得注意。它可能会推动故事的发展，把冒险者推入危险之中，或者让桌子上的每个人都笑起来。从本质上讲，你奖励玩家的角色扮演，使游戏对其他人来说更加愉快。",
	"Take into account each player's roleplaying style, and try not to favor one style over another. For example, Allison might be comfortable speaking in an accent and adopting her character's mannerisms, but Paul feels self-conscious when trying to act and prefers to describe his character's attitude and actions. Neither style is better than the other. Inspiration encourages players to take part and make a good effort, and awarding it fairly makes the game better for everyone.": "考虑到每个玩家的角色扮演风格，尽量不要偏向于一种风格。例如，Allison可能很喜欢用口音说话，并采用她的角色的举止，但Paul在尝试表演时感到很自觉，更喜欢描述他的角色的态度和行动。两种风格都不比对方好。灵感鼓励玩家参与并做出良好的努力，公平地授予它使游戏对每个人都更好。",
	"You can use inspiration to encourage player characters to take risks. A fighter might not normally hurl himself over a balcony to land in the mid of a pack of hungry ghouls, but you can reward the character's daring maneuver with inspiration. Such a reward tells the players that you want them to embrace swashbuckling action.": "你可以用灵感来鼓励玩家角色去冒险。一个战士通常不会把自己扔到阳台上，落在一群饥饿的食尸鬼中间，但你可以用灵感来奖励这个角色的大胆举动。这样的奖励告诉玩家，你想让他们去接受挥霍的行动。",
	"This approach is great for campaigns that emphasize action-packed heroics. For such campaigns, consider allowing inspiration to be spent after a {@dice d20} roll, rather than before. This approach turns inspiration into a cushion against failure—and a guarantee that it comes into play only when a player is faced directly by failure. Such an assurance makes risky tactics less daunting.": "这种方法很适合强调行动英雄主义的活动。对于这样的战役，可以考虑让灵感在掷出{@dice d20}之后，而不是之前花费。这种方法将灵感变成对失败的缓冲--保证它只在玩家直接面临失败时才发挥作用。这样的保证使冒险的战术不那么令人生畏。",
	"Some DMs prefer to play an impartial role in their campaigns. Inspiration normally requires a DM's judgment to award, which might run against your style if you like a campaign where you let dice determine most outcomes. If that's your style, consider using inspiration as a reward when the characters achieve an important goal or victory, representing a surge of confidence and energy.": "有些DM喜欢在他们的活动中扮演公正的角色。灵感通常需要DM的判断来授予，如果你喜欢让骰子决定大多数结果的战役，这可能会违背你的风格。如果这是你的风格，可以考虑在角色实现重要目标或取得胜利时使用灵感作为奖励，代表一种信心和能量的激增。",
	"Under this model, give everyone in the party inspiration if the characters manage to defeat a powerful foe, execute a cunning plan to achieve a goal, or otherwise overcome a daunting obstacle in the campaign.": "在这种模式下，如果人物成功地击败了一个强大的敌人，执行了一个狡猾的计划来实现一个目标，或以其他方式克服了运动中的一个艰巨的障碍，就给党内的每个人以灵感。",
	"Inspiration is a handy tool for reinforcing the conventions of a particular genre. Under this approach, think of the motifs of a genre as personality traits, flaws, and bonds that can apply to any of the adventurers. For example, in a campaign inspired by film noir, characters could have an additional flaw: \"I can 't resist helping a person I find alluring despite warnings that he or she is nothing but trouble.\" If the characters agree to help a suspicious but seductive noble and thereby become entangled in a web of intrigue and betrayal, reward them with inspiration.": "灵感是一个方便的工具，可以强化某一特定流派的惯例。在这种方法下，把一个流派的主题看作是可以适用于任何冒险者的个性特征、缺陷和纽带。例如，在一个以黑色电影为灵感的活动中，人物可以有一个额外的缺陷：\"我无法抗拒帮助一个我觉得很诱人的人，尽管有警告说他或她只是个麻烦。\" 如果人物同意帮助一个可疑但有诱惑力的贵族，并因此卷入了一个阴谋和背叛的网络，就用灵感来奖励他们。",
	"Similarly, characters in a horror story typically can't help but spend a night in a haunted house to learn its secrets. They probably also go off alone when they shouldn't. If the party splits up, consider giving each character inspiration.": "同样，恐怖故事中的人物通常会情不自禁地在闹鬼的房子里过夜，了解它的秘密。他们可能也会在不应该去的时候独自离开。如果聚会分头进行，考虑给每个角色以灵感。",
	"A sensible person would avoid the noble's intrigues and the haunted house, but in film noir or horror, we're not dealing with sensible people; we're dealing with protagonists in a particular type of story. For this approach to work, create a list of your genre's main conventions and share it with your players. Before the campaign begins, talk about the list to make sure your group is on board for embracing those conventions.": "一个明智的人会避开贵族的阴谋和鬼屋，但在黑色电影或恐怖片中，我们面对的不是明智的人；我们面对的是一个特殊类型故事中的主角。为了使这种方法奏效，请创建一个你的流派的主要惯例的清单，并与你的玩家分享它。在活动开始前，讨论这个清单，以确保你的小组同意接受这些惯例。",
	"Remember that a player with inspiration can award it to another player. Some groups even like to treat inspiration as a group resource, deciding collectively when to spend it on a roll. It's best to let players award their inspiration as they see fit, but feel free to talk to them about following certain guidelines, particularly if you're trying to reinforce conventions of a certain genre.": "记住，拥有灵感的玩家可以把它授予另一个玩家。有些团体甚至喜欢把灵感当作一种团体资源，集体决定什么时候把它用在卷轴上。最好的办法是让玩家按照他们认为合适的方式授予他们的灵感，但可以随时与他们讨论如何遵循某些准则，特别是如果你试图加强某种类型的惯例。",
	"Consider the timing of your inspiration rewards. Some DMs like to award inspiration in response to an action. Other DMs like to encourage specific actions by offering inspiration while a player is considering options. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses.": "考虑你的灵感奖励的时机。有些管理人喜欢在行动后奖励灵感。其他管理员则喜欢在玩家考虑选项时提供灵感，以鼓励特定的行动。这两种方法都有其优势和劣势。",
	"Waiting until after an action preserves the flow of play, but it also means players don't know whether their decisions will earn them inspiration. It also means the player can't spend the inspiration on the act that earned it, unless you allow a player to retroactively spend it or are quick enough to award it before any rolls. This approach works best for groups that want to focus on immersion and player agency, where the DM steps back and gives the players more freedom to do what they want.": "等到行动之后再进行，可以保留游戏的流程，但这也意味着玩家不知道他们的决定是否会给他们带来灵感。这也意味着玩家不能在赢得灵感的行为上花费灵感，除非你允许玩家追溯花费灵感，或者在任何掷骰子之前迅速授予灵感。这种方法最适合那些想要关注沉浸感和玩家代理权的团体，在这种情况下，管理员退后一步，给玩家更多的自由来做他们想做的事。",
	"Telling a player that an action will earn inspiration provides clarity, but it can make it feel like you are manipulating the players or making choices for them. Offering inspiration before an action works great with groups that are comfortable with an emphasis on genre emulation and group storytelling, where character freedom isn't as important as weaving a compelling tale together.": "告诉玩家某项行动会获得灵感，可以让玩家明白，但也会让人觉得你在操纵玩家或为他们做选择。在行动之前提供灵感，对于那些喜欢强调流派模仿和集体讲故事的团体来说是很好的，在这些团体中，角色自由并不像编织一个引人注目的故事那样重要。",
	"Start with awarding inspiration after an action, especially for your first campaign or when playing with a new group. That approach is the least disruptive to the flow of play and avoids making the players feel as if you are being manipulative.": "开始时，在一次行动后授予灵感，特别是对于你的第一次战役或与一个新团体一起玩时。这种方法对游戏流程的干扰最小，而且可以避免让玩家觉得你在操纵他们。",
	"A player typically notes on a character sheet whether he or she has inspiration, or you can use poker chips or some other token. Alternatively, you can hand out special d20s to represent inspiration. When a player spends inspiration, he or she rolls the die and then hands it back to you. If the player instead gives the inspiration to someone else, the {@dice d20} can go to that other person.": "玩家通常会在角色表上注明他或她是否有灵感，或者你可以使用扑克牌筹码或其他一些象征物。另外，你也可以发放特殊的D20来代表灵感。当玩家花费灵感时，他或她会掷出骰子，然后把它交还给你。如果玩家把灵感给了其他人，那么（%0%）可以给那个人。",
	"Inspiration might not work for your campaign. Some DMs feel it adds a layer of metagame thinking, and others feel that heroism, roleplaying, and other parts of the game are their own rewards that don't need incentives like inspiration.": "灵感可能对你的活动不起作用。有些管理员觉得它增加了一层元游戏的思维，而另一些人则觉得英雄主义、角色扮演和游戏的其他部分是他们自己的奖励，不需要灵感这样的激励。",
	"If you choose to ignore inspiration, you're telling the players that your campaign is one where you let the dice fall where they may. It's a good option for gritty campaigns or ones where the DM focuses on playing an impartial role as a rules arbiter.": "如果你选择忽略灵感，你就是在告诉玩家，你的战役是一个让骰子落在哪里都可以的地方。这是一个很好的选择，适用于粗暴的战役，或者DM专注于扮演一个公正的规则仲裁者的角色。",
	"As a DM, you have a lot to track during the game. Sometimes you can lose track of inspiration and forget to award it. As a variant rule, you can allow the players to handle awarding inspiration entirely. During every session, each player can award inspiration to another player. A player follows whatever guidelines the group has agreed on for awarding inspiration.": "作为一个管理人，你在游戏过程中有很多事情要跟踪。有时你会失去对灵感的追踪，而忘记授予它。作为一个变通规则，你可以让玩家完全处理授予灵感的问题。在每个环节中，每个玩家都可以向另一个玩家授予灵感。玩家遵循小组商定的授予灵感的任何准则。",
	"This approach makes your life easier and also gives players the chance to recognize each other for good play. You still need to make sure that inspiration is being awarded fairly.": "这种方法使你的生活更轻松，也让玩家有机会互相认可对方的良好发挥。你仍然需要确保公平地授予灵感。",
	"This approach works best with groups that are focused on the story. It falls flat if the players merely manipulate it to gain advantage in key situations, without earning inspiration by way of good roleplaying or whatever other criteria the group has established.": "这种方法在专注于故事的小组中效果最好。如果玩家只是在关键情况下操纵它来获得优势，而没有通过良好的角色扮演或小组制定的其他标准来赢得灵感，那么这种方法就会落空。",
	"In this variant, you can allow each player to award inspiration more than once per session. If you do so, the first time that a player awards inspiration in a session is free. Whenever that player awards it later in the same session, you gain inspiration that you can spend to give advantage to any foe of the player characters. There's no limit to the number of inspirations you can gain in this way, and unspent inspiration carries over from one session to the next.": "在这个变体中，你可以允许每个棋手在每一节中授予灵感一次以上。如果你这样做，一个玩家在一个会话中第一次授予灵感是免费的。每当该玩家在同一会话中授予灵感时，你就会获得灵感，你可以用它来给玩家角色的任何敌人带来好处。你可以通过这种方式获得的灵感数量没有限制，而且未使用的灵感可以从一个会话延续到下一个会话。",
	"Inspiration is a rule the Dungeon Master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.": "灵感是地下城管理员可以用来奖励你以真实的方式来扮演你的角色，这符合他或她的个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷的规则。通过使用灵感，你可以利用你对被压迫者的同情心这一个性特征，使你在与乞丐王子的谈判中取得优势。或者，灵感可以让你调用你的纽带来保卫你的家乡，以突破对你施加的法术的影响。",
	"Your DM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons. Typically, DMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your DM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.": "你的管理员可以选择以各种理由给你灵感。通常情况下，当你发挥你的个性特征，屈服于缺陷或束缚所带来的缺点，以及以其他令人信服的方式描绘你的角色时，DM会授予你灵感。你的管理员会告诉你如何在游戏中获得灵感。",
	"You either have inspiration or you don't—you can't stockpile multiple \"inspirations\" for later use.": "你要么有灵感，要么没有，你不能储存多个 \"灵感 \"供以后使用。",
	"If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.": "如果你有灵感，你可以在做攻击卷、自救动作或能力检查时消耗它。花费你的灵感会使你在该次翻滚中获得优势。",
	"Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration.": "此外，如果你有灵感，你可以奖励另一个玩家良好的角色扮演，聪明的思维，或只是在游戏中做了一些令人兴奋的事情。当另一个玩家角色做了一些真正对故事有贡献的有趣的事情时，你可以放弃你的灵感，给那个角色以灵感。",
	"You can do away with experience points entirely and control the rate of character advancement. Advance characters based on how many sessions they play, or when they accomplish significant story goals in the campaign. In either case, you tell the players when their characters gain a level.": "你可以完全摒弃经验值，控制角色的升级速度。根据他们玩了多少次游戏，或者当他们在战役中完成了重要的故事目标时，来提升角色。无论哪种情况，你都要告诉玩家他们的角色什么时候获得一个等级。",
	"This method of level advancement can be particularly helpful if your campaign doesn't include much combat, or includes so much combat that tracking XP becomes tiresome.": "如果你的活动不包括很多战斗，或者包括很多战斗，以至于追踪XP变得令人厌烦，那么这种等级提升的方法就会特别有帮助。",
	"A good rate of session-based advancement is to have characters reach 2nd level after the first session of play, 3rd level after another session, and 4th level after two more sessions. Then spend two or three sessions for each subsequent level. This rate mirrors the standard rate of advancement, assuming sessions are about four hours long.": "一个好的基于会话的升级速度是让角色在第一个会话后达到2级，在另一个会话后达到3级，再过两个会话后达到4级。然后再花两到三节课的时间来提升后续等级。这个速度反映了标准的升级速度，假设游戏时间约为四个小时。",
	"When you let the story of the campaign drive advancement, you award levels when adventurers accomplish significant goals in the campaign.": "当你让战役的故事推动进展时，当冒险者在战役中完成重要的目标时，你就会授予等级。",
	"Loyalty is an optional rule you can use to determine how far an NPC party member will go to protect or assist the other members of the party (even those she doesn't particularly like). An NPC party member who is abused or ignored is likely to abandon the party, whereas an NPC who owes a life characters or shares their goals might fight to the death for them. Loyalty can be roleplayed or represented by this rule.": "忠诚是一个可选的规则，你可以用它来决定一个NPC党员会在多大程度上保护或协助党内的其他成员（甚至是那些她并不特别喜欢的人）。一个被虐待或被忽视的NPC党员很可能会放弃党，而一个欠了一个生命人物或与他们有共同目标的NPC可能会为他们战斗到死。忠诚可以通过这个规则进行角色扮演或代表。",
	"An NPC's loyalty is measured on a numerical scale from 0 to 20. The NPC's maximum loyalty score is equal to the highest Charisma score among all adventurers in the party, and its starting loyalty score is half that number. If the highest Charisma score changes—perhaps a character dies or leaves the group-adjust the NPC's loyalty score accordingly.": "一个NPC的忠诚度是以0到20的数值来衡量的。NPC的最大忠诚度得分等于聚会中所有冒险者的最高魅力得分，而它的起始忠诚度得分是这个数字的一半。如果最高的魅力值发生了变化--也许是一个角色死亡或离开了团队--那么就相应地调整NPC的忠诚度得分。",
	"Keep track of an NPC's loyalty score in secret so that the players won't know for sure whether an NPC party member is loyal or disloyal (even if the NPC is currently under a player's control).": "秘密跟踪NPC的忠诚度分数，这样玩家就不会确定某个NPC党员是忠诚还是不忠诚（即使该NPC目前在玩家的控制之下）。",
	"An NPC's loyalty score increases by {@dice 1d4} if other party members help the NPC achieve a goal tied to its bond. Likewise, an NPC's loyalty score increases by {@dice 1d4} if the NPC is treated particularly well (for example, given a magic weapon as a gift) or rescued by another party member. An NPC 's loyalty score can never be raised above its maximum.": "如果其他党员帮助NPC实现与之相关的目标，那么NPC的忠诚度分数会增加（%0%）。同样，如果一个NPC受到特别好的对待（例如，得到一件魔法武器作为礼物）或被其他党员救出，该NPC的忠诚度分数会增加（%1%）。一个NPC的忠诚度分数永远不能超过其最大值。",
	"When other party members act in a manner that runs counter to the NPC's alignment or bond, reduce the PC's loyalty score by {@dice 1d4}. Reduce the NPC's loyalty score by {@dice 2d4} if the character is abused, misled, or endangered by other party members for purely selfish reasons.": "当其他党员的行为与NPC的排列组合或纽带背道而驰时，降低PC的忠诚度分数（%0%）。如果该角色被其他党员纯粹出于自私的原因虐待、误导或危害，则减少该NPC的忠诚度得分（%1%）。",
	"An NPC whose loyalty score drops to 0 is no longer loyal to the party and might part ways with them. A loyalty score can never drop below 0.": "忠诚度分数下降到0的NPC不再对党忠诚，并可能与他们分道扬镳。忠诚度的分数永远不能低于0。",
	"An NPC with a loyalty score of 10 or higher risks life and limb to help fellow party members. If the NPC's loyalty score is between 1 and 10, its loyalty is tenuous. An NPC whose loyalty drops to 0 no longer acts in the party's best interests. The disloyal NPC either leaves the party (attacking characters who attempt to intervene) or works in secret to bring about the party's downfall.": "忠诚度为10分或更高的NPC会冒着生命危险来帮助党内成员。如果NPC的忠诚度分数在1到10之间，它的忠诚度是脆弱的。一个忠诚度下降到0的NPC不再为党的最佳利益而行动。不忠诚的NPC要么离开党派（攻击试图干预的角色），要么秘密地工作，使党派垮台。",
	"In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.": "在一个典型的战役中，角色不会被他们所面对的恐怖和日复一日的屠杀所逼疯，但有时作为一个冒险家的压力会让人难以承受。如果你的活动有一个强烈的恐怖主题，你可能想用疯狂来强化这个主题，强调冒险者所面临的威胁的异常恐怖的性质。",
	"Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the Player's Handbook. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.": "各种魔法效果可以对原本稳定的心智造成疯狂。某些法术，比如接触其他位面和符号，可以导致疯狂，你可以在这里使用疯狂规则，而不是《玩家手册》中的法术效果。疾病、毒药和平面效应，如精神之风或大闹天宫的呼啸之风，都可以造成疯狂。一些神器也可以破坏使用或适应它们的角色的心理。",

	"Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes.

	"The real fun of running a mass battle is giving player characters and important NPCs a chance to affect the outcome. You might be tempted to absorb such characters into units and ignore their special abilities.

If members of a unit are killed, recalculate the unit's BR after removing the casualties.": "无论角色以何种方式参与大规模战斗，都要使用标准规则而不是大规模战斗规则来解决他们的特征、法术和其他能力。例如，一堵冰墙可以挡住100英尺长的队伍。如果一个单位在它旁边移动，则使用单个成员的属性来进行蓄力并施加伤害。如果一个单位的成员被杀，在除去伤亡人员后重新计算该单位的BR。",
	"Adjudicating these effects requires your judgment as DM. Consider the nature of the situation, how a unit interacts with a spell or other effect, and apply the effects as you see fit.

	"A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder.": "拯救失败并不总是对冒险者有利。例如，一个从战斗中逃跑的食人魔可能会让地牢里的其他人提高警惕，或者带着人物希望掠夺的财宝跑掉。",
	"If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the {@spell identify} spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.": "如果你希望魔法物品有更大的神秘感，可以考虑取消在短暂休息时识别魔法物品属性的能力，并要求使用（%0%）法术、实验或两者来揭示魔法物品的作用。",
	"Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class options.": "多类化允许你获得多个类别的等级。这样做可以让你混合这些等级的能力，以实现一个可能无法反映在标准等级选项中的角色概念。",
	"With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels in wizard and two in fighter, you're a 5th-level character.": "在这个规则下，你可以选择在你提升等级时获得一个新的等级，而不是在你目前的等级中获得一个等级。你在所有等级中的等级相加来决定你的角色等级。例如，如果你有三个魔法师等级和两个战士等级，你就是一个五级的角色。",
	"As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might change course entirely. never looking back at the class you left behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class. Compared to a single-class character of the same level, you'll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.": "随着你等级的提高，你可能主要保持你原来的班级的成员，只是在另一个班级的几级，或者你可能完全改变路线。 永远不要回头看你留下的班级。你甚至可能在第三个或第四个等级中开始进步。与同等级的单阶人物相比，你会牺牲一些重点来换取多功能性。",
	"To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-than-average ability scores.": "要想获得一个新等级的资格，你必须同时满足你当前等级和新等级的能力得分先决条件，如多类先决条件表中所示。例如，一个野蛮人决定多类为德鲁伊类，他的力量和智慧分数必须达到13或更高。在没有初学角色所接受的全面训练的情况下，你必须快速学习你的新阶级，拥有高于平均水平的能力分数所反映出的自然天赋。",

	"The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter I, not your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.": "获得等级的经验值成本总是基于你的角色总等级，如第一章中的角色进阶表所示，而不是你在某个特定等级中的等级。因此，如果你是一个牧师6级/战士1级，你必须获得足够的经验值以达到8级，然后才能作为战士升到第二级或作为牧师升到第七级。",

	"You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. if the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a {@dice d10}, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten {@dice d10} Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five {@dice d10} Hit Dice and five {@dice d8} Hit Dice.": "你把你所有等级赋予的命中率加在一起，形成你的命中率池。如果命中率是相同的骰子类型，你可以简单地把它们加在一起。例如，战士和圣骑士都有一个（%0%），所以如果你是圣骑士5/战士5，你就有10个（%1%）命中率。如果你的等级给你不同类型的命中率，请分别追踪它们。例如，如果你是圣骑士5/牧师5，你有五个{@dice d10}命中率和五个{@dice d8}命中率。",

	"If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn't give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.": "如果你已经有了 \"神性通道 \"特性，并且在一个同样赋予该特性的等级中获得了一个等级，你就会获得该等级所赋予的 \"神性通道 \"效果，但是再次获得该特性并不会让你获得额外的使用。只有当你达到一个明确授予你的等级时，你才会获得额外的使用。例如，如果你是牧师6级/帕拉丁4级，你可以在两次休息之间使用通道神性，因为你的牧师等级足够高，可以有更多的用途。每当你使用该功能时，你可以从你的两个等级中选择任何可用的通道神性效果。",
	"If you gain the Extra {@action Attack} class feature from more than one class, the features don't add together. You can't make more than two attacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter's version of Extra {@action Attack} does).

As 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.": "你决定你知道哪些法术，并且可以为每个等级单独准备，就像你是该等级的单一成员一样。例如，如果你是游侠4级/巫师3级，你就会根据你在游侠类中的等级知道三个1级的游侠法术。作为三级巫师，你知道三个巫师咒语，你的法术书包含十个巫师法术，其中两个（当你达到三级巫师时获得的两个）可以是二级法术。如果你的智力是16，你可以从你的法术书中准备六个巫师法术。",

	"You determine your available spell slots by adding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and wizard classes, half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and ranger classes, and a third of your fighter or rogue levels (rounded down) if you have the Eldritch Knight or the Arcane Trickster feature. Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.": "你可以把你在吟游诗人、牧师、德鲁伊、巫师和魔法师等级中的所有等级加在一起，把你在圣骑士和游侠等级中的一半等级（四舍五入）加在一起，如果你有长生骑士或奥术术士的特征，则把你的战士或无赖等级的三分之一（四舍五入）加在一起。用这个总数来确定你的法术槽，参考多类法术师表。",
	"If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can prepare.

	"For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3. you count as a 5th-level character when determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their effects.": "例如，如果你是前面提到的4级游侠/3级巫师。在确定你的法术槽时，你算作一个5级角色：你有4个1级槽，3个2级槽，2个3级槽。然而，你不知道任何第三级法术，也不知道任何第二级游侠法术。你可以使用这些等级的法术槽来施展你所知道的法术--并有可能增强它们的效果。",
	"If you have both the Spellcasting class feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.": "如果你同时拥有施法类特征和术士类的契约魔法类特征，你可以使用你从契约魔法特征中获得的法术槽来施放你所知道的或从具有施法类特征的课程中准备的法术，你可以使用你从施法类特征中获得的法术槽来施放你所知道的术士法术。",

	"An island can have any habitat that seems appropriate for the clime it occupies. For example, islands of floating ice are found in arctic seas, while islands with jungle habitats are found in tropical waters. Not all islands are created by nature, though. A powerful spellcaster or divine being could conjure an island made of crystal, iron, or any material you choose.": "一个岛屿可以有任何似乎适合它所处气候的生境。例如，浮冰岛被发现在北极海域，而丛林栖息地的岛屿被发现在热带水域。不过，并不是所有的岛屿都是由大自然创造的。一个强大的施法者或神灵可以变出一个由水晶、铁或任何你选择的材料制成的岛屿。",

	"If the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.": "如果攻击者通常在攻击卷上有优势，你反而对防御卷适用劣势，如果攻击者有劣势，反之亦然。",
	"If the defense roll comes up as a 1 on the {@dice d20}, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges.": "如果防御卷在{@dice d20}上显示为1，那么攻击就是一个关键打击。如果攻击者通常会在19或20的卷轴上得到一个关键打击，那么攻击在1或2的时候就是一个关键打击，以此类推，关键范围更广。",
	"When a character forces an opponent to make a saving throw, that player instead makes a saving throw check. The bonus to the {@dice d20} roll for a saving throw check equals the effect's save DC -8.": "当一个角色强迫对手做一个蓄力动作时，该玩家反而会做一个蓄力动作检查。蓄力检查的{@dice d20}卷的奖励等于该效果的蓄力DC-8。",
	"The DC for this check equals 11 + the target's saving throw modifier. On a successful check, the character overcomes the target's resistance and treats the target as if it failed its saving throw. On a failed check, the target is treated as if it succeeded on its save.": "该检查的DC等于11+目标的蓄力修改器。检验成功时，角色克服了目标的抵抗力，并将目标视为其救赎失败。在检查失败时，目标会被视为救赎成功的情况。",
	"As with attacks, the saving throw check has advantage if the target would have disadvantage on its saving throw, and vice versa.": "如同攻击一样，如果目标在救赎动作上处于劣势，则救赎动作检查具有优势，反之亦然。",
	"Whenever an NPC or monster would normally make an ability check, roll initiative, or take part in a contest, neither you nor the players roll the {@dice d20}. Instead, use the rules for passive checks to determine the result. See chapter 7, \"Using Ability Scores,\" of the Player's Handbook for more information on passive checks.": "每当一个NPC或怪物通常会进行能力检查、滚动主动权或参加竞赛时，你和玩家都不需要滚动（%0%）。相反，使用被动检查的规则来决定结果。关于被动检查的更多信息，请参见《玩家手册》第7章，\"使用能力分数\"。",
	"If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.": "如果你使用方形网格和微型模型或其他代币进行战斗，请遵循这些规则。",
	"Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.": "网格上的每个方格代表5英尺。",
	"Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.": "与其一脚一脚地移动，不如在网格上一格一格地移动。这意味着你以5英尺为单位使用你的速度。如果你把你的速度除以5，转化为方格，这就特别容易。例如，30英尺的速度转化为6个方格的速度。",
	"If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.": "如果你经常使用格子，可以考虑在你的人物表上用方格写上你的速度。",
	"To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)": "要进入一个方格，你必须至少有1个方格的移动空间，即使这个方格与你所在的方格是对角线相邻的。(对角线移动的规则为了流畅的游戏而牺牲了现实主义。地下城管理员指南》提供了关于使用更真实的方法的指导。）",
	"If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.": "如果一个方块需要额外的移动量，就像困难地形方块那样，你必须有足够的移动量来支付进入它的费用。例如，你必须至少有2个方格的移动量才能进入一个困难地形的方格。",
	"Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.": "对角线运动不能越过墙角、大树或其他填补其空间的地形特征。",
	"To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.": "要确定两个东西--无论是生物还是物体--在网格上的范围，就是从其中一个相邻的方格开始数，在另一个方格的空间里停止计数。用最短的路线来计算。",
	"Plot points allow players to change the course of the campaign, introduce plot complications, alter the world, and even assume the role of the DM. If your first reaction to reading this optional rule is to worry that your players might abuse it, it's probably not for you.": "情节点允许玩家改变战役的进程，引入复杂的情节，改变世界，甚至承担DM的角色。如果你看到这条可选规则的第一反应是担心你的玩家会滥用它，那它可能不适合你。",
	"Each player starts with 1 plot point. During a session, a player can spend that point for one effect. The effect depends on your group's approach to this optional rule. Three options are presented below.": "每个玩家开始时有1个情节点。在一次会议中，玩家可以用这个点来获得一个效果。这个效果取决于你的小组对这个可选规则的处理。下面介绍三种选择。",
	"A player can spend no more than 1 plot point per session. You can increase this limit if you like, especially if you want the players to drive more of the story. Once every player at the table has spent a plot point, they each gain 1 plot point.": "一个玩家每节课可以花费不超过1个情节点。如果你愿意，你可以增加这个限制，特别是如果你想让玩家来推动更多的故事。一旦桌子上的每个玩家都花费了一个情节点，他们就各自获得一个情节点。",
	"A player who spends a plot point gets to add some element to the setting or situation that the group (including you) must accept as true. For example, a player can spend a plot point and state that his or her character has found a secret door, an NPC appears, or a monster turns out to be a long-lost ally polymorphed into a horrid beast.": "花费剧情点的玩家可以在设定或情况中加入一些元素，而团体（包括你）必须接受这些元素为真实。例如，玩家可以花费一个情节点，并说明他或她的角色发现了一个秘密的门，一个NPC出现了，或者一个怪物变成了一个久违的盟友，变成了一个可怕的野兽。",
	"A player who wants to spend a plot point in this way should take a minute to discuss his or her idea with everyone else at the table and get feedback before settling on a plot development.": "想以这种方式花费一个情节点的玩家应该花一分钟时间与桌子上的其他人讨论他或她的想法，并在确定情节发展之前获得反馈。",
	"Whenever a player spends a plot point, the player to his or her right must add a complication to the scene. For example, if the player who spends the plot point decides that her character has found a secret door, the player to the right might state that opening the door triggers a magical trap that teleports the party to another part of the dungeon.": "每当一个玩家花费了一个情节点，他或她右边的玩家就必须为场景增加一个复杂因素。例如，如果花费情节点的玩家决定她的角色发现了一扇秘密的门，那么右边的玩家可能会说，打开这扇门会触发一个神奇的陷阱，将聚会传送到地牢的另一个地方。",
	"With this approach, there is no permanent DM. Everyone makes a character, and one person starts as the DM and runs the game as normal. That person's character becomes an NPC who can tag along with the group or remain on the sidelines, as the group wishes.": "采用这种方法，没有永久性的DM。每个人都做一个角色，然后一个人开始做DM，像平常一样运行游戏。这个人的角色会成为一个NPC，他可以根据小组的意愿，跟随小组一起行动，也可以保持旁观状态。",
	"At any time, a player can spend a plot point to become the DM. That player's character becomes an NPC, and play continues. It's probably not a good idea to swap roles in the middle of combat, but it can happen if your group allows time for the new DM to settle into his or her role and pick up where the previous DM left off.": "在任何时候，一个玩家都可以花费一个情节点来成为DM。该玩家的角色成为NPC，游戏继续。在战斗中交换角色可能不是一个好主意，但如果你的小组允许新的管理员有时间进入他或她的角色，并在前一个管理员离开的地方继续工作，这也是可以发生的。",
	"Using plot points in this way can make for an exciting campaign as each new DM steers the game in unexpected directions. This approach is also a great way for would-be DMs to try running a game in small, controlled doses.": "以这种方式使用情节点，可以使游戏活动更加精彩，因为每个新的管理人都会把游戏引向意想不到的方向。这种方法也是一种很好的方式，可以让未来的DM尝试以小规模、可控的剂量运行游戏。",
	"In a campaign that uses plot points this way, everyone should come to the table with a bit of material prepared or specific encounters in mind. A player who isn't prepared or who doesn't feel like DMing can choose to not spend a plot point that session.": "在以这种方式使用情节点的活动中，每个人都应该带着一点准备好的材料或特定的遭遇来参加会议。没有准备好的玩家或不喜欢做管理的玩家可以选择不在那一节课上花费一个情节点。",
	"For this approach to work, it's a good idea to establish some shared assumptions about the campaign so that DMs aren't duplicating efforts or trampling on each other's plans.": "为了使这种方法奏效，最好是建立一些关于活动的共同假设，这样DM就不会重复工作或践踏对方的计划。",
	"Many of the character concepts that were once prestige classes or paragon paths in earlier editions of D&D are now options available to 1st-level characters. In general, the game's design aims for maximum flexibility, making options available to all characters. As such, prestige classes build on the game's broad range of basic options to represent specialized options and unique training.": "许多曾经是D&D早期版本中的威望等级或准绳路径的角色概念，现在都是一级角色可以选择的。总的来说，游戏的设计旨在实现最大的灵活性，使所有角色都可以选择。因此，威望等级建立在游戏中广泛的基本选项之上，代表了专门的选项和独特的训练。",
	"A prestige class requires a high level of skill before a character can master even its basic elements. Prestige classes might confer lost lore, allow access to an inscrutable form of magic, grant mastery of an exotic fighting style, or be built around the knowledge harbored by a secret society.": "一个声望等级在角色掌握其基本要素之前需要有高水平的技能。声望等级可能会赋予失落的传说，允许使用一种难以捉摸的魔法形式，授予掌握一种异国的战斗风格，或者围绕一个秘密社会所蕴藏的知识而建立。",
	"Mechanically, a prestige class is a character class that requires the same training and focus as any other class. You enter a prestige class by way of the normal multiclassing rules. However, you cannot enter a prestige class until you are at least 3rd level—and many prestige classes have even higher level requirements.": "从机制上讲，威望类是一个角色类别，需要和其他类别一样的训练和关注。你可以通过正常的多类规则进入一个声望类。然而，你至少要在3级时才能进入一个声望等级--许多声望等级甚至有更高的等级要求。",
	"Most prestige classes require characters to complete specific deeds in order to gain access to the class. You cannot advance in a prestige class until its gatekeepers—typically those who harbor the class's lore—agree to accept you.": "大多数声望等级要求角色完成特定的事迹，以获得进入该等级的机会。在一个声望阶级的守门人--通常是那些掌握该阶级传说的人--同意接受你之前，你不能在该阶级中晋升。",
	"A prestige class typically offers access to unique game mechanics available only to members of that class. Such mechanics reflect specific lore, secrets, or techniques impossible to master without earning the respect and trust of those who already possess that knowledge.": "一个声望等级通常提供只有该等级的成员才能使用的独特游戏机制。这种机制反映了特定的传说、秘密或技术，如果不赢得那些已经拥有这些知识的人的尊重和信任，就不可能掌握。",
	"In order to join a prestige class, you must first check with your Dungeon Master. A DM can opt to include or disallow prestige classes in the game. Typically, a prestige class requires you to undertake specific actions in the game so that your character can begin pursuing that class. If those actions aren't already possible in your campaign, talk to your DM about integrating the prestige class that interests you.": "为了加入一个声望等级，你必须先向你的地下城管理员确认。管理员可以选择在游戏中加入或不加入声望等级。通常情况下，一个声望等级要求你在游戏中采取特定的行动，以便你的角色可以开始追求这个等级。如果这些行动在你的活动中还不可能实现，请与你的管理员讨论整合你感兴趣的威望等级。",
	"A prestige class uses the normal D&D multiclassing rules (see chapter 6, \"Customization Options,\" in the Player's Handbook). When your character is ready to advance a level, you can choose to gain a level in a prestige class. Your levels in all your classes, including prestige classes, are added together to determine your character level.": "声望级使用正常的D&D多类规则（见《玩家手册》第6章，\"自定义选项\"）。当你的角色准备提高一个等级时，你可以选择在威望类中获得一个等级。你在所有等级中的等级，包括声望等级，会加在一起决定你的角色等级。",
	"Taking up a prestige class through multiclassing involves meeting certain prerequisites, just as with multiclassing into a standard class. You must meet the ability score prerequisites for your current class and for the prestige class in order to qualify for it.": "通过多类来获得一个声望等级，需要满足一定的先决条件，就像多类进入一个标准等级一样。你必须满足你当前等级和声望等级的能力得分先决条件，才能获得该等级的资格。",
	"A prestige class requires a minimum character level and a minimum score in at least one ability, as well as requiring that you complete a specific deed—finding a magic item, defeating a monster, surviving a particular challenge, and so on—before being able to take up that class.": "一个声望等级需要最低的角色等级和至少一种能力的最低得分，还需要你完成一个特定的行为--找到一个魔法物品、击败一个怪物、在一个特定的挑战中生存下来，等等--然后才能够接受该等级。",
	"Just as with the standard rules for multiclassing, the experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class.": "就像多类的标准规则一样，获得一个等级的经验值成本总是基于你的总角色等级，而不是你在某个特定等级中的等级。",
	"Each prestige class specifies the hit points you gain from it. You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes and prestige classes to determine your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you simply pool them together.": "每个声望等级都规定了你从中获得的打击点数。你将你所有的等级和声望等级所赋予的命中率加在一起，以确定你的命中率。如果这些命中率是同一类型的，你可以简单地把它们集中起来。",
	"Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, not your level in a particular class. A prestige class specifies whether it grants proficiencies when you enter it.": "你的熟练度奖励总是基于你的角色总等级，而不是你在某个特定等级中的等级。一个声望等级在你进入该等级时，会指定它是否授予熟练度。",
	"You gain prestige class features just like normal class features. Sometimes, a prestige class can improve features you have gained from other classes. If a prestige class grants Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, or Unarmored Defense, that feature is treated the same way as if you had gained it from multiple standard classes.": "你获得声望等级的特征就像普通等级的特征一样。有时，一个声望等级可以改善你从其他等级获得的特征。如果一个声望阶级授予了 \"神性通道\"、\"额外攻击 \"或 \"无装甲防御\"，那么该特征的处理方式与你从多个标准阶级获得该特征相同。",
	"Some prestige classes grant spellcasting. Each prestige class provides details on how to determine your overall spellcasting ability, using the rules for spellcasting and multiclass characters.": "有些声望等级会授予法术攻击。每个声望等级都提供了如何确定你的整体法术能力的细节，使用法术和多类角色的规则。",
	"This optional rule replaces a character's proficiency bonus with a proficiency die, adding more randomness to the game and making proficiency a less reliable indicator of mastery. Instead of adding a proficiency bonus to an ability check, an attack roll, or saving throw, the character's player rolls a die. The Proficiency Die table shows which die or dice to roll, as determined by the character's level.": "这条可选的规则用熟练度骰子代替了角色的熟练度奖励，给游戏增加了更多的随机性，使熟练度成为一个不那么可靠的掌握指标。角色的玩家不是在能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力投掷中加入熟练度奖励，而是掷骰子。熟练度骰子表显示了要掷的骰子，这由角色的等级决定。",
	"Whenever a feature, such as the rogue's Expertise, lets a character double his or her proficiency bonus, the player rolls the character's proficiency die twice instead of once.": "每当一个特征，例如流氓的专长，让一个角色的熟练度奖励翻倍时，玩家就会把角色的熟练度模子掷两次而不是一次。",
	"This option is intended for player characters and nonplayer characters who have levels, as opposed to monsters who don't.": "这个选项是为有等级的玩家角色和非玩家角色准备的，而不是为没有等级的怪物。",
	"The characters aren't the only sailors traveling the high seas. Each new vessel they encounter presents an opportunity for adventure. The following rules can be used to generate other ships met on the open seas.": "这些人物并不是唯一在公海上旅行的水手。他们遇到的每一艘新船都是一个冒险的机会。下面的规则可以用来生成在公海上遇到的其他船只。",

Consider allowing spellcasters to restore expended spell slots equal to only half their maximum spell slots (rounded down) at the end of a long rest, and to limit spell slots restored to 5th level or lower. Only a full 8-hour rest will allow a spellcaster to restore all spell slots and to regain spell slots of 6th level or higher.": "使用这个系统的施法者可以承受快速消耗法术槽的代价，尤其是在较高的等级。考虑允许施法者在长时间休息结束时恢复已消耗的法术槽，其数量仅相当于其最大法术槽的一半（四舍五入），并将恢复的法术槽限制在5级或以下。只有完整的8小时休息才能让施法者恢复所有的法术槽，并重新获得6级或以上的法术槽。",

It's a good option for campaigns that emphasize intrigue, politics, and interactions among other PCs, and in which combat is rare or something to be avoided rather than rushed into.": "这种方法鼓励角色在地牢之外花时间。对于那些强调阴谋、政治和其他NPC之间互动的活动来说，这是一个很好的选择，在这些活动中，战斗是很少见的，或者是需要避免而不是急于进入的。",

Those effects are divided into two categories.": "符文是强大的图标，你可以用它来实现各种效果。为了使用符文，你通常必须找到并保留一个（%0%）。一个主符文是一个罕见的物体--宝石或雕刻的岩石，一个神奇的信物，一些特殊材料的碎片，等等，刻有符文并被赋予魔法，使你能够释放符文的效果。这些效果分为两类。",

	"Runes are identified in a manner similar to magic items. Simply handling a master rune causes a strong sense of its rune's identity to echo in a character's mind. For example, touching a master rune item containing the kalt rune (the rune of cold) might cause you to experience a sudden chill as visions of snow and ice flash through your mind.": "符文的识别方式与魔法物品类似。只要处理一个主符文，就会在人物的脑海中产生对其符文身份的强烈感觉。例如，触摸一个包含卡尔特符文（寒冷的符文）的主符文物品，可能会使你体验到突然的寒意，因为冰雪的景象在你脑海中闪现。",

	"A rune always requires attunement to use its simple properties. Attuning to a master rune requires you to spend a short rest focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it. This can't be the same short rest used to learn the rune's properties. This focus takes the form of carefully and repeatedly copying the rune, whether with ink and parchment or simply scribing it into the dirt. If the short rest is interrupted, the attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the short rest, you gain an intuitive understanding of how to activate the rune's magical properties.": "一个符文总是需要调和才能使用它的简单属性。适应一个主符文需要你花一个短暂的休息时间，只专注于该物品，同时与它保持身体接触。这不可能是用来学习符文属性的短暂休息。这种专注的形式是仔细和反复地复制符文，无论是用墨水和羊皮纸还是简单地把它刻在土里。如果短暂的休息时间被打断，调和尝试就会失败。否则，在短暂休息结束后，你会对如何激活符文的魔法属性有一个直观的认识。",
	"A master rune can be attuned to only one creature at a time, and all runes count toward your limit of magic items you can attune to.

Whether someone focuses on roleplaying and social interaction, defeating monsters in combat, or finding clever ways to avoid battles, this system gives credit where credit is due.": "游戏时间可能看起来是衡量经验值的一种奇怪的方式，但这个概念与共享战役的运作方式是一致的。一个角色玩了10个小时，就会达到相同数量的检查点，无论这个角色是去对付一条龙，还是花了所有时间潜伏在酒馆里。这种方法确保玩家的首选风格既不会受到惩罚也不会得到奖励。无论某人专注于角色扮演和社会互动，还是在战斗中击败怪物，或者找到避免战斗的巧妙方法，这个系统都会给予应有的奖励。",
	"The number of checkpoints needed to gain the next level depends on a character's level:": "获得下一等级所需的检查点数量取决于角色的等级。",
	"At levels 1—4, reaching 4 checkpoints is sufficient to advance to the next level.": "在第1-4关，达到4个检查点就可以进入下一关。",
	"At level 5 or higher, reaching 8 checkpoints is needed to advance to the next level.": "在第5级或以上，达到8个检查点才能进入下一级别。",
	"At the end of a play session, characters must level up if they have reached enough checkpoints to do so. The required number of checkpoints is expended, and any remaining checkpoints are applied toward the next opportunity for advancement.": "在一个游戏环节结束时，如果角色已经达到足够的检查点，他们就必须提升等级。所需的检查点数量被消耗掉了，任何剩余的检查点都被用于下一次升级的机会。",
	"In a shared campaign, each character receives a fixed number of gold pieces upon gaining a new level. (This gain represents the treasure a character might find in a standard adventure.)": "在一个共享的活动中，每个角色在获得一个新的等级时都会得到固定数量的金币。(这个收益代表了一个角色在标准冒险中可能找到的宝藏）。",
	"As an additional benefit, characters are not required to put out gold to maintain a lifestyle. Instead, each character begins with a modest lifestyle, which improves as the character attains higher levels.": "作为一个额外的好处，角色不需要拿出黄金来维持生活方式。相反，每个角色开始时都有一个适度的生活方式，随着角色等级的提高而得到改善。",
	"These benefits are summarized on the Individual Treasure table. Ways for characters to spend their treasure are covered in the \"Buying and Selling\" section below.": "这些好处在 \"个人宝藏表 \"中得到了总结。角色花费财宝的方法在下面的 \"购买和出售 \"一节中介绍。",

	"Each character earns treasure points based on an adventure's tier and its intended playing time:": "每个角色都会根据冒险的层级和预期的游戏时间获得宝藏点数。",
	"1 treasure point is awarded for every 2 hours played in a tier 1 or tier 2 adventure.": "在1级或2级冒险中，每玩2小时可获得1个宝藏点。",
	"1 treasure point is awarded for every 1 hour played in a tier 3 or tier 4 adventure.": "在3级或4级冒险中，每玩1小时就可获得1个宝藏点。",
	"As with the variant rules for gaining levels, this award is based on the adventure's projected playing time, rather than the actual time a group spent at the table.": "与获得等级的变体规则一样，这个奖励是基于冒险的预计游戏时间，而不是一个小组在桌子上花费的实际时间。",
	"If a character completes an adventure of a tier higher than that character's tier, the character receives 1 additional treasure point for that adventure.": "如果一个角色完成了一个比该角色等级更高的冒险，该角色将获得该冒险的1个额外宝藏点。",
	"The DMs of the shared campaign should work together to compile a list of magic items that players can purchase. The magic item tables in chapter 2 of this book and in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide are the obvious starting point. Choosing which items to allow or ban is a matter of personal preference, just as it is for the DM in a standard campaign. Involving all the DMs helps to ensure that the list meets everyone's expectations. When in doubt, disallow an item; it's easier to add it to the available items at a later time than it would be to remove it from the game once it has been handed out.": "共享活动的管理人应该共同编制一份玩家可以购买的魔法物品清单。本书第2章和《地下城管理员指南》第7章中的魔法物品表是明显的起点。选择允许或禁止哪些物品是个人偏好的问题，就像标准战役中DM的选择一样。让所有DM参与进来，有助于确保清单满足每个人的期望。如果有疑问，就不允许某种物品；以后再把它添加到可用物品中去，比一旦发放就把它从游戏中删除要容易。",
	"Naturally, the list of available items is longer for adventures in the higher tiers, and the point cost of those higher-tier items likewise increases. The Magic Items by Tier table provides the details.": "当然，对于更高等级的冒险来说，可用物品的清单更长，而这些高等级物品的点数成本也同样增加。按等级划分的魔法物品表提供了详细情况。",
	"For instance, treasure points from a tier 1 adventure can be spent on items from tables A, B, C, and F. Any item on the first three tables costs 4 points, and an item from table F costs 8 points.": "例如，来自一级冒险的宝藏点数可以用于购买A、B、C和F表中的物品，前三个表中的任何物品都需要4点，F表中的物品需要8点。",
	"Players must spend treasure points at the end of a play session, immediately after determining whether their characters have gained a level. The order of these steps is important, since a character might enter a new tier because of the level gain.": "玩家必须在一个游戏环节结束时，在确定他们的角色是否获得了等级后立即花费宝藏点。这些步骤的顺序很重要，因为一个角色可能因为等级的提高而进入一个新的等级。",
	"Players are entitled to choose any approved item from one of the magic item tables available in the current tier. Treasure points can be spread across multiple items.": "玩家有权从当前层级中可用的魔法物品表中选择任何被批准的物品。宝藏点数可以分散在多个物品上。",
	"Many items cost more treasure points than a character can earn in a 2- or 4-hour adventure. To buy such an item, a character can make a deposit, spending treasure points on the item until it's paid off, at which time the character gains the item.": "许多物品的价格比一个角色在2或4小时的冒险中所赚取的宝藏点还要多。为了购买这样的物品，角色可以进行存款，在物品上花费宝藏点数，直到付清为止，这时角色就会获得该物品。",
	"Characters can use their monetary treasure to purchase anything from the equipment lists in chapter 5 of the Player's Handbook. In addition, the Adventurers League allows characters to purchase potions and spell scrolls, as detailed below.

Weapons, armor, and other gear used by enemies are considered too damaged to have any monetary value.": "在共享活动中，角色无权出售他们在冒险中发现的物品或用个人资金购买的装备。敌人使用的武器、盔甲和其他装备被认为损坏严重，不具有任何货币价值。",
	"A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. A crew starts with a quality score of +4, and that score varies over time, going as low as -10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives clear, fair leadership.": "一艘船需要一定数量的健壮的水手来当船员，这在它的状态块中有规定。船员的技能、经验、士气和健康状况由其质量得分来定义。一个船员开始时的质量得分是+4，这个分数会随着时间的推移而变化，低至-10，高至+10。它随着船员的伤亡、困难或健康状况的恶化而减少。如果船员的士气高涨，有良好的医疗保健，并得到清晰、公平的领导，那么它就会增加。",

	"When dealing with an individual member of the crew, you might find it useful to use the optional loyalty rule from chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. To convert a quality score to an individual's loyalty score, add 10 to the crew's quality score.": "当处理船员中的个别成员时，你可能会发现使用《地下城主指南》第4章中的可选忠诚度规则是很有用的。要将质量得分转换为个人的忠诚得分，请在船员的质量得分上加上10。",
	"A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew's quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check modified by the crew's quality score. If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew's quality score decreases by 1.": "一个领导不力或被虐待的船员可能会反对其官员。每天一次，如果船员的质量得分低于0，船长必须进行一次魅力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查，并根据船员的质量得分进行修改。如果检查的总分在1到9之间，那么船员的质量得分将减少1。",
	"If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard. The crew can be cowed into obedience through violence, combat, or offers of treasure and other rewards. When the DM ends the mutiny, the crew's quality score increases by {@dice 1d4}.": "如果检查总数为0或更低，船员就会叛变。他们会对军官产生敌意，并可能试图杀死他们，囚禁他们，或把他们扔到海里。船员们可以通过暴力、战斗、或提供财宝和其他奖励来迫使他们顺从。当DM结束叛变时，船员的质量得分会增加（%0%）。",
	"If you'd like to explore running a ship, it needs officers to oversee its operations—officers who fill six different roles. A person can fill only one role at a time, though multiple people can be assigned to a single role. Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Others focus on keeping the crew's health and morale in order.": "如果你想探索经营一艘船，它需要军官来监督它的运作--那些担任六个不同角色的军官。一个人在同一时间只能扮演一个角色，不过一个人可以被分配到一个角色。船上的一些角色反映了对训练有素的专家的需求，以指导船员的工作。其他角色则侧重于保持船员的健康和士气。",

	"Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan.": "大多数船只是大型、巨大或巨型的。一艘船的尺寸类别是由其长度或宽度决定的，以较长者为准。例如，一艘长10英尺、宽20英尺的船将使用宽度为20英尺的尺寸类别，这意味着该船是巨大的。",

	"A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew of the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers don't generally engage in running a ship, but they also don't need to be mere bystanders. Seasick merchants and marines thoroughly capable of facing menaces from the deep both count as passengers.": "一艘船的状态块显示了它能携带多少生物和多少货物。生物包括船上的船员和任何可能乘坐的乘客。乘客一般不参与管理船只，但他们也不需要仅仅是旁观者。晕船的商人和有能力面对深海威胁的海军陆战队员都算作乘客。",
	"Cargo capacity notes the maximum amount of cargo a ship can carry. A vessel can't move—or might even start taking on water—if its cargo exceeds this capacity.": "载货量是指一艘船可以装载的最大货物量。如果一艘船的货物超过了这个容量，它就不能移动，甚至可能开始进水。",

Selecting an ability counts as two of the character's Expertise choices. If the character would gain an additional skill proficiency, that character instead selects another ability check in which to gain proficiency.": "在这个规则下，\"专长 \"的作用与正常情况不同。在1级的时候，拥有 \"专长 \"类特征的角色不是选择两个技能的熟练度，而是选择他或她所熟练的能力中的一个。选择一种能力算作角色的两个专长选择。如果该角色可以获得一个额外的技能熟练度，该角色可以选择另一个能力检查来获得熟练度。",
	"This option removes skills from the game and doesn't allow for much distinction among characters. For example, a character can't choose to emphasize persuasion or intimidation; he or she is equally adept at both.": "这个选项将技能从游戏中移除，并且不允许角色之间有太多的区别。例如，一个角色不能选择强调说服或恐吓；他或她同样擅长这两种。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill or tool proficiencies. Anything that would grant the character a skill or tool proficiency provides no benefit. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check to which the character's prior training and experience (reflected in the character's background) reasonably applies. The DM is the ultimate judge of whether the character's background applies.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能或工具的熟练程度。任何可以赋予角色技能或工具熟练度的东西都不会带来好处。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何能力检查上，而该角色先前的训练和经验（反映在该角色的背景中）是合理适用的。DM是判断该角色的背景是否适用的最终法官。",
	"For example, the player of a character with the noble background could reasonably argue that the proficiency bonus should apply to a Charisma check the character makes to secure an audience with the king. The player should be encouraged to explain in specific terms how the character's background applies. Not simply \"I'm a noble,\" but \"I spent three years before starting my adventuring career serving as my family's ambassador to the court, and this sort of thing is second nature to me now.\"": "例如，一个具有贵族背景的角色的玩家可以合理地争辩说，熟练度加分应该适用于该角色为确保与国王会面而进行的魅力检查。应该鼓励玩家用具体的术语来解释该角色的背景是如何应用的。不是简单的 \"我是一个贵族\"，而是 \"在开始我的冒险生涯之前，我花了三年时间担任我的家族在宫廷的大使，这种事情现在对我来说是第二天性了。\"",
	"This simple system relies heavily on players developing their characters' histories. Don't let it result in endless debates about whether a character's proficiency bonus applies in a given situation.

	"If a character has the Expertise feature, instead of choosing skills and tools to gain the benefit of that feature, the player defines aspects of his or her background to which the benefit applies. Continuing the noble example, the player might decide to apply Expertise to \"situations where courtly manners and etiquette are paramount\" and \"figuring out the secret plots that court members hatch against one another.\"": "如果一个角色有 \"专长 \"的特征，玩家不是选择技能和工具来获得该特征的好处，而是定义他或她的背景中适用该好处的方面。延续贵族的例子，玩家可能决定将专长应用于 \"宫廷礼仪最重要的情况 \"和 \"弄清宫廷成员相互间的秘密阴谋\"。",
	"With this variant rule, characters don't have skill proficiencies. Instead, a character can add his or her proficiency bonus to any ability check directly related to the character's positive personality traits. For example, a character with a positive personality trait of \"I never have a plan, but I'm great at making things up as I go along\" might apply the bonus when engaging in some off-the-cuff deception to get out of a tight spot. A player should come up with at least four positive personality traits when creating a character.": "在这个变体规则下，角色没有技能熟练度。相反，一个角色可以把他或她的熟练度加到任何与该角色的积极个性特征直接相关的能力检查上。例如，一个具有 \"我从来没有计划，但我很擅长随心所欲地做事情 \"的积极个性特征的角色，可以在从事一些不经意的欺骗行为以摆脱困境时应用这个奖励。玩家在创造一个角色时，至少要想出四个积极的人格特征。",
	"When a character's negative personality trait directly impacts an ability check, the character has disadvantage on the check. For example, a hermit whose negative trait is \"I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, oblivious to my surroundings\" might have disadvantage on an ability check made to notice creatures sneaking up.": "当一个角色的负面性格特征直接影响到能力检查时，该角色在检查中处于不利地位。例如，如果一个隐士的负面性格是 \"我经常迷失在自己的思想和沉思中，对周围的环境视而不见\"，那么他在察觉生物潜行的能力检查中就会处于不利地位。",
	"If a character has the Expertise feature, the player can apply its benefit to personality traits related to ability checks, instead of to skills or tools. If a character would gain a new skill or tool proficiency, the character instead gains a new positive personality trait.": "如果一个角色有专长特征，玩家可以把它的好处应用到与能力检查相关的人格特征上，而不是技能或工具上。如果一个角色会获得一个新的技能或工具的熟练度，那么这个角色会获得一个新的积极的个性特征。",
	"This system relies heavily on players developing their characters' personalities. Make sure that different characters' traits—positive and negative—come into play with about the same frequency.

	"Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in {@skill Athletics}, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in {@skill Athletics} and ask for a Constitution ({@skill Athletics}) check. So if you're proficient in {@skill Athletics}, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ({@skill Intimidation}) check, even though {@skill Intimidation} is normally associated with Charisma.": "通常情况下，你对某项技能的熟练程度只适用于某种特定的能力检查。例如，熟练掌握（%0%），通常适用于力量检查。但在某些情况下，你的熟练度可能合理地适用于不同种类的检查。在这种情况下，管理员可能会要求用不寻常的能力和技能组合进行检查，或者你可能会问你的管理员是否可以将熟练度应用于不同的检查。例如，如果你必须从一个近海岛屿游到大陆，你的管理员可能会要求进行宪法检查，看你是否有足够的耐力游那么远。在这种情况下，你的经理可能会允许你运用你对{@skill Athletics}的熟练程度，并要求你进行宪法({@skill Athletics})检查。因此，如果你精通{@skill Athletics}，你就把你的熟练度加成应用于体质检查，就像你通常对力量({@skill Athletics})检查所做的那样。同样地，当你的半兽人野蛮人使用原始力量来恐吓敌人时，你的管理员可能会要求进行力量（（%5%））检查，尽管（%6%）通常与魅力相关。",
	"Just as in the real world, D&D characters spend many hours sleeping, most often as part of a long rest. Most monsters also need to sleep. While a creature sleeps, it is subjected to the {@condition unconscious} condition. Here are a few rules that expand on that basic fact.": "就像在现实世界中一样，D&D角色会花很多时间睡觉，最常见的是作为长期休息的一部分。大多数怪物也需要睡觉。当一个生物睡觉时，它将受到（%0%）条件的影响。这里有几条规则是对这一基本事实的扩展。",
	"A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.": "一个自然睡眠的生物，而不是处于魔法或化学诱导的睡眠中，如果它受到任何伤害，或者如果其他人使用动作摇晃或拍打该生物，就会醒来。突如其来的巨响--比如大喊大叫、打雷或响铃--也会唤醒自然睡眠的人。",
	"Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper. Speech at a normal volume awakens a sleeper if the environment is otherwise silent (no wind, birdsong, crickets, street sounds, or the like) and the sleeper has a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 15 or higher.": "窃窃私语不会干扰睡眠，除非睡眠者的被动智慧（（%0%））得分是20或更高，而且窃窃私语在睡眠者的10英尺内。如果环境是安静的（没有风声、鸟鸣、蟋蟀、街道的声音等），并且睡眠者的被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在15分以上，那么正常音量的说话会唤醒睡眠者。",

	"When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of {@condition exhaustion}, the rest doesn't reduce your {@condition exhaustion} level.": "当你完成一个长时间的休息，期间你穿着中型或重型盔甲睡觉，你只恢复四分之一的已用命中率（最小为一个骰子）。如果你有任何{@condition exhaustion}的等级，休息并不会降低你的{@condition exhaustion}等级。",
	"A long rest is never mandatory, but going without sleep does have its consequences. If you want to account for the effects of sleep deprivation on characters and creatures, use these rules.": "长时间的休息从来不是强制性的，但不睡觉确实有其后果。如果你想说明睡眠不足对人物和生物的影响，请使用这些规则。",
	"Whenever you end a 24-hour period without finishing a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of {@condition exhaustion}.": "每当你在24小时内没有完成长期休息就结束时，你必须在DC10宪法救赎上成功，否则就会受到一级的（%0%）。",
	"It becomes harder to fight off {@condition exhaustion} if you stay awake for multiple days. After the first 24 hours, the DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a long rest. The DC resets to 10 when you finish a long rest.": "如果你连续多日保持清醒，它将变得更难抵御（%0%）。在第一个24小时后，每连续24小时没有长时间休息，DC就会增加5。当你完成长时间休息时，DC会恢复到10。",
	"One way to modify how a class feels is to change how it uses its spells. With this variant system, a character who has the Spellcasting feature uses spell points instead spell slots to fuel spells. Spell points give a caster more flexibility, at the cost of greater complexity.": "修改一个类别的感觉的一种方法是改变它使用法术的方式。在这个变体系统中，拥有咒语功能的角色使用咒语点而不是咒语槽来激发咒语。法术点给施法者带来了更多的灵活性，但代价是更大的复杂性。",
	"In this variant, each spell has a point cost based on its level. The Spell Point Cost table summarizes the cost in spell points of slots from 1st to 9th level. Cantrips don't require slots and therefore don't require spell points.": "在这个变体中，每个法术都有一个基于其等级的点数成本。法术点成本表总结了从1级到9级的插槽的法术点成本。咒语不需要插槽，因此不需要法术点数。",
	"Instead of gaining a number of spell slots to cast your spells from the Spellcasting feature, you gain a pool of spell points instead. You expend a number of spell points to create a spell slot of a given level, and then use that slot to cast a spell. You can't reduce your spell points total to less than 0, and you regain all spent spell points when you finish a long rest.": "你不是从 \"施法 \"功能中获得一定数量的法术槽来施展你的法术，而是获得一个法术点的集合。你消耗一定数量的法术点数来创造一个给定等级的法术槽，然后使用该法术槽来施展一个法术。你不能将你的法术点数总数减少到小于0，而且当你完成一次长时休息时，你会重新获得所有消耗的法术点数。",
	"Spells of 6th level and higher are particularly taxing to cast. You can use spell points to create one slot of each level of 6th or higher. You can't create another slot of the same level until you finish a long rest.": "6级及以上的法术在施放时特别费力。你可以使用法术点数来创造一个6级或更高等级的槽。在你完成长时间的休息之前，你不能再创造一个相同等级的槽。",
	"The number of spell points you have to spend is based on your level as a spellcaster, as shown in the Spell Points by Level table. Your level also determines the maximum-level spell slot you can create. Even though you might have enough points to create a slot above this maximum, you can't do so.": "你需要花费的法术点数是基于你作为施法者的等级，如按等级计算的法术点数表所示。你的等级也决定了你可以创建的最大级别的法术槽。即使你可能有足够的点数来创造一个高于这个最大值的槽，你也不能这样做。",
	"The Spell Points by Level table applies to {@class bard||bards}, {@class cleric||clerics}, {@class druid||druids}, {@class sorcerer||sorcerers}, and {@class wizard||wizards}. For a {@class paladin} or {@class ranger}, halve the character's level in that class and then consult the table.

	"This system can be applied to monsters that cast spells using spell slots, but it isn't recommended that you do so. Tracking spell point expenditures for a monster can be a hassle.": "这个系统可以应用于使用法术槽施法的怪物，但不建议你这样做。跟踪怪物的法术点支出会很麻烦。",
	"This section expands on the spellcasting rules presented in the Player's Handbook and the Dungeon Master's Guide, providing clarifications and new options.": "本节对《玩家手册》和《地下城主指南》中的法术规则进行了扩展，提供了澄清和新的选项。",
	"Many spells create obvious effects: explosions of fire, walls of ice, teleportation, and the like. Other spells, such as charm person, display no visible, audible, or otherwise perceptible sign of their effects, and could easily go unnoticed by someone unaffected by them. As noted in the Player's Handbook, you normally don't know that a spell has been cast unless the spell produces a noticeable effect.": "许多法术产生明显的效果：火的爆炸、冰墙、传送等等。其他的法术，比如 \"魅惑\"，没有显示任何可见的、可听的或其他可感知的效果迹象，而且很容易被未受其影响的人注意到。正如《玩家手册》中所指出的，除非法术产生明显的效果，否则你通常不会知道一个法术已经被施放。",
	"But what about the act of casting a spell? Is it possible for someone to perceive that a spell is being cast in their presence? To be perceptible, the casting of a spell must involve a verbal, somatic, or material component. The form of a material component doesn't matter for the purposes of perception, whether it's an object specified in the spell's description, a component pouch, or a spellcasting focus.": "但施法的行为呢？是否有可能让人察觉到有人在他们面前施法？为了能够被感知，施法必须涉及语言、身体或物质的成分。就感知而言，物质成分的形式并不重要，无论它是咒语描述中指定的物体、成分袋，还是施法焦点。",
	"If the need for a spell's components has been removed by a special ability, such as the sorcerer's Subtle Spell feature or the Innate Spellcasting trait possessed by many creatures, the casting of the spell is imperceptible. If an imperceptible casting produces a perceptible effect, it's normally impossible to determine who cast the spell in the absence of other evidence.": "如果对咒语成分的需求已经被一种特殊的能力所消除，例如巫师的微妙咒语特性或许多生物所拥有的先天咒语特性，那么该咒语的施放是不可察觉的。如果不可察觉的施法产生了可察觉的效果，在没有其他证据的情况下，通常无法确定是谁施法。",
	"Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.": "有时，一个角色想识别别人正在施放的或已经施放的法术。要做到这一点，角色可以使用他们的反应来识别正在施放的咒语，或者他们可以在他们的回合中使用行动来识别施放后的咒语效果。",
	"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with their reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.": "如果该角色察觉到了施法、咒语的效果，或者两者都察觉到了，该角色可以用他们的反应或行动进行智力（（%0%））检查。DC等于15+法术的等级。如果该法术是作为类法术施放的，并且该角色是该类的成员，那么该检查是有优势的。例如，如果施法者以牧师身份施法，那么另一个牧师在识别该法术的检定中具有优势。有些法术在施放时并不与任何类别相关联，例如当一个怪物使用其天生的法术特性时。",
	"This Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.": "这个智力（（%0%））检查代表了这样一个事实：识别一个咒语需要一个快速的头脑和对施法的理论和实践的熟悉。即使对于一个施法能力为智慧或魅力的角色来说也是如此。能够施法本身并不能使你善于推断出别人施法时到底在做什么。",
	"A spell specifies what a caster can target with it: any type of creature, a creature of a certain type (humanoid or beast, for instance), an object, an area, the caster, or something else. But what happens if a spell targets something that isn't a valid target? For example, someone might cast {@spell charm person} on a creature believed to be a humanoid, not knowing that the target is in fact a vampire. If this issue comes up, handle it using the following rule.": "咒语规定了施法者可以用它的目标：任何类型的生物、某种类型的生物（例如人形或兽形）、一个物体、一个区域、施法者，或其他东西。但是如果一个法术的目标不是一个有效的目标，会发生什么？例如，有人可能对一个被认为是人形的生物施放（%0%），而不知道目标其实是一个吸血鬼。如果这个问题出现了，就用下面的规则来处理它。",
	"If you cast a spell on someone or something that can't be affected by the spell, nothing happens to that target, but if you used a spell slot to cast the spell, the slot is still expended. If the spell normally has no effect on a target that succeeds on a saving throw, the invalid target appears to have succeeded on its saving throw, even though it didn't attempt one (giving no hint that the creature is in fact an invalid target). Otherwise, you perceive that the spell did nothing to the target.": "如果你对不能被法术影响的人或物施法，该目标不会发生任何事情，但如果你用法术槽施法，该法术槽仍然会被消耗掉。如果该法术通常对一个成功施展拯救术的目标没有影响，那么这个无效的目标似乎已经成功施展了拯救术，即使它没有尝试施展（没有提示该生物实际上是一个无效的目标）。否则，你会感觉到这个法术对目标没有任何作用。",
	"The Dungeon Master's Guide includes the following short rule for using areas of effect on a grid.": "地下城管理员指南》包括以下关于在网格上使用效应区的简短规则。",
	"Choose an intersection of squares as the point of origin of an area of effect, then follow the rules for that kind of area as normal (see the \"Areas of Effect\" section in chapter 10 of the Player's Handbook). If an area of effect is circular and covers at least half a square, it affects that square.": "选择一个方块的交叉点作为一个效应区域的原点，然后按照该种区域的正常规则行事（参见《玩家手册》第10章的 \"效应区域 \"部分）。如果一个效应区是圆形的，并且至少覆盖了半个方格，那么它就会影响到那个方格。",
	"That rule works, but it can require a fair amount of on-the-spot adjudication. This section offers two alternatives for determining the exact location of an area: the template method and the token method. Both of these methods assume you're using a grid and miniatures of some sort. Because these methods can yield different results for the number of squares in a given area, it's not recommended that they be combined at the table—choose whichever method you and your players find easier or more intuitive.": "这一规则是有效的，但它可能需要相当多的现场裁决。本节为确定一个区域的确切位置提供了两种选择：模板法和令牌法。这两种方法都假定你使用的是网格和某种类型的微型模型。由于这两种方法对于给定区域内的方格数会产生不同的结果，因此不建议在桌面上将它们结合起来--请选择你和你的棋手认为更容易或更直观的方法。",
	"The template method uses two-dimensional shapes that represent different areas of effect. The aim of the method is to accurately portray the length and width of each area on the grid and to leave little doubt about which creatures are affected by it. You'll need to make these templates or find premade ones.": "模板法使用二维形状，代表不同的影响区域。该方法的目的是准确描绘网格上每个区域的长度和宽度，并对哪些生物受到影响没有什么疑问。你需要制作这些模板或找到预制的模板。",
	"Making a template is simple. Get a piece of paper or card stock, and cut it in the shape of the area of effect you're using. Every 5 feet of the area equals 1 inch of the template's size. For example, the 20-foot-radius sphere of the {@spell fireball} spell, which has a 40-foot diameter, would translate into a circular template with an 8-inch diameter.": "制作一个模板很简单。找一张纸或卡纸，按照你要使用的效果区域的形状剪下来。该区域每5英尺等于模板尺寸的1英寸。例如，{@spell fireball}法术的20英尺半径的球体，其直径为40英尺，将转化为一个8英寸直径的圆形模板。",
	"To use an area-of-effect template, apply it to the grid. If the terrain is flat, you can lay it on the surface; otherwise, hold the template above the surface and take note of which squares it covers or partially covers. If any part of a square is under the template, that square is included in the area of effect. If a creature's miniature is in an affected square, that creature is in the area. Being adjacent to the edge of the template isn't enough for a square to be included in the area of effect; the square must be entirely or partly covered by the template.": "要使用效果区域模板，将其应用于网格。如果地形是平坦的，你可以把它放在表面上；否则，把模板放在表面上，并注意它覆盖或部分覆盖哪些方格。如果一个方格的任何部分在模板之下，该方格就包括在效果区域内。如果一个生物的迷你模型在受影响的方格内，该生物就在该区域内。仅仅与模板的边缘相邻并不足以让一个方块包括在效应区域内；该方块必须完全或部分地被模板所覆盖。",
	"You can also use this method without a grid. If you do so, a creature is included in an area of effect if any part of the miniature's base is overlapped by the template.": "你也可以不使用网格来使用这种方法。如果你这样做，如果一个生物的底座的任何部分被模板所覆盖，该生物就会被包括在一个影响区域内。",
	"When you place a template, follow all the rules in the Player's Handbook for placing the associated area of effect. If an area of effect, such as a cone or a line, originates from a spellcaster, the template should extend out from the caster and be positioned however the caster likes within the bounds of the rules.": "当你放置模板时，要遵循《玩家手册》中关于放置相关效果区域的所有规则。如果一个效果区，比如一个圆锥体或一条线，源自施法者，那么模板应该从施法者那里延伸出去，并在规则的范围内以施法者喜欢的方式定位。",
	"Diagrams 2.1 and 2.2 show the template method in action.": "图2.1和2.2显示了模板方法的作用。",
	"The token method is meant to make areas of effect tactile and fun. To use this method, grab some dice or other tokens, which you're going to use to represent your areas of effect.": "代币法的目的是使效应区具有触觉和乐趣。要使用这种方法，请拿起一些骰子或其他令牌，你要用它们来代表你的效应区。",
	"Rather than faithfully representing the shapes of the different areas of effect, this method gives you a way to create square-edged versions of them on a grid easily, as described in the following subsections.": "这种方法不是忠实地表现不同效果区域的形状，而是给你提供了一种在网格上轻松创建方形边缘版本的方法，如以下各小节所述。",
	"Every 5-foot square of an area of effect becomes a die or other token that you place on the grid. Each token goes inside a square, not at an intersection of lines. If an area's token is in a square, that square is included in the area of effect. It's that simple.": "效应区域的每一个5英尺的方块都会成为你放置在网格上的一个骰子或其他令牌。每个令牌都在一个方格内，而不是在线条的交叉点。如果一个区域的令牌在一个方格内，该方格就包括在效果区域内。就是这么简单。",
	"Diagrams 2.3 through 2.6 show this method in action, using dice as the tokens.": "图2.3至2.6显示了这种方法的作用，使用骰子作为代币。",
	"This method depicts everything using squares, and a circular area of effect becomes square in it, whether the area is a sphere, cylinder, or radius. For instance, the 10-foot radius of flame strike, which has a diameter of 20 feet, is expressed as a square that is 20 feet on a side, as shown in diagram 2.3. Diagram 2.4 shows that area with total cover inside it.": "这种方法用正方形来描绘一切，一个圆形的作用区域在其中变成了正方形，不管这个区域是球体、圆柱体还是半径。例如，火焰打击的10英尺半径，其直径为20英尺，被表示为一个边长为20英尺的正方形，如图2.3所示。图2.4显示了该区域内的总覆盖物。",
	"A cone is represented by rows of tokens on the grid, extending from the cone's point of origin. In the rows, the squares are adjoining side by side or corner to corner, as shown in diagram 2.5. To determine the number of rows a cone contains, divide its length by 5. For example, a 30-foot cone contains six rows.": "一个圆锥体由网格上的一排代币表示，从圆锥体的原点开始延伸。如图2.5所示，在这些行中，方块是并排或角对角相邻的。要确定一个圆锥体所包含的行数，需要用它的长度除以5，例如，一个30英尺的圆锥体包含6行。",
	"Here's how to create the rows. Starting with a square adjacent to the cone's point of origin, place one token. The square can be orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to the point of origin. In every row beyond that one, place as many tokens as you placed in the previous row, plus one more token. Place this row's tokens so that their squares each share a side with a square in the previous row. If the cone is orthogonally adjacent to the point of origin, you'll have one more token to place in the row; place it on one end or the other of the row you just created (you don't have to pick the side chosen in diagram 2.5). Keep placing tokens in this way until you've created all of the cone's rows.": "下面是创建行的方法。从与圆锥体原点相邻的一个正方形开始，放置一个令牌。这个方块可以是与原点正交或斜交的。在这之后的每一行中，放置与你在前一行中放置的相同数量的令牌，再加一个令牌。放置这一行的令牌，使它们的方格与前一行的方格共享一条边。如果圆锥体与原点正交，你将会有一个更多的令牌放在这一行中；把它放在你刚刚创建的这一行的一端或另一端（你不必选择图2.5中选择的那一面）。以这种方式继续放置令牌，直到你创建了圆锥体的所有行。",
	"A line can extend from its source orthogonally or diagonally, as shown in diagram 2.6.": "如图2.6所示，一条线可以从其源头正向或斜向延伸。",

	"While figureheads are usually purely decorative, they might be magically treated to produce extraordinary effects. A ship can receive one figurehead upgrade.": "虽然人物头像通常是纯粹的装饰品，但它们可能会被神奇地处理以产生非凡的效果。一艘船可以得到一个头像的升级。",
	"The following upgrades don't apply to a specific element of the ship. A ship can use any number of them, but it can gain a specific upgrade only once.": "以下的升级并不适用于飞船的特定元素。一艘船可以使用它们中的任何数量，但它只能获得一次特定的升级。",

Some of the most harrowing horror stories involve the least likely heroes, individuals who find their simple lives transformed into waking nightmares.": "恐怖并不只降临在勇敢和有准备的人身上--通常情况下恰恰相反。一些最令人痛心的恐怖故事涉及最不可能成为英雄的人，他们发现自己简单的生活变成了清醒的噩梦。",
	"In most horror adventures, your players will employ familiar, adventure-ready characters. That doesn't need to be the case, though. Instead, for short, low-power adventures, immersive retellings of tragic events, out-of-body experiences, or other unique tales, consider providing players with temporary, stand-in characters called survivors.": "在大多数恐怖冒险中，你的玩家将采用熟悉的、可供冒险的角色。不过，情况并不一定是这样。相反，对于短小精悍的冒险、身临其境地重述悲剧事件、灵魂出窍或其他独特的故事，可以考虑为玩家提供临时的、被称为幸存者的替身角色。",

Using survivors helps create horror experiences focused on the dread inherent to having limited resources and facing impending doom without forcing players to risk their favorite characters.": "本节提供了使用幸存者的指导，这些角色是为一到三节的冒险而设计的，重点是生存而不是拯救世界。使用幸存者有助于创造恐怖体验，重点是资源有限和面临迫在眉睫的厄运时固有的恐惧，而不强迫玩家让他们最喜欢的角色冒险。",
	"Survivors are premade characters that are simple and easy for players to master, while being customizable enough to fill broad roles in your adventures—whether they be farmers or bored nobles, constables or babysitters. Adventures employing survivors are meant to be asides within broader campaigns or otherwise short experiences.": "幸存者是预制的角色，对玩家来说简单而容易掌握，同时可以定制，足以在你的冒险中扮演广泛的角色--无论他们是农民还是无聊的贵族，警员还是保姆。采用幸存者的冒险是为了在更广泛的战役中作为旁观者，或者作为短暂的经历。",
	"Use survivors to provide information to players in the form of a self-contained adventure. Even if it doesn't make sense for a campaign's characters to be present for an event, survivors can provide players with perspectives they wouldn't otherwise have. For example, you might use survivors in the following ways:": "利用幸存者以自成一体的冒险形式向玩家提供信息。即使活动中的人物出现在某一事件中没有意义，幸存者也可以为玩家提供他们无法获得的观点。例如，你可以通过以下方式使用幸存者。",

	"The Mists frequently kidnap characters from across the multiverse, dragging them into the Domains of Dread. They don't always claim their victims bodily, though. Rather, the Mists might steal characters' minds, placing them into survivors involved in specific terrifying scenarios. Perhaps characters suddenly find themselves mentally recast into someone defending against a zombie siege in Falkovnia, attending a ball in Dementlieu, or exploring the tombs of Har'Akir (see {@book chapter 3|VRGR|3} for details on such adventures). Whether the characters survive or meet spectacular ends doesn't matter, as death might mean a return to the character's original body, a second chance to try again, or a stranger fate.": "迷雾经常从整个多元宇宙绑架人物，把他们拖入恐惧之域。不过，他们并不总是要求受害者的身体。相反，迷雾可能会窃取人物的思想，将他们置于参与特定恐怖场景的幸存者中。也许人物突然发现自己在精神上变成了在法尔科夫尼亚抵御僵尸围攻的人，参加Dementlieu的舞会，或者探索Har'Akir的墓穴（关于此类冒险的详情，请参见{@book chapter 3|VRGR|3}）。角色是否存活或遭遇壮观的结局并不重要，因为死亡可能意味着回到角色原来的身体，有再次尝试的机会，或者有更奇怪的命运。",
	"Make sure your players know how long you plan to use survivors and that they'll be playing their usual characters again soon.

	"Dwindling resources contribute to terrifying situations. When a group runs out of hit points, spells, food, or other vital reserves, tension and dread increase. High-level characters, though, have such resources in spades. By running an adventure using survivors, you can recapture some of the same tension adventurers experience early in their careers, encouraging players to use their wits and make desperate choices powerful characters can avoid.": "资源的减少会造成可怕的局面。当一个团体的命中率、法术、食物或其他重要储备耗尽时，紧张和恐惧就会增加。不过，高级别的角色拥有大量的这种资源。通过使用幸存者进行冒险，你可以重新获得一些冒险者在其职业生涯早期所经历的同样的紧张感，鼓励玩家使用他们的智慧，做出强大的角色可以避免的绝望选择。",

	"Determine how you want to use survivors in your adventure. If it's important to the story, perhaps all the players use the same stat block, representing their shared experience—a group of Sneaks might all be detectives while a band of Disciples might face a terror unleashed upon a monastery. You can also allow players to choose their own survivors, as any survivor might fill a general role like noble, villager, or sailor with a touch of talent. Make use of these ready-made characters in whatever ways suit your adventure best.": "确定你想在你的冒险中如何使用幸存者。如果这对故事很重要的话，也许所有的玩家都使用相同的状态块，代表他们的共同经历--一群潜行者可能都是侦探，而一队门徒可能面对的是在修道院里释放的恐怖。你也可以让玩家选择他们自己的幸存者，因为任何幸存者都可以填补一个一般的角色，如贵族、村民或有天赋的水手。以任何适合你的冒险的方式使用这些现成的角色。",

	"Survivors don't possess classes as detailed in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. Despite this, you can make a survivor marginally more powerful by increasing its level. The stat blocks present the survivors as they are at 1st level. Rather than gaining experience points, a survivor increases in level whenever it makes sense for your adventure. When a survivor gains a level, it gains the benefits on the Survivor Progression table. A survivor that advances from 1st to 2nd level and from 2nd to 3rd level gains access to the player's choice of Survivor Talents (see the section below).": "幸存者并不拥有{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中详细说明的等级。尽管如此，你可以通过提高幸存者的等级使其略微强大一些。状态块显示了幸存者在第一级时的情况。生存者不是获得经验值，而是在对你的冒险有意义的时候提高等级。当一个幸存者获得一个等级时，它就会获得幸存者进展表上的好处。一个从1级升到2级和从2级升到3级的幸存者可以获得玩家选择的幸存者天赋（见下面的章节）。",
