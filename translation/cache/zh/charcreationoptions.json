Both have threatened Ten-Towns in the past.": "我是哈珀人的间谍，这是一个秘密组织，在幕后挫败暴君和其他邪恶分子。我在冰风谷的任务是保护十镇的定居点，同时隐瞒我的哈珀人的关系。对十镇的可靠威胁包括奥术兄弟会，一个以卢斯坎为基地的巫师组织，以及Zhentarim，一个想要控制整个北方贸易的庞大的影子网络。两者在过去都曾威胁过十镇。",

	"A second being resides within your body along with you. It manifests physically somewhere on you and relies on you for its survival. At the same time, it offers you knowledge and other assistance, either of its own volition or because of your intertwined nature. The symbiote has its own personality and agenda, which might be at odds with yours. If you ignore the symbiote's desires, it might strive to interfere with you. There is no way to be rid of the symbiote while you have this Dark Gift. Even if you go to drastic lengths, such as severing the part of your body where the symbiote resides, it reappears on your body in another location at the next midnight.": "第二个生命与你一起居住在你的身体里。它在你身上的某个地方显现出来，并依靠你生存。同时，它为你提供知识和其他帮助，或是出于它自己的意愿，或是因为你们相互交织的性质。共生体有它自己的个性和议程，这可能与你不一致。如果你忽视了共生体的欲望，它可能会努力干扰你。在你拥有这种黑暗天赋时，没有办法摆脱共生体。即使你采取了激烈的手段，比如切断你身体中共生体所在的部分，它也会在下一个午夜重新出现在你身体的另一个地方。",

The symbiote can see and hear using your senses.": "你的共生体是一个独立的实体，它有自己的物理形态与你结合。它不是一个独立的生物，依靠你来生存。它有智力、智慧和魅力的分数。DM设定共生体的能力或随机确定它们（对每个分数进行滚动（%0%），忽略最低的滚动，将其余部分相加）。共生体可以用你的感官看和听。",

	"Your symbiote has a vested interest in your survival and takes steps to ensure it. When you fail a saving throw, you can choose to have your symbiote expend one of your Hit Dice to roll it and add the number rolled to the saving throw, potentially turning the failure into a success. If it uses this feature on a death saving throw, you succeed on the save and regain 1 hit point regardless of the number rolled on the {@dice d20}.": "你的共生体对你的生存有着既得利益，并采取措施来确保它。当你的救赎失败时，你可以选择让你的共生体消耗你的一个命中率骰子来掷出它，并将掷出的数字加入到救赎中，有可能将失败变成成功。如果它在死亡救赎中使用这个功能，你就会救赎成功，并恢复1点生命值，而不考虑掷出的数字（%0%）。",

	"Your symbiote has an agenda that drives it, and it expects you to assist it in achieving those goals. How permissive or patient it is in resolving its agenda depends on its personality (work with your DM to determine these details). If you have an opportunity to advance its agenda and don't act on it, the symbiote can try to force your hand. You must succeed on a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 + the symbiote's Charisma modifier) or be {@condition charmed} by the symbiote for {@dice 1d12} hours. While {@condition charmed}, you must try to follow the symbiote's commands. If you take damage that is not self-inflicted, you can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.": "你的共生体有一个驱动它的议程，它希望你能协助它实现这些目标。它在解决其议程方面有多放任或耐心，取决于它的个性（与你的管理员一起确定这些细节）。如果你有机会推进它的议程而不去做，共生体就会试图强迫你去做。你必须成功地进行魅力救赎（DC12+共生体的魅力修饰），或者被共生体控制{@condition charmed}个小时。在{@condition charmed}期间，你必须努力听从共生体的命令。如果你受到的伤害不是自己造成的，你可以重复蓄力动作，成功后结束效果。",

In any case, you and other travelers have shared experiences. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among sympathetic trading caravans, itinerant families, or displaced groups, so long as you don't present yourself as a danger.
